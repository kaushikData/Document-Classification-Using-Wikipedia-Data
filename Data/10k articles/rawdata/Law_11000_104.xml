      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">In [[Geotechnical engineering]] the term '''asperity''' is mostly used for unevenness (''roughness'') of the surface of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]], grain, or particle with heights in the range from approximately 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm to many decimetre. Smaller unevenness is normally considered to be a ''material'' property (often denoted by ''material friction'' or ''basic material friction'').&lt;ref name=Patton1966/&gt;

==Dilation==

An often used definition for ''asperities'' in geotechnical engineering:&lt;br /&gt;
Unevenness of a surface are ''asperities'' if these cause dilation if two blocks with in between a discontinuity with matching ''asperities'' on the two opposing surfaces (i.e. a ''fitting discontinuity'') move relative to each other, under low stress levels that do not cause breaking of the ''asperities''.

==Contrast with asperity in materials science==

[[Materials science]] recognizes [[asperity (materials science)|asperities]] ranging from the sub-visual (normally less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) to the atomic scale.

[[Marvin's Legal Bibliography|Legal Bibliography, or a thesaurus of American, English, Irish and Scotch law books:together with some continental treatises]]. T &amp; J W Johnson. 1847. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DSNEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 85], from Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 1768, with most recent English edition being published in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]''. 1999. Page xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is an abridgment of English Common Law which was widely used in the United States during the early through mid 19th Century. The work was compiled by Bacon, assembled mainly from the dissertations and treatises of Baron Gilbert, either quoting them in full or providing extracts thereof. Bacon died before completing the abridgment, and the collection was completed by Sergeant Sayer and [[Owen Ruffhead]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvin, J.G.

The modern creation of specialized '''Business Courts '''in the United States, sometimes referred to as '''Commercial Courts''', began in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell L.

Delaware's Court of Chancery, the nation's pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for a century.  However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes (10 Del. C. § 346), some purely monetary commercial disputes (10 Del. C. § 347), and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation (10 Del. C. § 347), arbitration (10 Del. C. § 349), Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters (10 Del. C. § 350), and agreements to make decisions non-appealable (10 Del. C. § 351).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant relationship between business courts and ADR is well recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin F.

==Business Court Jurisdiction, Technology Disputes &amp; Cyber Courts, and Complex Litigation Courts==
Business Courts are trial courts that hear business disputes primarily or exclusively.  In the United States, these courts have been established in approximately twenty states.  In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute.  In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the Supreme Court or trial court level.  In all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to "business" disputes, and generally fall into two categories:  (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity.  There are courts with mixed models as well.&lt;ref&gt;* Mitchell L. Bach &amp; Lee Applebaum, [http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf ''A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050912/http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}, 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, for example, the Commercial Division may hear cases (1) alleging breach of contract, (2) arising under the state's business corporation law, (3) arising under the state's partnership law, (4) relating to commercial loans, negotiable instruments, letters of credit, and bank transactions, or (5) involving business torts.  The Commercial Division may not, by comparison, hear cases involving (1) landlord/tenant disputes, (2) commercial foreclosures, (3) products liability claims, or (4) claims alleging discrimination except when part of or under the terms of a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Section 202.70, Rules of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York [http://www.nycourts.gov/rules/trialcourts/202.shtml#70 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states have established specialized courts that include technology disputes as part of their express jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob A. Sommer, Business Litigation and Cyberspace: Will Cyber Courts Prove and Effective Tool for Luring High-Tech Business Into Forum States, 56 Vanderbilt Law Review 561 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Through legislative effort and court rule, Maryland established a Business and Technology Case Management Program.  In May 2003, [[Delaware]] expanded the Court of Chancery’s jurisdiction to include technology disputes, and the mediation of other kinds of business disputes (10 Del. C. §§ 346, 347).&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c003/sc03/ Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures]&lt;/ref&gt;

California, Connecticut, Phoenix, Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell L. Bach &amp; Lee Applebaum, [http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf ''A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050912/http://v028u02dxf.maximumasp.com/uploads/publications/historybusinesscourts2.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}, 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20150915044044/http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/docs/programs/utcr/CJO_10-066.pdf Oregon], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20130830202840/http://www.mncourts.gov/Documents/0/Public/Clerks_Office/Rule%20Amendments/2013-02-04%20Order%20Civ%20Proc%20%26%20Gen%20Rls%20Amendments.pdf Minnesota] have created specialized courts or tracks for complex litigation that would include some business disputes within a broader jurisdiction of complex matters.  Other states are in various stages of moving toward or away from business or complex courts, with Colorado having conducted extensive studies over a decade ago into the merits and potential parameters of creating a business court on a broad basis, which was not pursued; and New Jersey considering state wide business court legislation over a period of years.

The '''Canada Green Building Council''' (CaGBC) was created in 2003 to further the expansion of [[green building]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingontario.ca/cagbc-toronto/about-us|title=Ontario Centre for Green Building Design and Development : About Us|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the formation of the Council, Canada had participated in the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC) through [[British Columbia|British Columbia's]] membership in the USGBC's Cascadia Chapter.&lt;ref&gt; The Cascadia Region Green Building Council is one of the original chapters of the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and covers [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Alaska]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.cascadiagbc.org/about-us|title=About Cascadia Region Green Building Council|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CaGBC was founded by Kevin Hydes of Integral Group, Joe Van Belleghem, Jon Hobbs, formerly of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and Peter Busby of Perkins+Will Canada. It is a member of the [[World Green Building Council]]. 

The CaGBC is dedicated to promoting the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED rating system]]. Their mission is to lead and accelerate the transformation to high-performing, healthy green buildings, homes and communities throughout Canada. 

The CaGBH award numerous awards of recognition to individuals and organizations who have made outstanding contributions to Canada's green building industry. These awards specifically include eight CaGBC Leadership Awards, the Andy Kesteloo Memorial Student Project Award, the Product of the Year Award, and the Canadian Green Building Awards. These awards celebrate innovative [[sustainable]] building practices and techniques being made in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cagbc.org/CAGBC/About_Us/CaGBCAwards/CAGBC/AboutUs/CaGBCAwards/CaGBC_Leadership_Awa.aspx?hkey=e036348d-ba84-4388-86bf-71854dc44234|title=CaGBC Awards|website=www.cagbc.org|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==LEED Canada-NC v1.0==
The Canadian version of LEED is very similar to the USGBC NC version.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cagbc.org/uploads/FINAL_LEED%20CANADA-NC%201.0_Green%20Building%20Rating%20System.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains the following categories:
* Sustainable sites (SS)
* [[Water efficiency]] (WE)
* Energy and [[atmosphere]] (EA)
* Materials &amp; resources (MR)
* Indoor [[environmental quality]] (EQ)
* [[Design management|Innovation in design]] (ID)
* Regional priorities (RP)

LEED Certification in Canada is done solely through the CaGBC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4260">'''''Canterbury v. Spence''''' (464 F.2d. 772, 782 D.C. Cir. 1972) was a landmark federal case decided by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] that significantly reshaped [[malpractice]] law in the United States.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Roberts, Sam  "Jerry Canterbury, Whose Paralysis Led to Informed Consent Laws, Is Dead at 78," New York Times, May 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Meisel, Alan.   “Canterbury v. Spence: The Inadvertent Landmark Case.” Health Law &amp; Bioethics: Cases in Context.”&lt;/ref&gt;  It established the idea of "[[informed consent]]" to medical procedures.
  
== Background ==

Until the 1960s, it was conventional medical doctrine to withhold significant information from patients, particularly potentially upsetting information.&lt;ref name = "WaPo"&gt;Langer, Emily, "Court ruling in his case established doctrine of informed medical consent", ''The Washington Post'', May 21, 2017, p. C8.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common practice not to tell a patient they were dying, and even to deny it.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Editorial, "[http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/8/3/115.full.pdf On telling dying patients the truth]", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 1982 (8): 115-116, treating the argument that the duty to "[[Primum non nocere|do no harm]]" can include not adding to the woes of a terminally ill patient, among other justifications.&lt;/ref&gt;  When health care providers began to move away from that practice, many still did not fully inform patients who were about to make decisions about future health care and particularly surgery.  Instead, many practitioners revealed only information that another physician might provide, following a rule known as "the professional standard".  Risks, in particular, were often glossed over or omitted entirely.  Although the right to consent in medical situations had been recognized for decades, the notion of ''informed'' consent was new.&lt;ref name = WaPo /&gt;

== The Case ==
 
Jerry Watson Canterbury (1939-2017) was an F.B.I. clerk who suffered a ruptured disk in 1958.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  He was operated on by Dr. William T. Spence, a well-known Washington neurosurgeon, and as a result of the surgery, and a subsequent fall from his bed while hospitalized, he ended up paralyzed below the waist and incontinent.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Canterbury sued for malpractice on the grounds of negligence.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Walter J Jr., Canterbury v. Spence—the case and a few comments The Forum (Section of Insurance, Negligence and Compensation Law, American Bar Association) Vol. 11, No. 3 (Spring 1976), pp. 716-726&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
He was discharged from the hospital three and a half months later, his legs partly paralyzed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  During the 1968 trial, the defense argued that since Canterbury lacked expert testimony, the case could not proceed.  This lack of testimony was likely the result of a "conspiracy of silence" that, at the time, prevented doctors from testifying against one another.  Judge [[Spottswood W. Robinson]] III of the DC Circuit Court allowed the case to go to a jury, deciding both that an expert was not necessary in such cases and that the standard for [[informed consent]] was what a reasonable patient would want to know in rendering a decision.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  At the second trial, Dr. Spence acknowledged that he had told Canterbury and his mother only that the surgery might result in “weakness" without mentioning paralysis, and that he avoided a more specific warning so as not to deter the patient from pursuing the operation.  Nevertheless, the jury ruled against Canterbury.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Impact ==
According to Dr. [[Jacob M. Appel]], "[t]he major legal implication of the decision...was that it largely shifted our culture from a ‘professional practice standard’ to a ‘reasonable person standard’ in malpractice cases, undermined the tradition and practice of physicians not testifying against each other, and largely opened the floodgates to the far more litigious medicolegal culture we have today."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Carnism''' is a concept used in discussions of humanity's relation to other animals, defined as a prevailing [[ideology]] in which people support the use and consumption of [[animal product]]s, especially [[meat]].{{refn|group=n|Gibert, Martin; Desaulniers, Élise (2014):"Carnism refers to the ideology conditioning people to consume certain animal products. It is essentially the opposite of veganism."&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;}} Carnism is presented as a dominant belief system supported by a variety of [[defense mechanisms]] and mostly unchallenged assumptions.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeMello2012p138&gt;{{cite book | title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies | publisher=New York: Columbia University Press | author=DeMello, Margo | year=2012 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=92Ct9iD1QTYC&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhont, Kristof; Hodson, Gordon (2014).

''Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism''. Conari Press, p.&amp;nbsp;9. {{ISBN|1573245054}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Marla (8 November 2010).

[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/carnism/ "Carnism"], Schott's Vocab, ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ideology, according to the theory, is the acceptance of meat-eating as "natural", "normal", "necessary", and (sometimes) "nice".{{refn|group=n|Joy introduced the "Three Ns of Justification", namely that meat-eating is regarded as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name=Joy2011p96&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 paper developed this into the "Four Ns": "natural, normal, necessary, and nice".&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015"&gt;Singal, Jesse (4 June 2015). [http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/4-ways-people-rationalize-eating-meat.html "The 4 Ways People Rationalize Eating Meat"], ''New York Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} An important feature of carnism is the classification of only particular species of animal as food, and the acceptance of practices toward those animals that would be rejected as unacceptable [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] if applied to other species. This classification is culturally relative, so that, for example, dogs are eaten by some people in Korea but may be pets in the West, while cows are eaten in the West but [[Cattle in religion|protected]] in much of India.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Ethics of eating meat|History of vegetarianism}}

Analyzing the history of vegetarianism and opposition to it from ancient Greece to the present day, literary scholar Renan Larue found certain commonalities in what he described as carnist arguments. According to him, carnists typically held that vegetarianism is a ludicrous idea unworthy of attention, that mankind is invested with dominion over animals by divine authority, and that abstaining from violence against animals would pose a threat to humans. He found that the views that farmed animals do not suffer, and that slaughter is preferable to death by disease or predation, gained currency in the nineteenth century, but that the former had precedent in the writings of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], a vegetarian who advocated the humane production of animal products which do not require animals to be slaughtered, such as wool.&lt;ref name="Desaulniers30Jan2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://penseravantdouvrirlabouche.com/2015/01/30/le-vegetarisme-et-ses-ennemis-entrevue-avec-renan-larue/ | title=Le végétarisme et ses ennemis: entrevue avec Renan Larue | date=30 January 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=[[Élise Desaulniers|Desaulniers, Élise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s traditional views on the moral standing of animals were challenged by [[animal rights]] advocates, including psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]], who in 1971 introduced the notion of [[speciesism]]. This is defined as the assignment of value and rights to individuals solely on the basis of their [[species]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] (1971).

"Eating Meat and Eating People", in [[Cass Sunstein]], [[Martha Nussbaum]] (eds.), ''Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions'', Oxford University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 psychologist and animal rights advocate Melanie Joy coined the term ''carnism'' for a form of speciesism that she argues underpins using animals for food, and particularly killing them for meat.&lt;ref name=Joy2001&gt;[[Melanie Joy|Joy, Melanie]] (2001).

''Psychic Numbing and Meat Consumption: The Psychology of Carnism'', doctoral dissertion, Saybrook Graduate School, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy compares carnism to [[patriarchy]], arguing that both are dominant normative ideologies that go unrecognized because of their ubiquity:&lt;ref name="Gibert2014"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-0929-4_83 | title=Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics | chapter = Carnism | chapterurl=https://martingibert.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gibert-desaulniers-2013-carnism.pdf| publisher=Springer Netherlands | author=Gibert, Martin; [[Élise Desaulniers|Desaulniers, Élise]]| year=2014 | pages=292–298 | isbn=978-94-007-0929-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref name="Braunsberger2015"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10873-5_201 | title=The Sustainable Global Marketplace | publisher=Springer International Publishing |author1=Braunsberger, Karin |author2=Flamm, Richard O. | year=2015 | pages=345 | isbn=978-3-319-10873-5 | chapter=Consumer Identities: Carnism Versus Veganism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster1994"&gt;{{cite conference | first = A.

{{quote|We don't see meat eating as we do vegetarianism&amp;nbsp;– as a choice, based on a set of assumptions about animals, our world, and ourselves. Rather, we see it as a given, the "natural" thing to do, the way things have always been and the way things will always be. We eat animals without thinking about what we are doing and why, because the belief system that underlies this behavior is invisible. This invisible belief system is what I call ''carnism''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011p9" /&gt;}}

Sandra Mahlke argues that carnism is the "central crux of speciesism" because the eating of meat motivates ideological justification for other forms of animal exploitation.&lt;ref name="Mahle2014"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6hPAwAAQBAJ | title=Das Machtverhältnis zwischen Mensch und Tier im Kontext sprachlicher Distanzierungsmechanismen: Anthropozentrismus, Speziesismus und Karnismus in der kritischen Diskursanalyse | publisher=Diplomica Verlag | author=Mahlke, Sandra | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-8428-9140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central aspect of carnism is that animals are categorized as edible, inedible, pets, [[vermin]], predators, or entertainment animals, according to people's [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] – mental classifications that determine, and are determined by, our beliefs and desires.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joy2011pp14,17" /&gt; There is cultural variability regarding which animals count as food. Dogs are eaten in China, and South Korea, but elsewhere are not viewed as food, either because they are loved or, as in the Middle East and parts of India, regarded as unclean.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Podberscek2009" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Hal (2011).

===Meat paradox===
{{main|Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox}}
Jeff Mannes writes that carnism is rooted in a paradox between most people's values and actions: they oppose harming animals, and yet eat them. He argues that this conflict leads to [[cognitive dissonance]], which people attempt to attenuate through [[psychic numbing]].&lt;ref name="Mannes2015"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-2232-4/lexikon-der-mensch-tier-beziehungen | title=Lexikon der Mensch-Tier-Beziehungen | chapter = Karnismus | publisher=Transcript Verlag | author=Mannes, Jeff| year=2015 | pages=191–193 | isbn=978-3-8376-2232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent conflict between caring about animals and embracing diets which require them to be harmed has been termed the "[[Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox|meat paradox]]".&lt;ref name=Loughnan2014&gt;Loughnan, Steve; Bastian, Brock; Haslam, Nick (2014).

There is experimental evidence supporting the idea that the meat paradox induces cognitive dissonance in Westerners.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothgerber2014"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Efforts to overcome vegetarian-induced dissonance among meat eaters | author=Rothgerber, Hank | journal=Appetite |date=August 2014  | volume=79 | pages=32–41 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2014.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Gordon (3 March 2014). [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/without-prejudice/201403/the-meat-paradox-loving-exploiting-animals "The Meat Paradox: Loving but Exploiting Animals"], ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; Westerners are more willing to eat animals which they regard as having lesser mental capacities and moral standing, and conversely, to attribute lesser mental faculties and moral standing to animals which are eaten.&lt;ref name="Loughnan2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bastian2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www2.psy.uq.edu.au/~uqbbast1/Bastian%20et%20al%20PSPB%20in%20press.pdf|doi=10.1177/0146167211424291 | title=Don’t mind meat?

{{anchor|4 Ns}}&lt;!-- Linked to by [[Psychology of eating meat]]. This should appear directly before the section currently titled "Justification" which discusses the 4 N's"--&gt;

===Justification===
Joy introduced the idea of the "Three Ns of Justification", writing that meat-eaters regard [[meat consumption]] as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name="Joy2011p96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt; She argues that the "Three Ns" have been invoked to justify other ideologies, including slavery and denying women the right to vote, and are widely recognized as problematic only after the ideology they support has been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument holds that people are conditioned to believe that humans evolved to eat meat, that it is expected of them, and that they need it to survive or be strong. These beliefs are said to be reinforced by various institutions, including religion, family and the media. Although scientists have shown that humans get more than enough protein in their diets without eating meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/ | title = Do vegetarians get enough protein? | first1 = Michael | last1 = Greger | date = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that meat is required persists.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt;

Building on Joy's work, psychologists conducted a series of studies in the United States and Australia, published in 2015, that found the great majority of meat-eaters' stated justifications for consuming meat were based on the "Four Ns"&amp;nbsp;– "natural, normal, necessary, and nice". The arguments were that humans are [[omnivore]]s (''natural''), that most people eat meat (''normal''), that vegetarian diets are lacking in nutrients (''necessary''), and that meat tastes good (''nice'').&lt;ref name="Piazza2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rationalizing meat consumption. The 4Ns | author=Piazza, Jared| journal=Appetite |date=August 2015  | volume=91 | pages=114–128 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.011|display-authors=etal | pmid=25865663}}{{paragraph break}}
[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/articles/2015/how-people-defend-eating-meat/ "How people defend eating meat"], Lancaster University, 15 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/meat-eaters-justify-diet-using-four-ns-natural-necessary-normal-nice-20150531-ghd5le.html | title=Meat eaters justify diet using 'Four Ns': natural, necessary, normal, nice | date=1 June 2015 | author=Goodyer, Paula |work = Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat-eaters who endorsed these arguments more strongly reported less guilt about their dietary habits. They tended to objectify animals, have less moral concern for them and attribute less consciousness to them. They were also more supportive of [[social inequality]] and hierarchical ideologies, and less proud of their consumer choices.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;

==="Saved from slaughter" narratives===
[[File:Obama ThanksGiving Turkey Pardon 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]], in which the American president pardons a turkey, has been cited as an illustration of carnism.&lt;ref name="Freeman2012p103" /&gt;]]

An illustration of dissonance reduction is the prominence given to "saved from slaughter" stories, in which the media focus on one animal that evaded slaughter, while ignoring the millions that did not.&lt;ref name="Mizelle2015p264" /&gt; Joy wrote that this dichotomy is characteristic of carnism.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, pp. 135,150&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals at the center of these narratives include Wilbur in ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' (1952); the eponymous and fictional star of ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995); Christopher Hogwood in [[Sy Montgomery]]'s ''The Good, Good Pig'' (2006);&lt;ref name=Mizelle2015p264&gt;Mizelle, Brett (2015).

''Pig'', Reaktion Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tamworth Two]]; and [[Cincinnati Freedom]]. The American [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]] is cited as another example. A 2012 study found that most media reporting on it celebrated the [[Poultry farming|poultry industry]] while marginalizing the link between living animals and meat.&lt;ref name=Freeman2012p103&gt;Packwood-Freeman, Carrie; Perez, Oana Leventi (2012).

Bruner (eds.), ''The Rhetoric of Food: Discourse, Materiality, and Power'', Routledge, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IR9woMrfFs4C&amp;pg=PA103 103ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-academic reception==
Opinion pieces in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'', and ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'' praised the idea, saying the term made it easier to discuss, and challenge, the practices of animal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Stephan|title=Friend or Food?

An article in the beef industry publication Drovers Cattle Network criticized the use of the term, saying it implied that eating animal foods was a "psychological sickness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Dan|title=Commentary: The carnist conundrum|url=http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/Commentary-The-carnist-conundrum-128069853.html|publisher=Drovers Cattle Network|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=19 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Drugs Standard Control Organization''' (CDSCO) is the national regulatory body for [[India]]n pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and serves parallel function to the [[European Medicines Agency]] of the [[European Union]], the [[Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency|PMDA]] of [[Japan]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the [[United States]] and the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

Within the CDSCO, the [[Drug Controller General of India]] (DCGI) regulates pharmaceutical and medical devices, under the gamut of [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]. The DCGI is advised by the Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) and the Drug Consultative Committee (DCC). It is divided into zonal offices which do pre-licensing and post-licensing inspections, post-market surveillance, and recalls when needed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pacificbridgemedical.com/indias-central-drugs-standard-control-organization-cdsco--/|title = India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)|accessdate = Dec 29, 2012|date = Dec 29, 2012|publisher = Pacific Bridge Medical|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121217040510/http://www.pacificbridgemedical.com/indias-central-drugs-standard-control-organization-cdsco--/|archivedate = 2012-12-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/Drugs_ContAd.html |title=Central Drugs Standard Control Homepage |accessdate=Dec 29, 2012 |date=Dec 29, 2012 |publisher=Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128203814/http://cdsco.nic.in/html/Drugs_ContAd.html |archivedate=January 28, 2013 }}

'''Charles Alan Wright''' (September 3, 1927 &amp;ndash; July 7, 2000) was an American constitutional lawyer widely considered to be the foremost authority in the [[United States]] on [[constitutional law]] and federal [[Procedural law|procedure]], and was the coauthor of the 54-volume treatise, ''Federal Practice and Procedure'' with [[Arthur R. Miller|Arthur Miller]] and Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., among others.

Born in [[Philadelphia]] in 1927, Wright earned his undergraduate degree from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1947 and law degree from [[Yale]] in 1949. Wright taught at the [[University of Minnesota Law School]] from 1950 to 1955 and at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] from 1955 until his death in 2000.

Professor Wright was a popular, if somewhat eccentric, educator, conducting class without lecture notes or even a copy of the casebook.  He had a photographic memory of the materials and would often answer student questions with a correct citation, by specific page, of a case different from the one the class was studying.  He always refused to call on women students, unless they volunteered, considering the traditional Socratic approach ungentlemanly to women.  In response to accusations of sexism, he simply stopped requiring any student to recite unless he or she volunteered.  Professor Wright's icy reserve with students disappeared completely  after they graduated and joined the Bar.  Many of them were pleasantly surprised to experience his warmth, kindness, gentle humor and interest in their families.

He was elected a member of the [[American Law Institute]] at the age of 30, and served as its president for the last seven years of his life, from 1993 to 2000.

Professor Wright organized an effective boycott of the Faculty Club at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] when operators failed to live up to their promise that the club would not be racially [[Racial segregation|segregated]].

Wright was a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and an Honorary Fellow of [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College, University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolfson College eBulletin, Easter 2009|url=http://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/alumni/publications/e-bulletin/easter-2009|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright represented [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on constitutional issues growing out of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate investigations]] by Congress and the special prosecutor. For a time he clearly appeared to be the President's lead lawyer, but then there was a shuffling of responsibilities, and he did not argue the case in the Supreme Court.

Wright was an active litigator before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].  [[Associate Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] once described Wright as "a Colossus standing at the summit of our profession." A former student teasingly suggested the diminutive Ginsburg was actually referring to Wright's 6-3 height.  The politically [[Liberalism|liberal]] Ginsburg also referred to Wright, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], as "the quintessential friend."  By the end of his life, Wright was on a first-name basis with all nine justices.

Wright was also involved in both intramural and intercollegiate athletics.  Wright served on the NCAA Committee on Infractions from 1973 until 1983, including five years as chair.  At the [[University of Texas]], Wright's achievements extended beyond the classroom and courtroom: Wright led the Legal Eagles – a stunningly successful intramural football team – to 330 wins during his 45-year involvement as coach and athletic director. He was also a member of the committee that was formed to hire a new head football coach of the University of Texas in 1997, eventually hiring [[Mack Brown]].

[[File:Je jure de maintenir la constitution.jpg|thumb|A commemorative plate from 1790 shows a curate swearing the Constitution.]]
The '''Civil Constitution of the Clergy''' ({{lang-fr|'''"Constitution civile du clergé"'''}}) was a law passed on 12 July 1790 during the [[French Revolution]], that caused the immediate subordination of the [[Catholic Church]] in France to the French government.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/780111354|title=A short history of the French Revolution|last=D.|first=Popkin, Jeremy|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0205693571|oclc=780111354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier legislation had already arranged the confiscation of the Catholic Church's French land holdings and banned [[monastic vows]]. This new law completed the destruction of the monastic orders, outlawing "all regular and secular chapters for either sex, abbacies and priorships, both regular and ''[[in commendam]]'', for either sex", etc. It also sought to settle the chaos caused by the earlier confiscation of Church lands and the abolition of the tithe.&lt;ref name="text2"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/civilcon.html Text of the Legislation] From J.H. Robinson, ed., ''The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, 12 July 1790, Readings in European History'', 2 vols. Boston: Ginn, 1906. Vol 2: pp. 423–427.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy regulated the current dioceses so that they could become more uniform and aligned with the administrative districts that had recently been created.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908192433|title=Rousseau, Burke, and revolution in France, 1791|last=1950-|first=Carnes, Mark C. (Mark Christopher),|last2=1952-|first2=Kates, Gary,|isbn=9780393938883|oclc=908192433}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasised that officials of the church could not provide commitment to anything outside France, specifically the Pope (due to his power and the influence he had) which was outside France.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy made Bishops and Priests elected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By having members of the Clergy elected the church lost much of the authority it had to govern itself and was now subject to the people, since they would vote on the Priest and Bishops as opposed to these individuals being appointed by the church and the hierarchy within.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed and some of the support for this came from figures that were within the Church, such as the priest and parliamentarian [[Pierre Claude François Daunou]], and, above all, the revolutionary priest [[Henri Grégoire]], who was the first French Catholic priest to take the Obligatory Oath. The measure was opposed, but ultimately acquiesced to, by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]].

==Status of the Church in France before the Civil Constitution==
Even before the Revolution and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the Catholic Church in France (the [[Gallican Church]]) had a status that tended to subordinate the Church to the State. Under the [[Declaration of the Clergy of France]] (1682) privileges of the French monarch included the right to assemble church councils in their dominions and to make laws and regulations touching ecclesiastical matters of the Gallican Church or to have recourse to the "appeal as from an abuse" (''"appel comme d'abus"'') against acts of the ecclesiastical power.

[[File:Decret de l'Assemblée National qui supprime les Ordres Religieux et Religieuses.jpg|thumb|In this caricature, after the decree of 16 February 1790, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom.]]
Even prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13009a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: French Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 August 1789 [[tithe]]s were abolished.
* On 2 November 1789, Catholic Church property that was held for purposes of church revenue was nationalized, and was used as the backing for the ''[[assignat]]s''.
* On 13 February 1790, monastic vows were forbidden and all ecclesiastical orders and congregations were dissolved, excepting those devoted to teaching children and nursing the sick.
* On 19 April 1790, administration of all remaining church property was transferred to the State.

==Motivation of the Civil Constitution==
The following interlinked factors appear to have been the causes of agitation for the confiscation of church lands and for the adoption of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/465524553|title=Living the French Revolution, 1789-1799|last=1948-|first=McPhee, Peter,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0333997395|oclc=465524553}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The French government in 1790 was nearly bankrupt; this fiscal crisis had been the original reason for the king's calling the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in 1789.
# The Church owned about six percent of the land in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889250730|title=Priest &amp; parish in eighteenth-century France: a social and political study of the curés in a diocese of Dauphiné, 1750-1791|last=1945-|first=Tackett, Timothy,|isbn=1400857147|oclc=889250730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the Church collected tithes.
#* The Church used the six percent of the land they owned for a multitude of purposes which included churches, monasteries, convents, schools, hospitals, and other establishments which served the people of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/gemma-betros/french-revolution-and-catholic-church|title=The French Revolution and the Catholic Church {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Owing, in part, to abuses of this system (especially for patronage), there was enormous resentment of the Church, taking the various forms of [[atheism]], [[anticlericalism]], and [[anti-Catholicism]].
# Many of the revolutionaries viewed the Catholic Church as a retrograde force.
# At the same time, there was enough support for a basically Catholic form of Christianity that some means had to be found to fund the Church in France.

==Debate over the Civil Constitution==
On 6 February 1790, one week before banning monastic vows, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] asked its ecclesiastical committee to prepare the reorganization of the clergy. No doubt, those who hoped to reach a solution amenable to the papacy were discouraged by the [[wikt:consistorial|consistorial]] address of March 22 in which Pius VI spoke out against measures already passed by the Assembly; also, the election of the Protestant [[Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne]] to the presidency of the Assembly brought about "commotions" at [[Toulouse]] and [[Nîmes]], suggesting that at least some Catholics would accept nothing less than a return to the ''[[ancien régime]]'' practice under which only Catholics could hold office.&lt;ref name="cat2"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13009a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy came before the Assembly on 29 May 1790. [[François de Bonal]], [[Bishop of Clermont]], and some members of the Right requested that the project should be submitted to a national council or to the Pope, but did not carry the day. Joining them in their opposition to the legislation was [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]], one of the chief political theorists of the French Revolution and author of the 1789 pamphlet "[[What is the Third Estate?]]"&lt;ref name="cat2" /&gt;

Conversely, the Jansenist theologian [[Armand-Gaston Camus]] argued that the plan was in perfect harmony with the [[New Testament]] and the councils of the fourth century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. On that anniversary, the [[Fête de la Fédération]], [[Talleyrand]] and three hundred priests officiated at the "altar of the nation" erected on the [[Champ de Mars]], wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God's blessing upon the Revolution.

In 1793, the [[War in the Vendee]] was influenced by the Constitution passing due to the devout population toward the Church among other social factors.

==Legal status of the Church in France under the Civil Constitution==

As noted above, even prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, church property was nationalized and monastic vows were forbidden. Under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:
* There were 83 bishops, one per Department, rather than the previous 135 bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan et al. (2001), p.  643.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bishops (known as [[constitutional bishop]]s) and priests were elected locally; electors had to sign a loyalty oath to the constitution. There was no requirement that the electors be Catholics, creating the ironic situation that Protestants and even Jews could help elect the Catholic priests and bishops. Their proportion in the French population was however very small.
* Authority of the Pope over the appointment of clergy was reduced to the right to be informed of election results.

The tone of the Civil Constitution can be gleaned from Title II, Article XXI:

:Before the ceremony of consecration begins, the bishop elect shall take a solemn oath, in the presence of the municipal officers, of the people, and of the clergy, to guard with care the faithful of his diocese who are confided to him, to be loyal to the nation, the law, and the king, and to support with all his power the constitution decreed by the National Assembly and accepted by the king.&lt;ref name="text2"/&gt;

In short, new bishops were required to swear loyalty to the State in far stronger terms than to any religious doctrine. Note also that, even in this revolutionary legislation, there are strong remnants of Gallican royalism.

The law also included some reforms supported even by many within the Church. For example, Title IV, Article I states, "The law requiring the residence of ecclesiastics in the districts under their charge shall be strictly observed. All vested with an ecclesiastical office or function shall be subject to this, without distinction or exception."&lt;ref name="text2"/&gt; In effect, this banned the practice by which younger sons of noble families would be appointed to a bishopric or other high church position and live off its revenues without ever moving to the region in question and taking up the duties of the office. The abuse of bishoprics by the nobility was further reduced in Title II, Article XI: "Bishoprics and cures shall be looked upon as vacant until those elected to fill them shall have taken
the oath above mentioned."&lt;ref name="text2"/&gt; This unified state control over both the nobility and the Church through the use of elected bishops and the oath of loyalty.

==Delay in implementation==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
For some time, Louis XVI delayed signing the Civil Constitution, saying that he needed "official word from Rome" before doing so. Pope Pius VI broke the logjam on 9 July 1790, writing a letter to Louis rejecting the arrangement. On 28 July, 6 September, and 16 December 1790, Louis XVI wrote letters to Pius VI, complaining that the National Assembly was forcing him to publicly accept the Civil Constitution, and suggesting that Pius VI appease them by accepting a few selected articles too. On 10 July, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI, indicating to the king that the Church could not accept any of the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution attempted to change the internal government of the Church, and no political regime had the right to unilaterally change the internal structure of the Church. On 17 August, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI of his intent to consult with the cardinals about this, but on 10 October Cardinal Rochefoucauld, the Archbishop of Aix, and 30 of France's 131 bishops sent their negative evaluation of the main points of the Civil Constitution to the Pope. Only four bishops actively dissented. On 30 October, the same 30 bishops restated their view to the public, signing a document known as the [[Exposition of Principles]] ("Exposition des principes sur la constitution civile du clergé"), written by [[Jean de Dieu-Raymond de Cucé de Boisgelin]]

On 27 November 1790, still lacking the king's signature on the law of the Civil Constitution, the National Assembly voted to require the clergy to sign an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. During the debate on that matter, on 25 November, [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne|Cardinal de Lomenie]] wrote a letter claiming that the clergy could be excused from taking the Oath if they lacked mental assent; that stance was to be rejected by the Pope on 23 February 1791. On 26 December 1790, Louis XVI finally granted his public assent to the Civil Constitution, allowing the process of administering the oaths to proceed in January and February 1791.

Pope Pius VI's 23 February rejection of Cardinal de Lomenie's position of withholding "mental assent" guaranteed that this would become a [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. The Pope's subsequent condemnation of the revolutionary regime and repudiation of all clergy who had complied with the oath completed the schism.

== Obligatory oath ==
[[File:FrenchChurchOathConcordat.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FrenchChurchOathConcordat.jpg|alt=Members taking oath|thumb|250x250px|Members of the Catholic Church taking the oath that was required by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.]]
Within the Civil Constitution of the Clergy there was a clause that required the Clergy to take an oath stating the individual's allegiance to France.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=269|title=CLERGY'S OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oath was basically an oath of fidelity and it required every single priest in France to make a public choice on whether or not they believed the nation of France had authority over all religious matters.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; This oath was very controversial because many Clergy believed that they could not put their loyalty towards France before their loyalty towards God. If a clergyman were to refuse to take this oath of allegiance then they were challenging the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and challenging the validity of the assembly which had established the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; On 16 January 1791 approximately 50% of the individuals required to take the oath went ahead and took it and the other half decided to wait for [[Pope Pius VI]] to provide instruction, since he was indecisive on what the Oath signified and how the Clergy should respond to it.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It is important to note that all but seven of the bishops in France decided to not take the oath and as a reprimand those governing France began to replace the individuals with those who had taken the oath.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucumberlands.edu/downloads/academics/history/vol6/LeeWhite94.html|title=The Subjugation of the Catholic Church: A Failed Attempt|website=www.ucumberlands.edu|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1791 Pope Pius VI finally decided that the oath was against the beliefs of the Church.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; By deciding that it was against the beliefs two groups were formed "jurors" ("refractory priests") and "non-jurors" and that was based on whether or not they had decided to take the oath. The Pope condemned those who took the oath and went as far as saying that they were absolutely separated from the church.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908192433|title=Rousseau, Burke, and revolution in France, 1791|last=1950-|first=Carnes, Mark C. (Mark Christopher),|last2=1952-|first2=Kates, Gary,|isbn=9780393938883|oclc=908192433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Pope expressed disapproval and chastised [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] for signing the document that required the oath to be taken.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Since the Pope expressed disapproval those who did not take it stayed unwilling to take it and as a result were replaced by those who had taken it. In addition to not receiving support from approximately 50% of the Clergy the oath was also disliked by a part of France's population. The individuals in France who were opposed to it claimed that the Revolution was destroying their "true" faith and this was also seen in the two groups of individuals that were formed because of the oath.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Those who believed that the Revolution was causing their "true" faith to be destroyed sided with the "non-jurors" and those who believed that the French government should have a say in religion sided with the "jurors."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

American Scholar Timothy Tackett believes that the oath that was required determined which individuals would let the revolution cause change and allow revolutionary reform and those who did not would remain true to their beliefs for many years to come.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Apart from Tackett's beliefs, it can be said that the obligatory oath marked a key historical point in the French Revolution since it was the first piece of legislation in the revolution that received massive drawback and resistance.&lt;u&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

==Jurors and non-jurors==
[[File:Carte des prêtres assermentés en France en 1791.svg|thumb|The rate of swearing priests in 1791. The department division is the current one.]]
As noted above, the government required all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Only seven bishops and about half of the clergy agreed while the rest refused; the latter became known as "non-jurors" or "refractory priests."&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; In areas where a majority had taken the oath, such as Paris, the refractory minority could be victimized by society at large: nuns from the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]], for example, were subjected to humiliating public spankings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Jones (historian)|Colin Jones]], ''The Great Nation'', 2002 (Penguin 2003 p. 444, {{ISBN|9780140130935}})&lt;/ref&gt;

While there was a higher rate of rejection in urban areas{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, most of these refractory priests (like most of the population) lived in the countryside, and the Civil Constitution generated considerable resentment among religious peasants. Meanwhile, the Pope repudiated the "jurors" who had signed the oath, especially bishops who had ordained new, elected clergy, and above all Bishop [[Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe]]. In May 1791, France recalled its ambassador to the Vatican and the Papal Nuncio was recalled from Paris. On June 9, the Assembly forbade the publication of Papal Bulls or Decrees, unless they had been approved by the Assembly as well.

The Constituent Assembly went back and forth on the exact status of non-juring priests. On 5 February 1791, non-juring priests were banned from preaching in public.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908192433|title=Rousseau, Burke, and revolution in France, 1791|last=1950-|first=Carnes, Mark C. (Mark Christopher),|last2=1952-|first2=Kates, Gary,|isbn=9780393938883|oclc=908192433}}&lt;/ref&gt; By not allowing the clergy to preach the National Assembly was trying to silence the Clergy.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This punishment that was imposed by the assembly signified that all refractory priest could no longer practice marriages and baptisms which were public ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; By not allowing refractory clergy to practice these large public ceremonies they were silenced. However, non-juring clergy continued to celebrate the Mass and attract crowds because the Assembly feared that stripping them of all of their powers would create chaos and that would be ineffective towards silencing them.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Although the Assembly allowed them to continue working in ceremonies that were not public they stated that they could only do so until they had been replaced by a clergyman who had taken the oath (juring).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; A large percentage of the refractionary priests were not replaced until 10 August 1792, which was more than a year after the original 50% had taken the oath; by the time they began to be replaced the Assembly had made some changes and it was not as significant that they were practicing Mass.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

At the beginning, when the Assembly was stripping the clergy of their titles they tried to ignore how the extreme anti-clerical elements were responding with violence against those who attended these Masses and against nuns who would not renounce their vocation.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Ultimately the Assembly had to recognize the schism that was occurring because it was extremely evident, even while the replacement was occurring juror priests often faced a hostile and violent reception in their old parishes.&lt;ref&gt;de Patris, B. Combes. ''Proces-verbaux des seances de la Societe Populaire de Rodez''. Rodez, Carrere, 1912. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 1791, the Assembly reversed itself, deciding that the non-juring priests, referred to as ''prêtres habitués'' ("habitual priests") could say Mass and conduct services in other churches on condition that they would respect the laws and not stir up revolt against the Civil Constitution. The assembly had to allow this change to control the schism and in part because "Constitutional Clergy" (those who had taken the oath) were unable to properly conduct their service.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The constitutional clergy often required the assistance of the National Guard due to the mayhem that would occur.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The division in France was at an all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It is important to note that even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the division in the state.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; On 29 November 1791, the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could invoke the rights in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|de-Christianization]] and propagation of the [[Cult of Reason]] and the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] in 1793–1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.

==Repeal of the Civil Constitution==
{{See also|Concordat of 1801}}After the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], the [[National Convention|Convention]] repealed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; however, the schism between the civilly constituted French Church and the Papacy was only resolved when the [[Concordat of 1801]] was agreed on. The Concordat was reached on July 15, 1801 and it was made widely known the following year, on Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Civil-Constitution-of-the-Clergy|title=Civil Constitution of the Clergy {{!}} France|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Concordat-of-1801|title=Concordat of 1801 {{!}} French religious history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an agreement executed by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and clerical and papal representatives from Rome and Paris,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and determined the role and status of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] in France; moreover, it concluded the confiscations and church reforms that had been implemented over the course of the revolution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The agreement also gave the [[First Consul|first consul]] (Napoleon) the authority and right to nominate bishops, redistribute the current parishes and bishoprics, and allowed for seminaries to be established.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In an effort to please [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] it was agreed upon that suitable salaries would be provided for bishops and curés and he would condone the acquisition of church lands.

The '''''Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902'''''  was an [[statute|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]] which defined a uniform national criteria of who was entitled to [[vote]] in [[Elections in Australia|Australian federal elections]]. The Act established universal suffrage for federal elections for those who are British subjects over 21 years of age who have lived in Australia for six months, with some qualifications. It granted Australian women the right to vote at a national level, and to stand for election to the Parliament.

The Act meant that, though the [[New Zealand|Colony of New Zealand]] had granted women universal suffrage in 1893 and this carried forward to New Zealand subsequently becoming an independent nation in 1907, Australia was the first independent country to grant [[women's suffrage]] at a national level, and the first country to allow women to stand for Parliament. However, the Act also disqualified some [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Asian people]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s (except New Zealand [[Māori language|Maori]]) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as [[British subject]]s.

The act was replaced by the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]''.

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act was originally very short, having only five sections. The main provision was section three, which provided that electors in a federal election are naturally born British subjects over twenty-one years of age, male or female, married or single, who have lived in Australia for at least six months, and are on the [[electoral register|electoral roll]] in any [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|federal electoral division]].

At the time whoever was considered a British subject was determined by rules of English commonwealth law, as an independent Australian citizenship was not introduced until 26 January 1949, with the coming into effect of the Australian nationality law, ''Australian Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948''.

Section 4 of the Act made a range of disqualifications from the general definition in section 3. People who had at any time been convicted of [[treason]] could not vote. A person who was under sentence or awaiting sentence for any offence which could be punished by [[prison|imprisonment]] for one year or longer (under the law of Australia, or of the United Kingdom, or of any other [[Dominion]] of the Empire) was also not allowed to vote. People of "unsound mind" were also disqualified. [[Indigenous people]] from  Australia, Asia, Africa and the [[Pacific Islands]], [excluding New Zealand  and 'aboriginal native of Australia' entitled by Section 41 of the Constitution to vote in State Government elections], were not entitled to enroll to vote in an election of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. 

Section 41 of the Constitution provided in short that 'No adult person with a right to vote at an elections for a State Parliament can be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth'.

For Example:[[India]]n people were therefore not allowed to vote, even though they were citizens of the British Empire, unless they had voting right in the State in which they were resident.

Section 44 of the Constitution disqualified a range of people from being elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] or the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], such as any person with an allegiance to a foreign power (such as a citizen of another country), or anyone who was [[bankrupt]] or [[insolvent]]. However, these people were not prevented from voting by the Act.

Section 5 provided that no person could vote more than once at an election.

==Amendments to the Act==
In 1906 the 1902 Act was amended to allow [[postal voting]]. In 1908, a permanent [[electoral roll]] was established and in 1911, it became compulsory for all eligible voters to enroll on the electoral roll. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in [[voter turnout]], even though voting was still voluntary.{{Ref|enrolment}} From 1912, elections have been held on Saturdays.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's major electoral developments Timeline: 1900 - Present|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/Reform_present.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Act==
Before [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901, Australia consisted of six colonies, each with their own voting systems and franchise. Section 41 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] governed how the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] in 1901 was to be conducted. It provided that any person who was enrolled and eligible to vote in a [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories|State election]] could also vote in a federal election. Each [[States and territories of Australia|state]] had a different system, with different criteria to determine who could vote. In South Australia and Western Australia, women could vote, and in Western Australia and [[Queensland]], Indigenous people were specifically barred from voting.

The 1902 Commonwealth Act created a uniform voting system for federal elections across the country. The original [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] was introduced into the Senate by [[Richard O'Connor (Australian politician)|Richard O'Connor]], the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]], and later in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Home Affairs, [[William Lyne]]. It is unusual for being one of the few major pieces of [[legislation]] to be introduced in the Senate before the House.

In 1918, the 1902 Act was repealed and replaced by the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]''. Many of the present features of the [[Australian electoral system]] were introduced after the 1918 Act came in force. [[Instant-runoff voting]] was introduced for the House of Representatives in 1918, [[compulsory voting]] was introduced in 1924, and the [[single transferable vote]] was introduced for the Senate in 1949. Indigenous Australians were granted the right to vote at federal elections in 1962. The qualifying voting age was lowered to 18 in 1973.

==Women's suffrage==
{{main|Women's suffrage in Australia}}
Because of Section 41 of the Constitution, women in South Australia and Western Australia were able to vote at federal elections. Although the original distribution between the states of seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the number of male voters in each state, it was possible that later distributions could proportionally increase the number of seats given to South Australia and Western Australia, since they had proportionally more enrolled voters than their percentage of the population.

Many politicians were concerned that allowing women to vote would discriminate in favour of married men, since, in the words of Sir [[Edward Braddon]], "the married man, happy in his family, whose wife's vote is one which he can command… will have two votes."{{Ref|braddon}} Others, such as [[William Sawers]], argued that because there were more women living in the cities, rural areas would become under-represented. Much of the opposition to the granting of women's suffrage in the Act was grounded in the belief that, in the words of [[William Knox (Victorian politician)|William Knox]], "the main ambition of a woman's life should be to become the wife of an honorable and honest man."{{Ref|knox}} However, there was much support for granting the vote to women, and the bill was approved by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament.

==Non-white people==
{{main|Voting rights of Indigenous Australians}}
The [[White Australia policy]], or at least the ideas behind it, had been very strong since long before [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. Although the ''[[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]]'' was established to prevent non-white people from migrating to Australia, significant numbers of foreign citizens, particularly [[Chinese race|Chinese people]] who migrated during the [[Victorian gold rush]], were already living in Australia, and many politicians were keen to prevent them from having any political influence. Politicians also wanted to prevent Indigenous people from voting. Although Indigenous men had the right to vote everywhere except Western Australia and Queensland, and Indigenous women also had the right to vote in South Australia, this was not because it had explicitly been given to them, but because it had not explicitly been denied to them.

Preventing non-white people from voting was an idea grounded in the philosophy of [[eugenics]] and [[scientific racism]], which were popular ideas at the time.{{citation needed|reason=Source needed|date=February 2015}} Whereas most Indigenous peoples were excluded from voting, [[Māori people|Māori]] living in Australia were allowed to vote. During the parliamentary debates over the Act, [[King O'Malley]] (a radical and "colourful" politician) said that "An Aboriginal is not as intelligent as a Māori. There is no scientific evidence that he is a human being at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Commonwealth Franchise Bill, second reading | work=Australian House of Representatives Hansard | url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22hansard80%2Fhansardr80%2F1902-04-23%2F0063%22 | accessdate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the attitudes of the time, the Act disqualified some [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Asian people]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s (except New Zealand [[Māori language|Maori]]) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as [[British subject]]s. In relation to Indigenous Australians, the Act providing that "No aboriginal native of Australia ... shall be entitled to have his name placed on an Electoral Roll unless so entitled under section forty-one of the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-88.html | title = Documenting a Democracy | accessdate = 13 October 2011 | publisher = Museum of Australian Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section forty-one of the Constitution provided that all those entitled to vote in state elections under the state franchise could vote in Commonwealth elections. It was not clear whether that section was intended to be an ongoing provision, or only an interim measure for State electors enrolled at the time of Federation. The first Permanent Head of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]], [[Robert Garran]], gave it the second, narrower, interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/1983/23.pdf Re Pearson; Ex Parte Sipka]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Air twist cordial glass.jpg|thumb|Air twist cordial glass c. 1750]]
A '''cordial''' is any invigorating and stimulating preparation that is intended for a medicinal purpose. The term derives from an obsolete usage. Various [[Pharmaceutical drug#Medieval pharmacology|concoctions]] were formerly created that were believed to be beneficial to one's health, especially for the [[heart]] (''cor'' in [[Latin]]).&lt;ref name=Morton2004 &gt;{{citation | last=Morton | first=Mark | year=2004 | title=Cupboard Love: A Dictionary of Culinary Curiosities | edition=2 | publisher=Insomniac Press | isbn=978-1-894663-66-3  | page=91 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qn-DASgdhiAC | accessdate=2011-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cordials, with their flecks of [[gold leaf]] and bright yellow hue, took their name from the "cordial vertues" of the rays of the sun, which some [[alchemists]] thought they contained.&lt;ref name='rosolio'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historicfood.com/rosolio.htm | title = Cordial Waters | accessdate = 2010-08-23 | last = Day | first = Ivan | work = Historic Food}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most cordials were of European origin, first produced in Italian [[apothecaries]] during the [[Renaissance]] where the art of distilling was refined during the 15th and 16th centuries. It is from this origin that cordials are frequently referred to in French as ''Liqueurs d'ltalie'', it is also from this that we have [[liqueur]]s. From the Renaissance onwards, cordials were usually based on [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in which certain [[herbs]], [[spices]] or other ingredients were allowed to steep.  The first cordials arrived in England in the late 15th century and were called distilled cordial waters. These were strictly used as alcoholic medicines, prescribed in small doses to invigorate and revitalise the heart, body and spirit as well as cure diseases. By the 18th century cordials were being imbibed for their intoxicating effects and medicinal virtues, and were fast becoming recreational drinks, eventually evolving into [[liqueur]]s.

Though cordials originated on the continent, a number of British "sweet drams" achieved popularity in Europe.

==Uses==
Cordials were used to renew the natural heat, recreate and revive the spirits, and free the whole body from the malignity of diseases.&lt;ref name='rosolio' /&gt; Many cordials were also considered [[aphrodisiacs]], a view which encouraged their consumption in a social as opposed to a medical context. Other early varieties of alcoholic cordials were flavoured with spices and herbal ingredients which were thought to settle the stomach after excessive eating. These cordials were called Surfeit Waters, which were specifically created for treating overindulgence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofdrink.com/2009/02/surfeit-water.php Surfeit Water&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115050402/http://www.artofdrink.com/2009/02/surfeit-water.php |date=2010-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precious ingredients like [[gold]], [[pearl]]s and [[coral]] were sometimes added. These were believed to revive the spirit and to preclude disease.

==In fiction==
Lucy Pevensie, a pivotal character in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Chronicles of Narnia]]'', was, as Queen Lucy in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', gifted a bottle of magical cordial by Father Christmas along with her dagger, prior to the Battle of Berunia. The cordial was said to be made from the juice of Fire-Flowers that grew in the mountains of the sun, with a single drop curing almost any illness or injury, bringing people back from the brink of death in some cases.  The use of the word "cordial" by the author was archaic even at the time.

==Popular cordials==
* ''Rosa Solis'' or ''Rosolio'', probably originating in Renaissance Turin was derived from the carnivorous [[sundew]] plant. It was believed to not only invigorate the heart, but to be an aphrodisiac as well; according to the 17th century medical writer William Salmon, sundew "stirs up lust".
* ''Royal Usquebaugh''  was a spicy concoction containing flecks of gold leaf thought to capture the sun's golden radiance. It was usually flavoured with [[aniseed]], [[liquorice]] and [[saffron]] and sweetened with fruit sugar extracted from [[figs]] and [[raisins]] by [[maceration (food)|maceration]]. The name derives from the Irish ''uisce beatha'', which is literally the Gaelic translation of Latin ''aqua vitae'', 'the water of life'). The word whisky is also derived from the Irish ''uisce beatha'', but this was not the same as the cordial consumed in 17th and 18th century England and France, and bore no resemblance to the spirit we now call whisky.&lt;ref name=Ross1970 &gt;{{citation | last=Ross | first=James | year=1970 | title=Whisky | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7100-6685-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoM9AAAAIAAJ  | pages=121–122  | accessdate=2011-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Escubac d'Angleterre'', a more down-market relative of Royal Usquebaugh without the flecks of gold leaf, but was nevertheless a popular drink.
* ''[[Vespetrò]]'', another popular liqueur of Italy (speciality of the town of [[Canzo]]), flavoured with anise, angelica and lemon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3429">The '''counteraction principle''' or '''counteraction theory''' is a legal principle which relates to the use of [[intellectual property]] where two marks are phonetically similar and where such a situation could lead to public confusion between brands.

==Relevant issues==
Holders of [[trademarks]] are able to contest the registration of similar trademarks on multiple grounds; one of which is public confusion. On the basis of public confusion, the counteraction principle (in essence) will not hinder companies using trademarks which are similar to those of famous marks. This is because most famous marks are likely to be easily identifiable, and therefore not likely to lead to confusion from the general public.

The estate argued that the trademark name Picaro was too similar to Picasso and would cause public confusion. After being defeated in lower European courts, the appeal was dismissed in the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rennie|first=David|title=A Picaro is no Picasso, and that's final|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1507759/A-Picaro-is-no-Picasso-and-thats-final.html#|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHIM accepted the registration of the mark on the basis that everyone knew the fictional character [[Obelix]]. The [[OHIM Board of Appeal]] allowed for opposition by the Paris-based publisher of the Obelix character for classes 9 and 35 of the [[Madrid System]]. However, for all other classes the appeal was dismissed, as the [[General Court (European Union)]] concluded that there should be no confusion over such a popular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/obelix-too-famous-to-be-confused-with.html |title=The IPKat: Obelix too famous to be confused with a mobile phone service |publisher=Ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Burton approached [[CeeLo Green]], a member of Goodie Mob, and gave him an instrumental demo tape. It would be several years before the pair made contact again, but the two would eventually collaborate as [[Gnarls Barkley]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/magazine/18barkley.html?ex=1308283200&amp;en=d69638926b798ed5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss| title=The D.J.

In March 2017, [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] singer [[Anthony Kiedis]] indicated that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to ''The Getaway''. Kiedis stated "I think it's good to work with the same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with this guy and see what we can accomplish."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CFOXVideos|title=Anthony Kiedis Interview.

== Philosophy ==
In an interview for ''The New York Times'' magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film [[auteur]], basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like [[Woody Allen]]. "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," he said. "That's what I decided to do with music. I want to create a director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'')... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10270">The '''EU–US Privacy Shield''' is a framework for regulating transatlantic exchanges of personal data for commercial purposes between the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="European Commission - Press release: political agreement on framework"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-216_en.htm European Commission - Press release: political agreement on framework]&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes is to enable US companies to more easily receive personal data from EU entities under EU [[privacy law]]s meant to protect European Union citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-2|title=The new transatlantic data "Privacy Shield"|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU–US Privacy Shield is a replacement for the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]], which were declared invalid by the [[European Court of Justice]] in October 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vera Jourová, "Commissioner Jourová's remarks on Safe Harbour EU Court of Justice judgement before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE)", 26 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background history ==
{{Main|International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles}}
In October 2015 the [[European Court of Justice]] declared the previous framework called the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] invalid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Soon after this decision the [[European Commission]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] started talks about a new framework and on February 2, 2016 they reached a political agreement.&lt;ref name="European Commission - Press release: political agreement on framework" /&gt; 
The European Commission published the "adequacy decision" draft, declaring principles to be equivalent to the protections offered by EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3038688/privacy/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-eu-us-privacy-shield-agreement.html|title=5 things you need to know about the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement|website=PCWorld|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Article 29 Data Protection Working Party]] delivered an opinion on April 13, 2016, stating that the Privacy Shield offers major improvements compared to the Safe Harbor decisions, but that three major points of concern still remain. They relate to deletion of data, collection of massive amounts of data, and clarification of the new Ombudsperson mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2016/wp238_en.pdf Opinion 01/2016 on the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield draft adequacy decision], the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] issued an opinion on 30 May 2016 in which he stated that "the Privacy Shield, as it stands, is not robust enough to withstand future legal scrutiny before the [European] Court".&lt;ref&gt;European Data Protection Supervisor, [https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/site/mySite/shared/Documents/EDPS/PressNews/Press/2016/EDPS-2016-11-PrivacyShield_EN.pdf Privacy Shield: more robust and sustainable solution needed], 30 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016 EU Member States representatives (article 31 committee) approved the final version of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, paving the way for the adoption of the decision by the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by European Commission Vice-President Ansip and Commissioner Jourová, [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-2443_en.htm Adoption by Member States of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield], 8 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] adopted the framework on 12 July 2016 and it went into effect the same day.&lt;ref name="European Commission - Press release: launch privacy shield"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm European Commission - Press release: launch privacy shield]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="privacy shield adequacy decision"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/privacy-shield-adequacy-decision_en.pdf Privacy Shield adequacy decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] entitled "[[Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States|Enhancing Public Safety]]" which states that U.S. privacy protections will not be extended beyond US citizens or residents:
:''Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united Executive Order: Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States], Section 14, 25 January 2017, accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Commission has stated that:
:''The US Privacy Act has never offered data protection rights to Europeans. The Commission negotiated two additional instruments to ensure that EU citizens’ data is duly protected when transferred to the US:
:*''The EU–US Privacy Shield, which does not rely on the protections under the US Privacy Act.
:*''The EU–US Umbrella Agreement, which enters into force on 1 February (2017). To finalize this agreement, the [[US Congress]] adopted a new law in 2017, the US Judicial Redress Act,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ126/PLAW-114publ126.pdf Public Law 114-126], 24 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which extends the benefits of the US Privacy Act to Europeans and gives them access to US courts."&lt;ref name="infosecurity-magazine.com"&gt;Muncaster, P., [https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/trump-order-sparks-privacy-shield/ Trump Order Sparks Privacy Shield Fears], ''InfoSecurity Magazine'', accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;''

The Commission said it will "continue to monitor the implementation of both instruments".&lt;ref name="infosecurity-magazine.com"/&gt;

==Response==
German [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Jan Philipp Albrecht]] and campaigner [[Max Schrems]] criticized the new ruling, with the latter predicting that the Commission might be taking a "round-trip to [[Luxembourg]]" (where the [[European Court of Justice]] is located).&lt;ref&gt;Max Schrems: "EU US Privacy Shield" (Safe Harbor 1.1) "European Commission may be issuing a round-trip to Luxembourg" [http://europe-v-facebook.org/PS_update.pdf] 16:45 (2nd Feb. 2016), PDF retrieved 3rd Feb. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Many Europeans demanded a mechanism for individual European citizens to lodge complaints over the use of their data, as well as a transparency scheme to assure that European citizens' data does not fall into the hands of U.S intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EU-US Data Transfers Won’t Be Blocked While Privacy Shield Details Are Hammered Out, Says WP29|url = https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/eu-us-data-transfers-wont-be-blocked-while-privacy-shield-details-are-hammered-out-says-wp29/|website = TechCrunch|access-date = 2016-02-03|first = Natasha|last = Lomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
As of February 2017 the future of the Privacy Shield is contested. One consultant, Matt Allison, predicts that "The EU's citizen-driven, regulated model will swiftly come into conflict with the market forces of the US and the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first= Matt | last=Allison | title =  A Template for Adequacy: EU Pitches for Data Protection Gold Standard, Feb 09, 2017 |url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20170209_template_for_adequacy_eu_pitches_for_data_protection_gold_standard/|

The Privacy Shield has been challenged legally by privacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62016TN0670 Case T-670/16], Digital Rights Ireland v the commssion, 16 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62016TN0738 Case T-738/16], La Quadrature du Net and Others v. the Commission, 25 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016|11}}, it is not clear whether the cases will be considered admissible.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters article [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-dataprotection-usa/eu-u-s-personal-data-pact-faces-second-legal-challenge-from-privacy-groups-idUSKBN12X253?il=0 EU-U.S. personal data pact faces second legal challenge from privacy groups], 2 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case information on [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/fiche.jsf?id=T%3B738%3B16%3BRD%3B1%3BP%3B1%3BT2016%2F0738%2FP T-738/16] at Curia&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Forensic Economics''' as defined by the National Association of Forensic Economics is the scientific discipline that applies economic theories and methods to matters within a legal framework. Forensic economics covers, but is not limited to:
* The calculation of pecuniary damages in personal and commercial litigation.
* The analysis of liability, such as the statistical analysis of discrimination, the analysis of market power in antitrust disputes, and fraud detection.
* Other matters subject to legal review, such as public policy analysis, and business, property, and asset valuation.

In a 2012 paper by Eric Zitzewitz entitled “Forensic Economics,” ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 2012, 50(3), 731–769, published by the American Economic Association, "Forensic Economics" was defined as the application of economics to the detection and quantification of harm from behavior that has become the subject of litigation.

The only difference between these two definitions is that one suggests the application of science is itself a scientific discipline.  Notwithstanding this distinction, both definitions refer to the application of [[economics]].  While courts may dictate what economic issues are to be addressed, the economic science that is applied must be that which is taught and practiced in the world at large.

==Examples of applications of economics in litigation==
* Economic damages in injury and death
* Antitrust liability and economic damages
* Unfair practices in international trade
* Economic damages in copyright violation and patent infringement
* Contract violations
* Discrimination
* [[Economic damages]] related to physical and emotional abuse

The '''Free Art License''' (abbr.: FAL, {{lang-fr|Licence Art Libre|links=no}}) is a [[copyleft]] [[license]] that grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and [[Derivative work|transform]] creative works.

==History==
The license was written in July 2000 with contributions from the mailing list ''&lt;copyleft_attitude{{@}}April.org&gt;'' and in particular with French lawyers [[Mélanie Clément-Fontaine]] and [[David Geraud]], and French artists [[Isabelle Vodjdani]] and [[Antoine Moreau]]. It followed meetings held by [[Copyleft Attitude Antoine Moreau]] with the artists gathered around the magazine ''Allotopie'': [[Francis Deck]], [[Antonio Gallego]], Roberto Martinez and [[Emma Gall]]. They took place at "Accès Local" in January 2000 and "Public" in March 2000, two places of contemporary art in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051225224149/http://artlibre.org/archives/news/210 The first meetings of Copyleft Attitude], copy in [[Internet Archive]] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Moreau organized a session at the EOF space which brought together hundreds of authors to achieve exposure according to the principles of copyleft with this condition: "Free Admission if free work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoinemoreau.info/copyleft_session/index.php?/category/3 Copyleft Session :: eof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140426/http://antoinemoreau.info/copyleft_session/index.php?%2Fcategory%2F3 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he wrote a memoir edited by Liliane Terrier entitled in {{Lang-fr|Le copyleft appliqué à la création artistique. Le collectif Copyleft Attitude et la Licence Art Libre}} (Copyleft applied to artistic creation. The Copyleft Attitude collective and the Free Art License).&lt;ref&gt;[http://antomoro.free.fr/left/dea/DEA_copyleft.html ''Le copyleft appliqué à la création artistique. Le collectif Copyleft Attitude et la Licence Art Libre'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, version 1.3 of the Free Art License was amended to provide greater [[legal certainty]] and optimum [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with other copyleft licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framablog.org/index.php/post/2007/04/09/Licence-Art-Libre-13-Antoine-Moreau Article introducing FAL 1.3 by Antoine Moreau]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenbelt Knoll''' is a residential development in the [[Northeast Philadelphia|Northeast]] section of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Planned and built from 1952 to 1957, it is notable as the first planned [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] development in Philadelphia and among the first in the [[United States]].

The developer, [[Morris Milgram]], a leader of the [[open housing]] movement, required that 55 percent of the homes be sold to whites, and 45 percent to non-whites.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/black_white_and_golden-38427864.html "Black, White and Golden. Greenbelt Knoll residents celebrate 50 years of historical significance,"] by Gwen Shaffer, ''Philadelphia Weekly'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first house sold in 1956 for $20,000. The isolated little neighborhood included its own swimming pool,  which was filled in circa 1985, leaving no trace above ground.&lt;ref name=NomForm&gt;[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/913602/greenbelt_knoll_nr_draft_pdf Greenbelt Knoll Historic District nomination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Eighteen (originally nineteen) one-story single-family homes are arranged in a heavily wooded [[cul de sac]] on Longford Street off Holme Avenue, surrounded on three sides by [[Pennypack Park]]. The simple wood-frame homes were designed in a [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style by the [[architect]]ural firm of [[Montgomery &amp; Bishop]] in consultation with architects [[Louis Kahn]] and [[Harry Duncan]] and [[landscape architect]] [[Margaret Lancaster Duncan]].

Greenbelt Knoll won several awards for design excellence. For example, the American Institute of Architects, ''House and Home'', ''Better Homes and Gardens'', and the National Broadcasting Corporation bestowed its Homes for Better Living award on the development. Also, Philadelphia Mayor [[Richardson Dilworth]], an ardent advocate of exceptional planning and design, conferred a City of Philadelphia Tribute on Montgomery &amp; Bishop; he gave the tribute "for the design of Greenbelt Knoll Homes, which ... brought new standards of contemporary residential architecture to Philadelphia."&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;

==Notable residents==
The original residents included Milgram himself;&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; [[Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.]], the first African American to represent Pennsylvania in [[United States Congress|Congress]];&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]–winning African-American playwright [[Charles Fuller]], who grew up here;&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt; the Rev. [[Leon Sullivan]], the civil rights activist, who developed the [[Sullivan Principles]] and hastened the end of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]];&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; and Fire Captain Roosevelt Barlow, a civil rights activist who was one of a group of African-American firefighters to integrate the Philadelphia Fire Department.&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2003-07-17/news/25453475_1_black-firefighters-white-firefighters-entrance-exam "Roosevelt Barlow, 85, Phila. firefighter" (obituary)], Philadelphia ''Inquirer'', July 17, 2003, by Gayle Ronan Sims.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic designation==
Greenbelt Knoll was listed as a historic district on the [[Philadelphia Register of Historic Places]] in 2006&lt;ref name="PRHP districts"&gt;{{cite web|title=PRHP: List of historic districts|url=http://www.phila.gov/historical/base.html|publisher=Philadelphia Historical Commission|accessdate=03-12-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010. The site is marked with a plaque placed by the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-pennsylvania-historical-markers-include-native-american-archeological-sites-in-lancaster-and-a-masonic-temple-in-philadelphia-among-others-57957732.html New Pennsylvania Historical Markers Include Native American Archeological Sites in Lancaster and a Masonic Temple in Philadelphia Among Others]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen of the existing homes are considered contributing properties; one home was completely rebuilt following a c. 1980 fire and is considered non-contributing. An additional lot (#17) is now open space, as the house was demolished 1997. Including the 5 detached garages, a studio, and the 2-acre community park that was part of the original neighborhood design, there are 26 resources: 22 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site (park), 2 non-contributing buildings and 1 non-contributing site (Lot #17). The development remains heavily wooded, and both the houses and landscape retain integrity.&lt;ref name=NomForm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6672">{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[conflict of laws]], '''habitual residence''' is the standard used to determine the law which should be applied to determine a given legal dispute. It can be contrasted with the law on [[domicile (law)|domicile]], traditionally used in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s to do the same thing.

Habitual residence is less demanding than domicile and the focus is more on past experience rather than future intention. There is normally only one habitual residence where the individual usually resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the geographical place considered "[[home]]" for a reasonably significant period of time.

==Discussion==
The concept of habitual residence is used in a number of [[international convention]]s, beginning with the [[Hague Convention on Civil Procedure]] of 14 November 1896 and a number of international conventions dealing with conflict to complement or supplant the traditional connecting factor of domicile, e.g. in the Rome Convention 1980, but it was replaced, with respect to [[Juristic person|legal entities]] by the new connecting factor of [[principal office]]. It is the basis of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], the [[Convention on International Child Abduction]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24 Full text of the Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; etc. 

Habitual residence is something less than [[domicile (law)|domicile]] but more than simple residence. It may also be more discriminating that the test of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'' in that the connection is to a specific location within a state rather than to the [[country]] of nationality which may contain several subnational jurisdictions (such as states or provinces). Hence, where a country contains more than one legal system, the residence must determine which of the several possible laws might apply (e.g. in the [[United States]] which of the laws of the [[U.S. states]] is to be applied). A [[supranationalism|supranational]] example of this selection process is contained in Article 19 of the [[Rome Convention (contract)|Rome Convention]]:
:States with more than one legal system
#Where a State comprises several [[territorial unit]]s each of which has its own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations, each territorial unit shall be considered as a country for the purposes of identifying the law applicable under this Convention.
#A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations shall not be bound to apply this Convention to conflicts solely between the laws of such units.

==Comparison with domicile==
To establish a domicile of choice, it is necessary to have a clear factual base in one [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] and that must be accompanied by an ''animus semper manendi'' ({{lang-la|intention to reside indefinitely}}). Although it is not so difficult to produce evidence that an individual has established a home in a state, it is very difficult to prove that someone has no intention of ever establishing a home in another state. The test for habitual residence is less demanding. The court focuses on the past experience of the individual and not so much on future intention. 

A person can have only one habitual residence. It is the place where the individual ordinarily resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the place he or she would consider to be "home" and it is established as a matter of geography over a reasonably significant period of time.

Since habitual residence is a test of fact, it cannot be a purely legal concept and there are different views about the factual situations which it is supposed to denote. Some authors believe that the sole criterion that the test of habitual residence should be purely objective, seeking evidence of physical presence over a considerable period of time. Others assert that the test should be both objective and subjective elements: the ''factum'' or physical presence in a given place and the ''animus'' to continue to stay there.

The [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] has deliberately refrained from offering a definition so that the concept may be flexible and adaptable to practical requirements. Thus, habitual residence may be interpreted differently in different Conflict situations. However, the core of the test will tend to be based on evidence of a long-term stay accompanied by other evidence of the individual's personal and professional life to demonstrate the continuity of the connection between that person and the place of residence. To that extent, the intention of the individual may have some weight.

But it may be difficult to determine where a person has a habitual residence if constantly on the move and has no real or continuing connection with any of the countries through which passed. This could be resolved by reference to the individual's intention, but although the test of intention is well-defined in the case law for the purposes of domicile, there is no consensus of the strength of intention that would have to be shown to establish "[[habit (psychology)|habit]]". Similarly, there is no consensus on the length of time a person should have a home for it to become habitual.

In some countries, the [[legislature]] has produced a test. In [[Canada]], [[Manitoba]] abolished the common law test of domicile and substituted the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Domicile and Habitual Residence Act|abbr =CCSM|year =|chapter = D96|section=8|link= http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/_pdf.php?cap=d96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
'''8'''(1) The domicile and habitual residence of each person is in the state and a subdivision thereof in which that person's principal home is situated and in which that person intends to reside.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), unless a contrary intention is shown, a person is presumed to intend to reside indefinitely in the state and subdivision thereof in which that person's principal home is situated.}}

The '''Impeachment Union''' ({{lang-hy|Իմպիչմենթ դաշինք}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Armenia]].

The '''Injunction Generator''' is an [[Internet art|artistic]] [[software]] module by Austrian artists [[Ubermorgen.com]] which claims to generate on request legal [[injunction]]s and personalized documentation in .rtf/.pdf format to force a website into taking its contents offline. 

Carrying on with their principles of "radical corporative marketing strategy" ([[media hacking]]), the artists produced an effective and credible interface which helps creating one's own documented [[cease-and-desist]] request, which is then automatically sent to the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] administrators, to the site's owner and to some journalists to trick them into supporting the "public trial". 

The project is published at ''ipnic.org'', an acronym which mimics the official protocols ([[Internet Protocol]] - [[Network Information Center]]), revisited as "Internet Partnership for No Internet Content". 

This sarcastic provocation (a "public shutdown service") was conceived after experiencing a similar mishap during the [[Voteauction]] art project, which in 2000 invited American citizens to put up their vote for auction. At the time an email injunction by an American court was sent to the Swiss [[internet service provider]] hosting the site, who immediately took them offline even though emailed documents aren't legally considered official and even though [[Switzerland]] is outside of American jurisdiction.

'''The International Centre for Financial Regulation (ICFR)''' (2009–12) was a UK-based [[non-partisan]] organisation focused entirely on [[financial regulation]] that operated between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icffr.org/getattachment/03ba1c5d-b37d-4ff1-b9f6-00286fabe5e6/ICFR-Launch-Press-Pack.aspx |title=ICFR launched |author= |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317205008/http://www.icffr.org/getattachment/03ba1c5d-b37d-4ff1-b9f6-00286fabe5e6/ICFR-Launch-Press-Pack.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IFCR was the product of a collaboration between a number if international financial services institutions and the UK Government. The ICFR wanted to provide research, events and training on financial regulation whilst also acting as a catalyst for dialogue, thought leadership and scholarship in this critical area.&lt;ref name=launch/&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2014}} The ICFR’s stated focus was to "shape regulatory thinking that not only addresses – but also anticipates – the evolution of [[financial markets]] at a global level, to bring consistency and cooperation between global regulators and policy makers through pro-active discussions, working groups and long-term research."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icffr.org/Research.aspx ICFR research]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121200419/http://www.icffr.org/Research.aspx |date=21 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also meant to support practical training initiatives on best practice and the latest regulatory changes both in developed and emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icffr.org/Training/Training-Catalogue.aspx ICFR training catalogue]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906180043/http://www.icffr.org/Training/Training-Catalogue.aspx |date=6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was put into administration in late 2012, as a member of the management had been suspended after a "substantial" sum of money "appeared to have been removed from the organisation’s bank accounts" without the permission of the centre's board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dc67ec98-5fe8-11e2-b128-00144feab49a.html#axzz2UNhGBgwi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/police-probe-into-financial-watchdog-after-money-goes-missing-8347670.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2014, the ICFR's Chief Operating Officer Charles Taylor appeared at City of London Magistrates' Court charged with fraud by abuse of position in relation to the internal theft of almost £600,000 and false accounting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancylive.com/croner/jsp/Editorial.do?contentId=2910760&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;channelId=-601070&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor committed suicide in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/accountant-state-funded-thinktank-killed-himself-before-trial-inquest-hears |title=Accountant at state-funded thinktank killed himself before trial |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inventors Assistance League''' (IAL) is a non-profit organization created to assist [[inventors]], small businesses and entrepreneurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16909">The '''King–Byng affair'''  was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[constitutional crisis]] that occurred in 1926, when the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|the Lord Byng of Vimy]], refused a request by his [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], to dissolve parliament and call a [[general election]].

The crisis came to redefine the role of [[governor general]], not only in Canada but throughout the [[Dominion]]s, becoming a major impetus in negotiations at [[Imperial Conference]]s held in the late 1920s that led to the adoption of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. According to [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in the [[British Empire]], the governor general once represented both the sovereign [[Queen-in-Council|in his]] [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|imperial council]] and in his [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Canadian council]], but the convention had evolved with Byng's predecessors, the Canadian government, and the Canadian people into a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government. After 1931, the governor general remained an important figure in Canadian governance as a constitutional watchdog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=McWhinney| first=Edward| authorlink=Edward McWhinney| title=The Governor General and the Prime Ministers: the Making and Unmaking of Governments| publisher=Ronsdale Press| year=2005| location=Vancouver| page=118| isbn=1-55380-031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the role was shorn of its previous imperial duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Messamore| first=Barbara J.| title=Canada's Governors General, 1847:1878: Biography and Constitutional Evolution| publisher=University of Toronto Press| year=2006| location=Toronto| page=| isbn=978-0-8020-9061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The affair==
[[Image:Lord-byng.jpg|thumb|right|The Lord Byng of Vimy]]
In September 1925, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[advice (constitutional)|advised]] the Governor General, [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|the Lord Byng of Vimy]], to [[Dissolution of parliament#Canada|dissolve parliament]] and [[Dropping the writ|drop the writ]] for a [[Elections in Canada|general election]], to which Lord Byng agreed. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|subsequent election]], held on 29 October, [[Arthur Meighen]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] won 116 seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] to 101 for King's [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]. Counting on the support of the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]], with its 28 seats, to overcome the Conservative plurality, King (who had lost his seat in the election, and didn't regain a seat formally until February 1926 thanks to [[Charles McDonald (Canadian politician)|Charles McDonald]]) did not resign and remained in office as head of a [[minority government]]. Strictly speaking, this was not a [[coalition government]], as the Progressives were not given any [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] seats and were thus not a part of the government.

On 30 October, King visited Byng after consulting with the rest of Cabinet and informed the Governor General that his government would continue until parliament decided otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Williams| first=Jeffery| title=Byng of Vimy: General and Governor General| publisher=University of Toronto Press| year=1992| page=305| location=Toronto| isbn=978-0-436-57110-7| ref=CITEREF_Williams_1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byng, who had suggested to King that he ought to resign with such a tenuous mandate, later claimed to have told the Prime Minister: "Well, in any event you must not at any time ask for a dissolution unless Mr Meighen is first given a chance to show whether or not he is able to govern," to which King acquiesced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams| 1992| p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Meighen and other Conservatives expressed public outrage at what they viewed as a desperate attempt on the part of King to cling to power, some Conservatives were privately relieved by King's decision; they seriously doubted whether the Tories could convince the Progressives to support a Conservative minority government, were confident that King's attempt to remain in power would eventually fail, and thought the expected debacle would be so damaging to the Liberals' reputation that the Conservatives would then be swept into office with a large majority.

===Scandal===
A few months later, one of King's appointees in the Department of Customs and Excise was revealed to have taken bribes, after which the Conservatives alleged that the corruption extended to the highest levels of government, including the prime minister. King had already replaced the Minister of Customs and Excise, [[Jacques Bureau]], with [[Georges Henri Boivin]], but recommended that Byng appoint Bureau to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]. This further alienated the members of the Progressive Party. The Progressives were already distancing themselves from the government because of its failure to transfer control of [[Alberta]]'s natural resources from the federal government to the province, but in June had saved the government from defeat in a no-confidence motion on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams| 1992| p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:WilliamLyonMackenzieKing.jpg|thumb|left|William Lyon Mackenzie King]]

The Progressive Party's support was temporarily retained by the formation of a special committee to investigate the corruption in the customs department. Its report, which was presented to the House of Commons, acknowledged that there was widespread fraud in the department but did not specifically criticise the government. A Conservative [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), [[Henry Herbert Stevens|H. H. Stevens]], proposed an amendment to the report which would effectively censure the government and compel it to resign. However, Labour MP [[J. S. Woodsworth]] proposed amending Stevens' amendment to remove the censure of the government and set up a [[Royal Commission]] to investigate the customs department further. The motion was defeated, despite the full support of the government. A Progressive MP, W. R. Fansher, then proposed that a Royal Commission be combined with the original motion of censure. The [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House]] ruled the motion out of order, but, [[on division]], the members over-ruled the speaker and the Cabinet was defeated again. After a motion that the House adjourn, put forward by a Progressive member at King's behest, was subsequently also voted down, King announced that he would accept Fansher's amendment and secured an adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams| 1992| pp=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for dissolution===
To avoid the inevitable vote on the Fansher amendment, which would either force his government's resignation or bring his administration into disrepute, King went to Byng on 26 June 1926 seeking a dissolution of parliament.&lt;ref name=Forsey&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Forsey| first=Helen| title=As David Johnson Enters Rideau Hall...| journal=The Monitor| publisher=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives| location=Ottawa| date=1 October 2010| url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/david-johnson-enters-rideau-hall | accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byng, though, using his [[reserve power]]s, refused the request, reminding King of their agreement made the previous October and arguing that the Conservatives, as the biggest single party in parliament, should have a chance to form a government before an election was called. For the next two days, the Prime Minister and the Governor General discussed the matter, with Byng asking King not to request a dissolution which he could not give and King twice requesting that Byng consult the British government prior to making any decision. Byng again refused, saying the matter should be settled in Canada, without resort to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams| 1992| pp=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Byng remaining steadfast, King then, on 28 June, formally presented the Governor General with an [[Order in Council]] for the dissolution of parliament, which Byng declined to sign, on the grounds that the House of Commons should first be given the opportunity to decide if it could support an alternate government.&lt;ref name=Forsey /&gt; Thus, believing that he no longer had enough support to stay in office, King resigned, as per convention that requires a prime minister who has lost the support of the House of Commons to either step down or advise the governor general to [[Dropping the writ|drop the writs]] for an election.{{Dubious|King's Resignation|date=November 2014}}

Byng then invited Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] to form a government. Although many Conservatives privately preferred an election, Meighen believed he was bound by honour and convention to accept Byng's invitation. Meighen thus formed a new Cabinet. At that time, convention dictated that the ministers of the Crown drawn from the House of Commons were obliged upon appointment to resign their seats in parliament and [[Ministerial by-election|run for re-election]]. This posed a problem for Meighen: his and the other ministers' temporary absence would make the government extremely vulnerable in the event of a vote of non-confidence. Meighen circumvented this by advising the appointment to Cabinet of [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]], who were not required to run for re-election. The Liberals were infuriated over this usage of "acting ministers" and were able to get the Progressives to join them in a successful drive to bring down the Conservative minority government,&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite book| last=Levine| first=Allan| title=King: William Lyon Mackenzie King: A Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny| year=2011| publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre| location=Vancouver| isbn=978-1-55365-560-2|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government losing confidence by only one vote.

Meighen subsequently requested a dissolution of parliament, which was granted by Byng, and [[Canadian federal election, 1926|an election]] was called. King's Liberals won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, while Meighen lost his seat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Compilations/ElectionsandRidings/ResultsParty.aspx?Season=0&amp;Parliament=208ab68e-34ac-423b-abb9-1723ff5a6a2c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Upon returning to power,  King's government sought at an imperial conference to redefine the role of the governor general as a personal representative of the sovereign in his Canadian council and not of the British government (the king in his British council). The change was agreed to at the Imperial Conference of 1926 and came to be official as a result of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] and [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].

In a letter to the Dominion's monarch, King [[George V]], whom he represented in Canada as governor general, Byng expressed surprise that the Liberal leader, a staunch [[nationalist]], had requested that Byng consult the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]] in London over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hubbard| first=R.H.| title=Rideau Hall| publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=1977| location=Montreal and London| page=158| isbn=978-0-7735-0310-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byng said: "I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Nicolson| first=Harold| authorlink=Harold Nicolson| title=King George the Fifth, His Life and Reign| publisher=Constable &amp; Co. Ltd| year=1952| location=London| pages=475–477| isbn=978-0-09-453181-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Secretary, [[Leo Amery]], privately informed Byng that had he appealed to the British government for an answer, "I could only have replied... that in my view it would not be proper for the Secretary of State to issue instructions to the Governor with regard to the exercise of his constitutional duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams| 1992| p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byng returned to the United Kingdom, leaving Canada on 30 September 1926 a much respected man, despite the political crisis. Some authorities have held that Byng was constitutionally obligated to refuse King's request; for example, [[Eugene Forsey]] argued that King's advice to Byng was "utterly unprecedented" and said further: "It was tantamount to allowing a prisoner to discharge the jury by which he was being tried.... If the Governor-General had granted the request, he would have become an accomplice in a flagrant act of contempt for Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Forsey| first=Eugene| author-link=Eugene Forsey| publication-date=1 October 2010| editor-last=Forsey| editor-first=Helen| | title=As David Johnson Enters Rideau Hall...| periodical=The Monitor| publication-place=Ottawa| publisher=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives| url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/david-johnson-enters-rideau-hall| accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively brief time that King had served in office prior to seeking a dissolution has also been cited as a reason for denying his request. In the United Kingdom in 1950, the [[Lascelles Principles]] expressed the relevant constitutional conventions in the matter, in which the King-Byng controversy served as one of the underlying precedents.

Other authorities agreed with King, since, by custom, the Lord Byng of Vimy was obligated to heed the Prime Minister's request to call the election.{{Citation needed| date=February 2011}} In 1997, then [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] [[Michael Hardie Boys|Sir Michael Hardie Boys]] expressed the opinion that Byng had been in error in not re-appointing King as prime minister and then granting the dissolution of parliament to King instead of Meighen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Boys| first=Michael Hardie| author-link=Michael Hardie Boys| date=10 September 1997| title=Public Law Class at College House Christchurch| editor-last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| editor-link=Governor-General of New Zealand| place=Christchurch| publication-place=Wellington| publisher=Queen's Printer for New Zealand| url=https://www.gg.govt.nz/node/562| accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King–Byng Affair was the most controversial use of a governor general's reserve powers until the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]], in which the [[Governor-General of Australia]], [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|Sir John Kerr]], dismissed [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]].

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Limitations and exceptions to copyright''' are provisions, in local [[copyright law]] or [[Berne Convention]], which allow for copyrighted works to be used without a license from the copyright owner.

Limitations and exceptions to copyright relate to a number of important considerations such as [[market failure]], [[freedom of speech]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Bernt Hugenholtz. ''Copyright And Freedom Of Expression In Europe'' (2001) Published in: [[Rochelle C. Dreyfuss|Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss]], Harry First and Diane Leenheer Zimmerman (eds.), ''Expanding the Boundaries of Intellectual Property'',  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; education and equality of access (such as by the visually impaired). Some view limitations and exceptions as "user rights"—seeing user rights as providing an essential balance to the rights of the copyright owners. There is no consensus among copyright experts as to whether user rights are rights or simply limitations on copyright. See for example the National Research Council's [http://books.nap.edu/html/digital_dilemma/exec_summ.html#REF1 Digital Agenda Report, note 1]. The concept of user rights has also been recognised by courts, including the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in [http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2125/index.do CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada] (2004 SCC 13), which classed "fair dealing" as such a user right. These kinds of disagreements in philosophy are quite common in the [[philosophy of copyright]], where debates about jurisprudential reasoning tend to act as proxies for more substantial disagreements about good policy.

==Changing technology==

The scope of copyright limitations and exceptions became a subject of societal and political debate within various nations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to the impact of digital technology, the changes in national copyright legislations for compliance with [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]], and the enactment of [[anti-circumvention rules]] in response to the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12101.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911023036/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc10%2FEDOC12101.htm |date=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European People's Party]] concluded that international instruments for the protection of copyright no longer seem capable of guaranteeing creators and investors a fair return on their activities while ensuring the public’s access to information and respect for privacy.

Defenders of copyright exceptions fear that technology, contract law undermining copyright law and copyright law not being amended, is reducing the scope of important exceptions and therefore harming creativity.

In May 2010 a declaration entitled [[Copyright for Creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright4creativity.eu/bin/view/Main/PressRelease05May2010 Copyright for Creativity.Broad coalition calls for European copyright to support digital creativity and innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110706012409/http://www.copyright4creativity.eu/bin/view/Main/PressRelease05May2010 |date=6 July 2011 }} 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, stating: "While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the [[knowledge economy]], copyright’s exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment." This ad-hoc coalition is being registered at the official EU Transparency Register in the section In-house lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=342464912839-08&amp;locale=en#en |title = EU Transparency Register - Display Lobbyist |publisher=European Union |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinator of this project runs a Brussels-based public affairs &amp; government relations firm specialised in the online environment, that mainly mentions ''Industry'' (a.o.

De Cock |accessdate = 25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition law / anti-trust law==
Copyright is typically thought of as a limited, legally sanctioned [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name="WIPO p7"&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | pages = 7 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =978-92-805-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, copyright licensing may sometimes interfere too much in free and competitive markets.&lt;ref name="Port"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Licensing Intellectual Property in the Information Age | author=Kenneth L. Port | publisher=Carolina Academic Press | edition=2nd | year=2005 | pages=425–566 | isbn=0-89089-890-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are governed by legal doctrines such as [[competition law]] in the [[European Union]], [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust law]] in the [[United States]], and anti-monopoly law in [[Russian competition law|Russia]] and [[Japanese competition law|Japan]].&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt; Competition issues may arise when the licensing party unfairly leverages market power, engages in [[price discrimination]] through its licensing terms, or otherwise uses a licensing agreement in a discriminatory or unfair manner.&lt;ref name="WIPO p7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt; Attempts to extend the [[copyright term]] granted by law &amp;ndash; for example, by collecting [[royalties]] for use of the work after its copyright term has expired and it has passed into the [[public domain]] &amp;ndash; raise such competition concerns.&lt;ref name="WIPO p7"/&gt;

In April 1995, the US published "Antitrust Guidelines for the licensing of Intellectual Property" which apply to [[patents]], copyright, and [[trade secrets]]. In January 1996, the [[European Union]] published Commission Regulation No. 240/96 which applies to patents, copyright, and other intellectual property rights, especially regarding licenses. The guidelines apply ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' to the extent possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | pages = 78 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =978-92-805-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interplay of copyright law and competition law is increasingly important in the digital world, as most countries' laws allow private contracts to over-ride copyright law. Given that copyright law creates a legally sanctioned [[monopoly]], balanced by "limitations and exceptions" that allow access without the permission of the copyright holder the over-riding of copyright law by private contracts can create monopoly activity. Well known limitations and exceptions include [[fair dealing]] in the [[UK]] and [[Canada]], as well as the [[fair use]] doctrine in the US. The undermining of copyright law, and in particular limitations and exceptions to copyright by [[contract law]] is an issue frequently raised by libraries, and library groups such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]]. As a result of this, this issue is increasingly being looked at and discussed at a national governmental level e.g. UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-ipresearch.htm?sabip=/contractlaw-workshop.pdf|date=October 2010|title=The Relationship Between Copyright Law and Contract Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as international level such as [[WIPO]] – as part of the Development Agenda.

==International legal instruments==
Limitations and exceptions are also the subject of significant regulation by global treaties. These treaties have [[harmonization|harmonized]] the exclusive rights which must be provided by copyright laws, and the [[Berne three-step test]] operates to constrain the kinds of copyright exceptions and limitations which individual nations can enact.

On the other hand, there are very few requirements in international copyright treaties placed on national governments to provide any exemptions from exclusive rights. One such case is Article 10(1) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which guarantees a limited right to make quotations from copyrighted works.

Because of the lack of balance in international treaties in October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a significant proposal offered by [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], the "Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO" also known simply as the "Development Agenda" - from the [[Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html Consumer Project on Technology web site, ''Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization'']&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was well supported by developing countries. A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ Consumer Project on Technology web site, ''Access to Knowledge (A2K)]&lt;/ref&gt; or A2K, Treaty which they would like to see introduced.

==National laws==
Two important examples of limitations and exceptions to copyright are the [[fair use]] doctrine found in the United States, and the [[fair dealing]] doctrine found in many other [[common law]] countries. Other more fundamental boundaries of copyright are caused by [[threshold of originality|thresholds of originality]], a threshold below which objects cease to be copyrightable, the [[Idea-expression divide|idea-expression dichotomy]], the [[public domain]] and the effect of [[Crown copyright]]. Even copyright maximalists might interpret these as ''defining'' copyright, rather than being "limitations" or "exceptions" to it. In addition copyright can only protect the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/~itconf/proceed03/98.html The Wrinkle in Your Research and Teaching: Copyright, DMCA, Guidelines, and Public Domain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918060155/http://www.mtsu.edu/~itconf/proceed03/98.html |date=18 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the U.S. courts have determined that [[stock character]]s are also uncopyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', [[Case citation|45 F.2d 119]] ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fighter's History|Capcom U.S.A. Inc. v. Data East Corp.]]''
1994 WL 1751482 (N.D. Cal. 1994). [http://www.patentarcade.com/2005/08/case-capcom-v-data-east-nd-cal-1994-c.html Analysis at Patent Arcade] accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[fair use]] in the United States is popularly understood as the only limitation to an author's exclusive rights, it is only one of several important limitations. Section 106 of the U.S. copyright law, which defines [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106 the exclusive rights in copyrighted works], is subject to [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107 sections 107 through 122], which limit the copyright holder's exclusive rights.

In the U.S. in stark contrast to those copyright laws which have developed from [[English law]], [[edict of government|edicts of government]] are not subject to copyright, including edicts of foreign governments.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Maldives]] on 18 August 2007 to decide on whether the country should have a [[presidential system]] or a [[parliamentary system]]. [[President of the Maldives]] [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] supported a presidential system while the opposition [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] favored a parliamentary system.&lt;ref name=Nessman&gt;Ravi Nessman, [http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/08/19/905722-maldives-backs-president-in-referendum "Maldives Backs President in Referendum"], Associated Press (Newsvine), August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official results showed the presidential system winning over 60% support. Gayoom called the result a "massive endorsement" and confirmed that he would be a candidate in the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. The opposition alleged that the referendum was rigged.&lt;ref name=Nessman/&gt;

The [[National Credit Union Administration]] (NCUA) is an autonomous agency of the United States federal government, and is responsible for regulating and insuring all federally insured credit unions in the [[United States]].

The NCUA's plan calls for all federally insured natural-person [[credit union]]s in the U.S. to pay an increased insurance premium to the [[National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund]] (NCUSIF) in 2009 to make up for the investment losses at U.S. Central, to which the NCUSIF has written a $1 billion capital note.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe [http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/02/13/paying_a_giants_price/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed6 Paying a Giant's Price], February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, NCUA has provided no assurances that the capital losses of the corporate credit unions to be covered through the planned assessment in 2009 will be adequate to cover eventual bad debt losses.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the unrecognised [[Republic of Artsakh|Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] on 20 February 2017. At least 25% of registered voters needed to vote in favour in order to validate the result. The referendum passed with about three quarters of voters voting.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=az012017 Nagorno-Karabakh (Azerbaijan), 20 February 2017: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
President [[Bako Sahakyan]] created a commission to draft a new constitution to replace the [[Constitution of Nagorno-Karabakh|2006 constitution]]. The draft was delivered on 24 November 2016 and approved by the [[National Assembly (Nagorno-Karabakh Republic)|National Assembly]] on 17 January by a vote of 20–7.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; On 19 January, Sahakyan set the referendum date.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Constitutional changes==
The constitutional changes would result in the name "Artsakh Republic" being officially adopted for the unrecognised country and used alongside its current name, as well as in abolishing the office of the [[Prime Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Prime Minister]] and giving more power to the [[President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|President]] to make quicker decisions on security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://euobserver.com/foreign/136961 Referendum to create 'Republic of Artsakh' on Europe's fringe] EU Observer, 20 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Levon Galustyan, an MP from the unrecognised country of [[Abkhazia]] and an observer at the referendum, said the idea for a name change was brought forward after Nagorno-Karabakh politicians had expressed worry that the use of the name "Artsakh" and "Nagorno-Karabakh" by Azerbaijan for its athletic teams and artistic initiatives abroad might create the wrong impression of the region's reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sputnik-abkhazia.ru/press_center/20170223/1020477493/galistian-ideia-pereimenovania-abhazii-v-apsni-mne-simpatichna.html Галустян: идея переименования Абхазии в Апсны мне симпатична] Sputnik, 23 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The government of [[Azerbaijan]], which Nagorno-Karabakh is officially part of but which lost ''de facto'' control of the region following the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], condemned the referendum calling it a "provocation" and counter-productive for the conflict resolution process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/nagorno_karabakh/referendum-in-occupied-azerbaijan-lands-another-provocation-of-yerevan.html “Referendum” in occupied Azerbaijan lands – another provocation of Yerevan] Azerbaijan Press Agency, 17 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The government also issued an international arrest warrant for three [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] who acted as observers at the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguemonitor.com/2017/02/24/mep-%C5%A1t%C4%9Btina-faces-azeri-arrest-warrant MEP Štětina faces Azeri arrest warrant] Prague Daily Monitor, 24 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSCE Minsk Group]], the official mediator of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, stated that the results of the referendum would not change the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/mg/300591 Statement by the Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group] OCSE, 17 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of several countries stated that they did not recognise the referendum, including [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/German-Foreign-Ministry-to-Vestnik-Kavkaza-German-government-does-not-recognize-referendum-in-Nagorno-Karabakh.html German Foreign Ministry to Vestnik Kavkaza: German government does not recognize 'referendum' in Nagorno-Karabakh] Vestnik Kavkaza, 23 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=29871 Tbilisi Does not Recognize Nagorno-Karabakh Referendum] Civil, 21 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/404926.html Ukraine considers so-called referendum in Nagorno-Karabakh illegitimate] Interfax, 22 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.crimea.ua/2017/02/18/turciya-ne-priznaet-referendum-v-nagornom-karabaxe-mid/ Турция не признает «референдум» в Нагорном Карабахе — МИД] KP, 18 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Truck regulation.jpg|thumb|OSM employee inspecting a mine]] --&gt;

The '''Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement''' (OSMRE) is a branch of the [[United States Department of the Interior]].  It is the federal agency entrusted with the implementation and enforcement of the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]] (SMCRA), which attached a per-ton fee to all extracted coal in order to fund an interest-accruing trust to be used for reclamation of abandoned mine lands,&lt;ref name="GIS Mine Post"&gt;[http://www.esri.com/library/newsletters/gis-mine-post/spring2009.pdf:2009-03-03:2570kb] GIS Mine Post, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as well as established a set environmental standards that mines must follow while operating, and achieve when reclaiming mined land, in order to minimize environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernhard|first=Karrie|title=Surface Mining Law|url=http://www.osmre.gov/topic/smcra/smcra.shtm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSMRE has about 500 employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Annual Report|url=http://www.osmre.gov/Reports/AnnualReport/2008/FY08.shtm|publisher=Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who work in either the national office in [[Washington, DC]], or of the many regional and field offices([http://www.arcc.osmre.gov/OSMregions.shtm OSM's Three Regions]).

OSM has three main functions:
* Regulating active mines
* Reclaiming lands damaged by surface mining and [[abandoned mine]]s
* Providing resources for technical assistance, training, and technology development [http://%5Bhttp://www.osmre.gov/science/Science.shtm%5D]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

==Regional structure==
The OSM operates 3 regional offices:

The Appalachian region covers 12 states and is headquartered in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcc.osmre.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 1, 1980, this office relocated into 10 Parkway West.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=okocAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A2AEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4389%2C856981&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western division covers 9 states and is headquartered in [[Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrcc.osmre.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mid-Continent division covers 11 states and is headquartered in [[Alton, Illinois]].

==Regulating Active Mines==
The Office of Surface Mining is responsible for the enforcement of the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]]; this includes setting regulatory guidelines. The actual regulation of mines is primarily done on a [[state government|state]] level and [[tribal government|tribal]] level, but OSM is charged with inspection of the state programs to meet the standard of quality. OSM regularly inspects state programs to make sure they are meeting the required standards; if they do not meet the required standards the OSM can take over. For example, when in the fiscal year of 2003 [[Missouri]] was unable to meet the federal requirements due to a lack of funding, OSM stepped in to assume partial control of the state program.

OSM took control of the following in Missouri:
* Training, examination, and certification of blasters
* Areas unsuitable for mining
* Small Operator Assistance
OSM continued to run the above parts of Missouri's mining program until Missouri improved its program, which took place on Feb. 1, 2006. Missouri now receives federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Land Reclamation Program| work = Protecting Missouri's Natural Resources| publisher = Missouri Department of Natural Resources  | date = January 2007| url = http://www.dnr.mo.gov/env/pmnr/pmnr07-01.htm| doi = | accessdate = 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclaiming abandoned mine lands==
'''Abandoned mine lands''' are lands and waters adversely impacted by inadequately reclaimed surface coal mining operations on lands that were not subject to the reclamation requirements of the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977|Surface Mining Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of Surface Mining [http://www.osmre.gov/topic/SMCRA/SMCRA.shtm "Surface Mining Law"]&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental problems associated with abandoned mine lands include surface and ground water pollution, entrances to open mines, water-filled pits, unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed refuse piles and minesites (including some with dangerous highwalls), sediment-clogged streams, damage from landslides, and fumes and surface instability resulting from [[coal seam fire|mine fires]] and burning coal refuse. Environmental restoration activities under the abandoned mine reclamation program correct or mitigate these problems.

===Initiatives===
The '''[http://www.coalcountryteam.org/ Appalachian Coal Country Team]''' was founded in response to requests from watershed groups throughout coal country. The Coal Country Team arms community organizations and watershed-based projects with the training, tools, and volunteer support necessary to help local citizens become effective environmental stewards, community leaders, and accelerators of change in places indelibly marked by the environmental legacy of pre-regulatory coal mining.

OSM's '''[http://www.mcrcc.osmre.gov/bats/ Bat conservation project]''' was begun December 15, 1998, when OSM signed a [[memorandum of understanding|MOU]] with Bat Conservation International, Inc. in order to establish a framework for cooperative efforts between the two organizations to maintain and increase the conservation of bats and their habitats. Under this agreement, OSM would (1) Consider the conservation of bats and their habitats in the development and implementation of abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation standards and recommendations to States and Indian Tribes; (2) Provide assistance in the development of AML programs to help manage bats and their habitats; (3) For Federal Programs, monitor non-emergency AML shaft and portal areas for bat activity prior to reclamation; (4) As appropriate, require the use of bat gates to seal the shafts of portals where bat habitation is known and would be endangered if sealed otherwise. OSM will encourage the States and Tribes to do the same; and (5) Promote the education of OSM staff, State agencies, and Indian Tribes as to: the beneficial aspects of conserving bats, tested methods to safeguard bat habitat and public health, and ways to mitigate for loss of bat roosts and habitat.

==Related legislation==
*[[Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America (H.R. 2824; 113th Congress)]] is a bill that, if passed, would amend the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]] to require state programs for regulation of [[Surface mining|surface coal mining]] to incorporate the necessary rule concerning excess spoil, coal mine waste, and buffers for perennial and intermittent streams published by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement on December 12, 2008.&lt;ref name=2824sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2824 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2824|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also would require OSM to assess the effectiveness of that rule after five years of implementation and to report its findings to the Congress. Finally, the bill would prevent OSM from issuing a new rule regarding stream buffer zones until the agency completes the report required under the bill.&lt;ref name=cbo2824&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2824|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45038|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7333">{{Party politics}}

A political '''party platform''' or '''program''' is a formal set of principal goals which are supported by a [[Party platform|political party]] or individual [[candidate]], in order to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public's support and votes about complicated topics or issues. "Plank" is the term often given to the components of the political platform – the opinions and viewpoints about individual topics, as held by a party, person, or organization.  The word "plank" depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] made out of boards or [[Plank (wood)|planks of wood]].  The metaphor can return to its literal origin when [[public speaking]] or [[debates]] are actually held upon a physical platform.

A party platform is sometimes referred to as a [[manifesto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto|title= Manifesto|publisher= Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a political platform. Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Robert|last2=Royed|first2=Terry|last3=Naurin|first3=Elin|last4=Artés|first4=Joaquín|last5=Costello|first5=Rory|last6=Ennser-Jedenastik|first6=Laurenz|last7=Ferguson|first7=Mark|last8=Kostadinova|first8=Petia|last9=Moury|first9=Catherine|date=2017-07-01|title=The Fulfillment of Parties’ Election Pledges: A Comparative Study on the Impact of Power Sharing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12313/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=527–542|doi=10.1111/ajps.12313|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The first known use of the word platform was in 1535. The word platform comes from [[Middle French]] ''plate-forme'', literally meaning "flat form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platform|title= Platform|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political meaning of the word to reflect "statement of party politics" is from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/platform|title= Platform|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fulfilling platforms==
A 2017 study in the ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'' found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) found that political parties in government fulfill their [[election promise]]s to voters to a considerable extent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study determined that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican [[Member of Congress|congresspeople]] voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/12/12060358/political-science-of-platforms|title=We asked 8 political scientists if party platforms matter.

The '''Privacy Act''' ({{lang-fr|Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels}}) is Canadian federal legislation that came into effect on July 1, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://privcom.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_15_e.asp|title=Privacy Legislation in Canada|accessdate=2006-08-16}} or [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103035930/http://privcom.gc.ca/fs-fi/02_05_d_15_e.asp backup at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The act sets out rules for how institutions of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] must deal with [[data privacy|personal information of individuals]]. Some salient provisions of the legislation are as follows:

* A government institution may not collect personal information unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution (section 4).
* With some exceptions, when a government institution collects an individual's personal information from the individual, it must inform the individual of the purpose for which the information is being collected (section 5(2)).
* With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may be used only for the purpose for which the information was obtained or for a use consistent with that purpose, unless the individual consents (section 7).
* With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may not be disclosed, unless the individual consents (section 8).
* Every [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizen]] or [[permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]] has the right to be given access to personal information about the individual under the control of a government institution that is reasonably retrievable by the government institution, and request correction if the information is inaccurate (section 12).
* The [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]] receives and investigates complaints, including complaints that an individual was denied access to his or her personal information held by a government institution (section 29).

==Case law==
An individual who has been refused access to personal information may ultimately apply to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] for a review of the matter, pursuant to section 41 of the Act. The Court may order the head of the government institution to disclose the information to the individual (sections 48 and 49). Decisions of the Federal Court on such matters may be appealed to the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and, if leave is granted, further appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. Some important court decision concerning the Privacy Act are:

* ''[[Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police)]]'', 2003 SCC 8 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110222145858/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2003/2003scc8/2003scc8.html] (considering the definition of "personal information" in section 3 of the Privacy Act)
* ''[[Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General)]]'', 2002 SCC 75 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080220215137/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc75/2002scc75.html] (holding that section 51(2)(a) of the Privacy Act is unconstitutional because it requires that the entire hearing of certain applications to Federal Court be held ''[[in camera]]'')
* ''[[Lavigne v. Canada (Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages)]]'', 2002 SCC 53 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110226140454/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2002/2002scc53/2002scc53.html] (holding that the Privacy Act is 'quasi-constitutional' legislation, and considering section 22(1)(b), the exemption for information the disclosure of which could be injurious to the conduct of lawful investigations)
* ''[[Privacy Act (Can.) (Re)]]'', 2001 SCC 89 [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002025532/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2001/2001scc89/2001scc89.html] (holding that the Privacy Act was not violated by a program whereby [[Canada Customs]] gave information about travellers to the [[unemployment benefit#Canada|Canada Employment Insurance Commission]], to identify those who received employment insurance benefits while outside Canada)
* ''[[Dagg v. Canada (Minister of Finance)]]'', [1997] 2 S.C.R. 403 [https://web.archive.org/web/20071017155430/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1997/1997rcs2-403/1997rcs2-403.html] (the first major Supreme Court of Canada decision to consider the Privacy Act)

In the [[legislative process]], a '''public bill''' is a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] which proposes a [[law]] of general application throughout the [[jurisdiction]] in which it is proposed, and which if enacted will hence become a [[Act of Congress|public law or public act]].

The term "public bill" differentiates such a bill from a [[private bill]], which is a legislative bill affecting only a single person, group, or area, such as a bill granting a named person [[citizenship]] or, previously, granting named persons a legislative [[divorce]].

In practice, a (technically) public act can have the effect of a private act by the addition of restrictions such as limiting the act's effect to areas falling within a certain population bracket.

==In the United Kingdom==
Public bills are the most common bills introduced in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. If they are enacted, they become [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Public General Acts|Public General Acts]] (in contrast with [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Local and Personal Acts]]).

== See also ==
* [[Private member's bill]] &lt;!--THIS BELONGS THERE. A VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPT. Bills can be proposed in either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or the House of Lords by any member of that House. However, although backbench members can introduce public bills, the vast majority of legislative time in the House of Commons is allocated to public bills introduced by the government.--&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13503">'''Public budgeting''' is a field of [[public administration]] and a discipline in the academic study thereof.  Budgeting is characterized by its approaches, functions, formation, and type.

Authors Robert W. Smith and Thomas D. Lynch describe public budgeting through four perspectives. The politician sees the budget process as "a political event conducted in the political arena for political advantage".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert W. and Thomas D. Lynch. (2004) ''Public Budgeting in America''. 5th Edition. Pearson; Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The economist views budgeting as a matter of allocating resources in terms of opportunity cost where allocating resources to one consumer takes resources away from another consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert W. and Thomas D. Lynch. (2004) Public Budgeting in America. 5th Edition. Pearson;Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the economist, therefore, is to provide decision makers with the best possible information.  The accountant perspective focuses on the accountability value in budgeting which analyzes the amount budgeted to the actual expenditures thereby describing the "wisdom of the original policy".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert W. and Thomas D. Lynch. (2004) Public Budgeting in America. 5th Edition. Pearson;Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Lynch's public manager's perspective on a budget is a policy tool to describe the implementation of public policy.  Further, they develop an operational definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A "budget" is a ''plan'' for the accomplishment of ''programs'' related to ''objectives'' and ''goals'' within a definite ''time'' period, including an estimate of ''resources required'', together with an estimate of ''resources available'', usually compared with one or more ''past periods'' and ''showing future requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert W. and Thomas D. Lynch. (2004) Public Budgeting in America. 5th Edition. Pearson;Upper Saddle River, New Jersery. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Leading definitions==
* '''Practical:''' "A plan for financing an enterprise or government during a definite period, which is prepared and submitted by a responsible executive to a representative body (or other duly constituted agent) whose approval and authorization are necessary before the plan may be executed." ~[[Frederick A. Cleveland]]  &lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, Frederick A.(1915)"Evolution of the Budget Idea in the United States". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. 16
-35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Theoretical:''' The leading question: "On what basis shall it be decided to allocate ''x'' dollars to activity A instead of activity B?" ~V. O. Key Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Key Jr., V. O.(1940)''American Political Science Review'' 34. 1137-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leading theorists and contributions==
* '''Frederick Cleveland''': constructed a practical definition of budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, Frederick A.(1915)"Evolution of the Budget Idea in the United States". ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science''. 15-35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[William F. Willoughby]]''': describes the purpose of a budget document.&lt;ref&gt;Willoughby, William F. (1918) "The Movement for Budgetary Reform in the States". ''D. Appleton and Company for the Institute for Government Research''. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[V. O. Key, Jr.]]''': sparked the normative question regarding how scarce resources ought to be distributed to unlimited demands.&lt;ref&gt;Key Jr., V. O. (December 1940) ''American Political Science Review'' 34. 1137-40&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Verne B. Lewis''': argued for a budgeting theory based on economic values; strongly contributing to the study of public finance.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Verne E. (Winter 1952) ''Public Administration Review'' 12.1. 43-54&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Richard A. Musgrave]]''': the Father of Public Finance; identified the three roles of government in the economy: allocation of resources, distribution of goods and services, and economy stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Mary Williams. "Richard A. Musgrave, 96, Theoretician of Public Finance, Dies". January 20, 2007. New York Times: Business.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Aaron Wildavsky]]''':suggested that budgetary decision making is largely political, rather than based on economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Wildavsky, Aaron. (Autumn 1961) ''Public Administration Review'' 21. 183-190.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Allen Schick]]''': outlined the three functions of budgeting:
# Strategic Planning; deciding on the goals and objectives of an organization.
# Management Control; management's process of assuring effective and efficient accomplishment of goals and objectives laid out via ''strategic planning''.
# Operational Control; focused on proper execution of specific tasks that provide the most efficient and effective means of meeting the goals and objectives ordered by ''management control''.&lt;ref&gt;Schick, Allen. (December 1966) ''Public Administration Review'' 26. 243-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Irene S. Rubin''': facilitated the discussion of the dichotomy between theory and practice of public budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Irene S. (1990) "Budget Theory and Budget Practice: How Good the Fit?" ''Public Administration Review'' March/April 1990. 179-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Irene S. (1997) The Politics of Public Budgeting: Getting and Spending, Borrowing and Balancing. Third Edition, Chatham House Publishers: Chatham, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to budgeting==
A brief note on [[Systems Theory]] applied to Political Science: Inputs enter the governmental system that produces outputs which—in turn—are related to outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Easton&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of inputs to outputs is a measure of efficiency as the measurement of contributing inputs to impacting outcomes is a measure of efficacy.
* '''Line Item Budgeting''' is arguably the simplest form of budgeting, this approach links the inputs of the system to the system. These budgets typically appear in the form of accounting documents that express minimal information regarding purpose or an explicit object within the system.
* '''Program Budgeting''' takes a normative approach to budgeting in that decision making—allocating resources—is determined by the funding of one program instead of another based on what that program offers. This approach quickly lends itself to the PPBS budgeting approach.
* '''PPBS Budgeting''' or—Program Planning Budgeting System—is the link between the line-item and program budgets and the more complex performance budget. As opposed to the more simple program budget, this decision making tool links the program under consideration to the ways and means of facilitating the program. This is meant to serve as a long-term planning tool so that decision makers are made aware of the future implications of their actions. These are typically most useful in capital projects. The planning portion of the approach seeks to link goals to objects or expected outcomes from specific outputs, which are then sorted into programs that convert inputs to outputs; finally, the budgeting of PPBS helps determine how to fund the program. A leader in the promotion of PPBS was Robert McNamara's use in the United States Government's Department of Defense in the 1960s.
* '''[[Performance Based Budgeting]]''' attempts to solve decision making problems based on a programs ability to convert inputs to outputs and/or use inputs to affect certain outcomes. whatever Performance may be judged by a certain program's ability to meet certain objectives that contribute to a more abstract goal as calculated by that program's ability to use resources (or inputs) efficiently—by linking inputs to outputs—and/or effectively—by linking inputs to outcomes. A decision making—or allocation of scarce resources—problem is solved by determining which project maximizes efficiency and efficacy.
* '''[[Zero-based budgeting]]''' is a response to an incremental decision making process whereby the budget of a given fiscal year (FY) is largely decided upon by the existing budget of FY-1. In contrast to [[incrementalism]], the allocation of scarce resources—funding—is determined from a zero-sum accounting method. In government, each function of a department's section proposes certain objectives that relate to some goal the section could achieve if allocated ''x'' dollars.
* '''Flexible Freeze''' is a budgeting approach pioneered by President George H. W. Bush as a means to cut government spending. Under this approach, certain programs would be affected by changes in population growth and inflation.
* '''[[Program Assessment Rating Tool]] (P.A.R.T.)''' is an instrument developed by the United States OMB to measure and assess the effectiveness of federal programs that review the program’s purpose and design, strategic planning, program management, and program results and accountability. The scores are rated from effective (ranging between 85 and 100 points), moderately affective (70-84 points), adequate (50-69 points), and ineffective (0-49 points).
* '''Priority Based Budgeting''' is a response to poor economic conditions.  As opposed to incremental budgeting, where resource allocation is determined based on marginal shifts in costs, priority based budgeting fixes the amount of governmental resources and then allocates resources across the various programs.  The programs receive their allocation based on their priority; priorities may include safe and secure communities, health, education, and community development among others.  Outcome assessment then determines the efficacy of the programs.  Although this approach is pro-democratic, critics suggest the administration of this process is extremely difficult.

==Functions of a budget document==
As a policy document, a government's budget is designed as a plan for implementing its policy.  Traditionally, budgets served as a more rigid tool to implement policy in a retrospective setting.  The functions associated with these values are listed under the Traditional Model and are control, management, and planning. The Modern Model, taking a less rigid approach, has replaced the control function with the monitoring function, the management function with the steering function, and the planning function with the strategic brokering function.

to the traditional control function, the monitoring function focuses on the ''consequences'' of expenditures.

'''Steering:''' as a response to the traditional management function, the steering function serves as a ''guide'' for managing.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strategic Brokering''' uses the budget document as a means of constantly looking for possible directions and reacting to the environment.

==Values in budgeting==
Three values are generally discussed in the literature of public budgeting: accountability, efficiency, and efficacy.

'''Accountability''' focuses on the inputs going into the system or program in action and is best characterized by the line-item budgeting approach.  It is best suited for the control and monitoring functions of a budget.

'''Efficiency''' focuses on the process of the system or program and its conversion of inputs (resources) into outputs (policy). Its focus on the process makes this value appropriate for performance budgets and most in-line with management and steering functions.

'''Efficacy''' focuses on outputs and outcomes, measuring the impact of policy.  This value follows both the program budget and PPBS budget approaches and coincides with the planning and strategic brokering functions.

==Six steps of the budgetary process; ''simplified''==
Typically, the budget cycles occurs in four phases.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert W. and Thomas D. Lynch. (2004) Public Budgeting in America. 5th Edition. Pearson;Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first requires policy planning and resource analysis and includes revenue estimation.  The second phase is referred to as policy formulation and includes the negotiation and planning of the budget formation.  The third phase is policy execution which follows budget adoption is budget execution—the implementation and revision of budgeted policy.  The fourth phase encompasses the entire budget process, but is considered its fourth phase.  This phase is auditing and evaluating the entire process and system.  See the associated points below:

* '''Revenue Estimation''' performed in the executive branch by the finance director, clerk's office, budget director, manager, or a team.
* '''Budget Call''' issued to outline the presentation form, recommend certain goals.
* '''Budget Formulation''' reflecting on the past, set goals for the future and reconcile the difference.
* '''Budget Hearings''' can include departments, sections, the executive, and the public to discuss changes in the budget.
* '''Budget Adoption''' final approval by the legislative body.
* '''Budget Execution''' amending the budget as the fiscal year progresses.

==Types of public budgets==
* '''[[Operating budget]]s''' are those documents that describe the expenditures and revenues during a given period for the functioning of an organization.
* '''[[Capital budgeting]]''' is the process of planning for future purchases above a certain cost threshold or extended life span. This budget is typically accompanied by a [[capital improvement plan]] that describes a timeline for acquisition and payment of debt.

The responding party is required to furnish copies of any documents that are responsive to the request, except for those that are legally [[privileged communication|privileged]]. The responding party also can submit a response to the requestor explaining why the documents cannot be produced. For example, the responding party may indicate that documents are unavailable because they have been destroyed, that it would be unduly burdensome to produce the documents, or that the documents are not in possession of the responding party. However, the requestor then may file a [[Motion to compel|Motion to Compel]] discovery to ask the court to order the responding party to produce documents.

{{Demographics and Culture of Hong Kong}}
The '''[[right of abode]]''' in '''Hong Kong''' is the right to legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or condition of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their right of abode in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]]. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. [[Hong Kong residents|Hong Kong Permanent Resident]] is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the ''[[de-facto]]'' citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport|HKSAR passport]], or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese citizens]].

==Rights==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The right of abode is enshrined in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], and is synonymous with the permanent resident status.

A Hong Kong permanent resident has the right
* to land in the HKSAR;
* to be free from any condition of stay (including a limit of stay) in the HKSAR;
* not to be deported from the HKSAR; and
* not to be removed from the HKSAR.

The term "right of abode" was first introduced into British law under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] as it specifically applied to the United Kingdom, while British dependent territories were governed under a similar concept of [[belonger status]]. The Hong Kong Immigration Ordinance was amended effective 1 July 1987 to rename "Hong Kong belonger" status to "Hong Kong permanent resident" status, with "Hong Kong permanent residents" defined as having the right of abode in Hong Kong.

==Colonial era==
During British administration prior to 1997, right of abode in Hong Kong was shaped by British nationality laws, and immigration policies since the 1950s. With the Handover imminent in 1997, the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] defined who may reside in Hong Kong once China assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong.

===British nationality===
[[File:HongKongRightofAbodePassport.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The interior page of a Hong Kong [[BDTC]] passport that has been issued by the [[British consulate]] in New York City to indicate that the bearer has the [[right of abode]] in Hong Kong.]]

{{See also|British nationality law and Hong Kong}}
Since Hong Kong was created a British colony in 1842, those who were born in the territory or become naturalised had British nationality. This included the right to enter and live in United Kingdom in addition to Hong Kong.

By the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the ''[[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]]'' and ''[[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]]''. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the British government tightened immigration control into the United Kingdom and Islands (the UK, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]). As such, British nationals connected to Hong Kong were subjected to immigration control since 1962 and no longer had the right of abode in the United Kingdom.

Until 1997, British nationality related closely with the permanent resident status which guaranteed right of abode. Hong Kong permanent residents had British nationality either by birth, naturalisation or by descent. The type of British citizenship connected to Hong Kong eventually evolved to become different from that of the United Kingdom. What has not changed is the definition that a Hong Kong permanent resident has the right of abode in Hong Kong.

===Immigration policies===
There was no immigration restriction into Hong Kong until 1950. People were free to travel across the Hong Kong-Chinese border. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Hong Kong government decided to close the border and implement immigration control in an attempt to stem waves of immigrants and refugees. The government also began to register Hong Kong residents to issue compulsory [[Hong Kong Identity Card|identity cards]]. The Hong Kong ID card is proof of legal residency still in use today.

Nevertheless, the immigration boom intensified throughout the 50s and 60s with the onset of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The government adopted the [[Touch Base Policy]] in 1974 and began repatriating immigrants intercepted at the border. The government had abolished the policy by 1980 and began repatriating all illegal immigrants once discovered.

Even though the PRC maintains ethnic Chinese of Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, Hong Kong residents were subjected to immigration controls when entering the PRC and had no right of abode in the mainland. There was also a quota for PRC residents to apply for a [[One-way Permit]] under special circumstances to immigrate to Hong Kong.

{{See also|Vietnamese people in Hong Kong}}
Many Vietnamese people sought refuge in Hong Kong as a result of war and persecution in Vietnam that began in the mid-1970s. Backed by a Hong Kong Government humanitarian policy, and under the auspices of the United Nations, some Vietnamese were permitted to settle in Hong Kong. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated. The illegal entry of Vietnamese refugees remained an issue for the Hong Kong government for 25 years. Finally in 2000, the government announced that it would widen the Local Resettlement Scheme for Vietnamese refugees and migrants, allowing the last remaining 1,400 refugees and migrants to settle in Hong Kong, granting them the right of abode.

===Sino-British Joint Declaration===
The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed on 19 December 1984 stated that the PRC would assume sovereignty over the entire ceded territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.

The terms "right of abode" first appeared in Annex I of the Declaration as the government of the People's Republic of China elaborated its basic policies regarding Hong Kong. Section XIV—concerning right of abode, travel, and immigration—stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following categories of persons shall have the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and, in accordance with the law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, be qualified to obtain permanent identity cards issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, which state their right of abode:

* all Chinese nationals who were born or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for a continuous period of 7 years or more, and persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of such Chinese nationals;
* all other persons who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for a continuous period of 7 years or more and who have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and persons under 21 years of age who were born of such persons in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
* any other persons who had the right of abode only in Hong Kong before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Basic Law===
Drafted in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] was adopted on 4 April 1990 by the Seventh [[National People's Congress]] of the People's Republic of China, and went into effect on 1 July 1997.

Certain classes of people hold Hong Kong Permanent Resident status, and hence the right of abode, by virtue of Article 24 of the Basic law. (Others may have the right of abode by statute&lt;ref&gt;Transitional provisions in the Immigration Ordinance (Cap 115) give rights to certain other people who would not otherwise have it: Schedule 1(6) preserves the right of abode for many pre-handover permanent residents; and Section 2AAA gives those who lost permanent resident status on or after handover the right to land (including the right to live, work and study without restriction). This applies to many who have never lived in or even visited Hong Kong, for instance pre-handover British Dependent Territories Citizens by descent.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sm128c.com/hk/ A guide to the Right of Abode in Hong Kong], with scanned letters from the HK Immigration Department&lt;/ref&gt;). The Article lists the following classes:

# [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese citizens]] born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]];
# Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
# Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2);
# Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
# Persons under 21 years of age born in Hong Kong of those residents listed in category (4) before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; and
# Persons other than those residents listed in categories (1) to (5), who, before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, had the right of abode in Hong Kong only.

On the other hand, Article 22 states that for the purpose of entry into Hong Kong, people from other parts of China must apply for approval. Among them, the number of persons who enter the Region for the purpose of settlement shall be determined by the authorities of the [[Central People's Government]] after consulting the [[Hong Kong government]].

Under the Immigration Ordinance, a Chinese national applying for permanent residence and the right of abode under (2) above may qualify on the basis of any seven-year period in Hong Kong, while a non-Chinese national applying under (4) may only qualify on the basis of seven years immediately preceding the application. The latter requirement was challenged in ''[[Fateh Muhammad v. Commissioner of Registration]]'' as discriminatory and inconsistent with the Basic Law, but was upheld in the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="BLB"&gt;{{citation|title=Judgment Update: Fateh Muhammad v Commissioner of Registration &amp; The Registration of Persons Tribunal|journal=Basic Law Bulletin|issue=2|year=2001|pages=21–23|url=http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic2-24.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Hong Kong Lawyer|date=December 2004|first=Anthony M.

== After the Handover ==
The Hong Kong Basic Law came into effect on 1 July 1997, along with the right of abode eligibility defined therein. Most Hong Kong residents became solely Chinese citizens on 1 July 1997 and continued to maintain their right of abode in Hong Kong held before the Handover. Non-Chinese citizens with Hong Kong right of abode maintained their original citizenship unless they successfully naturalised as Chinese citizens.

==Controversies==

===The debate in 1999 ===
The issue of who has the right of abode in Hong Kong prompted a fierce debate at the end of the 20th century and tested the "[[one country, two systems]]" policy towards Hong Kong of the People's Republic of China. On 29 January 1999, the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal]] ruled in ''Ng Ka Ling'' and ''Chan Kam Nga'' that children of permanent residents had the right of abode, including children born in mainland China and children whose parents had not been [[Permanent residents of Hong Kong|permanent residents]] at the time of the child's birth. These decisions would have granted immediate right of abode to up to 300,000 people in [[mainland China]], depending upon whether [[family unification]] would have been limited to children under a certain age, or extended to all people.

Many political commentators claimed that Hong Kong would experience a surge in people claiming the right of abode from mainland China, possibly disrupting the [[economy of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This move sparked large protests and debate over whether or not [[Judiciary of Hong Kong|the judiciary of Hong Kong]] remained independent from the government of [[mainland China]]. On 3 December 1999, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that the NPC's interpretation of the Basic Law was constitutional. The Court's decision denied almost all people listed as plaintiffs, including those already in Hong Kong since the first week of 1997, the right of abode.

According to Article 24 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], Chinese nationals may acquire the right of abode in Hong Kong ''inter alia'' by one of the following three ways:
# if they were born in Hong Kong before or after the transfer of sovereignty (Article 24(2)(1));
# if they have resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or after the transfer of sovereignty (Article 24(2)(2)); or
# if they were born outside Hong Kong to persons covered by the above two categories (Article 24(2)(3)).

Many from Hong Kong had moved to mainland China and started families. Under the immigration law prior to 1 July 1997, their children born in mainland China had no right of abode in Hong Kong. After the Basic Law came into effect, the government of Hong Kong realised that Article 24(2)(3) would have allowed thousands of children in mainland China, who previously had no right of abode in Hong Kong, to immigrate to Hong Kong. Many children who had already illegally come to Hong Kong or overstayed their visas presented themselves to immigration authorities and claimed that they were entitled to stay in Hong Kong under Article 24(2)(3).

In response, the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] proposed to restrict the right of such persons by adding another requirement that one of the child's parents must have been a permanent resident at the time of the child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a certification system. Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese [[Public Security Bureau]]. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient legal documentation would have been stripped of their right for lack of a certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The retroactivity of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] as ''Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration'' and ''Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration''.

In ''Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration'', the Court of Final Appeal was asked to rule on whether the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. The Director argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was constitutional because Article 24 was qualified by Article 22(4), which provides: "For entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, people from other parts of China must apply for approval. Among them, the number of persons who enter the Region for the purpose of settlement shall be determined by the competent authorities of the Central People's Government after consulting the government of the Region."

In ''Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration'', the Court of Final Appeal was asked to rule on the following question: "can a child become a Hong Kong permanent resident under category (3) of Article 24 of the Basic Law by virtue of a parent's Hong Kong permanent resident status under category (2) of that article not only if such status of the parent's had been acquired ''before'' the child's birth but even if it had not been acquired until ''after'' the child's birth?"

On 29 January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal gave its judgment, which affirmed some fundamental constitutional principles. The Court held that the Basic Law was a living instrument which, like any other constitution, should be interpreted using a generous and purposive approach. The Court rejected the idea that Article 22(4) qualified the right of abode in Article 24(2)(3), since "people from other parts of China" mentioned in Article 22(4) do not include permanent residents of Hong Kong, and therefore Article 22(4) does not concern those who otherwise have a valid claim to be a permanent resident. A scheme to verify the claim of right of abode was in itself constitutional, but such a scheme should not have been used to deny valid claims.

The Court also held that in considering any particular provision, the courts should take into account the [[International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as it applied to Hong Kong. The Court found that Article 15(1) of the ICCPR rendered the retrospective provision unconstitutional. The Court also found that the ICCPR enshrined the principle of equality and recognised the importance of family, hence illegitimate children enjoy the right of abode as much as other children.

On the same day, the Court gave its judgment on ''Chan Kam Nga''. The Court held that, as a matter of construction of Article 24, a child born ''after'' his or her parent became a permanent resident nevertheless enjoys the right of abode.

Based on the ruling, the Hong Kong Government estimated that the additional eligible persons in [[Mainland China]] who can obtain the right of abode (and therefore can immigrate to Hong Kong) within ten years would reach 1.6 million, and would result in very severe social and economic problems. While some questioned the methodology of the survey, opinion polls conducted revealed widespread concerns among the public on the consequences.

==== The debate on way forward ====
A number of persons in the legal sector believed that the best way forward was to seek the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) of the People's Republic of China to amend the part of the Basic Law to redress the problem. They argued that judgment has correctly reflected the true legislative intent of Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], and there are precedents in common law jurisdictions to repudiate a court judgment by means of legislative amendment.  However, the Government pointed out (in May 1999) the disadvantages of such option, that since the NPC would meet only once a year in March, a large number of ROA claimants would have flooded Hong Kong by then, and also the Basic Law, as a constitutional document, should not be amended lightly before other options are fully explored.

Based on the above, the Hong Kong Government sought interpretation of, rather than amendment to, the Basic Law from the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC).  The power of interpretation of the Basic Law by the NPCSC is explicitly provided under Article 158(1) of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].  However, no mechanisms are explicitly provided under that Article for the Government to take the initiative to seek an interpretation. (The Article provides only that the Court should seek an interpretation if it comes across Basic Law provisions concerning affairs under the responsibility of the Central Government or its relationship with the HKSAR before the final judgment. Article 22 in question is arguably one of such provisions).

==== Judicial independence undermined? ====
Former [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]], [[Tung Chee Hwa]], announced measures to be taken by the Government, which was to seek the assistance of the State Council to approach the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) to interpret the Basic Law provisions concerning the right of abode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199906/26/npc-e.htm |title=Transcript of media session on NPCSC interpretation of Basic Law |website=Info.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have widely commented that this is in contravention of Article 158 which stipulates the body that should seek an interpretation from the NPCSC is the Court of Final Appeal. Although the government, after the judgment of [[Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration|Lau Kong Yung &amp; Others v Director of Immigration]] was handed down, claimed that "the Court had confirmed that the Government had acted entirely constitutionally and legally" in requesting a NPCSC interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199912/03/1203114.htm|title=Government statement on Court of Final Appeal judgement|work=info.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the truth is the Court never endorsed or ratified the Government's acts. In the judgment, the Court affirmed that the NPCSC had unqualified power to interpret the Basic Law, but never discussed the issue as to whether the reference was legal. Therefore, this issue cannot be regarded as settled.&lt;ref&gt;Yash Ghai, The NPC Interpretation and Its Consequences, Hong Kong's Constitutional Debate-Conflict over Interpretation, Hong Kong University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 1999, in line with the request of the HKSAR Government, the NPCSC issued its interpretation which makes it clear that children born outside Hong Kong will be eligible for the right of abode only if at least one of their parents has already acquired permanent residence status at the time of their birth. Also, those eligible for ROA need to comply with Article 22 of the Basic Law, i.e. they need to apply for the necessary approval from the relevant Mainland authorities before entry into Hong Kong.

Some have argued that the judicial independence of Hong Kong is undermined by the act of Government seeking an interpretation of the Basic Law ''after'' a judgment by the judiciary has been made. (Some critics dubbed this a ''re-interpretation'' of the Basic Law). In addition, the fact that NPC is the law-making body of People's Republic of China has prompted critics to argue that the principle of [[One country, two systems]] is endangered.  The Government argued otherwise. In its paper Right of Abode, The Solution, the problems facing the HKSAR, the options, and the considerations leading to the decision were elaborated. The Secretary for Justice, [[Elsie Leung]], further defended Government's decision in her speech to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] after announcing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199905/19/0519274.htm |title=LC: Speech by Secretary for Justice |website=Info.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that regardless of the merits of the case, it was politically unwise for those worried about Hong Kong legal autonomy to use this as a test case to assert Hong Kong's judicial independence, since it is the general consensus that the Hong Kong public tended to support the position of the SAR government as well as the legal interpretation of the NPCSC.

Differences in opinion remain as to whether Hong Kong's judicial independence and the rule of law have been undermined.  Criticism of the interpretation has originated largely from [[Law of Hong Kong#The legal profession|the legal sector]].

It has sparked a hot debate among the public in Hong Kong.

The '''Salmon Act 1986''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]], passed in 1986, which regulates [[salmon]] [[fishery]]. It is frequently cited in lists of absurd or unusual laws, since it contains a provision making it illegal to "handle salmon in suspicious circumstances".

==Provisions==
The act contains 43 paragraphs, dealing with a wide range of detailed matters relating to salmon fisheries. Matters covered include
#the definition and registration of "salmon fishery", the legal regulation of close seasons on such fisheries, and the constitution and governance of [[salmon fishery board]]s.
#regulation of the methods allowed for salmon fishing (specifically, giving the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] the power to define what is meant by various forms of net fishing)
#regulation of the trade in salmon dealers.
A large part of the Act updates Victorian-era legislation, for instance the [[Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1868]].

==Handling Salmon in Suspicious Circumstances==
Section 32 of the Act is headed "Handling Salmon in Suspicious Circumstances".&lt;ref name="Salmon Act 1986"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/62/section/32 |title=Salmon Act 1986 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |publisher=National Archives |at=Section 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section creates an offence in England and Wales for any person who receives or disposes of any salmon in circumstances where they believe, or could reasonably believe, that the salmon has been illegally fished. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment. Essentially, this is a provision aimed at reducing salmon [[poaching]] by making the handling of poached salmon a criminal offence. Section 22 introduces a parallel provision into Scottish law.

This offence is often cited, without its context, in lists of quirky or absurd laws—often alongside archaic or downright mythical "laws".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8871">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 25''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the first section under the heading "General" in the ''Charter'', and like other sections within the "General" sphere, it aids in the interpretation of rights elsewhere in the ''Charter''.  While section 25 is also the Charter section that deals most directly with [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]], it does not create or constitutionalize rights for them.

The ''Charter'' is a part of the larger ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''.  Aboriginal rights, including treaty rights, receive more direct constitutional protection under [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982.''

==Text==
Under the heading "General," the section reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html |title=CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
|work=Department of Justice Canada|accessdate=August 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|25.  The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as to abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada including
:(a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized  by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and
:(b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.}}

==Purpose==
In other words, the ''Charter'' must be enforced in a way that does not diminish Aboriginal rights.  As the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] held in ''R. v. Agawa'' (1988), the section "confers no new rights," but instead "shields" old ones.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Agawa, (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 266 (Ont. C.A.); 
{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/ca/com/chart/s-25.html |title=SECTION 25 |last= |first= |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |date=June 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619020800/http://canlii.org/ca/com/chart/s-25.html |archivedate=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a stronger recognition for non-''Charter'' rights than [[Section Twenty-six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 26]]'s requirement that the ''Charter'' cannot be interpreted to deny that non-''Charter'' rights exist, as section 25 specifically states that Aboriginal rights will not only continue to exist but also cannot be derogated ''by the Charter itself''.  The distinction came about during the negotiations of the ''Charter''.  Section 25's content did not appear in the first version of the ''Charter'', in October 1980, but the original version of what later became section 26 did say that the existence of Aboriginal rights could not be denied.  This sparked dramatic [[protest]]s among Aboriginals, who viewed the proposed constitutional amendments as an insufficient protection of their rights.  This persisted until some of their leaders, the [[National Indian Brotherhood]], the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]], and the [[Native Council of Canada]] (now the [[Congress of Aboriginal Peoples]]), were appeased by the addition of sections 25 and 35 to the ''Constitution Act, 1982.''&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, Michael.  ''The Charter of Rights and the Legalization of Politics in Canada.''  Revised, Updated and Expanded Edition.  (Toronto:  Thompson Educational Publishing, Inc., 1994), pp. 354-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights to which section 25 refers explicitly include those in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  They may also include those created by ordinary legislation, like the ''[[Indian Act]]'', and constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] has speculated that without this section, [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] (the [[social equality|equality]] provision) would have possibly threatened these rights, since they are particular to a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].  Nevertheless, in the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'' (1999), it was found that not all legislative distinctions relating to Aboriginals are protected by section 25, and section 15 was accordingly used to extend voting rights in Aboriginal [[Indian reserves|reserves]] to Aboriginals who did not live in those reserves.  As Hogg observes, what particular rights section 25 protects was in the mean time left uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada'. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 35 of the Constitution Act, which falls outside the ''Charter'', ''does'' constitutionalize some aboriginal rights.  As Hogg notes, this makes section 25 altogether less important than section 35, but ''Corbiere'' leaves open the possibility that rights not constitutionalized by section 35 can have some protection under section 25.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, 631.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal self-government==
{{main|Aboriginal self-government in Canada}}
The question of how the ''Charter'' applies to Aboriginals and Aboriginal government has involved section 25.  On the one hand, it has been argued that Aboriginal governments are not bound by the ''Charter''. If section 35 includes a right to self-government, and section 25 ensures Aboriginal rights are not limited by the ''Charter'', then section 25 would also guarantee that self-government is not limited by the ''Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;Kent McNeil, "Aboriginal Governments and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms," (Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] once argued that while section 25 guarantees the existence of self-government itself, the powers of such Aboriginal governments will be limited to respect the ''Charter'' rights of individual Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bands receive a measure of autonomy under the ''Indian Act'', and the consequent powers of the councils would be protected by section 25.  Meanwhile, [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32]], which bounds the federal and provincial governments to the ''Charter'', may not include the band councils if their authority derives not only from the ''Indian Act'' but also tradition.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, pp. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments to section 25==
In 1983, with the passing of the ''Constitution Amendment Proclamation, 1983'', section 25 was amended to expand the protection provided for rights associated with [[Aboriginal land claims|land claim]]s.  Whereas the original wording made reference to rights acquired "by way of land claim settlement," the current version refers to rights that "now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired."  While ordinarily, section 25 could have been amended with the standard 7/50 [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amending formula]], this change was also carried out with agreement of aboriginal leaders.  At the same time, the Constitution Act, 1982 was amended to add section 35.1.  This new section suggests that, before section 25 is amended in the future, consultation with aboriginal leaders will again be requested by the [[Canadian prime minister|prime minister]].

==Case law==
Scholar Celeste Hutchinson remarks in an article that little has been done with section 25 by the courts.  However, she points to the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] case ''[[R. v. Kapp]]'' as one that discusses section 25's application.  She argues ''Kapp'' failed to resolve the issue of whether section 25 is only applied when the Charter is violated, or if applies earlier, when a Charter challenge is raised.  Nevertheless, Hutchinson did feel ''Kapp'' provided some significant discussion of section 25.  In ''Kapp'', Justice Kirkpatrick endorsed the view that section 25 is first considered when a Charter challenge is raised, and made a three-step test asking (1) is the right in question a treaty, Aboriginal or other right related to Aboriginals? (2) if it falls in the "other" category, does it relate to a part of Aboriginal life?  (3) would the remedy possibly given by the Charter limit Aboriginal rights?&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Celeste, "Case comment on R. v. Kapp: an analytical framework for section 25 of the Charter," ''McGill Law Journal'', 52.1 (Spring 2007): 173(18).&lt;/ref&gt;

General '''Sir Thomas Pride''' (died 23 October 1658) was a [[roundhead|parliamentarian]] commander in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], best known as one of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|Regicides of King Charles I]] and as the instigator of "[[Pride's Purge]]".

==Origins==
Pride is stated to have been brought up by the parish of St Bride's, [[London]] but is thought to have been born in [[Somerset]].{{who|date=August 2017}}

==Early career==
He commenced his adult life as a [[drayman]] and a [[brewing|brewer]]. At the beginning of the Civil War he served as a captain in the [[New Model Army]] under [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] and was eventually promoted to the rank of colonel. He distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] in 1648 and with his regiment took part in the military occupation of London in December 1648, which was the first step towards bringing to trial of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625-1649).

==Trial of King Charles I==
The next step was the expulsion of the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Cavalier|Royalist]] elements in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]], who were thought to be prepared to reach a settlement with Charles. This, resolved by the army council and ordered by the lord general, Fairfax, was carried out by Colonel Pride's regiment. Taking his stand at the entrance of the House of Commons with a written list in his hand, he caused the arrest or exclusion of the members, who were pointed out to him. After about a hundred members had been thus dealt with, the reduced House of Commons, now reduced to about eighty in number, proceeded to bring the king to trial. This marked the end of the [[Long Parliament]] and the beginning of the [[Rump Parliament]].

==Regicide==
Pride was one of the judges of the king and one of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|Regicides of King Charles I]], having signed and sealed the king's death-warrant. His coat of arms appears on his seal.

==Subsequent career==
He commanded an infantry brigade under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]] and at the [[Battle of Worcester]] (1651). He purchased the estate of [[Nonsuch Palace]] in Surrey, and in 1655 was appointed [[High Sheriff of Surrey|Sheriff of Surrey]].

==Retirement and knighthood==
When the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] was established he abandoned his involvement in politics, except in opposing the proposal to confer the kingly dignity on Cromwell. In 1656 he was knighted by Cromwell, then [[Lord Protector]], and was appointed to the second house added to Parliament as a result of the [[Humble Petition and Advice]].

==Marriage==
He married Elizabeth Monk (born 1628), a daughter of Thomas Monk of [[Potheridge]] in Devon by his wife Mary Gould, a daughter of William Gould of Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.419&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's uncle was the royalist general [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle]] (1608-1670), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], the key figure in effecting the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.

==Death==
Pride died in 1658 at his home of [[Worcester Park House]], having bought it and the "Great Park" of [[Nonsuch Palace]], Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e-UIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 ''The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, for the Year 1837''&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 his body was ordered dug up and suspended on the gallows at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] along with those of [[Oliver Cromwell's head|Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[John Bradshaw (Judge)|John Bradshaw]], though it is said that the sentence was not carried out, probably because his corpse was too far decayed. The Royalists thereupon attempted to hang his son, Joseph Pride, also an active member of the New Model Army, who barely escaped.

A '''witness statement''' is a [[Signature|signed]] document recording the [[evidence]] of a [[witness]]. A definition used in the UK is "a written statement signed by a person which contains the evidence which that person would be allowed to give orally".&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil Procedure Rules]] (CPR) Rule 32.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, witness statements are generally eschewed in favour of a discovery process including [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] of oral testimony given by key witnesses prior to trial.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''Wu Qi''' ({{zh|t=吳起|s=吴起|p=Wú Qǐ|w='''Wu Ch'i'''}}, 440-381 BC) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] military leader, [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist philosopher]], and [[politician]] in the [[Warring States]] period.

==Biography==
Born in the [[State of Wei]] (衞), he was skilled in leading armies and military strategy. He had served in the states of Lu and Wei (魏, not to be confused with Wèi, as in previous note). In the state of Wei he commanded many great battles and was appointed Xihe Shou (Mayor of Xihe county). Xihe was the area between the Yellow and [[Luo River (Shaanxi)|Luo]] Rivers that Wei had just taken from [[Qin (state)|Qin]]. Later, after he became estranged from the lord of Wei and was forced into exile, Wu Qi went to the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] where he was appointed [[Prime minister (Chu State)|Prime minister]] by [[King Dao of Chu]] (楚悼王). His reforms made Chu a strong state at that time. The reforms he instituted enraged the old nobility of Chu and he was killed after the death of King Dao.

Wu's reforms, which started around 389 BC, were generally aimed at changing the corrupt and inefficient government. The nobility and officialdom were terribly corrupt and the government was burdened with the costs of paying them and a horde of other minor officials. Wu first lowered the annual salary of Chu officials, then dismissed officials who were useless or incompetent. He also eliminated hereditary privileges after three generations. The money saved by cutting costs was used to create and train a more professional army.

Another of Wu's actions was to move all the nobles to the borders on the frontier, away from the capital, in order to reduce their power and at the same time populate those areas, making them more useful to the state government. He is also credited with devising a set of building codes in Ying, in order to make the city look less "barbaric", and more in line with 'civilized' Chinese architectural aesthetics.

Although his reforms soon started to make Chu a powerful country, the nobles and [[Daoists]] of Chu hated him. Nobles accused him of trying to change the old ways, and even managed to find fault with the building codes. Daoists accused him of being a "warmonger" and an "admirer of force and weaponry", even going as far as to say that he was "a threat to humanity". He was accused of not returning for the mourning period of his mother's death and for murdering his own wife (who was the daughter of a noble from the rival state of Qi) in order to gain trust from the ruler of the state of Lu.  There is no definitive evidence to the truth of these accusations, and it is possible  they were manufactured by Wu Qi's political enemies to slander him.

In the wake of Wu Qi's reforms, Chu's prowess was quickly manifest: Chu defeated the [[State of Yue|Yue]] state in the south and the [[State of Wei|Wei]] in the north, dealing with each in quick succession. However, King Dao died that same year. The old nobles plotted to assassinate Wu Qi at King Dao's funeral, where he would be separated from the army. Wu Qi spotted the assassins armed with bows, and rushed to the side of King Dao's body. He was killed, but many arrows struck the dead King. The new [[King Su of Chu|King Su]] (楚肃王), furious at his father's body being mutilated, ordered all nobles involved to be executed, along with their families.

==Wei Liaozi==

According to the [[Wei Liaozi]], a treatise on military matters dating from the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, the general Wu Qi was once offered a sword by his subordinates on the eve of battle. However Wu Qi refused to accept the weapon on the basis that banners and drums, the tools to lead and command, were the only instruments a general required. In his words, "to command the troops and direct their blades, this is the role of a commander. To wield a single sword is not his role."{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=24}} The point here is to highlight the idea that the general was the brain of the army, whereas the soldiers were to behave as the limbs. Heroic individual actions were disincentivized in preference to complete obedience and perfect coordination as a unit, a concept which the Wei Liaozi elucidates upon in another parable concerning Wu Qi: Prior to the beginning of a battle, one of Wu's soldiers broke from his ranks in his enthusiasm and charged the enemy line, slaying two men, and trotted back to his former position along with their heads as trophies. Wu immediately ordered the man to be put to death. When his officers protested that he was a fine warrior, Wu Qi answered, "He is indeed a fine warrior, but he disobeyed my orders."{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=24}} As with [[Sun Zi]] and his [[Art of War]], Wu Qi emphasized discipline and obedience before bravery as the most important traits in soldiery.

==Depictions in Popular Culture==

He and Sun Zi are often mentioned in the same sentence (Sun-Wu, 孙武) as great military strategists of similar if not equal importance.

His military treatise, the ''[[Wuzi]]'', is included as one of the ''[[Seven Military Classics]]''. It is said there were two books on the art of war by Wu Qi, but one was lost, hence leaving the Wuzi as the only existing book carrying Wu Qi's military thoughts.

Wu Qi is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game series ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game)]]'' by [[Koei]].
