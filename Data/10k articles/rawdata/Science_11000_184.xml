{{unreferenced|date=October 2008}}

'''Active duty''' is a full-time occupation as part of a military force, as opposed to [[Military reserve force|reserve duty]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the equivalent term is '''active service'''.

==India==
The [[Indian Armed Forces]] are considered to be one of the [[List of countries by size of armed forces|largest active service forces in the world]], with almost 1.42 million Active Standing Army. An additional 2.20 million reserve forces can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of India]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[India]]. This does not include the additional 1.40 million troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==Israel==
In the [[Israel Defense Forces]], there are two types of active duty: regular service ({{lang-he|שרות סדיר}}, ''Sherut Sadir''), and active [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] ({{lang-he|שרות מילואים פעיל}} ''Sherut Milu'im Pa'il'', abbr. ''Shamap''). Regular service refers to either mandatory service ({{lang-he|שרות חובה}}, ''Sherut Hova''), according to the laws of [[Israel]], or [[standing army]] service ({{lang-he|שרות קבע}}, ''Sherut Keva''), which consists of paid [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

Active reserve service refers to the actual time in which reservists are called up. This varies from once every few years to a month every year. During active reserve duty, [[military law]] can be applied to reservists, similarly to regular soldiers.

==Pakistan==
The [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] are one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 617,000 full-time personnel, due to the complex and volatile nature of Pakistan's relationship with India and the Kashmir region, and its porous border with Afghanistan. An additional 513,000 part-time reservists (including armed civilians of [[FATA]]) can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of Pakistan]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[Pakistan]]. This does not include the additional 427,627 troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==United States==
In the [[military of the United States|United States military]], active duty refers to military members who are currently serving on full-time status in their military capacity. Full-time status is not limited to members of the active components of the military services; members of any of the [[United States Armed Forces#Personnel in each service|three components]] (active, [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve]], and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]) may be placed into active status. All personnel in the active components are in active status.  Reservists may be placed into active status as units or individuals.  Units may be mobilized in support of operations, such as the reserve units that have been deployed in support of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]] or those called up within the United States to provide [[Defense Support of Civil authorities|support to civil authorities]]. Individuals may be placed in active status as part of the [[Active Guard Reserve]] program, as augmentees to  active or reserve component units, or to attend full-time military training.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women's achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education an International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women’s choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field. &lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt; 

Women’s [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women’s ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|page=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Engineering Ignorance: The Problem of Gender Equity in Engineering|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|last=Franzway|first=Suzanne|first2=Rhonda |last2=Sharp|first3=Julie E |last3=Mills|first4=Judith |last4=Gill |volume=30|issue=1|year=2009|page=90 |doi=10.1353/fro.0.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017|date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”. &lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture===
[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women’s representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW|isbn=9781879922402|date=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women’s exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alvey''' Programme was a [[British government]] sponsored research program in [[information technology]] that ran from 1983 to 1987. The program was a reaction to the Japanese [[Fifth generation computer]] project.

The project was named after John Alvey, a technology director at BT who led the enquiry that proposed the creation of the program. John Alvey was not involved in the program itself &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/7258984/One-small-step-forward-is-one-giant-leap-backwards-for-government.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Focus areas for the Alvey Programme included:

* VLSI ([[Very-large-scale integration|very large scale integration]]) technology for microelectronics
* [[Knowledge-based systems|Intelligent Knowledge Based Systems]] (IKBS) or [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)
* [[Software Engineering]]
* [[Man-Machine Interface]] (included [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]])
* [[Systems architecture|Systems Architecture]] (for [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]])

'''Amaechi Moshe''' is a Director in [http://www.platformpetroleum.com.ng/home Platform Petroleum Limited], an [[Oil and Gas]] Exploration and Production Company wholly owned by Nigerians; operator of the Egbaoma field (formerly Asuokpu/Umutu) located in Delta state, Nigeria.

Amaechi Moshe is a highly skilled [[oil and gas]] specialist with over 37 years of professional experience. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[Geology]] from the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]] (UNN) in 1972. He holds a certificate in [[Geophysics]], 1974 and a Master’s of Science degree in [[Geology]], 1979.

His successful activist role was recorded in December 2011, when the Geology guru filed a suit to challenge the non-payment of the reviewed pension arrears for [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC) pensioners (of which he was one). Consequently, in March 2013, the National Industrial Court in Nigeria ordered the Nigerian National Petroleum Pension Fund Limited to pay 500 million Naira to the NNPC pensioners who retired prior to 2004 as approved by the NNPC Board in 2009.

Amaechi is a member of the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] (AMAPG), Nigeria Mining and Geoscience Society (NMGS), as well as the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE). He is also a fellow of the [[Geological Society of London]].

His many years experience revolve around the [[oil and gas industry]]. Moshe Amaechi served as Manager of Exploration FES, NAPIMS from 1993 to 1995. He also served as Head Exploration of Shell J.V. OPS, NNPC from 1990 to 1991 and Head of [[Geophysics]], J.V. Operation of NNPC from 1986 to 1990. He served 11 Years as Consultant [[Geophysicist]] in 1995. He has 24 years continuous oil and gas industry experience; 3 Years as Field Geophysicist with SSL, CGG &amp; [[Geological Survey]]s and 21 Years with NNPC.

'''Amye Everard Ball''' was the first woman in [[England]] to be granted a [[patent]]. Her patent for [[tincture]] of [[saffron]] was registered in 1637, merely 76 years after [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] had awarded the first patent. The original patent registration is held at the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffe|first1=Deborah|title=Ingenious Women|date=2003|publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-0750930314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans-Pugh|first1=Christine|title=Engineering's most ingenious women (16 May 2011)|url=http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/05/ingenious-women.cfm|website=www.eandt.theiet.org|accessdate=July 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714143004/http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/05/ingenious-women.cfm|archive-date=2016-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Introduction to Sustainable Development''''' is a 2007 [[Earthscan]] book which presents [[sustainable development]] as a process that "meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This textbook examines the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainable development by exploring changing patterns of consumption, production, and distribution of resources.  Case studies include coastal wetlands;  community-based water supply and sanitation systems; and sustainable energy, forest, and industrial development.&lt;ref name=auth&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=1415  An Introduction to Sustainable Development]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/ROGINT.html An Introduction to Sustainable Development]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Peter P. Rogers is a Professor of Environmental Engineering at [[Harvard University]], USA.  Co-authors Kazi F. Jalal and John A. Boyd are lecturers at Harvard’s Extension School.&lt;ref name=auth/&gt;

'''Arp 87''' (also known as '''NGC 3808''') is a pair of two [[interacting galaxies]], NGC 3808A and NGC 3808B. They are situated in the [[Leo (constellation)|Leo constellation]]. NGC 3808A, the brighter, is a [[peculiar galaxy|peculiar]] [[spiral galaxy]],&lt;ref name=NEDA/&gt; while NGC 3808B is an [[irregular galaxy]].&lt;ref name=NEDB/&gt;

The two galaxies were discovered on 10 April 1785 by [[William Herschel]]. The two are located about 330 million light-years (100 megaparsecs) away from the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=cseligman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cseligman.com/text/atlas/ngc38.htm#3808|title=New General Catalogue objects: NGC 3800 - 3849|author=Seligman, Courtney|website=cseligman.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arp 87 was observed by the [[Hubble Telescope]] in 2007, which revealed massive clouds of gas and dust flowing from one galaxy to another.

'''''Austrian Economics Newsletter''''' is a [[newsletter]] that was published quarterly by the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] until Winter 2003. It was established in the Fall of 1977 and published by the [[Center for Libertarian Studies]], but moved to the Mises Institute in 1984.  The newsletter covers economics from an Austrian perspective: "Each issue spotlights the writings and research of a scholar or financial journalist who works within the tradition of the Austrian School."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=6 Archives of The Austrian Economics Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20056">A '''biomedical scientist'''&lt;!--- do not list all possible alternate titles here. biomedical scientist is sufficient. ---&gt; is a [[scientist]] trained in [[biology]], particularly in the context of [[medicine]]. These scientists work to gain knowledge on the main principles of how the human body works and to find new ways to cure or treat [[disease]] by developing advanced [[diagnostic test|diagnostic tools]] or new [[therapy|therapeutic strategies]]. The [[research]] of biomedical scientists is referred to as [[biomedical research]].

== Description ==
The specific activities of the biomedical scientist can differ in various parts of the world and vary with the level of education. Generally speaking, biomedical scientists conduct research in a [[laboratory]] setting, using living organisms as [[model organism|models]] to conduct [[experiment]]s. These can include [[cell culture|cultured human or animal cells]] grown outside of the whole organism, small animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|flies]], [[Caenorhabditis elegans|worms]], [[zebrafish|fish]], [[House mouse|mice]], and [[Brown rat|rat]]s, or, rarely, larger animals and [[primate]]s. Biomedical scientists may also work directly with human tissue specimens to perform experiments as well as participate in [[clinical research]].

Biomedical scientists employ a variety of techniques in order to carry out laboratory experiments. These include:
*Molecular and biochemical techniques
**[[Electrophoresis]] and [[Blot (biology)|blotting]]
**[[Immunostaining]]
**[[Chromatography]]
**[[Mass spectrometry]]
**[[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and [[sequencing]]
**[[Microarray]]s
*Imaging technologies
**[[Optical microscope|Light]], [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence]], and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]
**[[MRI]]
**[[Positron emission tomography|PET]]
**[[radiography|X-ray]]
*[[Gene]]tic engineering/modification
**[[Transfection]]
**[[Transduction (genetics)|Viral transduction]]
**[[Transgenic organisms|Transgenic model organisms]]
*[[Electrophysiology]] techniques
**[[Patch clamp]]
**[[EEG]], [[EKG]], [[Electroretinography|ERG]]
*''[[In silico]]'' techniques
**[[Bioinformatics]]
**[[Computational biology]]

===Level of education===
Biomedical scientists typically obtain a bachelor of science degree, and usually take postgraduate studies leading to a diploma, master or doctorate. This degree is necessary for faculty positions at academic institutions, as well as senior scientist positions at most companies. Some biomedical scientists also possess a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy|PharmD]], Doctor of Medical Laboratory Sciences[MLSD], MBBS, etc.) in addition to an academic degree.

===Work environment===

====Academics====
This category includes [[tenure]]d [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] positions at [[university|universities]], [[college]]s, non-profit [[research institute]]s, and sometimes [[hospital]]s. These positions usually afford more intellectual freedom and give the researcher more latitude in the direction and content of the research. Scientists in academic settings, in addition to conducting experiments, will also attend [[academic conference|scientific conferences]], compete for [[funding of science|research grant funding]], publish [[scientific journal|scientific papers]], and teach classes.

====Industry====
Industry jobs refer to private sector jobs at for-profit corporations. In the case of biomedical scientists, employment is usually at large [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] or [[biotechnology]] companies. Positions in industry tend to pay higher salaries than those at academic institutions, but job security compared to tenured academic faculty is significantly less. Researchers in industry tend to have less intellectual freedom in their research than those in the academic sector, owing to the ultimate goal of producing marketable products that benefit the company.

====Non-traditional career paths====
In recent years, more biomedical scientists have pursued careers where advanced education and experience in biomedical research is needed outside of traditional laboratory research. These areas include [[patent law]], [[consultant|consulting]], [[public policy]], and [[science journalism]].  The primary reason for growth in these areas is that in recent years fewer positions are available in traditional academic research relative to the number of seekers; approximately 15-20% of PhD life scientists will obtain a tenure-track position or lab-head position in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf |title=The Scientific Workforce Policy Debate: Do We Produce too Many Biomedical Trainees? |accessdate=19 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206081936/http://hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
"Biomedical scientist" is the protected title used by professionals qualified to work unsupervised within the [[pathology]] department of a [[hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biomedical Scientist as Expert Witness |author= Paul D. Ellner|year= 2006|publisher=ASM Press|isbn=1-55581-345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biomedical science]]s are made up of the following disciplines; [[biochemistry]], [[haematology]], [[immunology]], [[microbiology]], [[histology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], and [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] services. These professions are regulated within the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]]. Anyone who falsely claims to be a biomedical scientist commits an offence and could be [[Fine (penalty)|fined]] up to [[Pound sterling|£]]5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/|title=HCPC - Health and Care Professions Council  - Protected titles|website=www.hcpc-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each department specialises in aiding the [[diagnosis]] and treatment of disease. Entry to the profession requires an [[Institute of Biomedical Science]] (IBMS) accredited [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] [[honours degree]] followed by a minimum of 12 months [[laboratory]] training in one of the pathology disciplines, however the actual time spent training can be considerably longer. Trainees are also required to complete a certificate of competence training portfolio, this requires gathering extensive amounts of evidence to demonstrate professional competence. At the end of this period the trainees portfolio and overall competence are assessed; if successful, a certificate of competence is awarded, which can be used to apply for registration with the HCPC. State registration indicates that the applicant has reached a required standard of education and will follow the guidelines and codes of practice created by the Health and Care Professions Council. The NHS, the largest employer of Biomedical Scientist, now run the 'Practitioners Training Program' in conjunction with several Universities which includes a years experienced as a part of a 3-year degree. This is known as BSc Healthcare Science (Life Science) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/ptp-join/nhs-practitioner-training-programme|title=NHS Practitioner Training Programme|first=Super|last=User|website=www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biomedical Scientists are the second largest profession registered by the Health and Care Professions Council and make up a vital component of the health care team. Many of the decisions doctors make are based on the test results generated by Biomedical Scientists. Despite this, much of the general public are unaware of Biomedical Scientists and the important role they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/biomedical_scientist_job_description.htm|title=Biomedical scientist job profile - Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical Scientists are not confined to [[National Health Service|NHS]] laboratories. Biomedical Scientists along with scientists in other inter-related medical disciplines seek out to understand human anatomy, genetics, immunology, physiology and behaviour at all levels. This is sometimes achieved through the use of model systems that are homologous to various aspects of human biology. The research that is carried out either in Universities or Pharmaceutical companies by Biomedical Scientists has led to the development of new treatments for a wide range of degenerative and genetic disorders. [[Stem cell]] biology, [[cloning]], [[genetic testing|genetic screening]]/therapies and other areas of biomedical science have all been generated by the work of Biomedical Scientists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibms.org|title=Home|website=Institute of Biomedical Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Biomedical science graduate programs are maintained at academic institutions and medical schools around the world, and some biomedical graduate programs are administered jointly by an academic institution and a business, hospital, or independent research institute. While [[graduate students]] historically committed to a particular research specialty, such as [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[developmental biology]], the recent trend (particularly in the United States) is to offer interdisciplinary programs that do not specialize and instead aim to incorporate a broad education in multiple biological disciplines.

Initially, graduate students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, after which the student commits to joining a particular laboratory for the remainder of his or her education. The remaining time is spent conducting original research under the direction of the [[principal investigator]] to complete and publish a [[dissertation]]. Unlike undergraduate and [[professional schools]], there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/bbs/admissions/faq.aspx#FAQ13
 |title=Admission FAQS for The Basic and Biomedical Sciences Division of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at UMass Medical School, Worcester |accessdate=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical scientists typically study in undergraduate majors that are focused on biological sciences, such as [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[zoology]], [[biophysics]], etc.

=== United Kingdom ===
Education programmes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibms.org/go/education-development:ibms-courses&lt;/ref&gt; have traditionally encompassed an initial [[bachelor's degree]], which is presupposed for two years of further studies eventually earning the students a ''medicine master's examina''. Many students choose to study on (for as much as) another 4 years to earn a PhD degree, at this time the students specialize in a certain areas such as [[nephrology]], [[neurology]], [[oncology]] or [[virology]].

In the UK specifically, prospective undergraduate students wishing to undertake a BSc in biomedical sciences are required to apply via the [[UCAS]] application system (usually during the final year of college or sixth form secondary school). A [[Doctor of Science|PhD in Biomedicine]] is however required for most higher [[research]] and [[teacher|teaching]] positions, which most [[college]]s and [[universities]] offer.&lt;ref name="WiHC"/&gt; These [[graduate degree]] programs may include [[classroom]] and [[fieldwork]], research at a [[laboratory]], and a [[dissertation]]. Although a degree in a [[medicine]] or [[biology]] (biochemistry, microbiology, zoology, biophysics) is common, recent research [[project]]s also need graduates in [[statistics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Abilities preferred for entry in this field include: technical, scientific, numerical, written, and oral [[skill]]s.

University departments offering degree programmes and/or research in biomedical sciences are represented by the Heads of University Centres of Biomedical Sciences (HUCBMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hucbms.org/|title=Heads of University Centres of Biomedical Sciences (HUCBMS)|website=www.hucbms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. HUCBMS has an international membership.

== Areas of specialization ==
Biomedical scientists can focus on several areas of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]],&lt;ref name="WiHC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wihealthcareers.org/Career_occ_view.cfm?o_id=62 |title=Health Careers |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929215035/http://wihealthcareers.org/Career_occ_view.cfm?o_id=62 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

*[[Biochemistry]]: studies the [[chemical]] composition of [[cell (biology)|cells]], and in serum/plasma, and the chemistry behind biological processes
*[[Molecular biology]]: studies the [[molecular]] makeup and processes of living [[organisms]]
*[[Biophysics]]: studies [[Mechanical energy|mechanical]] and [[Electrical energy|electrical]] [[energy]] in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s
*[[Cell biology]]: studies cell-level organization and processes
*[[Cytopathology]]: Studies cell obtained by different means from human and sometimes animal bodies, using microscope and recent technologies to evaluate morphology, molecular pathology changes by molecular diagnostics. Also cytopathology involves cancer screening such cervical, breast, colon and prostate cancers.
*[[Computational biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]]: uses [[computer simulation|computer modeling]] and [[data analysis]] to understand biological systems
*[[Developmental biology]]: studies the growth and development of organisms and focuses on diseases of abnormal development
*[[Epidemiology]]: studies the incidence and transmission of diseases in a [[population]] and population characteristics ([[Human behavior|behaviors]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], etc.) that associate with diseases
*[[Genetics]]: studies [[DNA]] and [[gene]]s of [[human]]s and animals, as well as diseases caused by abnormal or [[mutation|mutated]] DNA.
*[[Haematology]]: studies of the [[blood]], such as [[blood cell]]s, and mechanisms of [[coagulation]].
*[[Blood Transfusion]]: studies of transfusion science (although frequently linked to haematology, it is however a specialist discipline in its own right). 
*[[Histopathology]]: Studies tissues for disease diagnosis, using histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical analysis or molecular genetic techniques for diagnostics.
*[[Immunology]]: studies the [[immune system]]
*[[Microbiology]]: studies characteristics of [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and their role in human health
*[[Neuroscience]]: studies on function and structure the [[nervous system]], including the [[brain]]
*[[Oncology]] (a.k.a. cancer biology): studies the causes and characteristics of [[cancer]]
*[[Parasitology]]: studies [[parasite]]s
*[[Pathology]]: studies the underlying causes and bodily effects of disease through examination of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, and cells
*[[Pharmacology]]: studies effects of [[drug]]s on biological systems
*[[Physiology]]: studies how various [[body system]]s function at macroscopic, microscopic and molecular levels
*[[Virology]]: studies [[virus]]es and viral diseases
*[[Medicinal chemistry|Medicinal Chemistry]]: studies compound for medicinal usage
 
However, recent trends in biomedical graduate education (particularly in the United States) are for biomedical scientists to remain interdisciplinary and to not specialize. This approach emphasizes focus on a particular body or disease process as a whole and drawing upon the techniques of multiple specialties. (''See also: [[Systems biology]]'')

== Salaries and job growth ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the salaries for biomedical scientists range from £21,692 to £67,805&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/working-in-the-nhs/pay-and-benefits/agenda-for-change-pay-rates/|title=Agenda for change - pay rates|date=22 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus high cost area supplements and out of hours payments, depending on experience, education, and position.

The '''Botanic Garden Meise''' ({{lang-nl|Plantentuin Meise}}, {{lang-fr|Jardin botanique Meise}}; until 2014 called the '''National Botanic Garden of Belgium''' ({{lang-nl|Nationale Plantentuin van België}}, {{lang-fr|Jardin Botanique National de Belgique}})) is located in the grounds of [[Bouchout Castle]] in the town of [[Meise]], just north of [[Brussels]] in the province of [[Flemish Brabant]]. It is one of the largest [[botanical garden]]s in the world with an extensive collection of living [[plant]]s in addition to a [[herbarium]] of over 3 million specimens. The current garden was established in 1958 after it moved from the centre of Brussels; the former site is now the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]]. Researchers at the garden conduct research particularly on Belgian and African plants.

The Botanic Garden contains about 18,000 plant [[species]]—about 6% of all known plant species of the world. Half are in greenhouses, the other half, including cultivated and [[Endemic (ecology)|indigenous]] plants, are outdoors. The gardens are grouped around the castle and lake of the Bouchout domain.

The mission statement of the Botanic Garden Meise specifies the increasing and spreading "the knowledge of plants" and contributions to "the conservation of [[biodiversity]]."

The Botanic Garden was property of the Belgian federal government, but after several years of negotiations it was eventually transferred to the [[Flemish Community]] ([[Flanders]]) effective 1 January 2014. The [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] still has its own employees and representation in the board of directors. The plants, library, etc. remain property of the federal State but given as [[commodate]] to the Flemish Community.

==History==

===Establishment in Brussels===
[[File:Botanique 03.JPG|thumb|left|[[Le Botanique]] in Brussels was the main [[orangery]] of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium]]
The first botanic garden in Brussels belonged to the [[:fr:École centrale de Bruxelles|Ecole Centrale]] du [[Département de la Dyle]] that was created during the [[History of Belgium#Coalition Wars|French rule of Belgium]] at the end of the 18th century. Due to their costs, those French schools were soon dropped and some [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]], including the [[City of Brussels]], took over the garden that was about to be abandoned. In 1815, Belgium became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Around the same period, the maintenance costs of the garden were regarded as too high by the city administration. A group of local bourgeois decided to create a new kind of botanical garden in Brussels. At the time the bourgeoisie was the new leading-class and since companies were popular financing method the garden was created as a company. The creators thought it would be their contribution to the city's reputation. Although it was rooted on a private enterprise, it was also supposed to be a national institution dedicated to science.

[[File:Jardin botanique national de Belgique 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Victoria (plant)|Giant waterlilies]] in the ''Victoria house'']]
[[Image:Meise JPG03.jpg|thumb|right|The Balat greenhouse]]
Both the City and the Home Office supported it financially. But, the [[Independence of Belgium]] (1830-1831) was detrimental to the Dutch-born institution: it was regarded as [[Orangism (Belgium)|orangist]], as a mere playground for the local elites, and as not useful for the country's agriculture, among other critiques. From then on, the garden would have to battle to survive. The state and the city did not want to support it anymore unless it proved useful to the whole country, so the Garden was obliged to develop its commercial activities. It sold plants by the thousands, and created several money-consuming attractions and events for the local élite, like [[aquarium|aquaria]], a dance room, fairs, a fish nursery, concerts etc. In the 1860s, the aging buildings required renovation. The board of the Society of Horticulture tried to raise the money, but the costs were just too high for the company. In 1870, the Belgian Government took over the company. The National Botanic Garden was created in the very same year. [[Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthélemy Dumortier]] (1797-1878), a Belgian politician and botanist, had played a major role in this process. He wanted a “Belgian [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]]” to be created in the capital of Belgium, that is to say a botanical garden dedicated to taxonomy. That is why, some months before the garden was bought by the state, the Belgian Government had purchased the famous [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius|von Martius]] Herbarium that was held in Munich. So, in 1870, Belgium had a great herbarium and an appropriate building. This was the dawn of a new era for Belgian botany.

===Move to Meise===


In 1927, just after the death of empress Charlotte, it was proposed to set up the National Botanical Garden at the Bouchout Domain. It took until 1937 before the final decision was made and major constructions were started. To the South-East of Bouchout Castle, the "Palace of the Plants" was built, which consists of a number of greenhouses. More to the South-West of the castle, the Victoria Balet greenhouse was placed. This greenhouse was designed in 1853 by Alfonse Balat and transported from its original location at the Botanical Garden of Brussels.

During the second world war, Bouchout Castle was occupied by the German forces and the domain altered into a fortress. Next to the Palace of Plants, six baracks were placed and concrete defenses were erected. The court of honour of Bouchout Castle was used to store ammunition, while artillery defenses were placed at the borders of the domain. The last German soldiers left Bouchout domain at 3 September 1944. Just a few days later, the Allied Forces arrived who used it as a training location, while stationing about 200 vehicles at the domain. At 29 November 1944, a bomb exploded at the Western part of the parc destroying the windows of Bouchout Castle. A second bomb exploded at 2 December nearby the adjacent Hoogvorst Castle, causing its complete destruction.

A '''cirque stairway''' or sequence of '''cirque steps''' is a stepped succession of glacially eroded rock basins.&lt;ref name=Whittow&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 95. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their individual formation is that of a [[cirque]].

These steps are arranged one above and behind the other at different heights in the terrain and caused by the same geomorphodynamic processes, albeit resulting in different landform shapes depending on the type of rock and the depositional circumstances involved. The lower step often lacks the steep headwalls typical of cirques.&lt;ref&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 915 (''Stufenkar''). {{ISBN|978-3-423-03422-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example is the [[Zastler Loch]] below the summit of the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]], the highest mountain of the [[Black Forest]] in [[Germany]].

[[Image:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|thumb|right|'''Thermal motion''' of an [[alpha helix|α-helical]] [[peptide]]. The jittery motion is random and complex, and the energy of any particular atom can fluctuate wildly. Nevertheless, the equipartition theorem allows the ''average'' [[kinetic energy]] of each atom to be computed, as well as the average potential energies of many vibrational modes. The grey, red and blue spheres represent [[atom]]s of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]], respectively; the smaller white spheres represent atoms of [[hydrogen]].]]

In [[classical physics|classical]] [[statistical mechanics]], the '''equipartition theorem''' relates the [[temperature]] of a system to its average [[energy|energies]]. The equipartition theorem is also known as the '''law of equipartition''', '''equipartition of energy''', or simply '''equipartition'''. The original idea of equipartition was that, in [[thermal equilibrium]], energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average [[kinetic energy]] per [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] in [[translation (physics)|translational motion]] of a molecule should equal that in [[rotational motion]].

The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions. Like the [[virial theorem]], it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's [[heat capacity]] can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single [[spring (device)|spring]]. For example, it predicts that every atom in a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]] has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|(thermodynamic) temperature]]. More generally, equipartition can be applied to any [[classical physics|classical system]] in [[thermal equilibrium]], no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]], and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids. The equipartition theorem can also be used to predict the properties of [[star]]s, even [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s, since it holds even when [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are considered.

Although the equipartition theorem makes accurate predictions in certain conditions, it is inaccurate when [[quantum physics|quantum effects]] are significant, such as at low temperatures.  When the [[thermal energy]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]], the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be "frozen out" when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model [[black-body radiation]]—also known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]—led [[Max Planck]] to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].

==Basic concept and simple examples==
{{See also|Kinetic energy|Heat capacity}}

[[File:MaxwellBoltzmann-en.svg|right|thumb|440px|Figure 2. Probability density functions of the molecular speed for four [[noble gas]]es at a [[temperature]] of 298.15 [[Kelvin|K]] (25 [[Celsius|°C]]). The four gases are [[helium]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), [[neon]] (&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne), [[argon]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar) and [[xenon]] (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Xe); the superscripts indicate their [[mass number]]s. These probability density functions have [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of probability times inverse speed; since probability is dimensionless, they can be expressed in units of seconds per meter.]]

The name "equipartition" means "equal division," as derived from the [[Latin]] ''equi'' from the antecedent, æquus ("equal or even"), and partition from the noun, ''partitio'' ("division, portion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=equi&amp;searchmode=none|title=equi-|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Partition&amp;searchmode=none|title=partition|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept of equipartition was that the total [[kinetic energy]] of a system is shared equally among all of its independent parts, ''on the average'', once the system has reached thermal equilibrium. Equipartition also makes quantitative predictions for these energies. For example, it predicts that every atom of an inert [[noble gas]], in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'', has an average translational kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. As a consequence, since kinetic energy is equal to 1/2(mass)(velocity)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the heavier atoms of [[xenon]] have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of [[helium]] at the same temperature. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 shows the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] for the speeds of the atoms in four noble gases.

In this example, the key point is that the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and therefore contributes {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This has many applications.

===Translational energy and ideal gases===
{{See also|Ideal gas}}

The (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass ''m'', velocity '''v''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \tfrac12 m |\mathbf{v}|^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left( v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Cartesian components of the velocity '''v'''. Here, ''H'' is short for [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]] plays a central role in the most [[#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|general form]] of the equipartition theorem.

Since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', as in the example of noble gases above.

More generally, in an ideal gas, the total energy consists purely of (translational) kinetic energy: by assumption, the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another. Equipartition therefore predicts that the average total energy of an ideal gas of ''N'' particles is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''T''.

It follows that the [[heat capacity]] of the gas is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of such gas particles is (3/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (3/2)''R'', where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] and ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. Since ''R'' ≈ 2 [[calorie|cal]]/([[mole (unit)|mol]]·[[Kelvin|K]]), equipartition predicts that the [[molar heat capacity]] of an ideal gas is roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment.&lt;ref name="kundt_1876" /&gt;

The mean kinetic energy also allows the [[root mean square speed]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; of the gas particles to be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\langle v^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 R T}{M}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''m'' is the mass of a mole of gas particles. This result is useful for many applications such as [[Graham's law]] of [[effusion]], which provides a method for [[enriched uranium|enriching]] [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/enrichment.html Fact Sheet on Uranium Enrichment] U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotational energy and molecular tumbling in solution===
{{See also|Angular velocity|Rotational diffusion}}

A similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with [[principal moments of inertia]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The rotational energy of such a molecule is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{rot}} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( I_{1} \omega_{1}^{2} + I_{2} \omega_{2}^{2} + I_{3} \omega_{3}^{2} ),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the principal components of the [[angular velocity]]. By exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case, equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Similarly, the equipartition theorem allows the average (more precisely, the root mean square) angular speed of the molecules to be calculated.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;

The tumbling of rigid molecules—that is, the random rotations of molecules in solution—plays a key role in the [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]]s observed by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], particularly [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]] and [[residual dipolar coupling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Cavanagh, J; Fairbrother WJ, Palmer AG III, Skelton NJ, Rance M | year = 2006 | title = Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice | edition = 2nd | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-164491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as [[fluorescence anisotropy]], [[flow birefringence]] and [[dielectric spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cantor | first = CR |author2=Schimmel PR | year = 1980 | title = Biophysical Chemistry. Part II. Techniques for the study of biological structure and function | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-1189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential energy and harmonic oscillators===
Equipartition applies to [[potential energy|potential energies]] as well as kinetic energies: important examples include [[harmonic oscillator]]s such as a [[spring (device)|spring]], which has a quadratic potential energy

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{pot}} = \tfrac 12 a q^2,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' describes the stiffness of the spring and ''q'' is the deviation from equilibrium. If such a one-dimensional system has mass ''m'', then its kinetic energy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt; is
&lt;!-- {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m'', --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;= ''mv'' denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator. Combining these terms yields the total energy&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H = H_{\text{kin}} + H_{\text{pot}} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} a q^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

Equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium, the oscillator has average energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = 
\langle H_{\text{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\text{pot}} \rangle = 
\tfrac{1}{2} k_B T + \tfrac{1}{2} k_B T = k_B T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the angular brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the average of the enclosed quantity,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

This result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator, such as a [[pendulum]], a vibrating molecule or a passive [[electronic oscillator]]. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and hence contributes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This can be used to derive the formula for [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Mandl | first = F | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 213–219 | isbn = 0-471-56658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.

[[Image:Vätskefas.png|frame|left|Figure 3. Atoms in a crystal can vibrate about their equilibrium positions in the [[crystal structure|lattice]]. Such vibrations account largely for the [[heat capacity]] of crystalline [[dielectric]]s; with [[metal]]s, [[electron]]s also contribute to the heat capacity.]]

===Specific heat capacity of solids===
::''For more details on the molar specific heat capacities of [[solid]]s, see [[Einstein solid]] and [[Debye model]].''

An important application of the equipartition theorem is to the specific heat capacity of a crystalline solid. Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid can be viewed as a system of 3''N'' independent [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s, where ''N'' denotes the number of atoms in the lattice. Since each harmonic oscillator has average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average total energy of the solid is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', and its heat capacity is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

By taking ''N'' to be the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and using the relation ''R''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; between the [[gas constant]] ''R'' and the Boltzmann constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, this provides an explanation for the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids, which stated that the specific heat capacity (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its [[atomic weight]]. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is ''3R''&amp;nbsp;≈ 6&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

However, this law is inaccurate at lower temperatures, due to quantum effects; it is also inconsistent with the experimentally derived [[third law of thermodynamics]], according to which the molar heat capacity of any substance must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero.&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" /&gt; A more accurate theory, incorporating quantum effects, was developed by [[Albert Einstein]] (1907) and [[Peter Debye]] (1911).&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

Many other physical systems can be modeled as sets of [[oscillation#Coupled oscillations|coupled oscillators]]. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into [[normal mode]]s, like the vibrational modes of a [[piano string]] or the [[resonance]]s of an [[organ pipe]]. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, because there is no exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called ''ergodicity'', is important for the law of equipartition to hold.

===Sedimentation of particles===
{{See also|Sedimentation|Mason&amp;ndash;Weaver equation|Brewing}}

Potential energies are not always quadratic in the position. However, the equipartition theorem also shows that if a degree of freedom ''x'' contributes only a multiple of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (for a fixed real number ''s'') to the energy, then in thermal equilibrium the average energy of that part is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s''.

There is a simple application of this extension to the [[sedimentation]] of particles under [[gravitation|gravity]].&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" /&gt; For example, the haze sometimes seen in [[beer]] can be caused by clumps of [[protein]]s that [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter]] light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miedl M, Garcia M, Bamforth C |title=Haze formation in model beer systems |journal=J. Agric. Food Chem. |volume=53 |issue=26 |pages=10161–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16366710 |doi=10.1021/jf0506941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity, causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top. However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also [[diffusion|diffuse]] back up towards the top of the bottle. Once equilibrium has been reached, the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of [[buoyant mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. For an infinitely tall bottle of beer, the gravitational [[potential energy]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H^{\mathrm{grav}} = m_{\rm b} g z\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the height of the protein clump in the bottle and ''[[Earth's gravity|g]]'' is the [[acceleration]] due to gravity. Since ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 1, the average potential energy of a protein clump equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Hence, a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10&amp;nbsp;[[Dalton (unit)|MDa]] (roughly the size of a [[virus]]) would produce a haze with an average height of about 2&amp;nbsp;cm at equilibrium. The process of such sedimentation to equilibrium is described by the [[Mason–Weaver equation]].&lt;ref name="mason_1924" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Mason | first = M |author2=Weaver W | year = 1924 | title = The Settling of Small Particles in a Fluid | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 412–426 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.23.412|bibcode = 1924PhRv...23..412M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843, and more correctly in 1845, by [[John James Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 1 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 134–159 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 2 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 336–339 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waterston | first = JJ | authorlink = John James Waterston | year = 1846 | title = On the physics of media that are composed of free and elastic molecules in a state of motion | journal = Proc.

Waterston's key paper was written and submitted in 1845 to the [[Royal Society]]. After refusing to publish his work, the Society also refused to return his manuscript and stored it among its files. The manuscript was discovered in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], who criticized the original reviewer for failing to recognize the significance of Waterston's work. Waterston managed to publish his ideas in 1851, and therefore has priority over Maxwell for enunciating the first version of the equipartition theorem.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxwell | first = JC | authorlink = James Clerk Maxwell | year = 2003 | chapter = Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gases | title = The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell | editor = WD Niven | pages = Vol.1, pp. 377–409 | publisher = Dover | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-486-49560-6 | nopp = true}} Read by Prof. Maxwell at a Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen on 21 September 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1871 | title = Einige allgemeine Sätze über Wärmegleichgewicht (Some general statements on thermal equilibrium) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 63 | pages = 679–711|language=de}} In this preliminary work, Boltzmann showed that the average total kinetic energy equals the average total potential energy when a system is acted upon by external harmonic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1876 | title = Über die Natur der Gasmoleküle (On the nature of gas molecules) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 74 | pages = 553–560|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat|specific heat capacities]] of solids.

[[Image:DiatomicSpecHeat1.png|thumb|450px|right|Figure 4. Idealized plot of the [[specific heat capacity|molar specific heat]] of a diatomic gas against temperature. It agrees with the value (7/2)''R'' predicted by equipartition at high temperatures (where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]), but decreases to (5/2)''R'' and then (3/2)''R'' at lower temperatures, as the vibrational and rotational modes of motion are "frozen out". The failure of the equipartition theorem led to a paradox that was only resolved by [[quantum mechanics]]. For most molecules, the transitional temperature T&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; is much less than room temperature, whereas ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be ten times larger or more. A typical example is [[carbon monoxide]], CO, for which ''T''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 3103&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. For molecules with very large or weakly bound atoms, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be close to room temperature (about 300&amp;nbsp;K); for example, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 308&amp;nbsp;K for [[iodine]] gas, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" /&gt;]]

The history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of [[specific heat capacity]], both of which were studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit]] discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petit | first = AT | authorlink = Alexis Thérèse Petit |author2=Dulong PL |authorlink2=Pierre Louis Dulong  | year = 1819 | title = Recherches sur quelques points importants de la théorie de la chaleur (Studies on key points in the theory of heat) | url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PETIT.html | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 10 | pages = 395–413|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights.&lt;ref name="pais_1982" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1982 | title = Subtle is the Lord | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-853907-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies by [[James Dewar]] and [[Heinrich Friedrich Weber]] showed that this [[Dulong–Petit law]] holds only at high [[temperature]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dewar | first = J | authorlink = James Dewar | year = 1872 | title = The Specific Heat of Carbon at High Temperatures | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 44 | pages = 461}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1872 | title = Die specifische Wärme des Kohlenstoffs (The specific heat of carbon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 147 | pages = 311–319 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152316|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.18722231007|bibcode = 1872AnP...223..311W }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1875 | title = Die specifische Wärmen der Elemente Kohlenstoff, Bor und Silicium (The specific heats of elemental carbon, boron, and silicon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 154 | pages = 367–423, 553–582 |doi=10.1002/andp.18752300307 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15238m|language=de|bibcode = 1875AnP...230..367W }}&lt;/ref&gt; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as [[diamond]], the specific heat capacity was lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = de la Rive | first = A |author2=Marcet F | year = 1840 | title = Quelques recherches sur la chaleur spécifique (Some research on specific heat) | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | volume = 75 | pages = 113–144 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBwAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA3 | publisher = Masson.|language=fr}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Regnault | first = HV | authorlink = Henri Victor Regnault | year = 1841 | title = Recherches sur la chaleur spécifique des corps simples et des corps composés (deuxième Mémoire) (Studies of the specific heats of simple and composite bodies) | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 1 | series = (3me Série)| pages = 129–207 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34742d|language=fr}} Read at l'Académie des Sciences on 11 January 1841.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wigand | first = A | year = 1907 | title = Über Temperaturabhängigkeit der spezifischen Wärme fester Elemente (On the temperature dependence of the specific heats of solids) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 22 | pages = 99–106|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.19063270105 |bibcode = 1906AnP...327...99W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental observations of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns about the validity of the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

Several explanations of equipartition's failure to account for molar heat capacities were proposed.

==General formulation of the equipartition theorem==
{{See also|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics|Microcanonical ensemble|Canonical ensemble}}

The most general form of the equipartition theorem states that under suitable assumptions (discussed below), for a physical system with [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] energy function ''H'' and degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the following equipartition formula holds in thermal equilibrium for all indices ''m'' and ''n'':&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1918 | title = A General Theory of Energy Partition with Applications to Quantum Theory | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–275 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.11.261|bibcode = 1918PhRv...11..261T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''δ&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], which is equal to one if ''m''&amp;nbsp;= ''n'' and is zero otherwise. The averaging brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be an [[ensemble average]] over phase space or, under an assumption of [[ergodic]]ity, a time average of a single system.

The general equipartition theorem holds in both the [[microcanonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="huang_1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Huang | first = K | authorlink = Kerson Huang | year = 1987 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = 2nd | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 136–138 | isbn = 0-471-81518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the total energy of the system is constant, and also in the [[canonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pathria | first = RK | year = 1972 | title = Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Pergamon Press | pages = 43–48, 73–74 | isbn = 0-08-016747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1938 | title = The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | pages = 93–98 | isbn = 0-486-63896-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the system is coupled to a [[heat bath]] with which it can exchange energy. Derivations of the general formula are given [[#Derivations|later in the article]].

The general formula is equivalent to the following two:
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{B} T \quad \mbox{for all } n&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{for all } m \neq n.&lt;/math&gt;

If a degree of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' appears only as a quadratic term ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Hamiltonian ''H'', then the first of these formulae implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}}\Bigr\rangle = 2\langle a_n x_n^2 \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy &lt;math&gt;\langle H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula. A similar argument, with 2 replaced by ''s'', applies to energies of the form ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n''&lt;/sub&gt; are coordinates on the [[phase space]] of the system and are therefore commonly subdivided into [[canonical coordinates|generalized position]] coordinates ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[generalized momentum]] coordinates ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[conjugate momentum]] to ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this situation, formula 1 means that for all ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle =  \Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equations of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]],&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" &gt;{{cite book | last = Goldstein |first = H | authorlink = Herbert Goldstein | year = 1980 | title = Classical Mechanics | edition = 2nd. | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-201-02918-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; these formulae may also be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can show using formula 2 that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 
\quad \mbox{ for all } \, j,k
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{ for all } \, j \neq k.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to the virial theorem===
{{See also|Virial theorem|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics}}

The general equipartition theorem is an extension of the [[virial theorem]] (proposed in 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = R | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = Ueber einen auf die Wärme anwendbaren mechanischen Satz | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 141 | pages = 124–130 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152258 | doi=10.1002/andp.18702170911|language=de|bibcode = 1870AnP...217..124C }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = RJE | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=Series 4 | volume = 40 | pages = 122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which states that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' denotes [[time]].&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt; Two key differences are that the virial theorem relates ''summed'' rather than ''individual'' averages to each other, and it does not connect them to the [[temperature]] ''T''. Another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over [[phase space]].

==Applications==

===Ideal gas law===
{{See also|Ideal gas|Ideal gas law}}

[[Ideal gas]]es provide an important application of the equipartition theorem. As well as providing the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H^{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{2m} \langle p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2} \rangle\\
&amp;=  \frac{1}{2} \biggl(
\Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle +
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle \biggr) = 
\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for the average kinetic energy per particle, the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]] from classical mechanics.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; If '''q''' = (''q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') and '''p''' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and
'''F''' is the net force on that particle, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{F} \rangle &amp;= \Bigl\langle q_x \frac{dp_x}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{dp_y}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{dp_z}{dt} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;=-\Bigl\langle q_x \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_x} \Bigr\rangle -
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_y} \Bigr\rangle - 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_z} \Bigr\rangle = -3k_B T,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the first equality is [[Newton's second law]], and the second line uses [[Hamilton's equations]] and the equipartition formula. Summing over a system of ''N'' particles yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = - \biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|frame|right|Figure 5. The kinetic energy of a particular molecule can [[thermal fluctuations|fluctuate wildly]], but the equipartition theorem allows its ''average'' energy to be calculated at any temperature. Equipartition also provides a derivation of the [[ideal gas law]], an equation that relates the [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[temperature]] of the gas. (In this diagram five of the molecules have been colored red to track their motion; this coloration has no other significance.)]]

By [[Newton's third law]] and the ideal gas assumption, the net force on the system is the force applied by the walls of their container, and this force is given by the pressure ''P'' of the gas. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;
-\biggl\langle\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k}\biggr\rangle = P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''d''S''''' is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the [[divergence]] of the position vector '''q''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} =
\frac{\partial q_{x}}{\partial q_{x}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{y}}{\partial q_{y}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{z}}{\partial q_{z}} = 3,
&lt;/math&gt;

the [[divergence theorem]] implies that

:&lt;math&gt;
P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS} = P \int_{\mathrm{volume}} \left( \boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} \right) \, dV = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''V'' is an infinitesimal volume within the container and ''V'' is the total volume of the container.

Putting these equalities together yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = -\biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

which immediately implies the [[ideal gas law]] for ''N'' particles:

:&lt;math&gt;
PV = Nk_{B} T = nRT,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal-gas law and the internal energy, the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].&lt;ref name="configint"&gt;

===Diatomic gases===
{{See also|Two-body problem|Rigid rotor|Harmonic oscillator}}

A diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, joined by a [[spring (device)|spring]] of [[Hooke's law|stiffness]] ''a'', which is called the ''rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 91–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical energy of this system is

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{1} \right|^{2}}{2m_{1}} + 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{2} \right|^{2}}{2m_{2}} + 
\frac{1}{2} a q^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the momenta of the two atoms, and ''q'' is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value. Every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and, thus, should contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the total average energy, and {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the heat capacity. Therefore, the heat capacity of a gas of ''N'' diatomic molecules is predicted to be 7''N''·{{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;: the momenta '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contribute three degrees of freedom each, and the extension ''q'' contributes the seventh. It follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be (7/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (7/2)''R'' and, thus, the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K)&lt;ref name="Wueller_1896" /&gt; and fall to 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Eucken_1912" /&gt; This disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule, since adding more degrees of freedom can only ''increase'' the predicted specific heat, not decrease it.&lt;ref name="maxwell_1875" /&gt; This discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of matter.

[[Image:Chandra-crab.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Figure 6. A combined X-ray and optical image of the [[Crab Nebula]]. At the heart of this nebula there is a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]] which has about one and a half times the mass of the [[Sun]] but is only 25 km across. The equipartition theorem is useful in predicting the properties of such neutron stars.]]

===Extreme relativistic ideal gases===
{{See also|Special relativity|White dwarf|Neutron star}}

Equipartition was used above to derive the classical [[ideal gas law]] from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. However, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become dominant in some systems, such as [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and the ideal gas equations must be modified. The equipartition theorem provides a convenient way to derive the corresponding laws for an extreme relativistic [[ideal gas]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; In such cases, the kinetic energy of a [[relativistic particle|single particle]] is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{kin}} \approx cp = c \sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the derivative of ''H'' with respect to the ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' momentum component gives the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
p_x \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_x}  = c \frac{p_x^2}{\sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' components. Adding the three components together gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle
&amp;= \biggl\langle c \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}{\sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}}  \biggr\rangle\\
&amp;= \Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;= 3 k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality follows from the equipartition formula. Thus, the average total energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case: for ''N'' particles, it is 3&amp;nbsp;''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.

===Non-ideal gases===
{{See also|Virial expansion|Virial coefficient}}

In an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions. The equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of "non-ideal gases" in which the particles also interact with one another through [[conservative force]]s whose potential ''U''(''r'') depends only on the distance ''r'' between the particles.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] distribution. It is then customary to introduce a [[radial distribution function]] ''g''(''r'') such that the [[probability density function|probability density]] of finding another particle at a distance ''r'' from the given particle is equal to 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ρg''(''r''), where ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/''V'' is the mean [[density]] of the gas.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000b" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 254–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty} 4\pi r^{2} \rho U(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore &lt;math&gt; \langle H_{pot} \rangle = \tfrac12 N \langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor {{frac|1|2}} is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice.
Adding kinetic and potential energies, then applying equipartition, yields the ''energy equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = 
\frac{3}{2} Nk_{B}T + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{2} U(r) g(r) \, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar argument,&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; can be used to derive the ''pressure equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{\rm B}T = 3PV + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{3} U'(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Anharmonic oscillators===
{{See also|Anharmonic oscillator}}

An anharmonic oscillator (in contrast to a simple harmonic oscillator) is one in which the potential energy is not quadratic in the extension ''q'' (the [[canonical coordinate|generalized position]] which measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium). Such oscillators provide a complementary point of view on the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1927 | title = Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Physics and Chemistry | publisher = Chemical Catalog Company | pages = 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terletskii_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Terletskii | first = YP | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | edition = translated: N. Fröman | publisher = North-Holland | location = Amsterdam | isbn = 0-7204-0221-2 | pages = 83–84 | lccn = 70157006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples are provided by potential energy functions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = C q^{s},\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' and ''s'' are arbitrary [[real number|real constants]]. In these cases, the law of equipartition predicts that

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{\rm B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\langle q \cdot s C q^{s-1} \rangle = \langle s C q^{s} \rangle = s \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the average potential energy equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s'', not ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/2 as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 2).

More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a [[Taylor expansion]] in the extension ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} C_{n} q^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative [[integer]]s ''n''. There is no ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 1 term, because at the equilibrium point, there is no net force and so the first derivative of the energy is zero. The ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 0 term need not be included, since the energy at the equilibrium position may be set to zero by convention. In this case, the law of equipartition predicts that&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \langle q \cdot n C_{n} q^{n-1} \rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T - 
\sum_{n=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{n - 2}{2} \right) C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
does ''not'' allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.

===Brownian motion===
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 7. Typical Brownian motion of a particle in three dimensions.]]
{{See also|Brownian motion}}

The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[Brownian motion]] of a particle from the [[Langevin equation]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass ''m'' with velocity '''v''' is governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\tau} + \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{rnd}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the [[time constant]] τ reflects the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] that opposes the particle's motion through the solution. The drag force is often written '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;drag&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −γ'''v'''; therefore, the time constant τ equals ''m''/γ.

The dot product of this equation with the position vector '''r''', after averaging, yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\frac{1}{\tau} \langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

for Brownian motion (since the random force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is uncorrelated with the position '''r'''). Using the mathematical identities

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\frac{d}{dt} \left( r^{2} \right) = 2 \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right) = v^{2} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}} \langle r^{2} \rangle + \frac{1}{\tau} \frac{d}{dt} \langle r^{2} \rangle = 
2 \langle v^{2} \rangle = \frac{6}{m} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = \Bigl\langle \frac{p^{2}}{2m} \Bigr\rangle = \langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

The above [[differential equation]] for &lt;math&gt;\langle r^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle = \frac{6k_{\rm B} T \tau^{2}}{m} \left( e^{-t/\tau} - 1 + \frac{t}{\tau} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

On small time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''τ'', the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the [[Taylor series]] of the [[exponential function]], the squared distance grows approximately ''quadratically'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{3k_{\rm B} T}{m} t^{2} = \langle v^{2} \rangle t^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

However, on long time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''τ'', the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only ''linearly'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{6k_{B} T\tau}{m} t = \frac{6 k_{B} T t}{\gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This describes the [[diffusion]] of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.

===Stellar physics===
{{See also|Astrophysics|Stellar structure}}

The equipartition theorem and the related [[virial theorem]] have long been used as a tool in [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = GW | year = 1978 | title = The Virial Theorem in Stellar Astrophysics  | url = http://ads.harvard.edu/books/1978vtsa.book/ | publisher = Pachart Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, the virial theorem may be used to estimate stellar temperatures or the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] on the mass of [[white dwarf]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandrasekhar | first = S | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | year = 1939 | title = An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | pages = 49–53 | isbn = 0-486-60413-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kourganoff | first = V | year = 1980 | title = Introduction to Advanced Astrophysics | publisher = D. Reidel | location = Dordrecht, Holland | pages = 59–60, 134–140, 181–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature of a star can be estimated from the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chiu | first = H-Y | year = 1968 | title = Stellar Physics, volume I | publisher = Blaisdell Publishing | location = Waltham, MA | lccn = 67017990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most stars are spherically symmetric, the total [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational]] [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|potential energy]] can be estimated by integration

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = -\int_0^R \frac{4\pi r^2 G}{r} M(r)\, \rho(r)\, dr,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''(''r'') is the mass within a radius ''r'' and ''ρ''(''r'') is the stellar density at radius ''r''; ''G'' represents the [[gravitational constant]] and ''R'' the total radius of the star. Assuming a constant density throughout the star, this integration yields the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5R},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the star's total mass. Hence, the average potential energy of a single particle is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = \frac{H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{N} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5RN},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of particles in the star. Since most [[star]]s are composed mainly of [[ion]]ized [[hydrogen]], ''N'' equals roughly ''M''/''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of one proton. Application of the equipartition theorem gives an estimate of the star's temperature

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle r \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{\partial r} \Bigr\rangle = \langle -H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = 
k_B T = \frac{3G M^2}{5RN}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the mass and radius of the [[Sun]] yields an estimated solar temperature of ''T''&amp;nbsp;= 14 million kelvins, very close to its core temperature of 15 million kelvins. However, the Sun is much more complex than assumed by this model—both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius—and such excellent agreement (≈7% [[approximation error|relative error]]) is partly fortuitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noyes | first = RW | year = 1982 | title = The Sun, Our Star | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-85435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star formation===
The same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for [[star formation]] in giant [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ostlie | first = DA |author2=Carroll BW | year = 1996 | title = An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics | publisher = Addison–Wesley | location = Reading, MA | isbn = 0-201-59880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity. Such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem—or, equivalently, the [[virial theorem]]—is no longer valid, i.e., when the gravitational potential energy exceeds twice the kinetic energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3G M^{2}}{5R} &gt; 3 N k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a constant density ρ for the cloud

:&lt;math&gt;
M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^{3} \rho
&lt;/math&gt;

yields a minimum mass for stellar contraction, the Jeans mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M_{\rm J}^{2} = \left( \frac{5k_{B}T}{G m_{p}} \right)^{3} \left( \frac{3}{4\pi \rho} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the values typically observed in such clouds (''T''&amp;nbsp;= 150&amp;nbsp;K, ρ&amp;nbsp;= 2{{e|&amp;minus;16}}&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) gives an estimated minimum mass of 17 solar masses, which is consistent with observed star formation. This effect is also known as the [[Jeans instability]], after the British physicist [[James Hopwood Jeans]] who published it in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jeans | first = JH | authorlink = James Hopwood Jeans | year = 1902 | title = The Stability of a Spherical Nebula | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 199 | issue = 312–320 | pages = 1–53 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1902.0012 | bibcode=1902RSPTA.199....1J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivations==

===Kinetic energies and the Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution===
The original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that, in any physical system in [[thermal equilibrium]], every particle has exactly the same average [[kinetic energy]], (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be shown using the [[Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution]] (see Figure 2), which is the probability distribution

:&lt;math&gt;
f (v) = 4 \pi 
\left( \frac{m}{2 \pi k_{\rm B} T}\right)^{3/2}\!\!v^2
\exp \Bigl(
\frac{-mv^2}{2k_{\rm B} T}
\Bigr)
&lt;/math&gt;

for the speed of a particle of mass ''m'' in the system, where the speed ''v'' is the magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (v_x,v_y,v_z).&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies to any system composed of atoms, and assumes only a [[canonical ensemble]], specifically, that the kinetic energies are distributed according to their [[Boltzmann factor]] at a temperature ''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" /&gt; The average kinetic energy for a particle of mass ''m'' is then given by the integral formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = 
\langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = 
\int _{0}^{\infty} \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}\  f(v)\  dv = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem. The same result can also be obtained by averaging the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state.&lt;ref name="configint"/&gt;

===Quadratic energies and the partition function===
More generally, the equipartition theorem states that any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] ''x'' which appears in the total energy ''H'' only as a simple quadratic term ''Ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''A'' is a constant, has an average energy of ½''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium. In this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] ''Z''(''β''), where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/(''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') is the canonical [[inverse temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Callen | first = HB | authorlink = Herbert Callen | year = 1985 | title = Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 375–377 | isbn = 0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration over the variable ''x'' yields a factor

:&lt;math&gt;
Z_{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \ e^{-\beta A x^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\beta A}},
&lt;/math&gt;

in the formula for ''Z''. The mean energy associated with this factor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{x} \rangle = - \frac{\partial \log Z_{x}}{\partial \beta} = \frac{1}{2\beta} = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem.

===General proofs===
General derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many [[statistical mechanics]] textbooks, both for the [[microcanonical ensemble]]&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and for the [[canonical ensemble]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt;
They involve taking averages over the [[phase space]] of the system, which is a [[symplectic manifold]].

To explain these derivations, the following notation is introduced. First, the phase space is described in terms of [[canonical coordinates|generalized position coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; together with their [[conjugate momentum|conjugate momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The quantities ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; completely describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system, while the quantities (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) together completely describe its [[Classical mechanics|state]].

Secondly, the infinitesimal volume
:&lt;math&gt;
d\Gamma = \prod_i  dq_i \, dp_i \,
&lt;/math&gt;

of the phase space is introduced and used to define the volume Σ(''E'', Δ''E'') of the portion of phase space where the energy ''H'' of the system lies between two limits, ''E'' and ''E''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma (E, \Delta E) = \int_{H \in \left[E, E+\Delta E \right]} d\Gamma .
&lt;/math&gt;
In this expression, Δ''E'' is assumed to be very small, Δ''E''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''E''. Similarly, Ω(''E'') is defined to be the total volume of phase space where the energy is less than ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega (E) = \int_{H &lt; E} d\Gamma.\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Since Δ''E'' is very small, the following integrations are equivalent

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]} \ldots d\Gamma  = \Delta E \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E} \ldots d\Gamma,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ellipses represent the integrand. From this, it follows that Γ is proportional to Δ''E''

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma = \Delta E \ \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} = \Delta E \ \rho(E),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''(''E'') is the [[density of states]]. By the usual definitions of [[statistical mechanics]], the [[entropy]] ''S'' equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; log ''Ω''(''E''), and the [[temperature]] ''T'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{\partial \log \Omega}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{1}{\Omega}\,\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} .
&lt;/math&gt;

====The canonical ensemble====
In the [[canonical ensemble]], the system is in [[thermal equilibrium]] with an infinite heat bath at [[temperature]] ''T'' (in kelvins).&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt; The probability of each state in [[phase space]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]] times a [[normalization factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is chosen so that the probabilities sum to one

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. [[Integration by parts]] for a phase-space variable ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') between two limits ''a'' and ''b'' yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int  \left[ e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \right]_{x_{k}=a}^{x_{k}=b} d\Gamma_{k}+ 
\mathcal{N} \int  e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \beta \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''Γ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;= d''Γ''/d''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e., the first integration is not carried out over ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first term is usually zero, either because ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is zero at the limits, or because the energy goes to infinity at those limits. In that case, the equipartition theorem for the canonical ensemble follows immediately

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \,d\Gamma = 
\Bigl\langle x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \frac{1}{\beta} = k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the averaging symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ensemble average]] taken over the [[canonical ensemble]].

====The microcanonical ensemble====
In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from the rest of the world, or at least very weakly coupled to it.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Hence, its total energy is effectively constant; to be definite, we say that the total energy ''H'' is confined between ''E'' and ''E''+d''E''. For a given energy ''E'' and spread d''E'', there is a region of [[phase space]] Σ in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of [[phase space]] is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble. Given these definitions, the equipartition average of phase-space variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr \rangle &amp;=
\frac{1}{\Sigma}   \, \int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;=\frac{\Delta E}{\Sigma}\, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\rho} \,\frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial \left( H - E \right)}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows because ''E'' is a constant that does not depend on ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. [[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields the relation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial ( H - E )}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma &amp;= 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}} \bigl( x_{m} ( H - E ) \bigr) \,d\Gamma - 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \delta_{mn} ( H - E ) d\Gamma\\
&amp;=  \delta_{mn} \int_{H &lt; E} ( E - H ) \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
since the first term on the right hand side of the first line is zero (it can be rewritten as an integral of ''H'' − ''E'' on the [[hypersurface]] where ''H'' = ''E'').

Substitution of this result into the previous equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \frac{1}{\rho} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}\left( E - H \right)\,d\Gamma  = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{1}{\rho}  \, \int_{H &lt; E} \,d\Gamma = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{\Omega}{\rho}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} &lt;/math&gt; the equipartition theorem follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{1}{\Omega} \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1}  = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{\partial \log \Omega} {\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1} = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have derived the [[#General_formulation_for_all_energies|general formulation of the equipartition theorem]]

&lt;div style="border:2px solid black; padding:3px; margin-left: 0em; width: 250px;
text-align:left"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

which was so useful in the [[#Applications|applications]] described above.

==Limitations==
[[Image:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|frame|right|Figure 9. Energy is ''not'' shared among the various [[normal modes]] in an isolated system of ideal coupled [[harmonic oscillator|oscillators]]; the energy in each mode is constant and independent of the energy in the other modes. Hence, the equipartition theorem does ''not'' hold for such a system in the [[microcanonical ensemble]] (when isolated), although it does hold in the [[canonical ensemble]] (when coupled to a heat bath). However, by adding a sufficiently strong nonlinear coupling between the modes, energy will be shared and equipartition holds in both ensembles.]]

===Requirement of ergodicity===
{{See also|Ergodicity|Chaos theory|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Solitons}}

The law of equipartition holds only for [[ergodic hypothesis|ergodic]] systems in [[thermal equilibrium]], which implies that all states with the same energy must be equally likely to be populated.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Consequently, it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external [[heat bath]] in the [[canonical ensemble]]. The number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be ergodic is small; a famous example is the [[dynamical billiards|hard-sphere system]] of [[Yakov G. Sinai|Yakov Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arnold | first = VI | authorlink = Vladimir Arnold |author2=Avez A | year = 1957 | title = Théorie ergodique des systèms dynamiques | publisher = Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  (English edition: Benjamin-Cummings, Reading, Mass. 1968)|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements for isolated systems to ensure [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]]—and, thus equipartition—have been studied, and provided motivation for the modern [[chaos theory]] of [[dynamical system]]s. A chaotic [[Hamiltonian system]] need not be ergodic, although that is usually a good assumption.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" /&gt;

A commonly cited counter-example where energy is ''not'' shared among its various forms and where equipartition does ''not'' hold in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" &gt;{{cite book | last = Reichl | first = LE | year = 1998 | title = A Modern Course in Statistical Physics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Wiley Interscience | isbn = 978-0-471-59520-5 | pages = 326–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the system is isolated from the rest of the world, the energy in each [[normal mode]] is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the [[energy]] function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.

Another way ergodicity can be broken is by the existence of nonlinear [[soliton]] symmetries. In 1953, [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]], [[John Pasta|Pasta]], [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]] conducted [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|computer simulations]] of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] led to the development of soliton mathematics.

===Failure due to quantum effects===
{{See also|Ultraviolet catastrophe|History of quantum mechanics|Identical particles}}

The law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'' is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], which is required in the [[#Derivations|derivations of the equipartition theorem above]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Historically, the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain [[specific heats]] and [[blackbody radiation]] were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

[[Image:Et fig2.png|left|thumb|400px|Figure 10. Log–log plot of the average energy of a quantum mechanical oscillator (shown in red) as a function of temperature. For comparison, the value predicted by the equipartition theorem is shown in black. At high temperatures, the two agree nearly perfectly, but at low temperatures when ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T &lt;&lt; hν'', the quantum mechanical value decreases much more rapidly. This resolves the problem of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]: for a given temperature, the energy in the high-frequency modes (where ''hν &gt;&gt; k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'') is almost zero.]]

To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case. Neglecting the irrelevant [[zero-point energy]] term, its quantum energy levels are given by ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= nhν'', where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''ν'' is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the oscillator, and ''n'' is an integer. The probability of a given energy level being populated in the [[canonical ensemble]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]]

:&lt;math&gt;
P(E_{n}) = \frac{e^{-n\beta h\nu}}{Z},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and the denominator ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], here a [[geometric series]]

:&lt;math&gt;
Z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-n\beta h\nu} = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Its average energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} E_{n} P(E_{n}) =
\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} nh\nu \ e^{-n\beta h\nu} = 
-\frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} = 
-\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the formula for ''Z'' gives the final result&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = h\nu \frac{e^{-\beta h\nu}}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

At high temperatures, when the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is much greater than the spacing ''hν'' between energy levels, the exponential argument ''βhν'' is much less than one and the average energy becomes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', in agreement with the equipartition theorem (Figure 10). However, at low temperatures, when ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average energy goes to zero—the higher-frequency energy levels are "frozen out" (Figure 10). As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' (roughly 0.025&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10&amp;nbsp;eV).

Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy. This reasoning was used by [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]], among others, to resolve the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] of [[blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | year = 1905 | title = Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt (A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 132&amp;ndash;148 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2094597 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |language=de}}. An [[s:A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light|English translation]] is available from [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the [[electromagnetic field]] in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayleigh | first = JWS | authorlink = John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh | year = 1900 | title = Remarks upon the Law of Complete Radiation | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 49 | pages = 539–540 | doi=10.1080/14786440009463878}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ''ν'' goes to infinity; moreover, [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;

Other, more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition, such as [[identical particles]] and [[symmetry|continuous symmetries]]. The effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures. For example, the [[valence electron]]s in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few [[electronvolt]]s, which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins. Such a state, in which the density is high enough that the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] invalidates the classical approach, is called a [[degenerate matter|degenerate fermion gas]]. Such gases are important for the structure of [[white dwarf]] and [[neutron star]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At low temperatures, a [[fermionic condensate|fermionic analogue]] of the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state) can form; such [[superfluid]] electrons are responsible{{dubious|date=May 2018}} for [[superconductivity]].

'''Figurational sociology''' is a research tradition in which figurations of humans—evolving [[social network|networks]] of interdependent humans—are the unit of investigation. Although more a [[methodology|methodological]] stance than a determinate [[school]] of practice, the tradition has one essential feature:

* Concern for ''process'', not ''state''. Figurational sociology is also referred to as '''process sociology'''. This feature is an attempt to correct for an in-built language [[prejudice]] which tilts theory to [[reductionism|reduce]] processes into static elements, separating, for example, human actors from their actions. Just as linguists rely on [[etymology]] to gain a rich understanding of a word's history, which may help to understand its later uses, figurational sociologists attempt to look at the process of a social feature's emergence and evolution to gain a fuller understanding of its function in the present.

Practitioners may be said to be inspired by the ideal that the usual [[humanities]] barrier between micro (e.g. psychological) and macro (e.g. state organization) is removed, and their causal links opened to examination. As a consequence, much of the work done in the name of this approach has examined the connection between changes in psychology and personhood, on the one hand, and changes in macro social structures on the other. 

[[Norbert Elias]] is usually acknowledged as an early or primary practitioner, as a consequence of his ground-breaking 1939 work, ''[[The Civilizing Process]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16575">The '''Gittins index''' is a measure of the reward that can be achieved through a given [[stochastic process]] with certain properties, namely: the process has an ultimate termination state and evolves with an option, at each intermediate state, of terminating.  Upon terminating at a given state, the reward achieved is the sum of the probabilistic expected rewards associated with every state from the actual terminating state to the ultimate terminal state, inclusive. The index is a [[real number|real]] [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].

==Terminology==
To illustrate the theory we can take two examples from a developing sector, such as from electricity generating technologies: wind power and wave power. If we are presented with the two technologies when they are both proposed as ideas we cannot say which will be better in the long run as we have no data, as yet, to base our judgments on.&lt;ref name="Co1"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Economic Journal|last=Cowan|first=Robin|title=Tortoises and Hares:  Choice among technologies of unknown merit|date=July 1991|volume=101|issue=407|pages=801–814|doi=10.2307/2233856}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be easy to say that wave power would be too problematic to develop as it seems easier to put up lots of wind turbines than to make the long floating generators, tow them out to sea and lay the cables necessary.

If we were to make a judgment call at that early time in development we could be condemning one technology to being put on the shelf and the other would be developed and put into operation. If we develop both technologies we would be able to make a judgment call on each by comparing the progress of each technology at a set time interval such as every three months. The decisions we make about investment in the next stage would be based on those results.&lt;ref name="Co1"/&gt;

In a paper in 1979 called ''Bandit Processes and Dynamic Allocation Indices'' [[John C. Gittins]] suggests a solution for problems such as this. He takes the two basic functions of a "[[Scheduling (computing)|Scheduling]] Problem" and a "Multi-armed bandit" problem&lt;ref name="Git1"&gt;J. C. Gittins, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2985029 Bandit Processes and Dynamic Allocation Indices]'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, Vol. 41, No. 2. (1979), pp. 148&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt; and shows how these problems can be solved using ''Dynamic allocation indices''. He first takes the "Scheduling Problem" and reduces it to a machine which has to perform jobs and has a set time period, every hour or day for example, to finish each job in. The machine is given a reward value, based on finishing or not within the time period, and a probability value of whether it will finish or not for each job is calculated. The problem is "to decide which job to process next at each stage so as to maximize the total expected reward."&lt;ref name="Co1"/&gt; He then moves on to the "Multi–armed bandit problem" where each pull on a "[[Slot machine|one armed bandit]]" lever is allocated a reward function for a successful pull, and a zero reward for an unsuccessful pull. The sequence of successes forms a [[Bernoulli process]] and has an unknown probability of success. There are multiple "bandits" and the distribution of successful pulls is calculated and different for each machine. Gittins states that the problem here is "to decide which arm to pull next at each stage so as to maximize the total expected reward from an infinite sequence of pulls."&lt;ref name="Co1"/&gt;

Gittins says that "Both the problems described above involve a sequence of decisions, each of which is based on more information than its predecessors, and these both problems may be tackled by dynamic allocation indices."&lt;ref name="Git1"/&gt;

==Definition==
In applied mathematics, the "Gittins index" is a [[real number|real]] [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value associated to the state of a [[stochastic process]] with a reward function and with a probability of termination. It is a measure of the reward that can be achieved by the process evolving from that state on, under the probability that it will be terminated in future.  The "index policy" induced by the Gittins index, consisting of choosing at any time the stochastic process with the currently highest Gittins index, is the solution of some ''[[Optimal stopping|stopping problems]]'' such as the one of dynamic allocation, where a decision-maker has to maximize the total reward by distributing a limited amount of effort to a number of competing projects, each returning a stochastic reward.  If the projects are independent from each other and only one project at a time may evolve, the problem is called [[multi-armed bandit]] (one type of [[Stochastic scheduling]] problems) and the Gittins index policy is optimal.  If multiple projects can evolve, the problem is called ''Restless bandit'' and the Gittins index policy is a known good heuristic but no optimal solution exists in general.  In fact, in general this problem is [[NP (complexity)|NP-complete]] and it is generally accepted that no feasible solution can be found.

==History==
Questions about the optimal stopping policies in the context of clinical trials have been open from the 1940s and in the 1960s a few authors analyzed simple models leading to optimal index policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mitten L | year = 1960 | title = An Analytic Solution to the Least Cost Testing Sequence Problem | url = | journal = J. of Industrial Eng. | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only in the 1970s that [[John C. Gittins|Gittins]] and his collaborators demonstrated in a markovian framework that the optimal solution of the general case is an index policy whose "dynamic allocation index" is computable in principle for every state of each project as a function of the single project's dynamics.&lt;ref name="Git1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Gittins, D. M. Jones, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335176 A Dynamic Allocation Index for the Discounted Multiarmed Bandit Problem]'', Biometrika, Vol 66, No. 3. (1979), pp. 561&amp;ndash;565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the seminal paper of Gittins, [[Peter Whittle (mathematician)|Peter Whittle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Peter Whittle (mathematician)|last=Whittle|first=Peter|year=1980|title=Multi-armed Bandits and the Gittins Index|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]]|volume=42|issue=2|pages=143–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
demonstrated that the index emerges as a [[lagrangian multiplier]] from a [[dynamic programming]] formulation of the problem called ''retirement process'' and conjectured that the same index would be a good heuristic in a more general setup named ''Restless bandit''.  The question of how to actually calculate the index for [[Markov chain]]s was first addressed by Varaiya and his collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Varaiya, P., Walrand J., Buyukkoc C. (1985). "Extensions of the Multiarmed Bandit Problem." ''IEEE Trans. Autom. Control'', AC-30, 426&amp;ndash;439&lt;/ref&gt; with an algorithm that computes the indexes
from the largest first down to the smallest and by Chen and Katehakis  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen Y.R., Katehakis M.N. | year = 1986 | title = Linear programming for finite state multi-armed bandit problems | url = | journal = Math. Oper. Res. | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 180–183 | doi=10.1287/moor.11.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that standard [[Linear programming|LP]] could be used to calculate the index of a state without requiring its calculation for all states with higher index values.
LCM Kallenberg  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kallenberg L.C.M. | year = 1986 | title = A Note on MN Katehakis' and Y.-R. Chen's Computation of the Gittins Index | url = | journal = Math. Oper. Res. | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 184–186 | doi=10.1287/moor.11.1.184}}&lt;/ref&gt;   provided a parametric LP implementation to compute the indices for all states of a Markov chain.   Further, Katehakis and Veinott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Katehakis M., Veinott A. | year = 1987 | title = The multi-armed bandit problem: decomposition and computation | url = | journal = Math. Oper. Res. | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 262–268 | doi=10.1287/moor.12.2.262}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the index is the expected reward of a [[Markov decision process]] constructed over the Markov chain and known as ''Restart in State'' and can be calculated exactly by solving that problem with the ''policy iteration'' algorithm, or approximately with the ''value iteration'' algorithm. 
This approach also has the advantage of calculating the index for one specific state without having to calculate all the greater indexes and it is valid under more general state space conditions. A faster algorithm for the calculation of all indices has been obtained in 2004 by Sonin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sonin I | year = 2008 | title = A generalized Gittins index for a Markov chain and its recursive calculation | url = | journal = Statistics and Probability Letters | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 1526–1533 | doi=10.1016/j.spl.2008.01.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of his ''elimination algorithm'' for the optimal stopping of a Markov chain. In this algorithm the termination probability of the process may depend on the current state rather than being a fixed factor. A faster algorithm has been proposed in 2007 by Niño-Mora &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ni , Mora J | year = 2007 | title = A (2/3)^n Fast-Pivoting Algorithm for the Gittins Index and Optimal Stopping of a Markov Chain | url = | journal = INFORMS Journal of Computing | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 596–606 | doi=10.1287/ijoc.1060.0206}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exploiting the structure of a parametric simplex to reduce the computational effort of the pivot steps and thereby achieving the same complexity as the [[Gaussian elimination]] algorithm.

Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences, 29(1): 51-76 doi:10.1017/S0269964814000217&lt;/ref&gt; provide a solution to the problem, with potentially non-Markovian, uncountable state space reward processes, under frameworks in which, either the discount factors may be non-uniform and vary over time, or the periods of activation of each bandit may be not be fixed or uniform, subject instead to a possibly stochastic duration of activation before a change to a different bandit is allowed. The solution is based on generalized restart-in-state indices.

==Mathematical definition==

===Dynamic allocation index===
The classical definition by Gittins et al. is:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu(i)=\sup_{\tau&gt;0}\frac{
       \left\langle\sum_{t=0}^{\tau-1}\beta^t R[Z(t)]\right\rangle_{Z(0)=i}}{
       \left\langle\sum_{t=0}^{\tau-1}\beta^t        \right\rangle_{Z(0)=i}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a stochastic process, &lt;math&gt;R(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the
utility (also called reward) associated to the discrete state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the stochastic process does not
terminate, and &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot\rangle_c&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional expectation
operator given&amp;nbsp;''c'':

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle_c \doteq \sum_{x\in\chi}x P\{X=x|c\}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

===Retirement process formulation===

The dynamic programming formulation in terms of retirement process, given by Whittle, is:

:&lt;math&gt;w(i)=\inf\{k:v(i,k)=k\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v(i,k)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''value function''

:&lt;math&gt;v(i,k)=\sup_{\tau&gt;0} \left\langle \sum_{t=0}^{\tau-1} \beta^t R[Z(t)] + \beta^t k \right\rangle_{Z(0) = i} &lt;/math&gt;

with the same notation as above.  It holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\nu(i)=(1-\beta)w(i).&lt;/math&gt;

===Restart-in-state formulation===

If &lt;math&gt;Z(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a Markov chain with rewards, the interpretation of [[Michael Katehakis|Katehakis]] and Veinott (1987)  associates to every state the action of restarting from one arbitrary state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, thereby constructing a Markov decision process &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The Gittins Index of that state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the highest total reward which can be achieved on &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; if one can always choose to continue or restart from that state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;h(i)=\sup_\pi \left\langle \sum_{t=0}^{\tau-1} \beta^t R[Z^\pi(t)] \right\rangle_{Z(0) = i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; indicates a policy over &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;.  It holds that
:&lt;math&gt;h(i)=w(i)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generalized index===

If the probability of survival &lt;math&gt;\beta(i)&lt;/math&gt; depends on the state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, a generalization introduced by Sonin (2008) defines the Gittins index &lt;math&gt;\alpha(i)&lt;/math&gt; as the maximum discounted total reward per chance of termination.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(i)=\sup_{\tau&gt;0} \frac{R^\tau(i)}{Q^\tau(i)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
::&lt;math&gt;R^\tau(i)=\left\langle \sum_{t=0}^{\tau-1} R[Z(t)] \right\rangle_{Z(0) = i}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Q^\tau(i)=\left\langle 1 - \prod_{t=0}^{\tau-1} \beta[Z(t)] \right\rangle_{Z(0) = i}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\beta^t&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\prod_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta[Z(j)]&lt;/math&gt; in the definitions of &lt;math&gt;\nu(i)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w(i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(i)&lt;/math&gt;, then it holds that
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(i)=h(i)=w(i)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(i)\neq k \nu(i), \forall k&lt;/math&gt;
this observation leads Sonin to conclude that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(i)&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;\nu(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the "true meaning" of the Gittins index.

==Queueing theory==

In queueing theory, Gittins index is used to determine the optimal scheduling of jobs, e.g., in an M/G/1 queue.   The mean completion time of jobs under a Gittins index schedule can be determined using the SOAP approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article
|  title=SOAP: One Clean Analysis of All Age-Based Scheduling Policies

|  journal=Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems
|  volume=2
|  number=1
|  pages=16
|  year=2018
|  publisher=ACM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the dynamics of the queue are intrinsically Markovian, and stochasticity is due to the arrival and service processes. This is in contrast to most of the works in the learning literature, where stochasticity is explicitly accounted through a noise term.

'''Heinrich Wankel''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: Jindřich Wankel; July 15, 1821, [[Prague]] – April 5, 1897, [[Olomouc]]) was a [[Bohemian]] [[palaeontologist]] and [[archaeologist]].

Wankel was born to Damian Wankel, a clerk, and his wife Magdalena, née Schwarz in a bilingual environment. He was attending German schools in Prague and later studied Medicine at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] as a student of [[Josef Hyrtl]].

He came to work into area of [[Moravian Karst|Moravský kras]] (''Moravian Karst'', today [[Czech Republic]]) in 1847 and since 1849 lived in [[Blansko]] as a medical doctor. He started with geological exploration of the area and later with [[palaeontology]], archaeology and anthropology.

In 1850, in Blansko, he set up first ever laboratory to research fossil bones from [[Cenozoic Era]] where he assembled complete skeleton of [[cave bear]] (until then such bones were used for [[spodium]] in nearby sugar refinery [http://www.boskowan.com/region/sloupsko/wankel.htm]). His most famous discovery (1872) was burial site of a nobleman from [[Bronze Age]] at ''[[Býčí skála Cave|Býčí skála]]'', with skeletons of 40 ritually killed young women ([http://www.showcaves.com/english/cz/caves/ByciSkala.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20051224100103/http://www.moravskykras.net/byciskala.html]).

His grandson [[Karel Absolon]] was also famous archaeologist and worked in the same area.

==Lewontin's argument==
In the 1972 study "The Apportionment of Human Diversity", [[Richard Lewontin]] performed a [[fixation index]] (''F''&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) statistical analysis using 17 markers, including blood group proteins, from individuals across classically defined "races" (Caucasian, African, Mongoloid, South Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians, and Australian Aborigines). He found that the majority of the total genetic variation between humans (i.e., of the 0.1% of DNA that varies between individuals), 85.4%, is found within populations, 8.3% of the variation is found between populations within a "race", and only 6.3% was found to account for the racial classification. Numerous later studies have confirmed his findings.&lt;ref name = "Ramachandran"/&gt; Based on this analysis, Lewontin concluded, "Since such racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance either, no justification can be offered for its continuance."

This argument has been cited as evidence that racial categories are biologically meaningless, and that behavioral differences between groups cannot have any genetic underpinnings.&lt;ref name="Marks"/&gt; One example is the "Statement on 'Race'" published by the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1998, which rejected the existence of races as unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups.&lt;ref name = "AAA"&gt;{{Cite web

Edwards argued that while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different [[allele]]s (variants of a particular gene) at an individual [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time. This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations—the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously. Or in other words, the frequency of the alleles tends to cluster differently for different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Edwards's words, "most of the information that distinguishes populations is hidden in the correlation structure of the data." These relationships can be extracted using commonly used [[ordination (statistics)|ordination]] and [[cluster analysis]] techniques. Edwards argued that, even if the probability of misclassifying an individual based on the frequency of alleles at a single locus is as high as 30 percent (as Lewontin reported in 1972), the misclassification probability becomes close to zero if enough loci are studied.&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: promise and peril |last1=McCabe |first1=Linda L. |last2=McCabe |first2=Edward R.

Edwards's paper stated that the underlying logic was discussed in the early years of the 20th century. Edwards wrote that he and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] had presented a contrasting analysis to Lewontin's, using very similar data, already at the 1963 International Congress of Genetics. Lewontin participated in the conference but did not refer to this in his later paper. Edwards argued that Lewontin used his analysis to attack human classification in science for social reasons.&lt;ref name="McCabe"/&gt;

==Response to Edwards==

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] discusses genetic variation across human races in his book ''The Ancestor's Tale''.&lt;ref name=Dawkins /&gt;  In the chapter ''The Grasshopper's Tale'', he characterizes the genetic variation between races as a very small fraction of the total human genetic variation.  He goes on to disagree with Lewontin's conclusions about taxonomy, writing, "However small the racial partition of the total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlate with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance."&lt;ref name="Dawkins"/&gt; [[Neven Sesardic]] has argued that, unbeknownst to Edwards, Jeffry B. Mitton already made the same argument about Lewontin's claim in two articles published in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sesardic | first1 = Neven | title = Race: a social destruction of a biological concept | doi = 10.1007/s10539-009-9193-7 | journal = Biology &amp; Philosophy | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–162 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mitton | first1 = J.

Similarly, biological anthropologist [[Jonathan Marks (anthropologist)|Jonathan Marks]] agrees with Edwards that correlations between geographical areas and genetics obviously exist in human populations, but goes on to note that "What is unclear is what this has to do with 'race' as that term has been used through much in the twentieth century—the mere fact that we can find groups to be different and can reliably allot people to them is trivial. Again, the point of the theory of race was to discover large clusters of people that are principally homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, contrasting groups. Lewontin's analysis shows that such groups do not exist in the human species, and Edwards' critique does not contradict that interpretation."&lt;ref name="Marks"/&gt;

The view that, while geographic clustering of biological traits does exist, this does not lend biological validity to racial groups, was proposed by several evolutionary anthropologists and geneticists prior to the publication of Edwards critique of Lewontin.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon ''et al.'' attempt to answer the question, "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?". The answer depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity, and the populations being compared. When they analysed three geographically distinct populations (European, African and East Asian) and measured [[genetic similarity]] over many thousands of loci, the answer to their question was "never". However, measuring similarity using smaller numbers of loci yielded substantial overlap between these populations. Rates of between-population similarity also increased when geographically intermediate and admixed populations were included in the analysis.&lt;ref name="Witherspoon"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14644">'''Industrial microbiology''' is a branch of biotechnology that applies microbial sciences to create industrial products in mass quantities. There are multiple ways to manipulate a microorganism in order to increase maximum product yields. Introduction of mutations into an organism may be accomplished by introducing them to mutagens. Another way to increase production is by gene amplification, this is done by the use of plasmids, and vectors. The plasmids and/ or vectors are used to incorporate multiple copies of a specific gene that would allow more enzymes to be produced that eventually cause more product yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boundless|first=|date=2016-05-26|title=Industrial Production of Antibiotics|url=https://www.boundless.com/microbiology/textbooks/boundless-microbiology-textbook/industrial-microbiology-17/microbial-products-in-the-health-industry-199/industrial-production-of-antibiotics-1001-6911/|journal=Boundless|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manipulation of organisms in order to yield a specific product has many applications to the real world like the production of some antibiotics, vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, solvents, alcohol and daily products. They can also be used in an agricultural application and use them as a biopesticede instead of using dangerous chemicals or as inoculants and help plant proliferation.

== Medical application ==
[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|Representation of bioreactors. They are used to store the microbes while they are producing desired product of interest.]]
The medical application to industrial microbiology is the production of new drugs synthesized in a specific organism for medical purposes. [[Production of antibiotics]] is necessary for the treatment of many bacterial infections.Some natural occurring antibiotics and precursors, are produced through a process called [[fermentation]]. The microorganisms grow in a liquid media where the population size is controlled in order to yield the greatest amount of product. In this environment nutrient, pH, temperature, and oxygen are controlled also in order to maximize the amount of cells and cause them not to die before the production of the antibiotic of interest. Once the antibiotic is produced it must be extracted in order to yield an income.

Vitamins also get produced in massive quantities either by fermentation or [[biotransformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandamme|first=E. J.|date=1992-01-01|title=Production of vitamins, coenzymes and related biochemicals by biotechnological processes|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology (Oxford, Oxfordshire: 1986)|volume=53|issue=4|pages=313–327|issn=0268-2575|pmid=1368195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) for example is produced both ways. Biotransformation is mostly used for the production of riboflavin, and the carbon source starting material for this reaction is glucose. There are a few strains of microorganisms that were engineered to increase the yield of riboflavin produced. The most common organism used for this reaction is ''Ashbya gossypii''. The fermentation process is another common way to produce riboflavin. The most common organism used for production of riboflavin through fermentation is ''Eremothecium ashbyii''. Once riboflavin is produced it must be extracted from the broth, this is done by heating the cells for a certain amount of time, and then the cells can be filtered out of solution. Riboflavin is later purified and released as final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/vitamins/microbial-production-of-vitamins-an-overview/10372|title=Microbial Production of Vitamins: An Overview|date=2015-09-21|newspaper=Biology Discussion|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzymes can be produced through fermentation either by submerged fermentation and/ or by solid state fermentation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527630233.ch5/summary|title=Industrial Biotechnology|last=Singhania|first=Reeta Rani|last2=Patel|first2=Anil Kumar|last3=Pandey|first3=Ashok|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In this process the contact with oxygen is essential.  The bioreactors/fermentors that are used to do these mass production of product can store up to 500 cubic meters in volume. Solid state fermentation is less common than submerged fermentation, but has many benefits. There is less need for the environment to be sterile since there is less water, there is a higher stability and concentration for the end product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Insulin]] synthesis is done through the fermentation process and the use of recombinant ''E.coli'' or yeast in order to make human insulin also called Humulin''.''

=== Fermentation ===
_Fermentation is a reaction where sugar can be converted into a gas, alcohols or acids. _Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria are used to massively produce the many things. Drinking alcohol also known as ethanol is produced by yeast and bacteria.
_Ethanol can also be used as a fuel source. _The drinking alcohol is produced from natural sugars like glucose. 
_Carbon dioxide is produced as a side product in this reaction and can be used to make bread, and can also be used to carbonate beverages.
FermentationWine :
_Alcoholic beverages like beer and wine are fermented by microorganisms when there is no oxygen present.

 In this process, once there is enough alcohol and carbon dioxide around in the media the yeast start to die due to the environment becoming toxic to them. There are many strains of yeast and bacteria that can tolerate different amounts of alcohol around in their environment before it becoming toxic, thus one can obtain different alcohol levels in beer and wine, just by selecting a different microbial strain.
_Most yeast can tolerate between 10 and 15 percent alcohol, but there are some strains that can tolerate up to 21 percent alcohol.
_Dairy products like cheese and yogurt can also be made through fermentation using microbes. 
Cheese was produced as a way to preserve the nutrients obtained from milk, through

fermentation thus elongating the shelf-life of the product. 
_Microbes are used to convert the lactose sugars into lactic acid through fermentation. _The bacteria used for such fermentation are usually from ''Lactococci'', ''Lactobacilli'', or ''Streptococci'' families.
_Sometimes these microbes are added before or after the acidification step needed for cheese production. 
_Also these microbes are responsible for the different flavors of cheese, since they have enzymes that breakdown milk sugars and fats into multiple building blocks. 
 _Some other microbes like mold may be purposely introduced during or before the aging of the cheese, in order to give it a different flavor.

_The production of yogurt starts from the pasteurization of milk, where undesired microbes are reduced or eliminated. 
_Once the milk is pasteurized the milk is ready to be processed to reduce fat and liquid content, so what remains is mostly solid content. 
_This can be done by drying the milk so that the liquid evaporates or by adding concentrated milk. 
_Increasing the solid content of the milk also increases the nutritional value since the nutrients are more concentrated.
_After this step is accomplished, the milk is ready for fermentation where the milk gets inoculated with bacteria in hygienic stainless steel containers and then gets carefully monitored for lactic acid production, temperature and pH.

[[Biopesticide]] is a pesticide derivatized from a living organism or natural occurring substances. Biochemical pesticides can also be produced from naturally occurring substances that can control pest populations in a non-toxic matter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/what-are-biopesticides|title=What are Biopesticides?|last=EPA, OCSPP, OPP|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a biochemical pesticide is garlic and pepper based insecticides, these work by repelling insects from the desired location. Microbial pesticides, usually a virus,  bacterium, or fungus are used to control pest populations in a more specific manner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most commonly used microbe for the production of microbial bio-pesticides is ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', also known as Bt. This spore forming bacterium produces a delta-endotoxins in which it causes the insect or pest to stop feeding on the crop or plant because the endotoxin destroys the lining of the digestive system. Another mechanism that is used to reduce plant pathogens is by introducing other microbes that are non-pathogenic but compete for the rhizosphere, and succeed by producing anti fungal chemicals yielding plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpia.org/microbial-biopesticides/bacteria/|title=Microbial Biopesticides: Bacteria {{!}} Biopesticide Industry Alliance|website=www.bpia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microbial inoculant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are addition of microbes into a plant that would essentially help the plant grow by introducing nutrients, and stimulating plant growth. The preparation in mass quantities of any inoculum is performed by a process called fermentation. The first step to making it is by selecting a microbial strain, and letting it grow and increase in bacterial concentration. The greater the bacterial concentration the greater the fermentation yield would be (fermentation yield is ratio of bacterial concentration to mass of substrate)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769187429|title=Comprehensive biotechnology|last=Mike.|first=Butler,|last2=Murray.|first2=Moo-Young,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080885049|oclc=769187429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterial concentration can be measured by monitoring the turbidity, wet or dry weight,  or residual nutrient concentration. After the inoculant is ready then it gets transferred in a fermentor where oxygen and temperature most be highly monitored for the survival of the microbes and it can vary depending on the microbe that is being used.  After enough time has passed for the microbes to be properly incubated the product is ready to be extracted purified and packaged.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Synthesis of amino acids and organic solvents can also be made using microbes. The synthesis of essential amino acids such as are L-Methionine, L-Lysine, L-Tryptophan and the non-essential amino acid L-Glutamic acid are used today mainly for feed, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The production of these amino acids is due to ''Corynebacterium glutamicum'' and fermentation.  ''C.glutamicum'' was engineered to be able to produce L-lysine and L-Glutamic acid is large quantities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Microbial amino acids production (PDF Download Available)|url=http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/2.1.2822.2245|journal=ResearchGate|language=en|doi=10.13140/2.1.2822.2245}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-Glutamic acid had a high demand for production because this amino acid is used to produce [[Monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) a food flavoring agent. In 2012 the total production of L-Glutamic acid was 2.2 million tons and is produced using a submerged fermentation technique inoculated with ''C.glutamicum.'' L-Lysine was originally produced from diaminopimelic acid (DAP) by ''E.coli'', but once the ''C.glutamicum'' was discovered for the production of L-Glutamic acid.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This organism and other autotrophs were later modified to yield other amino acids such as lysine, aspartate, methionine, isoleucine and threonine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; L-Lysine is used for the feeding of pigs and chicken, as well as to treat nutrient deficiency, increase energy in a patient, and sometimes used to treat viral infections. L-Tryptophan is also produced through fermentation and by  ''Corynebacterium'' and ''E.coli,'' though the production is not as large as the rest of the amino acids it is still produced for pharmaceutical purposes since it can be converted and used to produce neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The production of organic solvents like acetone, butanol, and isopropanol through fermentation was one of the very first things to be produced by using bacteria, since achieving the necessary chirality of the products is easily achieved by using living systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-31331-8_386|title=The Prokaryotes|last=Chen|first=Jiann-Shin|last2=Zidwick|first2=Mary Jo|last3=Rogers∗|first3=Palmer|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642313301|editor-last=Rosenberg|editor-first=Eugene|location=|pages=77–134|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31331-8_386|editor-last2=DeLong|editor-first2=Edward F.|editor-last3=Lory|editor-first3=Stephen|editor-last4=Stackebrandt|editor-first4=Erko|editor-last5=Thompson|editor-first5=Fabiano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvent fermentation uses a series of ''Clostridia'' bacterial species. Solvent fermentation at first was not as productive as it is used today. The amount of bacteria required to yield a product was high, and the actual yield of product was low. Later technological advances were discovered that allowed scientist to genetically alter these strains to achieve a higher yield for these solvents. These Clostridial strains were transformed to have extra gene copies of enzymes necessary for solvent production, as well as being more tolerant to higher concentrations of the solvent being produced, since these bacteria have a range of product in which they can survive in before the environment becomes toxic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S016777990088960X/1-s2.0-S016777990088960X-main.pdf?_tid=3210d434-0b25-11e7-9c5c-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1489764184_ccc1b7bfa5e5d8a3ff38507600c46970|title=The genetic engineering of microbial solvent production - ScienceDirect|website=ac.els-cdn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yielding more strains that can use other subtrates was also another way to increase the productivity of these bacteria.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

This article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.

In DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.

{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}

== Command processing ==
The command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal — built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.

External commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.

In the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''&lt;tt&gt;[[filespec]]&lt;/tt&gt;'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''&lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt;'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a "/" or a "-" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.

The command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.

Many commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.

== DOS commands ==
A partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] follows below.

=== APPEND ===
Sets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. 
The APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).

=== ASSIGN ===
{{further|Drive letter assignment}}
The command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments. The command is available in MS-DOS 5.00.

=== ATTRIB ===
{{main|ATTRIB}}
Attrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files,

=== BACKUP and RESTORE ===
These are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.

=== BASIC and BASICA ===
{{main|IBM BASIC}}

An implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.

[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.

Microsoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.

BASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.

=== CALL ===
Starts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.

=== CD and CHDIR ===
{{main|cd (command)}}

The CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].

=== CHCP ===
The command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].

=== CHKDSK ===
{{main|CHKDSK}}

CHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective [[disk sector]]s of a volume.

=== CHOICE ===
{{main|choice (command)}}

The CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character ''choices''. Choice was introduced as an external command with MS-DOS 6.0;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/choicehl.htm|title=MS-DOS choice command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novell DOS]] 7&lt;ref name="drdos7ch7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/usergeng/07ugch7.htm|title=Caldera DR-DOS 7.03 User Guide|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PC DOS 7.0. Earlier versions of [[DR DOS]] supported this function with the built-in ''switch'' command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark.&lt;ref name="drdos7ch7" /&gt; This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== CLS ===
{{main|cls (command)}}

The CLS or CLRSCR command clears the [[Computer terminal|terminal screen]].

=== COMP ===
{{main|comp (command)}}

Show differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.

=== COPY ===
{{main|copy (command)}}

Copies files from one location to another. It is used to make copies of existing files. This command can be used to combine multiple files into target files. The destination defaults to the current directory. If multiple source files are indicated, the destination must be a directory, or an error will result. COPY has the ability to concatenate files. The command can copy in text mode or binary mode; in text mode, &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; will stop when it reaches the [[end-of-file|EOF]] character; in binary mode, the files will be concatenated in their entirety, ignoring EOF characters.

Files may be copied to devices. For example, &lt;code&gt;copy ''file'' con&lt;/code&gt; outputs ''file'' to the screen console. Devices themselves may be copied to a destination file, for example, &lt;code&gt;copy con ''file''&lt;/code&gt; takes the text typed into the console and puts it into ''FILE'', stopping when [[end-of-file|EOF]] (Ctrl+Z) is typed.

=== CTTY ===
Defines the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.

=== DATE ===
Displays the [[system date]] and prompts the user to enter a new date. Complements the [[#TIME|TIME]] command.

=== DEBUG ===
{{main|debug (command)}}

A very primitive assembler and disassambler.

=== DEFRAG ===
The command has the ability to analyze the file fragmentation on a disk drive or to [[Defragmentation|defragment]] a drive. This command is called DEFRAG in MS-DOS/PC DOS and &lt;tt&gt;diskopt&lt;/tt&gt; in [[DR-DOS]].

=== DEL and ERASE ===
{{main|del (command)}}

DEL (or the alternative form ERASE) is used to delete one or more files.

=== DELTREE ===
{{main|DELTREE}}

Deletes a directory along with all of the files and subdirectories that it contains. Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. We know that the RD(RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty. DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory if the directory is not empty.

The &lt;code&gt;deltree&lt;/code&gt; command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS|Microsoft DOS]] [[Operating system|Operating Systems]].  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher, and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.

 DELTREE[/Y][DRIVE:][PATH]

=== DIR ===
{{main|dir (command)}}

The DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS. The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.

=== ECHO ===
{{main|echo (command)}}

The ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the [[Standard streams|standard output stream.]] (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of ''echo'' can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.

Another important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the &lt;code&gt;@echo off&lt;/code&gt; statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a "tidier" output (the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)

EDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS 5 and 6, OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and W2k and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the DOS ''E'' Editor and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.

=== EDLIN ===
{{main|Edlin}}

DOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.

In DOS 5, an extra command "?" was added to give the user much-needed help.

DOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks, while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.

=== EXE2BIN ===
{{main|exe2bin}}

Converts an [[executable]] ([[.exe]]) file into a [[binary file]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] [[COM file|.com]], which is a memory image of the program.

The size of the resident [[Code segment|code]] and [[Data segment|data sections]] combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB. The file must also have no [[Call stack|stack segment]].

=== EXIT ===
{{main|exit (command)}}

Exits the current command processor.  If the exit is used at the primary command, it has no effect unless in a DOS window under Microsoft Windows, in which case the window is closed and the user returns to the desktop.

=== FASTOPEN ===
{{main|FASTOPEN}}

=== FC ===
{{main|Microsoft File Compare}}

Show differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.

=== FDISK ===
{{main|fdisk}}

The FDISK command manipulates hard disk [[partition table]]s. The name derives from IBM's habit of calling hard drives ''fixed disks''. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or [[Disk partitioning|logical DOS drive]]. It can also install a standard [[master boot record]] on the hard drive.

=== FIND ===
{{main|Find (Windows)}}

The FIND command is a [[Filter (software)|filter]] to find lines in the input [[data stream]] that contain or don't contain a specified [[String (computer science)|string]] and send these to the output data stream. It may also be used as a [[Pipeline (software)|pipe]].
&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;find /V "any string" FileName
&lt;/source&gt;

=== FOR ===
{{main|For loop}}

The FOR loop can be used to [[parse]] a file or the output of a command.

=== FORMAT ===
{{main|format (command)}}

Deletes the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] entries and the [[root directory]] of the drive/partition, and reformats it for MS-DOS. In most cases, this should only be used on floppy drives or other [[removable media]]. This command can potentially erase everything on a computer's drive.

=== GRAPHICS ===
A TSR program to enable the sending of graphical screen dump to printer by pressing &lt;Print Screen&gt;.

=== HELP ===
{{main|help (command)}}

Gives help about DOS commands.
;MS-DOS
:help 'command' would give help on a specific command.  By itself, it lists the contents of DOSHELP.HLP.
:MS-DOS 6.xx help command uses [[QBASIC]] to view a quickhelp HELP.HLP file, which contains more extensive information on the commands, with some hyperlinking etc.  The MS-DOS 6.22 help system is included on Windows 9x cdrom versions as well.
;PC DOS
:PC DOS 5,6 help is the same form as MS-DOS 5 help command.
:PC DOS 7.xx help uses view.exe to open OS/2 style .INF files (cmdref.inf, dosrexx.inf and doserror.inf), opening these to the appropriate pages.
;DR-DOS
:In DR-DOS, help is a batch file that launches DR-DOS' reference, &lt;tt&gt;dosbook&lt;/tt&gt;.
;Microsoft Windows
:Windows NT, all versions, uses DOS 5 style help, but versions before VISTA have also a Windows help file (NTCMDS.HLP or NTCMDS.INF) in a similar style to MS-DOS 6.

=== IF ===
{{main||Control flow}}

Evaluate the condition, and only if it is true,  then it execute the remainder of the command line
Otherwise, it skips the remainder of the line and continues with next command line. 

Used in [[Batch_file|Batch files]].

=== INTERSVR and INTERLNK ===
In MS-DOS; &lt;tt&gt;filelink&lt;/tt&gt; in DR-DOS.

Network PCs using a [[null modem cable]] or [[LapLink cable]]. The server-side version of InterLnk, it also immobilizes the machine it's running on as it is an active app (As opposed to a [[Terminate and Stay Resident|TSR]] app) which must be running for any transfer to take place. DR-DOS' &lt;tt&gt;filelink&lt;/tt&gt; is executed on both the client and server.

New in PC DOS 5.02, MS-DOS 6.0&lt;ref name="murdock" /&gt;

=== JOIN ===
The JOIN command attaches a drive letter to a specified directory on another drive.&lt;ref name="murdock"&gt;[http://www.easydos.com/dosindex.html EasyDOS Command Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite can be achieved via the [[#SUBST|SUBST]] command.

=== LABEL ===
{{main|label (command)}}
Changes the label on a logical drive, such as a hard disk partition or a floppy disk.

=== LOADFIX ===
Loads a program above the first 64K of memory, and runs the program. The command is included only in MS-DOS/PC DOS. DR-DOS used &lt;tt&gt;memmax&lt;/tt&gt;, which opened or closed lower, upper, and video memory access, to block the lower 64K of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DR DOS 6.0 User Guide|publisher=Digital Research|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LOADHIGH and LH ===
{{Main|loadhigh}}

''hiload'' in DR-DOS.

=== MD or MKDIR ===
{{main|mkdir}}

Makes a new [[directory (file systems)|directory]]. The parent of the directory specified will be created if it does not already exist.

=== MEM ===
Displays memory usage. It is capable of displaying program size and status, memory in use, and internal drivers.It is internal command.

=== MEMMAKER ===
Starting with version 6, MS-DOS included the external program MemMaker which was used to free system memory (especially [[Conventional memory]]) by automatically reconfiguring the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] and [[CONFIG.SYS]] files. This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether he/she wanted to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver.  MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = Que Publishing | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&amp;q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in MS&amp;nbsp;DOS&amp;nbsp;7 / Windows&amp;nbsp;95. PC DOS uses another program RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.  RamBoost was licensed to IBM by [[Central Point Software]].

=== MODE ===
Configures system devices. Changes graphics modes, adjusts keyboard settings, prepares [[code page]]s, and sets up port redirection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/modehlp.htm|title=MS-DOS mode command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MORE ===
{{main|more (command)}}

The MORE command [[Pagination|paginates]] text, so that one can view files containing more than one screen of text. ''More'' may also be used as a [[Filter (software)|filter]]. While viewing MORE text, the return key displays the next line, the space bar displays the next page.

=== MOVE ===
{{main|move (command)}}

Moves files or renames directories. DR-DOS used a separate command for renaming directories, &lt;code&gt;rendir&lt;/code&gt;.

=== MSCDEX ===
{{main|MSCDEX}}

MSCDEX is a driver executable which allows [[DOS]] programs to recognize, read, and control [[CD-ROM]]s.

=== MSD ===
{{main|Microsoft Diagnostics}}

The MSD command provides detailed technical information about the computer's hardware and software. MSD was new in MS-DOS 6;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/msdhlp.htm|title=MS-DOS msd command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the PC DOS version of this command is QCONFIG.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  The command appeared first in Word2, and then in Windows 3.10.

=== PATH ===
Displays or sets a search [[Path (computing)|path]] for executable files.

=== PAUSE ===
Suspends processing of a batch program and displays the message 'Press any key to continue. . .', if not given other text to display.

=== PRINT ===
{{main|PRINT (command)}}

The PRINT command adds or removes files in the [[print queue]]. This command was introduced in MS-DOS version 2. Before that there was no built-in support for background printing files. The user would usually use the copy command to copy files to LPT1.

=== RD or RMDIR ===
{{main|rmdir}}

Remove a directory (delete a directory); by default the directories must be empty of files for the command to succeed.  The [[List of DOS commands#DELTREE|deltree]] command in some versions of MS-DOS and all versions of [[Windows 9x]] removes non-empty directories.

=== RECOVER ===
{{main|recover (command)}}

=== REM ===
Remark ([[comment (computer programming)|comment]]) command, normally used within a [[batch file]], and for DR-DOS, PC/MS-DOS 6 and above, in CONFIG.SYS. This command is processed by the command processor. Thus, its output can be redirected to create a zero-byte file. REM is useful in logged sessions or screen-captures. One might add comments by way of labels, usually starting with double-colon (::).   These are not processed by the command processor.

=== REN ===
{{main|ren (command)}}

The REN command renames a file. Unlike the &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; command, this command cannot be used to rename subdirectories, or rename files across drives. Mass renames can be accomplished by the use of the wildcards characters asterisk (*) and question mark (?).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490987.aspx |title=Microsoft TechNet Rename (ren) article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SCANDISK ===
{{main|Microsoft ScanDisk}}

Disk diagnostic utility. Scandisk was a replacement for the &lt;code&gt;chkdsk&lt;/code&gt; utility, starting with later versions of MS-DOS. Its primary advantages over &lt;code&gt;chkdsk&lt;/code&gt; is that it is more reliable and has the ability to run a surface scan which finds and marks bad clusters on the disk. It also provided mouse point-and-click [[Text user interface|TUI]], allowing for interactive session to complement command-line batch run.
&lt;code&gt;chkdsk&lt;/code&gt; had surface scan and bad cluster detection functionality included, and was used again on Windows NT based operating systems.

=== SET ===
Sets [[environment variable]]s.  [[cmd.exe]] in Windows NT 2000, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and a number of third-party solutions allow direct entry of environment variables from the command prompt. From at least Windows 2000, the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; command allows for the evaluation of strings into variables, thus providing ''inter alia'' a means of performing integer arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SETVER ===
SetVer is a [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program designed to return a different value to the version of DOS that is running.  This allows programs that look for a specific version of DOS to run under a different DOS.

Setver appeared in version 4, and has been in every version of DOS, OS/2 and Windows NT since.

=== SHARE ===
{{main|share (command)}}

Installs support for file sharing and locking capabilities.

=== SMARTDRV ===
{{Main|SmartDrive}}

=== SORT ===
A [[Filter (software)|filter]] to sort lines in the input data stream and send them to the output data stream. Similar to the Unix command &lt;code&gt;[[Sort (Unix)|sort]]&lt;/code&gt;. Handles files up to 64k. This sort is always case insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722869.aspx|title=Microsoft on "sort"|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SUBST ===
{{main|SUBST}}

A utility to map a subdirectory to a drive letter.&lt;ref name="murdock" /&gt; The opposite can be achieved via the [[#JOIN|JOIN]] command.
commands the drive letter to main.

=== SYS ===
{{main|SYS (command)}}

A utility to make a volume bootable.  Sys rewrites the Volume Boot Code (the first sector of the partition that SYS is acting on) so that the code, when executed, will look for [[IO.SYS]].  SYS also copies the core DOS system files, IO.SYS, [[MSDOS.SYS]], and [[COMMAND.COM]], to the volume.  SYS does ''not'' rewrite the Master Boot Record, contrary to widely held belief.

=== TIME ===
{{main|TIME (command)}}

Display the [[system time]] and waits for the user to enter a new time.  Complements the [[#DATE|DATE]] command.

 [Hours][Min][Sec]

=== TITLE===
{{main|title (command)}}
Enables a user to change the title of their MS-DOS window.

=== TREE ===
{{main|tree (command)}}
It is an external command, graphically displays the path of each directory and sub-directories on the specified drive.

=== TRUENAME ===
The TRUENAME command will expand the name of a file, directory, or drive, and display the result. It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through &lt;tt&gt;SUBST&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;JOIN&lt;/tt&gt; to find the actual directory.

MS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt; includes &lt;tt&gt;C:\PROGRAMS&lt;/tt&gt;, and file &lt;tt&gt;MYPROG.EXE&lt;/tt&gt; is on this directory, then if &lt;code&gt;MYPROG&lt;/code&gt; is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute &lt;code&gt;C:\PROGRAMS\MYPROG.EXE&lt;/code&gt;. In this case,

 TRUENAME MYPROG

would display

 C:\PROGRAMS\MYPROG.EXE

This command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch "&lt;tt&gt;/?&lt;/tt&gt;" defines it as a "Reserved command name". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the Unix [[which (Unix)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function &lt;code&gt;realpath&lt;/code&gt; performs this function. The Microsoft Windows command processors do not support this command.
&lt;real code.st&gt;

=== TYPE ===
{{main|TYPE (DOS command)}}

Displays a file. The &lt;tt&gt;[[List of DOS commands#MORE|more]]&lt;/tt&gt; command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;type ''long-text-file'' | more&lt;/tt&gt;. TYPE can be used to concatenate files (type file1 file2 &gt; file3); however this won't work for large files{{dubious|date=November 2014}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}—use copy command instead.

=== UNDELETE ===
{{main|Undeletion}}

Restores file previously deleted with &lt;tt&gt;del&lt;/tt&gt;. By default all recoverable files in the working directory are restored; options are used to change this behavior. If the MS-DOS &lt;tt&gt;mirror&lt;/tt&gt; [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program is used, then deletion tracking files are created and can be used by &lt;tt&gt;undelete&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== VER ===
{{main|ver (command)}}

An internal DOS command, that reports the DOS version presently running, and since MS-DOS 5, whether DOS is loaded high.  The corresponding command to report the Windows version is &lt;code&gt;winver&lt;/code&gt;. Values returned:
* MS-DOS up to 6.22, typically derive the DOS version from the DOS kernel.  This may be different from the string it prints when it starts.
* PC DOS typically derive the version from an internal string in command.com (so PC DOS 6.1 command.com reports the version as 6.10, although the kernel version is 6.00.)
* DR-DOS reports whatever value the environment variable OSVER reports.
* OS/2 command.com reports an internal string, with the OS/2 version.  The underlying kernel here is 5.00, but modified to report x0.xx (where x.xx is the OS/2 version).
* Windows 9x command.com report a string from inside command.com.  The build version (e.g. 2222), is also derived from there.
* Windows NT command.com reports either the 32-bit processor string (4nt, cmd), or under some loads, MS-DOS 5.00.500, (for all builds).  The underlying kernel reports 5.00 or 5.50 depending on the interrupt. MS-DOS 5.00 commands run unmodified on NT.
* The Winver command usually displays a Windows dialog showing the version, with some information derived from the shell.  In windows before Windows for workgroups 3.11, running winver from DOS reported an embedded string in winver.exe.

=== VERIFY ===
Enables or disables the feature to determine if files have been correctly written to disk. If no parameter is provided, the command will display the current setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/verify.html|title=DOS Command: VERIFY|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== XCOPY ===
{{main|XCOPY}}

Copy entire directory trees. Xcopy is a version of the copy command that can move files and directories from one location to another.

This following is a '''list of case colors and styles that have been produced for the [[Nintendo 3DS family]]''' of [[handheld game console]]s produced by [[Nintendo]]. Although the system initially launched with only two colors, its lineup has subsequently expanded to incorporate many more color varieties and limited editions, some of which are exclusive to various regions. As such, the list includes all color variations of regular [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[New Nintendo 3DS]], as well as their larger models, the [[Nintendo 3DS XL]] and [[New Nintendo 3DS XL]] along with the Chinese version, the [[iQue#iQue 3DS XL|iQue 3DS XL]], and the entry-level versions, the [[Nintendo 2DS]] and [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]].

The '''Little Joe 2''' was a test of the [[Mercury program|Mercury]] space capsule, carrying the [[Animals in space|rhesus monkey Sam]] (''Macaca mulatta'') close to the edge of space. He was sent to test the space equipment and the adverse effects of space on humans.

[[File:B60-00036.jpg|left|thumb|Sam, the rhesus monkey flown aboard Little Joe 2]]
The flight was launched December 4, 1959, at 11:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET from [[Wallops Island]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. Little Joe 2 flew to an altitude of 55 miles (88&amp;nbsp;km) . It was recovered, with the monkey intact, in the Atlantic Ocean by [[USS Borie (DD-704)|USS ''Borie'']]. Sam was one of a series of [[monkeys in space]]. Sam, from the School of Aviation Medicine in San Antonio, Texas, received his name as an acronym of the facility. The flight time was 11 minutes, 6 seconds, with a payload of 1,007&amp;nbsp;kg.

The [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Mercury spacecraft used in the Little Joe 2 mission is currently displayed at Airpower Park and Museum, Hampton, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americanspacecraft.com/pages/address/a-f/airpower.html| title=Mercury ''Little Joe 2'' spacecraft display page on A Field Guide to American Spacecraft website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">'''Mathematics mastery''' is an approach to [[mathematics education]] which is based on [[mastery learning]] in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing.  This technique is used in countries such as China and [[Singapore math|Singapore]] where good results have been achieved and so the approach is now being promoted in the [[UK]] by people such as schools minister [[Nick Gibb]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCETM/&gt;&lt;ref name=MM/&gt;&lt;ref name=TES/&gt;  Chinese teachers were brought to the UK to demonstrate the Shanghai mastery approach in 2015.&lt;ref name=G2/&gt;  A trial was made in the UK with about 10,000 students of ages 5–6 and 11–12.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  In one year, test scores indicated that the students were about a month ahead of students in schools using other approaches.&lt;ref name=G/&gt; This result was considered small but significant.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

The National Association of Mathematics Advisers has highlighted five issues in understanding this approach.&lt;ref name=NAMA/&gt;
#Variation in the methods promoted by different organisations
#The extent of [[differentiated instruction|differentiation]] 
#The content of the [[curriculum]] 
#The amount of practise and repetition
#The choice and use of textbooks

An '''optical instrument''' either processes [[light wave]]s to enhance an image for viewing, or analyzes light waves (or [[photon]]s) to determine one of a number of characteristic properties.

==Image enhancement==
[[File:Optical Devices England 1858.jpg|thumb|An illustration of some of the optical devices available for laboratory work in England in 1858.]]
{{further|Viewing instrument}}
The first optical instruments were [[telescope]]s used for magnification of distant images, and [[microscope]]s used for magnifying very tiny images. Since the days of [[Galileo]] and [[Van Leeuwenhoek]], these instruments have been greatly improved and extended into other portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The [[binoculars|binocular]] device is a generally compact instrument for both eyes designed for mobile use. A [[camera]] could be considered a type of optical instrument, with the [[pinhole camera]] and ''[[camera obscura]]'' being very simple examples of such devices.

==Analysis==
Another class of optical instrument is used to analyze the properties of [[light]] or optical materials. They include:

*[[Interferometer]] for measuring the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] properties of light waves
*[[Photometer]] for measuring light intensity
*[[Polarimeter]] for measuring dispersion or rotation of polarized light
*[[Spectrophotometer|Reflectometer]] for measuring the [[reflectivity]] of a surface or object
*[[Refractometer]] for measuring [[refractive index]] of various materials, invented by [[Ernst Abbe]]
*[[Spectrometer]] or [[monochromator]] for generating or measuring a portion of the optical spectrum, for the purpose of chemical or material analysis
*[[Autocollimator]] which is used to measure angular deflections
* [[Vertometer]] which is used to determine refractive power of lenses such as glasses, contact lenses and magnifier lens

[[DNA sequencer]]s can be considered optical instruments as they analyse the ''color'' and intensity of the light emitted by a fluorochrome attached to a specific nucleotide of a DNA strand.

[[Surface plasmon resonance]]-based instruments use refractometry to measure and analyze biomolecular interactions.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HeinsPerepitea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Thane Heins and his machine.]]  --&gt;
'''Perepiteia''' is claimed to be a new generator developed by the [[Canada|Canadian]] inventor Thane Heins. The device is named after the Greek word for [[Peripeteia|peripety]], a dramatic reversal of circumstances or turning point in a story. The device was quickly attributed the term "[[perpetual motion machine]]" by several media outlets. Due to the [[History of perpetual motion machines|long history of hoaxes and failures of perpetual motion machines]] and the incompatibility of such a device with [[Second law of thermodynamics|accepted principles of physics]], Heins' claims about Perepiteia have been treated with considerable skepticism.

In 2003, Heins filed a [[patent application]] in Canada&lt;ref name="Patent Application"&gt;{{Cite patent|CA|2437745|application}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no [[patent]] was granted.&lt;ref name="Patent Dead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2437745/summary.html?query=2437745&amp;start=1&amp;num=50&amp;type=basic_search|title=Canadian Patent Database |first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Canadian Intellectual Property|last=Office|website=brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heins also founded Potential Difference Inc, the website of which contains a series of videos of the inventor demonstrating the machine.&lt;ref name="Demonstration Page on Potential Difference website"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g9toengineering.com/backemf/demonstration.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208205509/http://www.g9toengineering.com/backemf/demonstration.htm |archivedate=2008-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; US patent #9,230,730&lt;ref name="US patent #9,230,730"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9230730.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9230730&amp;RS=PN/9230730|title=United States Patent: 9230730 - Bi-toroidal topology transformer|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued in 2016 pertaining to another of Thane's inventions, a bi-toroidal topology transformer.

Heins has recently stated that he is unsure whether or not the machine really produces energy, but in communications with science writer David Bradley of ScienceBase, Heins made claims of up to 7000% efficiency for the bi-toroidal transformer.&lt;ref name="Sciencebase article on Sciencebase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/potential-difference-transformation.html|title=Free energy with magnetic reluctance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130114146/http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/potential-difference-transformation.html|archivedate=30 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heins, who reportedly works 8–12 hours a day on the Perepiteia, insists that it is viable and that "This technology should be mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/article.jsp?content=20080611_72329_72329 The next great Canadian idea: Peripiteia generator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203130557/http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/article.jsp?content=20080611_72329_72329 |date=2009-02-03 }} by Sharda Prashad, Canadian Business magazine, July 11, 2008. (retrieved on January 3, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Mechanically, the device appears to be an [[induction motor]] with a magnetic material placed inside the rotor core.&lt;ref name="BeamMeUp analysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrfrbeameup.blogspot.com/2008/02/thane-heins-perepiteia-device.html|title=Thane Heins' Perepiteia device|first=Beam Me|last=Up|date=6 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heins believes that the device's potential may rest in its atypical manipulation of the [[Back emf|back electromotive force (back EMF)]].  A more detailed description of the device may be found in the patent application, minus supporting figures.&lt;ref name="Patent Application"/&gt;

The apparent unique quality of the Perepiteia machine is that instead of maintaining a certain state of motion, it appears to generate acceleration. According to Heins, the Perepiteia produces magnetic friction which somehow gets turned into a magnetic boost. Using an electric motor, the drive shaft is attached to a steel rotor with small round magnets lining its outer edges. In this set-up of a simple generator, the rotor spins so that the magnets pass by a wire coil just in front of them, generating electrical energy.

==Operation==
Perepiteia's process begins by overloading the generator to get a current, which typically causes the wire coil to build up a large electromagnetic field. Usually, this kind of electromagnetic field creates an effect called the [[Counter-electromotive force|back electromotive force (back EMF)]] due to [[Lenz's law]]. The effect should repel the spinning magnets on the rotor, and slow them down until the motor stops completely, in accordance with the law of conservation. However, instead of stopping, the rotor accelerates - i.e. the magnetic friction did not repel the magnets and wire coil. Heins states that the steel rotor and driveshaft had conducted the magnetic resistance away from the coil and back into the electric motor. In effect, the back EMF was boosting the magnetic fields used by the motor to generate electrical energy and cause acceleration. The faster the motor accelerated, the stronger the electromagnetic field it would create on the wire coil, which in turn would make the motor go even faster. Heins seemed to have created a positive feedback loop. To confirm the theory, Heins replaced part of the driveshaft with plastic pipe that wouldn't conduct the magnetic field. There was no acceleration.&lt;ref name=PhysOrg/&gt;

==Scientific examination==
In early 2008, Heins was given access to equipment to demonstrate it by professor Riadh Habash of the  [[University of Ottawa]], who says of it, "It accelerates, but when it comes to an explanation, there is no backing theory for it. That's why we're consulting MIT. But at this time we can't support any claim."&lt;ref name="Toronto Star article"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/300042#t | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Turning physics on its ear | first=Tyler | last=Hamilton | date=February 4, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After examining the machine and witnessing a demonstration, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) professor Markus Zahn admitted that he could not fully explain its operation. Although he refused to call it [[perpetual motion]], he stated that it might be an extremely efficient motor.&lt;ref name="Popular Fidelity article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popfi.com/2008/02/07/the-chef-who-could-change-the-world-of-physics/|title=The Chef Who Could Change The World of Physics » Popular Fidelity » Unusual Stuff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the device, Zahn stated that "It's an unusual phenomena{{sic}} I wouldn't have predicted in advance. But I saw it. It's real. Now I'm just trying to figure it out...To my mind this is unexpected and new, and it's worth exploring all the possible advantages once you're convinced it's a real effect."&lt;ref name="Gizmodo Article"&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/353655/perepiteia-perpetual+motion-machine-may-actually-dosomething Perepiteia Perpetual-Motion Machine May Actually Do...Something], gizmodo.com, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if Perepiteia does not produce [[perpetual motion]], Zahn still believes that the device could have considerable practical applications, noting that "There are an infinite number of induction machines in people's homes and everywhere around the world. If you could make them more efficient, cumulatively, it could make a big difference."&lt;ref name=PhysOrg&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news121610315.html Inventor Doesn't Dare Say 'Perpetual Motion Machine'], Physorg.com, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Zahn later stated in an interview that "I can't understand how [Heins] can even breathe the words 'perpetual motion.' He plugs it into the wall." In a subsequent e-mail to Heins, Zahn wrote that: "Any talk of perpetual motion, over unity efficiency, etc. discredits you, now me, and your ideas." Zahn further stated that he would not endorse Heins' device until "the foolishness is stopped of hinting that your motor violates fundamental laws of physics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080320131421/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=31887883-be00-4d3c-8763-d96564794cae An Internet commotion over 'perpetual motion'], ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' (reprinted by Canada.com), March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the system have pointed out that the system described by Heins simply demonstrates a change in the motor's [[Rolling resistance|hysteresis drag]], increasing the speed of the rotor but not producing any energy.&lt;ref name="Slashdot Article with Explanations"&gt;[http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/09/1436257 Slashdot | Yet Another Perpetual Motion Device&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Verify credibility|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when the rotor exhibits acceleration following a specific [[Short circuit|electrical short-out]], the device is merely more efficiently converting the input electricity to [[mechanical energy]] than in the other test configurations.

On February 29, 2008, six members of [http://ottawaskeptics.org/ Ottawa Skeptics], met at the Colonel By building at the [[University of Ottawa]] to witness a demonstration of Perepiteia. Heins, who conducted the demonstration, later met with the members to discuss his device and answer questions. In a subsequent report released in May, Ottawa Skeptics expressed severe doubts about Heins' claims regarding Perepiteia. They noted that Perepiteia produces either observed acceleration or a slight increase in [[Electric generator|generator electrical]] output but that this alone does not automatically mean that "free energy" or perpetual motion is being produced or that there is a "real and measurable effect." While acknowledging that the speed-up behaviour of the generator cannot be fully explained, they stated that there is no evidence that Perepiteia "represents any challenge to currently known laws of physics."&lt;ref name="Ottawa Skeptics Report"&gt;[http://ottawaskeptics.org/local-investigations/121-in-this-town-we-obey-the-laws-of-thermodynamics In This Town We Obey the Laws of Thermodynamics] by Seanna Watson, Ottawa Skeptics May 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2009, a skeptic writing under the name Natan Weissman wrote an explanation of Perepiteia in relation to its motor, a [[Ryobi]] bench grinder. The author states that the acceleration behavior of the machine is due to the consumption of [[torque]] from the [[induction motor]], rather than any unconventional manipulation of [[Electromagnetic field]]s or [[Counter-electromotive force]].&lt;ref name="Thane Heins Perepiteia Explained"&gt;[http://www.sciscoop.com/perepiteia-explanation.pdf Explanation of the Perepiteia rotating machine and the accompanying theory concerning "Back EMF"] by Natan Weissman, SciScoop, May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2013, posting in response to questions ''Pure Energy Blog'', Heins provided an explanation of his claims, stating that: "A generator that requires a 1 Watt increase in mechanical drive shaft power to deliver 1 Watt of electrical power to a load would be 100% efficient. A generator that delivers 0.95 Watts with a 1 Watt increase in mechanical drive shaft power from no-load to on-load would be 95% efficient."&lt;ref name="Thane Heins Allows Open License of his Regenerative Acceleration (ReGenX) Technology"&gt;[http://www.pureenergyblog.com/2013/06/09/1285/8502328_thane-heins-allows-open-license-of-his-regenerative-acceleration-regenx-technology/ Thane Heins Allows Open License of his Regenerative Acceleration (ReGenX) Technology] by Sterling D.

'''Petrus Apianus''' (April 16, 1495 – April 21, 1552), also known as '''Peter Apian''', '''Peter Bennewitz''', and '''Peter Bienewitz''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[Humanism|humanist]], known for his works in [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[cartography]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; His work on "[[cosmography]]", the field that dealt with the earth and its position in the universe and presented in his most famous works, ''Astronomicum Caesareum'' (1540) and ''Cosmographicus liber'' (1524) which were extremely influential in his time with the numerous editions in multiple languages being published until 1609. The lunar crater ''[[Apianus (crater)|Apianus]]'' and asteroid [[19139&amp;nbsp;Apian]] are named in his honour.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Life and work ==
Apianus was born as '''Peter Bienewitz''' (or '''[[Bennewitz]]''') in [[Leisnig]] in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]; his father, Martin, was a [[shoemaker]]. The family was relatively well off, belonging to the middle-class citizenry of Leisnig. Apianus was educated at the [[Latin]] school in [[Rochlitz]]. From 1516 to 1519 he studied at the [[University of Leipzig]]; during this time, he Latinized his name to Apianus (lat. ''apis'' means "bee"; "Biene" is the German word for bee).

In 1519, Apianus moved to [[Vienna]] and continued his studies at the [[University of Vienna]], which was considered one of the leading universities in geography and mathematics at the time and where [[Georg Tannstetter]] taught. When the [[bubonic plague|plague]] broke out in Vienna in 1521, he completed his studies with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and moved to [[Regensburg]] and then to [[Landshut]]. At Landshut, he produced his ''Cosmographicus liber'' (1524), a highly respected work on [[astronomy]] and [[navigation]] which was to see at least 30 reprints in 14 languages and that remained popular until the end of the 16th century. Later editions were produced by [[Gemma Frisius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0030923000360107|title=The Use of Visual Media in Renaissance Cosmography: The Cosmography of Peter Apian and Gemma Frisius|journal=Paedagogica Historica|volume=36|pages=130|year=2006|last1=Broecke|first1=Steven Vanden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His print shop started small. Among the first books he printed were the writings of [[Johann Eck]], [[Martin Luther]]'s antagonist. This print shop was active between 1543 and 1540 and became well known for its high-quality editions of geographic and cartographic works.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It is thought that he used [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]] printing techniques on woodblocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03085697008592348|title=Some evidence for the use of stereotyping on Peter Apian's world map of 1530|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=24|pages=43|year=2008|last1=Woodward|first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printer's logo included the motto ''Industria superat vires'' in  Greek, Hebrew, and Latin around the figure of a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=A.

[[File:Astronomicum Caesareum.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A volvelle from  ''Astronomicum Caesareum'' (1540)]]
Through his work, Apian became a favourite of [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Charles had praised his work (the ''Cosmographicus liber'') at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of 1530 and granted him a printing monopoly in 1532 and 1534. In 1535, the emperor made Apian an [[armiger]], i.e. granted him the right to display a [[coat of arms]]. In 1540, Apian printed the ''Astronomicum Caesareum'', dedicated to Charles V. Charles promised him a truly royal sum (3,000 golden [[Gulden (historical denomination)|guilder]]s),{{ref|1|1}} appointed him his court mathematician, and made him a ''[[Reichsritter]]'' (a Free Imperial Knight) and in 1544 even an [[Count Palatine (Imperial)|Imperial Count Palatine]]. All this furthered Apian's reputation as an eminent scientist. ''Astronomicum Caesareum'' is noted for its visual appeal. Printed and bound decoratively, with about a 100 known copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/002182867100200303|title=Apianus's Astronomicum Caesareum and its Leipzig Facsimile|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=2|issue=3|pages=168|year=2016|last1=Gingerich|first1=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; it included several [[Volvelle|volvelles]] that allowed users to calculate dates, the positions of constellations and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gislén|first=Lars|date=2017|title=Apinanus' latitude volvelles - how were they made?|url=|journal=Journal of Astronomical History and  Heritage|volume=20|pages=13–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stebbins|first=F.

On this map [[Ursa Minor]] is an old woman and three maidens, [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] is four camels and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] was illustrated as a shepherd with sheep and dog.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Stott, Celestial Charts, Antique Maps of the Heavens, 1995, Studio Editions, London, England P38-39&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Apian, coat of arms, leisnig - d.jpg|thumb|upright|Arms of coat of nobility Apian in [[Leisnig]] / [[Saxony]]|left]]
Despite many calls from other universities, including [[Leipzig]], [[Padua]], [[Tübingen]], and [[Vienna]], Apian remained in [[Ingolstadt]] until his death. Although he neglected his teaching duties, the university evidently was proud to host such an esteemed scientist. Apian's work included in mathematics&amp;mdash;in 1527 he published a variation of [[Pascal's triangle]], and in 1534 a table of [[sine]]s&amp;mdash; as well as astronomy. In 1531, he observed [[Halley's Comet|Halley's comet]] and noted that a [[comet]]'s tail always point away from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Peter|date=2008|title=Stoic alternatives to Aristotelian cosmology : Pena, Rothmann and Brahe, Summary|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire-des-sciences-2008-2-page-265.htm|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|language=fr|volume=Tome 61|issue=2|pages=265–286|doi=10.3917/rhs.612.0265|issn=0151-4105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] also detected this in 1531, but Apian's publication was the first to also include graphics. He designed [[sundial]]s, published manuals for astronomical instruments and crafted volvelles ("Apian wheels"), measuring instruments useful for calculating time and distance for astronomical and astrological applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolfschmidt, Gudrun|title=Peter Apian as an astronomical instrument maker|journal=Astronomische Gesellschaft Abstract Series|volume=11|page=107|bibcode=1995AGAb...11..107W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=J.

Apianus married the daughter of a councilman of Landshut, Katharina Mosner, in 1526. They would have 14 children together, five girls and nine sons, one of whom was [[Philipp Apian]] (1531–1589), who, in addition to his own research, preserved the legacy of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern.

'''Progress''' ({{lang-ru|Прогресс}}) is a [[Russia]]n (formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) research station in [[Antarctica]].  It is located at the [[Larsemann Hills]] [[antarctic oasis]] on the shore of [[Prydz Bay]].

The station was established by the 33rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.ivki.ru/kapustin/journal/dubrovin9.htm Kapustin Arctica-Antarctica philatelia]&lt;/ref&gt; on April 1, 1988 and was moved to another place on February 26, 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://south.aari.ru/stations/progress/progress_ru.html Progress Station] at [[AARI]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, work was temporarily halted but it reopened in 2003.

A landing field is located close to the station for air connection with other stations.  From 1998-2001 works were performed to transfer transportation operations to Progress from the [[Mirny Station]] and make it the main support base for [[Vostok station]].

In 2004, work began on a year-round facility at the station.  On October 4, 2008, a fire broke out at the construction site resulting in the death of a construction worker and two serious injuries.  The fire resulted in the complete loss of the new structure, as well as damage to the station's communications and scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, the construction of a new wintering complex was completed. It is a residential unit with a sauna and gym, rooms for meteorologists and radio operators, medical unit, equipped with no less modern{{clarify|date=January 2017}} regional hospital, and its own galley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1049555&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''R&amp;D management''' is the discipline of designing and leading [[R&amp;D]] processes, managing R&amp;D organizations, and ensuring smooth transfer of new know-how and technology to other groups or departments involved in [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, V. (2001). R&amp;D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Managing Global Innovation |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-66832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
R&amp;D management can be defined as where the tasks of [[innovation management]] (i.e., creating and commercializing inventions) meet the tasks of [[technology management]] (i.e., external and internal creation and retention of technological know-how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brockhoff, Klaus -link = Klaus Brockhoff |title=Forschung und Entwicklung |publisher=Oldenbourg |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers activities such as basic [[research]], fundamental research, technology development, advanced development, concept development, new product development, process development, [[prototyping]], R&amp;D portfolio management, technology transfer, etc., but generally is not considered to include technology licensing, innovation management, IP management, corporate venturing, incubation, etc. as those are sufficiently independent activities that can be carried out without the presence of a R&amp;D function in a firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Specht, G. |author2=Beckmann, Ch. |title=F&amp;E-Management |publisher=Schaeffer-Poeschel |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management models==
Few dedicated management models for R&amp;D exist. Among the more popularized ones are [[Arthur D. Little]]'s '''Third generation R&amp;D management''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roussel|title=Third generation R&amp;D |publisher=HBS Press |year=1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Development funnel''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wheelwright, S. |author2=Clark, K. |title=Revolutionizing Product Development |publisher=Free Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Phase–gate model]] All these models are concerned with improving R&amp;D performance and result productivity, managing R&amp;D as a process, and providing the R&amp;D function with an environment in which the inherent technological and market uncertainties can be managed.

'''The Path to Developing Successful New Products'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mike Gordon |author2=Chris Musso |author3=Eric Rebentisch |author4=Nisheeth Gupta |title= The Path to Developing Successful New Products |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review Press |date=Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint research by MIT &amp; McKinsey &amp; Co. points out three key practices that can play critical role in R&amp;D Management: Talk to the customer, Nurture a project culture, Keep it focused.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1356">The rent-gap theory or Mietlückentheorie was developed in 1979 by the geographer [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] as an economic explanation for the process of [[gentrification]]. It describes the disparity between the current [[Rental property|rental]] income of a property and the potentially achievable rental income. Only from this difference arises the interest of [[Property investment|investors]], a particular object (to entire neighborhoods) to renovate, resulting in an increase in rents and also the value of the property.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/neil-smith&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment in the property market will therefore only be made if a rent gap exists. Thus, it is contrary to other explanations for gentrification related to cultural and consumption preferences and housing preferences. The rent-gap theory is a purely economic approach. The processes described with the rent-gap theory can be observed especially in North America.

The '''Sarphatipark''' is a public [[urban park]] located in the ''[[stadsdeel]]'' [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The park is named after [[Samuel Sarphati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/indexen/typisch_amsterdams/typisch_amsterdams?ActItmIdt=3834 Het Sarphatipark]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. [[Government of Amsterdam|City of Amsterdam]]. Retrieved on 2008-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the park was renamed "Bollandpark" after [[Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland|G.J.P.J. Bolland]], because Samuel Sarphati was a Jew. The old name was restored after the war in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/tweede-wereldoorlog/nl/achtergrond/achtergrond,amsterdam/straatnamen Amsterdam, straatnamen 1940-1945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129130817/http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/tweede-wereldoorlog/nl/achtergrond/achtergrond,amsterdam/straatnamen |date=2012-11-29 }}. Verzetsmuseum. Retrieved on 2008-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch painter [[Mommie Schwarz]] and his wife [[Else Berg]] lived adjacent to the park from 1927 until their deportation to, and execution at, the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in 1942.  Some of their last works were landscape paintings of the park.

A general view is that Science 2.0 is gaining traction&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; with websites beginning to proliferate,&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; yet at the same time there is considerable resistance within the scientific community about aspects of the transition as well as discussion about what, exactly, the term means.

It not only describes what is currently happening in science, but describes a direction in which proponents believe science should move towards, as well as a growing number of websites which promote free scientific collaboration.

[[File:Ben Shneiderman at UNCC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ben Shneiderman]]]]
The term ''Science 2.0'' suggests a contrast between traditional ways of doing science, often denoted ''Science 1.0'', with more collaborative approaches, and suggests that the new forms of science will work with [[Web 2.0]] technologies.&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt; One description from ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' is that Science 2.0 uses the "networking power of the internet to tackle problems with multiple interacting variables - the problems, in other words, of everyday life."&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; A different and somewhat controversial view is that of [[Ben Shneiderman]], who suggested that Science 2.0 combines hypothesis-based inquiries with social science methods, partially for the purpose of improving those new networks.&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt;

While the term describes websites for sharing scientific knowledge, it also includes efforts by existing science publishers to embrace new digital tools, such as offering areas for discussions following published online articles.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Sometimes it denotes [[open access]] which, according to one view, means that the author continues to hold the copyright but that others can read it and use it for reasonable purposes, provided that the attribution is maintained.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Most online scientific literature is behind [[paywall]]s, meaning that a person can find the title of an article on Google but they can not read the actual article.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; People who can access these articles are generally affiliated with a university&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; or secondary school or library or other educational institution, or who pay on a per-article or subscription basis.

{{Quote|Traditional scientific journals are part of this social evolution too, innovating ways to engage scientists online and enable global collaboration and conversation. Even the 187-year-old Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences has joined the digital age. The Academy now permits free public access to selected online content and has digitized every volume dating back to 1823.|Adrienne J. Burke in ''Seed Magazine'', 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

One view is that ''Science 2.0'' should include an effort by scientists to offer papers in non-technical language, as a way of reaching out to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=tws2E28&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For others, it includes building vast databases of case histories.&lt;ref name=tws2E34/&gt; There is a sense in which ''Science 2.0'' indicates a general direction for scientific collaboration, although there is little clarity about how exactly this might happen. One aim is to "make scientific collaboration as easy as sharing videos of trips home from the dentist," according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E23/&gt;

==History and background==
The rise of the [[Internet]] has transformed many activities such as [[retailing]] and information searching.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; In [[journalism]], Internet technologies such as [[blogging]], tagging and [[social networking]] have caused many existing media sources such as newspapers to "adopt whole new ways of thinking and operating," according to a report in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2E41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that while the Internet has transformed many aspects of life, it has not changed scientific research as much as it could. While firms such as eBay, Amazon and Netflix have changed consumer retailing, and online patient-centered medical data has enabled better health care, Science 2.0 advocate Ben Shneiderman said:

According to one view, a similar web-inspired transformation that has happened to other areas is now happening to science.&lt;ref name=tws2E41/&gt; The general view is that science has been slower than other areas to embrace the web technology, but that it is beginning to catch up.&lt;ref name=tws2E42&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was done in private. Next, it was submitted to scientific publications and reviewed by editors and gatekeepers and other scientists. Last, it was published.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; This has been the traditional pathway of scientific advancement, sometimes dubbed ''Science 1.0''.

Established journals provided a "critical service", according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Publications such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' have large editorial staffs to manage the peer-review process as well as have hired fact-checkers and screeners to look over submissions. These publications get revenue from subscriptions, including online ones, as well as advertising revenue and fees paid by authors.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; According to advocates of Science 2.0, however, this process of paper-submission and review was rather long.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Detractors complained that the system is "hidebound, expensive and elitist", sometimes "reductionist",&lt;ref name=tws2E1112/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; as well as being slow and "prohibitively costly".&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Only a select group of gatekeepers—those in charge of the traditional publications—limited the flow of information.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt; Proponents of [[open science]] claimed that scientists could learn more and learn faster if there is a "friction-free collaboration over the Internet."&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Yet there is considerable resistance within the scientific community to a change of approach. The act of publishing a new finding in a major journal has been at the "heart of the career of scientists," according to one view, which elaborated that many scientists would be reluctant to sacrifice the "emotional reward" of having their discoveries published in the usual, traditional way.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; Established scientists are often loath to switch to an open-source model, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2E25/&gt;

Timo Hannay explained that the traditional publish-a-paper model, sometimes described as "Science 1.0",&lt;ref name=tws2E43/&gt; was a workable one but there need to be other ways for scientists to make contributions and get credit for their work:

{{Quote|The unit of contribution to the scientific knowledge base has become the paper. Journals grew up as a means for scientists to be able to share their discoveries and ideas. The incentive for doing so was that by publishing in journals their contributions would be recognized by citation and other means. So you have this pact: be open with your ideas and share them through journals and you will get credit... There are all kinds of ways in which scientists can contribute to the global endeavor. ... The incentive structure has not caught up with what we really want scientists to do.|Timo Hannay, 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

There are reports that established journals are moving towards greater openness. Some help readers network online; others enable commenters to post links to websites; others make papers accessible after a certain period of time has elapsed.&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; But it remains a "hotly debated question", according to one view, whether the business of scientific research can move away from the model of "peer-vetted, high-quality content without requiring payment for access."&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt; The topic has been discussed in a lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=tws2E1113&gt;{{cite news

{{Quote|Open science is not this maverick idea; it’s becoming reality. About 35 percent of scientists are using things like blogs to consume and produce content. There is an explosion of online tools and platforms available to scientists, ranging from Web 2.0 tools modified or created for the scientific world to Web sites that are doing amazing things with video, lab notebooks, and social networking. There are thousands of scientific software programs freely available online and tens of millions of science, technology, and math journal articles online. What’s missing is the vision and infrastructure to bring together all of the various changes and new players across this Science 2.0 landscape so that it’s simple, scalable, and sustainable—so that it makes research better.|[[Adam Bly]], 2012&lt;ref name=tws2E42/&gt;}}

==Semantic modeling and annotation of sensor data==
Ontologies and other semantic technologies can be key enabling technologies for sensor networks because they will improve semantic interoperability and integration, as well as facilitate reasoning, classification and other types of assurance and automation not included in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. A semantic sensor network will allow the network, its sensors and the resulting data to be organised, installed and managed, queried, understood and controlled through high-level specifications. Ontologies for sensors provide a framework for describing sensors. These ontologies allow classification and reasoning on the capabilities and measurements of sensors, provenance of measurements and may allow reasoning about individual sensors as well as reasoning about the connection of a number of sensors as a macroinstrument. The sensor ontologies, to some degree, reflect the OGC standards and, given ontologies that can encode sensor descriptions, understanding how to map between the ontologies and OGC models is an important consideration. Semantic annotation of sensor descriptions and services that support sensor data exchange and sensor network management will serve a similar purpose as that espoused by semantic annotation of Web services. This research is conducted through the [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group (SSN-XG)] activity.

==W3C Semantic Sensor Networks ==
The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) initiated the [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ Semantic Sensor Networks Incubator Group (SSN-XG)] to develop the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, intended to model sensor devices, systems, processes, and observations. The Incubator Group later transitioned into the [http://www.w3.org/community/ssn-cg/ Semantic Sensor Networks Community Group]. It was then picked up in the joint [http://www.opengeospatial.org OGC] and [http://w3.org W3C] [https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Main_Page Spatial Data on the Web Working Group] and published as a W3C Recommendation &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/ Semantic Sensor Network Ontology]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology enables expressive representation of sensor observations, sampling, and actuation. The SSN ontology is encoded in the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL2). A number of projects have used it for improved management of sensor data on the Web, involving annotation, integration, publishing, and search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/community/ssn-cg/wiki/SSN_Applications SSN Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
[[Sensors]] around the globe currently collect avalanches of data about the world. The rapid development and deployment of sensor technology is intensifying the existing problem of too much data and not enough knowledge [http://www.knoesis.org/library/resource.php?id=1635]. With a view to alleviating this glut, sensor data can be annotated with semantic [[metadata]] to increase interoperability between heterogeneous sensor networks, as well as to provide contextual information essential for [[situation awareness]]. Semantic web techniques can greatly help with the problem of data integration and discovery as it helps map between different metadata schema in a structured way.

==Uses==
Semantic Sensor Web (SSW) technologies are utilized in fields such as [[agriculture]], [[disaster management]],&lt;ref&gt;Coronato, A.; De Pietro, G.; Esposito, M., "A Semantic Context Service for Smart Offices," Hybrid Information Technology, 2006. ICHIT '06. International Conference on , vol.2, no., pp.391,399, 9-11 Nov. 2006
doi: 10.1109/ICHIT.2006.253638&lt;/ref&gt; [[building management]] and [[laboratory management system|laboratory management]].

===Agriculture===
Monitoring various [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] attributes is critical to the growth of [[plant]]s. Environmental attributes that are critical for growers are mainly [[temperature]], moisture, [[pH]], [[electric conductivity]] (EC), and more. Real-time monitoring in addition to setting alerts for the mentioned sensors was never possible. With the creation of SSW, [[farmer|growers]] can now track their plant growing conditions in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, K.; Griffith, C.; Lefort, L.; Gaire, R.; Compton, M.; Wark, T.; Lamb, D.; Falzon, G.; Trotter, M., "Farming the Web of Things," Intelligent Systems, IEEE , vol.28, no.6, pp.12,19, Nov.-Dec. 2013 doi: 10.1109/MIS.2013.102&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such advancement in agriculture through utilization of SSW is the research conducted in 2008 on [[Australia]]n [[farm]]s where temperature, humidity, [[barometric pressure]], wind speed, wind direction and [[rainfall]] were monitored using SSW methodology. The architecture of this research project consists of personal integration needs, [[Semantic web]], and more in addition to [[semantic data model|semantic data integration]], i.e. where data is centralized to make sensor semantic web technologies meaningful and useful.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, A.; Henson, C.; Sahoo, S.S., "Semantic Sensor Web," Internet Computing, IEEE, vol.12, no.4, pp.78,83, July-Aug. 2008 doi: 10.1109/MIC.2008.87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building management (smart buildings)===
Managing [[building]]s can be quite sophisticated, as the cost of fixing damages is significantly higher than having proper monitoring tools in place to prevent damages from happening. SSW allows for getting notified of water leaks, controlling apartment temperature via [[smartphone]], and more.

===Laboratory management===
Managing [[laboratory]] tests can be quite challenging, especially if tests take place over a long time, across multiple locations, or in infrastructures where many tests occur. Such tests include creep tests for a material, reaction tests of a certain [[chemical]] or [[wireless|wireless transmission]] tests of a circuit. Advancements in SSW allow for real-time monitoring of laboratory variables via sensors. Such sensors can take more than one factor into consideration before alerting.&lt;ref&gt;Zarri, G.P.; Sabri, L.; Chibani, A.; Amirat, Y., "Semantic-Based Industrial Engineering: Problems and Solutions," Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS), 2010 International Conference on , vol., no., pp.1022,1027, 15-18 Feb. 2010 doi: 10.1109/CISIS.2010.94&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an alert can go off when pressure and temperature both exceed a certain limit, or an alert can go off when pressure in one building drops, yet pressure in another building remains the same.

==Notable contributions==
Standardization is a lengthy and difficult process, as players in a field that have existing solutions would see any standardization as an additional cost to their activities. [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC), an international voluntary consensus standards organization that was founded in 1994, is making efforts to enhance and accelerate the growth of the SSW community and standardize sensor information across web.&lt;ref&gt;[6] McCreedy, F.P.; Marks, D.B., "The Naval Research Laboratory's ongoing implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium's Catalogue Services specification," OCEANS 2009, MTS/IEEE Biloxi - Marine Technology for Our Future: Global and Local Challenges , vol., no., pp.1,7, 26-29 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most OGC standards depend on generalized architecture that is collectively captured in set of [[document]]s. The goal of OGC is to provide enhancements in description and meaning of sensor data. Also, OGC had enabled Sensor Web communication. OGC is in charge of creating open [[geospatial]] standards. Moreover, OCG is supported by [[industry]], [[government]], and [[academia|academic]] partners to allow for easy creation of geo-processing technologies known as “plug and play”.

==Current challenges==
Current challenges in the SSW field include a lack of standardization, which slows down the growth rate of sensors created to measure things. For the semantic sensor web to be meaningful, the languages, tags, and labels across various applications, developed by various developers, must be the same. Unfortunately, due to scattered development of various architectures, such standardization is not possible. This problem is called [[vastness]].

There is also the problem of inconsistency, such that when changing the architecture of an existing solution, the system logic will no longer hold. In order to resolve this problem, there is a need for an extensive amount of resources (depending on the size and complexity of system). For example, many existing systems use twelve bits to transfer temperature data to a local [[computer]]. However, in a SSW 16 bits of data is acceptable. This inconsistency results in higher [[data traffic]] with no additional accuracy improvement. In order for the old system to improve, there is a need of allocating extra bits and changing the buffer requirements, which is costly. Assuming the resources required to make the tag requirement are available, there is still the existence of unnecessary data that requires additional storage space in addition to creating confusion for other SSW members. The only solution remaining is changing the [[hardware (computer)|hardware]] requirements, which requires a lot of resources.

'''Stealth conservative''' individuals or [[organization]]s are those whom some perceive to present themselves as progressive, liberal, or moderate while using that status to forward a so-called "conservative agenda".  According to journalist [[Laura Flanders]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the new face of the radical right. The attractive right-wingers who talk about 'choice' and 'civil rights' pose a threat to progressives who support the federal government’s role as a protector of individual citizens.[http://www.feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=6287]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] leader [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]] has openly advocated a policy of stealth politics by the right.  In a March 1992 interview with the [[Los Angeles Times]], Reed stated "It's like guerrilla warfare.  If you reveal your location, all it does is allow your opponent to improve his artillery bearings. It's better to move quietly, with stealth, under the cover of night."

The '''Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms''' ('''THEMIS''') mission began in February 2007 as a constellation of five [[NASA]] [[satellite]]s (THEMIS A through THEMIS E) to study energy releases from [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] known as [[substorm]]s, magnetic phenomena that intensify [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s near Earth's poles. The name of the mission is an [[acronym]]  alluding to the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Themis]].&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lynn Jenner|title=THEMIS Mission Pages|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/main/index.html|publisher=NASA|date=28 May 2009|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the satellites orbit the Earth within the magnetosphere, while two have been moved into orbit around the [[Moon]]. Those two were renamed '''ARTEMIS''' for '''Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun'''. THEMIS B became ARTEMIS P1 and THEMIS C became ARTEMIS P2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tony|title=Dead Spacecraft Walking|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/dead-walking.html|work=ARTEMIS mission site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The THEMIS satellites were launched February 17, 2007 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17]] aboard a [[Delta II]] [[rocket]].&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFN"&gt;{{cite news | author=Justin Ray | title=Mission Status Center: THEMIS  | url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d323/status.html | work=SpaceFlight Now | date=18 February 2007 | accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each satellite carries identical instrumentation, including a [[fluxgate magnetometer]] (FGM), an electrostatic analyzer (ESA), a solid state telescope (SST), a [[search-coil magnetometer]] (SCM) and an electric field instrument (EFI). Each probe has a mass of 126&amp;nbsp;kg, including 49&amp;nbsp;kg of [[hydrazine]] fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=World Data Center for Satellite Information | title=SPACEWARN Bulletin, No. 640 | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx640.html | publisher=National Space Science Data Center | date=1 March 2007| accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THEMIS data can be accessed using the [[SPEDAS]] software.

==Launch==
[[File:Themis launch-l.jpg|thumb|The launch of THEMIS atop the [[Delta II]] 7925 rocket, at SLC-17B, Cape Canaveral]]
THEMIS was originally scheduled to launch on October 19, 2006. Owing to delays caused by workmanship problems with Delta II second stages—an issue that also affected the previous mission, [[STEREO]]—the THEMIS launch was delayed to Thursday, February 15, 2007. Due to weather conditions occurring on Tuesday, February 13, fueling of the second stage was delayed, and the launch pushed back 24 hours. On February 16, the launch was scrubbed in a hold at the T-4 minute point in the countdown due to the final weather balloon reporting a red, or nogo condition for upper level winds. A 24-hour turnaround procedure was initiated, targeting a new launch window between 23:01 and 23:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on February 17.

Favorable weather conditions were observed on February 17, and the countdown proceeded smoothly. THEMIS successfully launched  at 6:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST. The spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle approximately 73 minutes after liftoff. By 8:07&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST, mission operators at the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] (SSL) of the University of California, Berkeley, commanded and received signals from all five spacecraft, confirming nominal separation status.

The launch service was provided by the [[United Launch Alliance]] through NASA Launch Services Program (LSP).

== Mission status ==
From February 15, 2007 until September 15, 2007 the five THEMIS satellites coasted in a string-of-pearls orbital configuration.  From September 15, 2007 until December 4, 2007 the satellites were moved to more distant orbits in preparation for data collection in the magnetotail. This phase of the mission was called the "Dawn Phase" because the satellites' orbits were in [[apogee]] on the dawn side of the [[magnetosphere]].  On December 4, 2007 the first tail science phase of the mission began.  In this segment of the mission scientists will collect data from the magnetotail of the Earth's magnetosphere.  During this phase the satellites' orbits are in apogee inside the magnetotail. The scientists hope to observe substorms and magnetic reconnection events.  During these events charged particles stored in the Earth's magnetosphere are discharged to form the [[aurora borealis]].  Tail science is performed in the winter of the [[northern hemisphere]] because the ground magnetometers that Themis scientists correlate the satellite data with have relatively longer periods of night.

=== Extended mission ===
On May 19, 2008 the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] (SSL) at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] announced NASA had extended the THEMIS mission to the year 2012. NASA officially approved the movement of THEMIS B and THEMIS C into [[lunar orbit]] under the mission name [[ARTEMIS]] (Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun). In February 2017, THEMIS celebrated ten years of science operations. As of August 2017, the three THEMIS inner probes continue to collect valuable data on the Sun's interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.

As of spring 2010, '''ARTEMIS P1''' (THEMIS B) had performed two Lunar flybys and one Earth flyby, and was approaching insertion into a [[Lissajous orbit]] around a Lunar [[Lagrange point]]. Lunar orbit insertion was targeted for April 2011. '''ARTEMIS P2''' (THEMIS C) completed a Lunar flyby and was on the inbound leg of the first of three deep space excursions on its way to a Lissajous orbit and was targeted for Lunar orbit in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Space Sciences Laboratory | title=THEMIS News and Events | url=http://ds9.ssl.berkeley.edu/themis/news.html | publisher=UC Berkeley | date= | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2011, ARTEMIS P1 began firing its thrusters to move out of its kidney-shaped "libration" orbit on one side of the Moon, where it had been since January.&lt;ref name="NASA2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Karen C.|title=First ARTEMIS Spacecraft Successfully Enters Lunar Orbit|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/artemis/news/P1-lunarOrbit.html|work=The Sun-Earth Connection: Heliophysics|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of July 2, 2011 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT, ARTEMIS P1 achieved lunar orbit.

As of August 2017, both lunar probes are in stable orbits, and the health of all instruments and the spacecraft remains very good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2013/20131107-artemis-mission-update.html ARTEMIS Mission Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==

=== Aboard the spacecraft ===

* Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU): The IDPU houses most of the electronics for the instruments on the THEMIS spacecraft.
* Electric Field Instruments (EFI): The EFI is designed and built to sense the electric field in Earth's ever-changing magnetosphere
* [[Fluxgate magnetometer]] (FGM): The FGM measures the background magnetic field to identify and time the abrupt reconfigurations of the magnetosphere during substorm onset.
* [[Search-coil magnetometer]] (SCM): The SCM measures low frequency magnetic field fluctuations and waves in three directions in Earth's magnetosphere.
* [[Electrostatic analyzer|Electrostatic Analyzer]] (ESA): The ESA measures thermal electrons and ions to identify and track high-speed flows through the magnetotail and identify pressure pulses.
* Solid State Telescope (SST): The SST measures energetic particle distribution functions.
* Digital Fields Board (DFB): The DFB uses an [[FPGA]] to perform configurable on-board band pass processing and fast Fourier transformations([[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]]) on instrument data.

=== Ground based ===
As the satellites monitor the magnetosphere from orbit, twenty ground stations in [[North America]] simultaneously monitor [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s. Ground station mission and science operations are being managed by the University of California [[Space Sciences Laboratory]].

* Ground-Based All-Sky Imager (ASI) Array: The ground-based All-Sky Imager (ASI) array observes the aurora over the Northern American continent from Canada to Alaska in order to determine where and when the auroral substorm onset occurs.
* Ground-Based Magnetometer (GMAG) Array: The GMAG Measure changes in Earth’s magnetic field near Earth’s surface due to substorm onset to help determine the timing of substorm events.

== Swales Aerospace ==
Swales Aerospace, now part of [[Orbital ATK]], ([[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]], [[Maryland]]) manufactured all five probes for this mission.  Each was built-up and tested at the Beltsville facility, before being delivered to [[University of California, Berkeley]] for instrument integration.  Swales was responsible for integrating the BAU, IRU, Solar Arrays, Antenna, Battery, and other components necessary for functionality.  This was the second major satellite built by Swales, the first being the EO-1 spacecraft, which continues to orbit Earth.  Swales was also responsible for designing and building the Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) used for monitoring the probes during all phases of pre-launch activities, including use at the launch site.

== JPL ==
After the installation of instruments at SSL, Berkeley, pre-launch testing including thermal-vac, vibration and acoustic tests, was conducted at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
{{-}}

==FAST==
The [[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer]] (FAST) mission supported THEMIS in 2008 and 2009 before being retired.&lt;ref name=epon&gt;[http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast_epo/news.html FAST EPO News]&lt;/ref&gt; FAST was a [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX) mission launched in 1996.&lt;ref name=epon/&gt;

{{Taxation}}

In [[public choice theory]], '''tax choice''' (sometimes called '''taxpayer sovereignty'''&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Daniel J.|title=The Case for Tax-Target Plans|journal=Journal of Education Finance|date=Fall 1979|volume=5|issue=2|jstor=40703229|page=215|publisher=University of Illinois Press|ref=harv|quote=For educators, these "new" values reflect a demand for taxpayer sovereignty, greater choice among educational programs, and more responsiveness on the part of educational systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''earmarking'''{{sfn|Buchanan|1963}}{{failed verification|date=February 2013}}) is the belief that individual taxpayers should have direct control over how their taxes are spent. Its proponents apply the theory of [[consumer choice]] to [[public finance]].  They claim taxpayers react positively when they are allowed to allocate portions of their taxes to specific spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lamberton |first=Cait |title=Your Money, Your Choice | work=Democracy: A Journal of Ideas | date=4 March 2011 | url=https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/20/your-money-your-choice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sherry Xin Li |author2=Catherine Eckel |author3=Philip J.

== Opinions ==

Daniel J. Brown{{r|brown}} examines tax-target plans in educational programs.

[[Alan Peacock]], in his 1961 book ''The Welfare Society'',{{page needed|date=February 2013}} advocates greater diversity in public services (education, housing, hospitals).{{clarify|reason=is Peacock talking about tax choice as part of greater diversity?|date=February 2013}}

== Optimal quantities of public goods ==
According to Vincent and Elinor Ostrom, it is possible that government may oversupply, and a market arrangement may undersupply, those public goods for which exclusion is not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Patricia (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLRFLlIrqLsC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Nevertheless,+the+classic+solution+to+the+problem+of+underprovision+of+public+goods+has+been+government+funding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h__mdFaQDM&amp;sig=vedpmP00LeKdmE2eiGWDB9gpt7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3Z4NUbjNJuiligLwqYDYAw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Nevertheless%2C%20the%20classic%20solution%20to%20the%20problem%20of%20underprovision%20of%20public%20goods%20has%20been%20government%20funding&amp;f=false Governance, globalization and public policy]''.

== Foot voting versus tax choice ==
[[Foot voting|Voting with your feet]] and voting with your taxes are two methods that allow taxpayers to reveal their preferences for public policies.  Foot voting refers to where people move to areas that offer a more attractive [[Bundling (public choice)|bundle]] of public policies. In theory foot voting would force local governments to compete for taxpayers.  Tax choice, on the other hand, would allow taxpayers to indicate their preferences with their individual taxes.

:In the Tiebout model, for example, there is costless mobility; individuals seek out a jurisdiction that provides exactly the level of output of the public good that they wish to consume.  In so doing, they reveal their preferences for "local" public outputs and generate a Pareto-efficient outcome in the public sector. – [[Wallace E. Oates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Oates |first=Wallace E. |date=May 2006 |url=http://www.ifigr.org/publication/ifir_working_papers/IFIR-WP-2006-05.pdf |title=On the Theory and Practice of Fiscal Decentralization |location=Lexington, KY |publisher=Institute for Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201085332/http://www.ifigr.org/publication/ifir_working_papers/IFIR-WP-2006-05.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative measures==
Four bills involving tax choice have been introduced by the United States Congress since 1971. The [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|Presidential Election Campaign Fund]], enacted in 1971, allows taxpayers to allocate $3 of their taxes to presidential election campaigns.&lt;!--I think the current number is $3. Needs verification/updating.--&gt; The 2000 Taxpayers’ Choice Debt Reduction Act would have allowed taxpayers to designate money toward reduction of the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr5349 Taxpayers’ Choice Debt Reduction Act]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 Opt Out of Iraq War Act would have allowed taxpayers to designate money toward certain social programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr3190 Opt Out of Iraq War Act of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Act would have allowed taxpayers to make voluntary contributions (not tax payments) to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1541  Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasperowicz, Pete, [http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/156471-rep-campbell-proposes-tax-form-change-to-encourage-donations-to-the-government "Rep. Campbell proposes tax form change to encourage donations to the government"].  ''The Hill", 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These later bills died in committee.

==In popular culture==
* When asked what her first [[executive order]] as [[President of the United States|president]] would be, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] advocated a mix of [[voluntary taxation]] and tax choice, stating "you should get to choose where your money goes instead of giving it and just letting them decide, I think you should decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Ellen DeGeneres, Mario Lopez | date = 4 May 2016 | title = What Ellen DeGeneres Would Do If She Were President | language = English | url = http://extratv.com/videos/0-o2eskl66/ | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6hPuxquXo | archive-date = 10 May 2016 | publisher = [[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transformers technology''' refers to various technologies in [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]] series of comic books, films, animated series, and other media. The term refers to unusual processes, such as the departure from the standard Transformer ability to change between two different forms, as well as technology utilized by the Transformers in-series.

==Combiner technology==
[[Image:Hasbro Constructicons Devastator.jpg|right|thumb|''Generation 1'' Devastator, the original combiner, and his components, the Constructicons]]
The term "Combiner" refers to a sub-group of Transformers able to combine their bodies and minds into a singular, larger, more powerful super-robot (the process is referred to in Computron's Marvel tech spec as "combinatics"). The term "Combiner" comes from the sub-group's ability to "combine" into a larger robot.

Combiner technology has its downsides as well, the primary one being that the combined robot can only do what all of its components agree upon. For beings such as Devastator, that is typically wanton destruction and nothing else. There is a flipside to this: Computron's main problem is that every problem must be worked out to every conceivable solution; even with Computron's enhanced computers, this is a time-consuming task, which for example led to his quick defeat by Abominus (another Decepticon Combiner) around the time of the [[Hate Plague]].

The term "gestalt" was adopted by small minority of fans as the catch-all name for combining Transformers. Although not officially employed on any merchandise by Hasbro, it appears that the term is recognized by them for its use in the fandom, although it is generally passed over in favor of the more widely used term Combiners in fandom. It may also be noted that the US Marvel ''Generation 2'' comic issue #9 uses the term "fusilateral-quintrocombiners" for 5-member teams such as the Combaticons, (and presumably other "Scramble City" style-combiners).

==Mass displacement==
In the American animated series, and various comic incarnations, many Transformers have the ability to change size during transformation, while a glowing outline occasionally appears around their bodies as they do so. Notable examples include [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] and his operatives [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]], [[Frenzy]], [[Laserbeak]], the transporter [[Astrotrain]] and the Autobot [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]]. Long since regarded as a source of confusion, such technology first received a full-scale explanation in the final issue of the ''Generation One'' version of [[Dreamwave Productions]]' [[List of Transformers comic book series#Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye|''More Than Meets The Eye'']] series, which focused on many different aspects of Transformers technology and other information. In [[IDW Publishing]]'s ''Transformers: Escalation'' it is also mentioned that it takes considerable power to accomplish this feat. During Optimus Prime and Prowl's conversation, it is hinted at that the technology is old, but has not been in use for some time. Megatron and Soundwave are the first Transformers in this continuity to display mass displacement. Although used in the animated series quite often, mass displacement was not utilized by any of the Autobots or Decepticons in the [[Transformers (film)|2007 Transformers film]], as the producers claimed that they considered it a form of "cheating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tformers.com/article.php?sid=6374&amp;mode=flat|title=Transformers Movie Webcast - The Recap|website=www.tformers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is contradicted however, when the film depicts the [[Allspark]] displacing mass when it reduces itself from its [[Hoover Dam]] filling size to one that [[Witwicky family#Spike Witwicky|Sam]] is capable of carrying around.
In [[Transformers Prime]], Predaking, a [[Predacon]] gets bigger when transforming into his alt mode ( read: dragon ), as well as fellow Predacons Darksteel and Skylynx, from the series finale movie [[Predacons Rising.]]

==Master process==
In the American comic and cartoon, the Master process was acquired from [[Nebulos]]. It allows [[human]]s or Nebulons to become components of Transformers using cybernetic exosuits in a process referred to as Binary Bonding (although not all Master processes involve bonding with humans). Still experimental, the results of this are unpredictable. Known Master technologies are:

* '''[[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]]''': A humanoid becomes the head module of the robot-form Transformer, and the pilot of the vehicle mode.
* '''[[Targetmaster]]''': A humanoid transforms into a highly accurate intelligent weapon for use by the Transformer. Prototypical Targetmaster technology was being researched on [[Cybertron]] in the distant past.
* '''[[Powermaster]]''': An enhanced humanoid provides biologic energy and abilities to a Transformer; such as the ability to withstand hostile environments to which the biological life form is well suited.
* '''[[Micromasters|Micromaster]]''': Transformers who are smaller than normal size Transformers (more to the scale of later "[[Beast Wars]]" era Transformers) with lesser energy requirements. Usually looked at by the larger Transformers as cannon fodder. These Transformers were created because of Energon shortages on Cybertron.
* '''[[Action Masters|Action Master]]''': Transformers who have undergone this process have lost the ability to transform; Instead, they have bodies completely engineered to peak performance in robot mode.

In the extended Japanese continuity, the master process can use either humanoids or robots to form the binary bonding component. The original Headmasters, for example, were originally small Cybertronians, taken to the planet "Master" by Fortress, where they began to experiment with how to transform. They created large, lifeless Transformer bodies named "[[Transtector]]s" to which they connected as heads, forming the basis for Master technology. After returning to Cybertron, Headmaster technology (called the Masterforce) was modified to allow humans to become Headmasters; the first six were a group of teenagers known as the "Headmaster Juniors".

While the Japanese concept for Headmasters featured only one mind in the process, Targetmasters did indeed consist of a bonding of two beings, as in America - in this case, a group of refugees from Master who were fused to the arms of several larger Transformers in a plasma energy explosion.

In Japan, Powermasters are known as ''Godmasters'', and, like Headmasters, consist of a human being bonded to a Transtector. The Godmasters were created as part of a plan by the super-energy being, [[Devil Z]], to create the ultimate super robot lifeform, and possess control over the energies of the Earth, the heavens and man.

==Organic technology==
Although made from a living metal, various Cybertronians have found sufficient cause or reason to incorporate purely [[Organic life|organic]] material into their forms.

===Pretenders===
{{Main article|Pretenders (Transformers)}}

Pretenders, introduced in 1988, followed the concept of Transformers using organic shells as an extra disguise or as [[armor]] for defense. The concept was first seen in [[Marvel Comics]] with [[Thunderwing]] and [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] as notable Decepticons. [[Dreamwave Productions]] detailed the process and its transition from simple power-upgrading armor to a whole host of potential future applications in their [[List of Transformers comic book series#Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye|''More Than Meets The Eye'']] series. In [[IDW Publishing]]'s [[The Transformers (IDW Publishing)|rebooted comic]], Pretender technology had the benefit of turning a Transformer into a supremely powerful being (for example, Thunderwing destroyed much of [[Cybertron]]) — but an improper grafting process could destroy the Transformer's mind.

===Environmental adaptation===
In many series, it is shown that an organic shell could protect a Transformer's body from intense environmental conditions such as energon [[radiation]]. Dreamwave' ''More Than Meets The Eye'' series noted this as the logical progression for Pretenders technology, explaining that it had branched out to include specially designed suits for dealing with hazardous materials, etc. Similarly, in the IDW comic, Thunderwing had developed his Pretender technology, called "Bio-Cybernetic Grafting" as a way for Transformers to survive Cybertron's declining conditions. In ''[[Beast Wars]]'', The Maximals and Predacons on earth adopted organic shells and animal forms because of the high amounts of natural energon on the planet. Similarly, in ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight]]'', The [[Dinobots]] assumed dinosaur forms with organic shells to protect themselves from energon radiation.

===Techno-organic hybridization===
Techno-Organic Hybrids are transformers who possess or have obtained organic halves (having been infused with an organic being's DNA) and can be considered a fusion of both technological &amp; organic lifeforms at cellular level. Transformers of this type are featured prominently in the ''Beast Wars'' era and even more so in ''[[Beast Machines]]'' (with their existence and techno-organic nature being an important plot element). Their outward appearance often varies from slightly robotic, completely organic, or a combination of the two.

In ''[[Transformers: Animated]]'', transformers with organic halves are rare due to limited cybertronian interaction with organic life (planets with organic life are considered mostly off limits by the Autobots). Due to this unfamiliarity with organic life many Transformers have difficulty relating to it and some (like [[Sentinel Prime]]) have developed a ''[[phobia]] of organics'', with others seeing it is seen as a form of contamination. As a result, techno-organic transformers are likely to be viewed by other "pure" transformers with contempt (being regarded as freaks/abomination). These Transformers have their original abilities augmented by the genetic makeup of the organic they can transform into.

In this series, the Decepticon [[Blackarachnia]] is techno-organic reformat of [[Elita One|Elita-1]] (a female Autobot Elite Guard trainee), after she tried to "download" the abilities of an "organic species of alien spider" to neutralize the venom injected into her. But the attempt unintentually transformed into a techno-organic hybrid (and is considered by both herself and others a freak). Though she repeatedly tries to purge herself of her organic-half, she has failed every time (and it appears she is likely to remain as such). Her recent attempt involved duplicating the process using a transwarp generator, using it on Wasp and resulting in his reformating in [[Waspinator]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:sarisumdac.jpg|left|thumb|Sari's "organic" human form]] --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:sari-protoform-upgraded.jpg|right|thumb|Sari as a Protoform&lt;br&gt;Sari after her "teenage" reformat]] --&gt;
Another character in the series, a girl named [[Sari Sumdac]], was originally a cybertronian protoform, that mysteriously appeared in the lab of human inventor, Professor Isaac Sumdac. While investigating the mysterious "''[[Spark (Transformers)|liquid metal being]]''", he accidentally touched the protoform (which rendered him briefly unconscious), unintentually infusing the young protoform with his DNA, resulting in the birth of a redheaded ''techno-organic female clone'' of Sumdac (a "''techno-organic human/transformer hybrid''" in the form of a human girl). Professor Sumdac decides to unofficially adopt her as his daughter, Sari (Prof. Sumdac decided to keep the truth of her origins a secret from her, due in part to him being unaware of what had actually occurred). Unlike Blackarachnia and Waspinator, Sari was not actually a Transformer to begin with was and started off more organic at first, both in biology (possessing normal human biological functions) and in outward appearance.

Her techno-organic nature (except for a few hints) is not fully revealed until the very end of the 2nd season, when her elbow is injured, tearing the skin and revealing a robotic joint underneath. After the truth is revealed, Sari's techno-organic nature becomes more apparent, being able to transform into a ''slightly robotic'' version of herself. Her techno-organic nature is further enhanced when she uses her "''All-Spark enhanced Key''" to reformat herself into a teenaged form, with her new body functioning like a "''techno-organic powersuit''" (equipped which energy-based roller blades and weapons).

==Life, death and the Matrix==

===Birth of a Transformer===
The life essence of a Transformer is called a [[Spark (Transformers)|Spark]], an incandescent sphere of light that is, in essence, both the heart and soul of the Transformer. From a scientific point of view it is said (By [[Rattrap]] in Beast Machines) to be composed of or at least containing [[positron]]s. Following the construction of the Transformer body, Sparks can be implanted in a variety of ways, depending on the continuity.

* In the comic continuity, all Transformer life comes from [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], and as Sparks are a newer concept, it has been retroactively established via convention comics and other writings that Sparks are a fragment of Primus. Primus can either bestow this upon creation - as he did with the original Transformers he created - or it can be done using the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Matrix]].
* In the cartoon continuity (where the life essence of a Transformer was twice referred to as a "laser core"), the only way to bestow full life was via the supercomputer, [[Vector Sigma]], as was the case with the [[Stunticon]]s and the [[Aerialbots]]. Most other attempts at creating life without using Vector Sigma to bestow them with real minds and souls have resulted in dull-witted, unstable creatures of low intelligence, prone to rage (the [[Dinobots]], [[Trypticon]]). The only Transformers with normal intelligence without being created by Vector Sigma were the [[Combaticons]], of whom Starscream brought in their personality components from the Decepticon penitentiary on Cybertron, and the [[Technobots]]. The Technobots were created by the super intelligent [[Grimlock]] in the episode "Grimlock's New Brain". Grimlock used components within [[Unicron]]'s head to build the Technobots. It's possible that components from Unicron allowed the Technobots to have normal intelligence.
* In the [[Beast Wars]] and [[Beast Machines]] continuities, the nature of Transformer life and death is expanded on with the revelation of the existence of the [[Allspark]] (also called the Matrix). It is the source of all Sparks that exist, have existed, or ever will exist, sending them out into the world to live, so that when they die, they will return to the Allspark and share their experiences, thereby increasing the collective wisdom and knowledge of the Allspark. This concept is similar to the [[Brahma]] oversoul of [[Hindu]]ism. Vector Sigma is revealed to have access to the Allspark, explaining how it could program robots with life (by implanting a Spark in them through its access to the Allspark), and retroactively, it can easily be assumed that the Matrix object was a gate to the Allspark as well. As Beast Wars and Beast Machines are officially set in neither the comic nor cartoon universe, but a universe that takes aspects from both, this is also another explanation for how the Matrix object could bestow life (by transferring a Spark through its connection to the Allspark) in the comic continuity.
* Circa Beast Wars, Transformer life seems to be entirely generated at facilities nicknamed "The Matrix" and "The Pit", Maximal and Predacon facilities respectively which produce [[Protoforms]] - raw, undeveloped Transformers. Upon the creation of each Protoform, the Allspark bestows upon this life-to-be a Spark.

Other methods of creation include:

* Cloning: A new technology recently developed allows for the cloning of one transformer into another; identical at the time of cloning, differences start to appear immediately.
* Experiments in creating immortal life have ended with horrible consequences: [[Rampage (Transformers)|Protoform X]]. Protoform X was enslaved by the '''Beast Wars'' Megatron and renamed Rampage, and was eventually destroyed by having raw energon forced through his spark.
* Transplantation: In a few circumstances, the transplant of a "living spark" for life support, power enhancement, or just to change bodies has occurred. For instance, in [[Beast Wars]], Optimus Primal removed the Spark from G1 Optimus Prime and placed it inside his own body to sustain Prime's life after his body was critically damaged. The presence of Prime's spark was too much for his body to handle, and the power reformatted his body into a stronger form. Later, [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]] would deliberately do the same with his predecessor's spark to add to his power. In the Dreamwave comic line, Ratbat was moved from a large, average-sized transformer body into that of a Cassette, where he became a minion of [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]].

===Transformer aging===
In a few notable cases, Transformers have displayed the ability to physically age. Most Transformers' ages are clear from their personalities, defined by their life experiences - for example, [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] would be a young adult and [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] is the equivalent of a teenager while [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]], [[Jazz]] and [[Ironhide]] are old warhorses. [[Optimus Prime]], although clearly a mature, older father figure to most Autobots is still considerably younger than the old veterans and even his arch-foe [[Megatron]]. In Kup's case, he physically appears older through simple wear to his body over time. However, at the opposite end of the specutrum, there is the most ancient Autobot, [[Alpha Trion]], who has appeared in three distinct stages of life, (one million years old, three million years old, and twelve million years old), with a suitably different physical construction each time (including the growth of shaped metal that resembles facial "hair"). Transformers facial structures have even changed over time with brow crevices, angled cheek lines and discolored tooled metal appearing on their chins that show aging on their living metal skin. Notable examples of this are [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Rodimus Prime]], [[Galvatron]], [[Blurr]], [[Cyclonus]], [[Scourge]], [[Ultra Magnus]] and even the ancient destroyer [[Unicron]]. In the comics, an aged and mentally ravaged Rodimus Prime discusses "Aspects of Evil" with a soon to become turncoat autobot.

Although aging takes its toll on performance and appearance, there are no known incidences of transformers dying from "old age". Presumably, with regular maintenance and Energon, a Transformer could live forever.

===Stasis lock===
Stasis lock is an operational state meant to protect the spark of a Transformer following severe trauma; it is similar to a [[coma]] in humans. Stasis lock is known to be able to maintain the spark of a Transformer for millions of years if necessary. Once in stasis lock, outside intervention is required to reactivate the Transformer.

In the event of critical damage, outside life support mechanisms can support the body of a Transformer while the spark is transplanted. This is a rare occurrence as usually the spark is terminated quickly after the damage is inflicted. A notable occurrence of this happening is [[Optimus Primal]] taking the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership]], and Optimus Prime's spark, during the Beast Wars on prehistoric Earth while [[Teletraan I]] and other Maximals were repairing the incredible damage to his body.

====CR Chamber====
A CR Chamber (Critical Recovery Chamber) can reverse serious damage to Transformers. It was introduced as Maximal technology during ''[[Beast Wars]]''. The process takes time, but is not as lengthy as manual repair. A CR Chamber is used when a Transformer's internal repair processes cannot repair damage taken in a battle. It restores the bot to perfect physical condition. Problems with programming and data, such as viruses and core conscience damage, cannot be remedied and must be resolved manually. Similar technologies include the Predacon R Tank. The CR Chmamber/R Tank may also have protective qualities, as it possibly prevented Waspinator from becoming a [[Transmetals|Transmetal]] during a quantum surge after he fell into one, Rhinox and Dinobot may have also been protected by CR Chambers in the same manner. However, Tigertron, Airazor, Blackarachnia and Inferno also did not become Transmetals, despite not being protected, so it is more likely that the quantum surge simply did not affect all Transformers. Also some protoforms in Stasis Pods were mutated by the surge, such as Rampage's and the one used to replace Optimus Primal's destroyed body, while others, such as Fuzor Silverbolt's were unaffected. The Fuzor Quickstrike was noted to have Transmetal-like plating for his Scorpion half, but not his Cobra half and he lacked a vehicle mode.

===Death===
Death of a Transformer can follow irreversible (mortal) stasis lock or be caused by a sudden traumatic injury (such as a close-proximity nuclear explosion, or spark excision). A few weapons, such as a high powered fusion cannon, are known to be powerful enough to cause severe enough damage to immediately terminate a Transformer. Also, while the utter destruction of a body can and usually does cause death, a Transformer can often survive total dismemberment. Notable examples include Optimus Prime (during the Generation 1 series), [[Ultra Magnus]] (during the movie), [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and [[Waspinator]] (repeatedly).

Transformers who die from stasis lock usually turn a neutral gray, as the color leaves their living metal bodies. For example, Optimus Prime, various [[Insecticon]]s and [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seekers]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], and  Starscream (debatable, as his body was incinerated) have all turned gray upon death. Ultra Magnus did not turn gray, however, this may be because his actual body was encased in armor at the time. There is debate on whether the armor was constructed of ''living metal'' or not. Also, in [[The Transformers: Stormbringer]], [[Iguanus]]' body turned a uniform purple upon his death.

Transformers who die from mortal injury (as seen during the movie) have shown signature flashes in their optics, fire or smoke that discharges from their mouths or open wounds and bodily function failure depending on the type of energy that penetrates their outer shells and disables their inner circuits. For example, [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]], Prowl, Ironhide and Ratchet were shot to death with explosive plasma blasts. Because they didn't die an immediate death or suffered a slow death from their wounds, their inherit colors seemed to remain (temporarily) intact. Transformers also show the ability to feel pain from more damaging wounds that crack, bends and even breaks parts of their living metal skin.

In the "''[[Transformers: Animated]]''" series debut (2007–2009), [[Optimus Prime#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]] was killed by an energy shockwave from the [[Allspark#Transformers: Animated 2008 TV series|Allspark]] which was meant to drive [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] away after they had fought each other. However, [[Transformers: Animated#Allies|Sari Sumdac]]'s new AllSpark-upgraded key card instantly restored Optimus to life. When Optimus died, his body also turned gray, though he was not in stasis lock at the time; when he was restored, he changed back to his normal coloring.

===Beyond death===
It is known that some or all of a Transformer's essence moves to a separate spatial realm accessible by the Matrix or into the Matrix itself upon spark termination.

On rare occasions, a destroyed Transformer can be brought back to life using the proper knowledge. Quintessons have been known to do this. The Transformer creator [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] can also accomplish resurrections, but it is beyond the scope of modern Transformers technology. The method of a spark returning to the body has yet to be pinpointed, however it is believed an outside force, seen or unseen, may guide the spark back to the body, perhaps utilizing [[Zone Energy]]. Incidents of this occurring include the Quintesson revival of Optimus Prime and Rhinox's recovery of Optimus Primal after a transwarp explosion in space destroyed Primal's original body (and created a transwarp rift through which an ion trail could be created. If this feat is impossible with normal transformer technology, then the alien energy released by the detonation of the "Vox" device must be seen as responsible for access to "the other side of the Matrix" as well as producing part alien transmetal forms.)

Starscream was also given a new physical body after death by [[Unicron]]. However, unlike normal sparks that disappear from this world, Starscream's spark was able to continue existing in the physical world as a ghost and had the power to possess and control over Transformers, such as Cyclonus and Scourge. In Beast Wars it is stated that Starscream's spark could also travel through time as well as space, explaining his possession of Waspinator, and is believed by Transformer scientists to be a rare mutant spark that is indestructible/immortal and therefore not subject to the normal laws governing death.

In ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'', Megatron is also resurrected from the bottom of the ocean (where he was left in the first movie) to find The Fallen.

==Space Bridge==
The '''Space Bridge''' is a technology that enables Transformers to traverse great distances-usually interstellar as indicated by the name-without the use of a spacecraft or alternate mode.

===Animated series===

====Generation 1====
The Space Bridge was introduced as a Decepticon technology, typically enabling them to move back and forth between Earth and their homeworld of Cybertron while the Autobots were typically confined to the former. However, on several occasions the Autobots commandeered the Space Bridge for their own uses, usually to reach Cybertron to stop a Decepticon plot. Its use was largely discontinued after the Decepticons fled Cybertorn during the events of ''The Transformers Movie'' and began relying upon their alternate forms for travel.

====Robots in Disguise====
In this series the term Space Bridge referred to the Autobots' means of traversing the planet unseen, a hidden road network that extends to most parts of the planet. Created by the Build Team, this Space Bridge is more limited than other versions, as it is a physical road rather than a portal or teleportation device.

====Unicron Trilogy====
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', the Autobots and Decepticons utilize a similar technology to travel, opening portals through which they are able to travel vast distances. ''Transformers: Cybertron'' saw this means of transit replaced by the warp abilities of Vector Prime and other Cybertronians.

====Animated====
In this series the Autobots control a vast network of Space Bridges, which was one of the key forces behind their victory over the Decepticons in the Great War. The Space Bridge network is enabled by numerous relay stations across the galaxy, which individual Transformers and vessels can access in order to travel from one point to another. [[Omega Supreme]] was also equipped with his own Space Bridge drive, enabling him to teleport without accessing a Space Bridge.

====Aligned continuity====
Both Autobots and Decepticons utilize Space Bridge technology in the Aligned continuity, which also introduced a variant of the technology known as the '''Ground Bridge'''. This version is a less powerful variant of the Space Bridge, with its name referring to its more limited range, as it is only capable of transport to other points on the same planet or in nearby space.

===Comics===

===Films===

==Communication==
In the 2007 Michael Bay-directed live-action film, Optimus Prime revealed to [[Witwicky family#Samuel James Witwicky|Sam Witwicky]] that the surviving Cybertronians managed to learn Earth's languages through the [[World Wide Web]] (with the auction site [[eBay]] being cited throughout the film as the primary source of information regarding the eyeglasses of Sam's great-grandfather, Captain [[Witwicky family#Archibald Witwicky|Archibald Witwicky]]), hinting that the Transformers, being highly evolved sentient electronically composed beings, possess the capability to both interface with communications networks and protocols and glean information from Internet-accessible documents, files and applications. However, the capability of the Transformers to learn both written and spoken languages through the World Wide Web and translate between the Cybertronian language and Earth-human languages was not fully explained in the film.

}}'''Tudor Bompa''' is often regarded as the father of [[sports periodization]] theory, a training system developed by the [[Soviets]] that emphasised variable loads for optimal performance throughout the year rather than maintaining a constant training focus. Bompa's training theory was a summary of periodization basics laid out by L.P. Matveev and others in his early and only English published ''Theory and Methodology of Training''. Bompa's understanding of periodization has been passed from the Eastern Bloc to the Americas in an incomplete and sometimes inaccurate interpretation.

Prof. Tudor Bompa PhD., one of the world's top specialists who revolutionized the training methods of athletes around the world, is an honorary guest of the Politehnica University Timișoara, who awarded him with the title of Doctor Honoris Causa during the Politehnica Week. The famous professor, who is behind the success of the athlete Ben Johnson, met on November 8 in Timisoara with athletes, coaches, and mass media representatives, who learned some of the secrets that underlie the top athletes' training. Tudor Bompa is known as the man who revolutionized Western training methods. After more than 40 years of work in the international sports arena, he is considered one of the world's top specialists in periodization, planning, performance and strength training.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.upt.ro/Informatii-utile_grant-of-dhc-title-to-prof-tudor-bompa-_144_en.html|title=Grant of DHC Title to Prof. Tudor BOMPA  {{!}} Politehnica University Timisoara|website=www.upt.ro|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=October 2016}} Bompa is a Professor Emeritus at [[York University]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  He is married to Tamara Bompa who is an associate lecturer at York University.

Professor TUDOR BOMPA was born on 23 December 1932 in the town of [[Năsăud|Nasaud]], in [[Northern Transylvania]]. He attended his first school classes in his hometown, and in 1949 he moved to the Sports School in Cluj-Napoca, under the patronage of the local “Victor Babeş” University. During his junior years, he was part of the national athletics team, and won several silver and bronze medals at the National Championships, in the pentathlon, javelin and discus competitions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his teens, Bompa played competitive soccer and competed in [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] and [[pentathlon]]. After an ankle injury, he swapped to rowing, which he found difficult as it is an endurance sport rather than a strength sport that he had been used to through his [[track and field]] career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorbompainstitute.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/interview-with-tudor-bompa/|title=Interview with Tudor Bompa|last1=Koch|first1=Fred|date=7 October 2013|publisher=Tudor Bompa Institute|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1958 European Rowing Championships]], he won a silver medal in the [[coxed four]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-komplett.de/sport-komplett/sportarten/r/rudern/hst/68.html|title=Rudern – Europameisterschaften (Herren – Vierer m.Stm.)|last1=Heckert|first1=Karlheinz|publisher=Sport Komplett|language=de|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the courses of the Institute of Physical Culture and Sports, a prestigious sports academy in the Romanian capital city, Bucharest, which he graduated at the age of 24, in 1956. In Bucharest, he activated within the Central Army House Club, with which he won six national titles at rowing and a silver medal in 1958 at the European Championship. As a student, but mainly after graduation, between 1960 and 1970, he served as Director of the Central Army House Sports Club, as university assistant professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Timisoara and the University of Bucharest, and as Athletic Director at Politehnica Timișoara Sports Club. Starting in 1960, he laid the foundations of new training methods for performance athletes, which were first published in the journal “Studies and Research” Politehnica Timişoara, T. BOMPA being part of the editorial board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Honors ==

=== Coaching career ===

As a coach, Bompa trained 11 medalists in various [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] (2 gold medals) and World championships in two sport disciplines: [[track and field]] and [[Sport rowing|rowing]]. He revolutionized the training concepts in [[cross country skiing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The system and training methods of the distinguished specialist are proven by the performance of “ Bompațs champions “, who won 11 medals (4 gold, 2 silver and 5 bronze) in the Olympic Games and World Championships; 3 medals (2 gold) in the Pan American Games; 22 medals in National Championships (in [[Canada]] and [[Romania]]).

Two outstanding results have crowned his permanent, uninterrupted concerns in the development and application of his methods in order to achieve the highest level of performance:

[[Mihaela Peneș|Mihaela Peneş]], Romanian junior, [[Javelin throw|javelin]], Olympic champion in Tokyo in 1964. TUDOR BOMPA managed the physical training of young Mihaela Peneş, for a year and a half in the years 1963-1964. Thus, the 17-year-old unknown, who was not taken into account after a 51-meter qualification, became the Olympic champion in Tokyo with a 60.54-meter throw in the first attempt. She was the “bomb” of the Olympics, “the wonder of Tokyo,” who shocked the world.

[[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], Canadian [[Sprint (running)|Sprinter]], Olympic Champion at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, 100 meters. T. BOMPA’s best known “product” is the Canadian Sprinter Ben Johnson. In 1988, at the Seoul Olympics, in the “race of the century”, while competing with American sprinter Carl Lewis, Johnson arrived first in the 100-meter competition, with a new world record of 9.79 seconds. This was the peak of the confrontation between the two world speed titans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Books ===

With 15 books published, translated into 18 languages, sold in over one million copies and used in 180 countries, Prof. Tudor Bompa Ph.D. has received so far only in Romania the title of honorary citizen of his native town, Năsăud. Moreover, when awarding the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the Politehnica University Timișoara, Prof. Tudor Bompa Ph.D. said, visibly touched, that "in my trophy room, it will occupy the most important place." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20092">[[Image:Mildura Airport Weatherstation.jpg|right|thumb|Weather station at [[Mildura Airport]], [[Victoria, Australia]].]]
A '''weather station''' is a facility, either on land or sea, with instruments and equipment for measuring [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions to provide information for [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] and to study the [[weather]] and [[climate]]. The measurements taken include [[temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[humidity]], [[wind speed]], [[wind direction]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amounts. [[Wind]] measurements are taken with as few other obstructions as possible, while temperature and humidity measurements are kept free from direct solar radiation, or [[insolation]]. Manual observations are taken at least once daily, while automated measurements are taken at least once an hour. Weather conditions out at sea are taken by ships and buoys, which measure slightly different meteorological quantities such as [[sea surface temperature]] (SST), wave height, and wave period. Drifting [[weather buoy]]s outnumber their moored versions by a significant amount.

==Weather Instruments==
[[File:NOAA weather station at Wake Island harbor.jpg|thumb|The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] weather station at [[Wake Island]] harbor measures and transmits data on [[wind speed]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[temperature|air temperature]] and [[tide]]s.]]
Typical weather stations have the following instruments:
* [[Thermometer]] for measuring air and sea surface temperature
* [[Barometer]] for measuring [[atmospheric pressure]]
* [[Hygrometer]] for measuring humidity
* [[Anemometer]] for measuring wind speed
* [[Pyranometer]] for measuring [[solar radiation]]
* [[Rain gauge]] for measuring liquid precipitation over a set period of time.

In addition, at certain [[automated airport weather station]]s, additional instruments may be employed, including:
* Present Weather/Precipitation Identification Sensor for identifying falling precipitation
* [[Disdrometer]] for measuring [[Raindrop size distribution|drop size distribution]]
* [[Transmissometer]] for measuring visibility
* [[Ceilometer]] for measuring cloud ceiling

More sophisticated stations may also measure the [[ultraviolet index]], [[leaf wetness]], [[soil moisture]], soil temperature, water temperature in ponds, lakes, creeks, or rivers, and occasionally other data.

===Exposure===
Except for those instruments requiring direct exposure to the elements (anemometer, rain gauge), the instruments should be sheltered in a vented box, usually a [[Stevenson screen]], to keep direct sunlight off the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer. The instrumentation may be specialized to allow for periodic recording otherwise significant manual labour is required for record keeping. Automatic transmission of data, in a format such as [[METAR]], is also desirable as many weather station's data is required for weather forecasting.

==Personal weather station==
[[File:Davis VantagePro.jpg|right|thumb|Roof-mounted weather station instruments]]
A personal weather station is a set of weather measuring instruments operated by a private individual, club, association, or business (where obtaining and distributing weather data is not a part of the entity's business operation).  Personal weather stations have become more advanced and can include many different sensors to measure weather conditions. These sensors can vary between models but most measure wind speed, wind direction, outdoor and indoor temperatures, outdoor and indoor humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, and UV or solar radiation. Other available sensors can measure soil moisture, soil temperature, and leaf wetness.  The quality, number of instruments, and placement of personal weather stations can vary widely, making the determination of which stations collect accurate, meaningful, and comparable data difficult. There are a comprehensive number of [[retail weather stations]] available.

Personal weather stations typically involve a digital console that provides readouts of the data being collected. These consoles may interface to a personal computer where data can be displayed, stored, and uploaded to websites or data ingestion/distribution systems. [[open-source hardware|Open-source]] weather stations are available that are designed to be fully customizable by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Yannick-Verbelen/WeatherStation-3|title=WeatherStation 3|last=Verbelen|first=Yannick|date=2016|website=CircuitMaker|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416130000/https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Yannick-Verbelen/WeatherStation-3|archive-date=2017-04-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 April 2017|quote=The firmware is under active development, and users are encouraged to contribute to it by forking the repository on Github. An initiative to further develop the hardware and make it commercially available is ongoing as spin-off project OpenObservatory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal weather stations may be operated solely for the enjoyment and education of the owner, while some owners share their results with others. They do this by either by manually compiling data and distributing it, distributing data over the internet, or sharing data via [[amateur radio]]. The [[Citizen Weather Observer Program]] (CWOP) is a service which facilitates the sharing of information from personal weather stations. This data is submitted through use of software, a personal computer, and internet connection (or amateur radio) and are utilized by groups such as the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) when generating [[Numerical weather prediction|forecast models]]. Each weather station submitting data to CWOP will also have an individual Web page that depicts the data submitted by that station. The [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]] Internet site is another popular destination for the submittal and sharing of data with others around the world. As with CWOP, each station submitting data to Weather Underground has a unique Web page displaying their submitted data. The UK [[Met Office]]'s Weather Observations Website (WOW) also allows such data to be shared and displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2011/wow-website-to-launch|title=WOW - A new weather website for everyone|date=2011-02-11|publisher=[[Met Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home weather station==
Home weather stations include hygrometers, thermometers, barographs, and barometers. Commonly wall mounted and made by manufacturers such as Airguide, Taylor, Springfield, Sputnik and Stormoguide.
[[Image:Polarfront.jpg|thumb|right|The weather ship {{MS|Polarfront}} at sea.]]

== Dedicated ships ==
{{Main article|Weather ship}}
A [[weather ship]] was a [[ship]] stationed in the [[ocean]] as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological measurements for use in weather forecasting. It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5A9LCujs08C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=weather+ship+book#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20ship%20book&amp;f=false|pages=127–130|author=Malcolm Francis Willoughby|title=The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II|publisher=|date=|ISBN=|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during [[World War II]] that the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) established a global network of 13 weather ships in 1948.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=weather+ship+book#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20ship%20book&amp;f=false|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=June 1948|accessdate=2011-01-18|title=Britain's First Weather Ship|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 12 left in operation in 1996, nine were located in the northern [[Atlantic ocean]] while three were located in the northern [[Pacific ocean]]. The agreement of the weather ships ended in 1990. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sHp9ml7G6YC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;dq=weather+ship+book#v=onepage&amp;q=weather%20ship%20book&amp;f=false|pages=369–371|title=Ocean surface waves: their physics and prediction|author=Stanislaw R. Massel|year=1996|publisher=World Scientific|ISBN=978-981-02-2109-6|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last weather ship was {{MS|Polarfront}}, known as weather station M ("jilindras") at 66°N, 02°E, run by the [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]. MS ''Polarfront'' was removed from service January 1, 2010. Since the 1960s this role has been largely superseded by [[satellite]]s, long range [[aircraft]] and [[weather buoy]]s. Weather observations from ships continue from thousands of [[Voluntary observing ship program|voluntary merchant vessels]] in routine commercial operation; the [[Old Weather]] [[crowdsourcing]] project transcribes naval logs from before the era of dedicated ships.

==Synoptic weather station==
[[File:PULSONIC - PULSIA - Station Synoptique.png|thumb|right|A [[Synoptic scale meteorology|Synoptic]] automatic weather station]]
[[Synoptic scale meteorology|Synoptic]] weather stations are instruments which collect meteorological information at synoptic time 00h00, 06h00, 12h00, 18h00 ([[UTC]]) and at intermediate synoptic hours 03h00, 09h00, 15h00, 21h00 (UTC).

The common instruments of measure are anemometer, wind vane, pressure sensor, thermometer, hygrometer, and rain gauge.

The weather measures are formatted in special format and transmit to WMO to help the weather forecast model.

==Networks==
A variety of land-based weather station networks have been set up globally. Some of these are basic to analyzing [[weather front]]s and pressure systems, such as the synoptic observation network, while others are more regional in nature, known as [[mesonet]]s.

'''Zhang Jiaxiang''' ({{zh|c=张家祥}}; born in Oct. 1932), also known as '''Chia-Hsiang Chang''', is a Chinese [[astronomer]] affiliated with [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of the Minor Planet Foundation at that observatory.

He discovered [[5384 Changjiangcun]], an inner main-belt asteroid of the [[Hungaria family]] at the Purple Mountain Observatory in 1957 named after the village near [[Zhangjiagang]], China. It is his only discovery credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]] under the name "C.-H. Chang".&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Changjiangcun" /&gt;

== Biography ==

Zhang Jiaxiang, astronomer, was born in Oct. 1932 in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu province]]. In 1951, he first joined the Purple Mountain Observatory as a technician, supervised by director [[Zhang Yuzhe]].

In 1957, Zhang Yuzhe and Zhang Jiaxiang worked together and published a paper discussing the orbit of artificial satellites. From 1965 to 1972, Prof. Zhang led a research group to accomplish the project of orbit determination of the first Chinese [[artificial satellite]] and thereafter the systematic studies of the orbit of Chinese synchronous satellite. In total, they have discovered more than 150 internationally numbered new [[minor planets]] and four [[comet]]s. In the 1990s, he accurately predicted a series of collision times between 19 comet nuclei and Jupiter, based on his self-established numerical model of the [[solar system]] dynamics. In the most recent 10 years, he was named as the chief scientist, leading a  project of “Construction of Near Earth Object Telescope，” which has been successfully completed.

To recognize his contribution in his field, Harvard Smithsonian Observatory in Boston named the asteroid [[4760&amp;nbsp;Jia-xiang]] after him.&lt;ref name="MPC-Jia-xiang" /&gt;
