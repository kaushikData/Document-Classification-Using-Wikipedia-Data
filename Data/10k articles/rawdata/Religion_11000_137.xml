In [[Hopi mythology]], '''Aholi''' is a [[kachina]], a spirit, also called a kachina.  He is a friend of [[Eototo]] and is very handsome; he wears a colorful cloak with a picture of [[Muyingwa]] and is the [[patron god|patron]] kachina of the [[Pikya clan]].  Aholi once allowed his throat to be slit so that Eototo could escape.  They eventually met again.
Aholi,a chief Kachina on Third Mesa appears with Eototo. Both are principal Kachinas appearing in the Powamu and other sacred rituals.&lt;ref&gt;H.

The '''Archbishop of Canterbury''' is the senior [[bishop]] and principal leader of the [[Church of England]], the symbolic head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]]. The current archbishop is [[Justin Welby]], who was enthroned at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] on 21 March 2013. Welby is the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|105th in a line]] which goes back more than 1400 years to [[Augustine of Canterbury]], the "Apostle to the English", sent from [[Rome]] in the year 597. Welby succeeded [[Rowan Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2692/announcement-of-the-105th-archbishop-of-canterbury|title=Announcement of the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury|date=9 November 2012|work=Archbishop of Canterbury Website|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of Augustine until the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in [[full communion]] with the [[See of Rome]] and usually received the [[pallium]] from the [[Pope]]. During the [[English Reformation]], the Church of England broke away from the authority of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Thomas Cranmer]] became the first Protestant holder of the office in 1533, while [[Reginald Pole]] was the last Catholic in the position, serving from 1556 to 1558 during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other [[bishop]]s. At various times the choice was made by the [[canons of Canterbury Cathedral]], the Pope, or the [[King of England]]. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a [[state church]] and the choice is legally that of [[the Crown]]; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], who receives a shortlist of two names from an ''ad hoc'' committee called the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Commission]].

==Present roles and status==
Today the archbishop fills four main roles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 Archbishop's Roles and Responsibilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214105116/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 |date=14 February 2008 }}, Archbishop of Canterbury website. Retrieved 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

# He is the diocesan bishop of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], which covers the [[East Kent|eastern]] parts of the County of [[Kent]]. Founded in 597, it is the oldest [[episcopal see|see]] in the English church.
# He is the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]], which covers the southern two-thirds of England.
# He is the senior [[primate (bishop)|primate]] and chief religious figure of the Church of England (the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|supreme governor]] of the church). Along with his colleague the [[Archbishop of York]] he chairs the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] and sits on or chairs many of the church's important boards and committees; power in the church is not highly centralised, however, so the two archbishops can often lead only through persuasion. The Archbishop of Canterbury plays a central part in national ceremonies such as [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]]; due to his high public profile, his opinions are often in demand by the [[news media]].
# As spiritual leader of the [[Anglican Communion]], the archbishop, although without legal authority outside England, is recognised by convention as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' ("first among equals") of all Anglican [[primate (bishop)|primates]] worldwide. Since 1867 he has convened more or less decennial meetings of worldwide Anglican bishops, the [[Lambeth Conferences]].

In the last two of these functions, he has an important [[ecumenical]] and [[interfaith]] role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.

The archbishop's main residence is [[Lambeth Palace]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, [[Canterbury]], located beside [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where the [[Chair of St Augustine]] sits.

As holder of one of the "five great sees" (the others being [[Archbishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]), the Archbishop of Canterbury is ''ex officio'' one of the [[Lords Spiritual]] of the [[House of Lords]]. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|United Kingdom's order of precedence]].

Since [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Catholic Church|Rome]], the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch.  Since the 20th century, the appointment of Archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between [[Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofyork.org/154?q=archbishops The Archbishop of Canterbury], website of the Archbishop of York. Retrieved 31 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current archbishop, Justin Welby, the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 4 February 2013. As archbishop he signs himself as ''+ Justin Cantuar''. His predecessor, Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury, Williams was the [[Bishop of Monmouth]] and [[Archbishop of Wales]]. On 18 March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down as Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of 2012 to become [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=125895 Dr Williams resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional roles===
In addition to his office, the archbishop also holds a number of other positions; for example, he is Joint President of the [[Council of Christians and Jews]] in the United Kingdom. Some positions he formally holds ''[[ex officio]]'' and others virtually so (the incumbent of the day, although appointed personally, is appointed because of his office). Amongst these are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldreg/reg06.htm|title=Register of Lords' interests|accessdate=15 August 2007|publisher=[[House of Lords]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807023334/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldreg/reg06.htm|archivedate=7 August 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical and interfaith===
The Archbishop of Canterbury is also a president of [[Churches Together in England]] (an [[ecumenical]] organisation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Presidents of Churches Together in England|url=http://www.churches-together.net/Articles/61446/Churches_Together_in/About_Us/The_Presidents_of.aspx|publisher=Churches Together in England|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Fisher]], 99th Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first since 1397 to visit Rome, where he held private talks with [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960. In 2005, Rowan Williams became the first Archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal funeral since the Reformation. He also attended the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. The 101st archbishop, [[Donald Coggan]], was the first to attend a papal inauguration, that of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Baden|title=Lord Coggan of Canterbury|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/19/guardianobituaries.religion|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the Archbishop of Canterbury has co-sponsored the Alexandria Middle East Peace process with the Grand Mufti of Egypt. In July 2008, the archbishop attended a conference of Christians, Jews and Muslims convened by the King of Saudi Arabia at which the notion of the "clash of civilizations" was rejected. Delegates agreed "on international guidelines for dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2008/special-reports/080719-madrid-conference.html |title=Madrid Interfaith Dialogue Conference: Beginning of a Process|publisher=Saudi-US Relations Information Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515085122/http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2008/special-reports/080719-madrid-conference.html|archivedate=15 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates said that "the deepening of moral values and ethical principles, which are common denominators among such followers, would help strengthen stability and achieve prosperity for all humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niles|first=D.

==Origins==
[[File:Angl-Canterbury-Arms.svg|thumb|right|upright|Arms of the [[episcopal see|see]] of Canterbury. Nearly 500 years after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], the arms still depict the [[pallium]], a symbol of the authority of the [[Pope]] and metropolitan archbishops.]]
It has been suggested that the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] had four archbishops, seated at [[Londinium]] ([[London]]), [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), [[Lindum Colonia]] ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]) and [[Corinium Dobunnorum]] ([[Cirencester]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wacher, J., ''The Towns of Roman Britain'', Batsford, 1974, especially pp. 84–6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 5th and 6th centuries Britannia began to be overrun by [[paganism|pagan]], [[Germanic peoples]] who came to be known collectively as the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Of the kingdoms they created, [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently situated for communication with [[continental Europe]]. In the late 6th century, King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] married a Christian [[Franks|Frankish]] princess named [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02519a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Bertha&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; He permitted the preaching of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bede]], ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'', i, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Archbishop of Canterbury was [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] (not to be confused with [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine of Hippo]]), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King Æthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]], had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', i, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, N., ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', Leicester University Press, 1984, pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the [[Chair of St. Augustine]].

A Gospel Book believed to be directly associated with St Augustine's mission survives in the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge University]], England. Catalogued as Cambridge ''Manuscript 286'', it has been positively dated to 6th century Italy and this bound book, the [[St Augustine Gospels]], is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.

Before the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the Western European church. Since the break the Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition (although this is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church which regards Anglicanism as schismatic{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and does not accept Anglican holy orders as valid) as well as being the "mother church" of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

==Province and Diocese of Canterbury==
The Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the [[Province of Canterbury]], which encompasses thirty of the forty-two dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the [[Province of York]]. The four dioceses of Wales were formerly also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the [[established church|established Church]] of England to the [[Disestablishment of the Church in Wales|disestablished]] [[Church in Wales]].

[[File:CanterburyCathedral.png|thumb|left|View of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west {{circa|1890–1900}}]]
The Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial ''curia'', or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf Order of Service from the Enthronement of the 104th Archbishop in 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202170108/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf |date=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishop of London]]—the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial [[Dean (Church)|dean]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] as [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as vice-chancellor, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] as [[precentor]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] as [[chaplain]] and the [[Bishop of Rochester]] as [[crucifer|cross-bearer]].

Along with [[Primacy of Canterbury|primacy over the Archbishop of York]], the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as ''primus inter pares'', or first amongst equals. He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England, except in certain minor roles dictated by Canon in those provinces (for example, he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the Archbishop of Wales). He does hold [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitical]] authority over several [[extra-provincial Anglican churches]], and he serves as ''ex officio'' [[Bishop of the Falkland Islands]].

At present the archbishop has three [[suffragan]] bishops:
{{clear}}
* The [[Bishop of Dover]] is given the additional title of "Bishop in Canterbury" and empowered to act almost as if he were the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], since the archbishop is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties.
* Two further suffragans, the [[Bishop of Ebbsfleet]] and the [[Bishop of Richborough]], are [[provincial episcopal visitor]]s for the whole [[Province of Canterbury]], licensed by the archbishop as "flying bishops" to provide oversight throughout the province to parishes who hold to the Church Catholic's teaching on the Sacrament of Ordination. 

The [[Bishop of Maidstone]] was previously a second ''actual'' suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm Canterbury Diocese — Synod News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615003605/http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm |date=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and privileges==
The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as "The Most Reverend"; retired archbishops are styled as "The Right Reverend". Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and may, therefore, also use the style of "[[The Right Honourable]]" for life (unless they are later removed from the council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as "The Most Reverend &lt;!--Father in God, is now omitted--&gt;[[Given name|Forenames]], by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan". In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as "The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury". "The Right Honourable" is not used in either instance. He may also be formally addressed as "Your Grace"—or, more often these days, simply as "Archbishop", or "Father".

The surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned. The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as "Cantuar" (from the [[Latin]] for Canterbury). The right to use a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops, [[Peers of the Realm]] and peers by courtesy. The current Archbishop of Canterbury usually signs as "''+Justin Cantuar:''".

In the [[Order of Precedence in England and Wales|English and Welsh order of precedence]], the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the Sovereign and members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', 2008, p43 – (Precedence, England and Wales)&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately below him is the [[Lord Chancellor]] and then the Archbishop of York.

===Lambeth degrees===
The Archbishop of Canterbury awards academic degrees, commonly called "[[Lambeth degree]]s".

==Residences==
[[File:Lambeth Palace London 240404.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.4|The Archbishop of Canterbury's official London residence is [[Lambeth Palace]], photographed looking east across the [[River Thames]]]]
The Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is [[Lambeth Palace]].
He also has a residence, named [[Old Palace, Canterbury|The Old Palace]], next to [[Canterbury Cathedral]] on the site of the medieval Archbishop's Palace.
The archbishops had palaces on the periphery of London and on the route between London and Canterbury.

Former palaces of the archbishops include
* [[Croydon Palace]]: the summer residence of the Archbishops from the 15th to the 18th centuries.
* [[Addington Palace]]: purchased as a replacement for Croydon Palace in 1807; sold in 1897.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone]]: constructed in the 1390s, the palace was seized by the Crown at the time of the Reformation.
* [[Otford Palace]]: a medieval palace, rebuilt by Archbishop Warham {{circa|1515}} and forfeited to the Crown by Thomas Cranmer in 1537.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Charing]]: a palace existed from at least the 13th century; seized by the Crown after the Dissolution.
* [[Knole House]]: built by Archbishop Bourchier in the second half of the 15th century, it was forfeited to the Crown by Archbishop Cranmer in 1538.
* The Old Palace, [[Bekesbourne]], built {{circa|1552}} for Archbishop Cranmer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/English%20sites/4000.html&lt;br /&gt;Tim Tatton Brown, ''Lambeth Palace: A History of the Archbishops of Canterbury and Their Houses'' (2000) p.73-4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Archura''' ({{lang-cv|Арçури}}, ''Arśuri''; {{lang-tt|Арсури}}, ''Arsuri''; {{lang-tr|Arçura}}; {{lang-ru|Арзюр}}, ''Arzjur'') is a [[shapeshifter|shapeshifting]] woodland spirit in [[Turkic mythology]] who protects wild animals and forests.

==Description==
Archura usually appears as a man, but he is able to change his size from that of a blade of grass to a very tall tree. He has hair and a beard made from living grass,&lt;ref&gt;Türk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sözlük, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayınevi (Page - 66)&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes depicted with a tail, hooves, and horns. Archura has a close bond with the [[gray wolf]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Bozkurt). Legend describes him as having a red scarf and his left shoe on his right foot.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sözlük, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayınevi (Page - 67)&lt;/ref&gt; He also had no shadow.

Archura protects the animals and birds in the forest and tells them when to migrate. He can shapeshift into many different forms. As a human, he looks like a peasant with glowing eyes.

Archuras are terribly mischievous beings: they have horrible cries, and can imitate voices of people familiar to wanderers and lure them back to their caves, where the Archuras will tickle them to death; they also remove signs from their posts. They aren't evil: although they enjoy misguiding humans and kidnapping young women, they are also known to keep grazing cattle from wandering too far into the forests and getting lost. Sometimes more than one Archura inhabits a forest, and then they will fight for their territory, knocking down trees and scaring animals.

== Chor / Chura ==
There are two different kinds of [[Chort|Chura]]. The one ([[Bichura (folklore)|Bichura]]) that comes from the forest is married to the Orman iyesi. The other one (Archura) comes from the cellar and she is married to Ev iyesi.

Parlett - 2014, p 126&lt;/ref&gt; or that he is the [[antichrist]] of [[Christian eschatology]], have been suggested since he campaigned for the U.S. Senate in 2004 and proliferated after his election as [[President of the U.S.]] in 2008.

Barack Obama is a [[Protestant]] [[Christian]]. While in his twenties, Obama was involved with the [[Black churches]]. From 1992 until 2008, he was a member of the [[Trinity United Church of Christ]]—a [[Reformed]] denomination. Obama left it in the wake of the [[Jeremiah Wright controversy]]. Since 2008, he attends various [[Protestant]] churches, including [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]] and [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopalian]] churches.

==Claims that Obama secretly practices Islam==
{{See also|Public image of Barack Obama#Religion}}
Obama was baptized into the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) denomination and formally joined it in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/world/americas/30iht-30obama.5501905.html |title=Barack Obama's search for faith|first=Jodi|last=Kantor|date=April 30, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the UCC in 2008 because of the Rev. [[Jeremiah Wright controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27775757/ "Obama's church choice likely to be scrutinized"]. Associated Press. msnbc.com. November 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He now worships with a [[Southern Baptist]] pastor at [[Camp David]] but has not become a formal member of any church since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Amy (June 29, 2009). [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1907610,00.html "The Obamas Find a Church Home—Away from Home"]. ''Time''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Obama is a practicing Christian&lt;ref name="Marsden"&gt;Marsden, Lee. "Religion, Identity and American Power in the Age of Obama." International Politics 48.2-3 (2011): 326-43. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 27 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson, Gary C.

Web. 27 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; and he was chiefly raised by his mother and her Christian parents, his father, [[Barack Obama, Sr.]], with whom he lived only as a baby, he characterized as a Muslim-raised atheist,&lt;ref name="spiritual journey"&gt;{{cite news |author=Obama, Barack |date=16 October 2006 |title=My spiritual journey |magazine=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1546579,00.html |accessdate=5 March 2008 |quote=My father was almost entirely absent from my childhood, having been divorced from my mother when I was 2 years old; in any event, although my father had been raised a Muslim, by the time he met my mother he was a confirmed atheist, thinking religion to be so much superstition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his stepfather, [[Lolo Soetoro]], with whom he lived during his early childhood, was nominally Muslim. This familial connection to Islam, among other things, is a basis of claims that Obama secretly practices Islam.

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', false rumors saying that Obama was secretly a Muslim started during his campaign for the [[United States Senate]] in 2004 and had expanded through viral e-mails by 2006. The ''Times'' compared these rumors to earlier false rumors about 2000 presidential candidate [[John McCain]] fathering a dark-skinned child out of wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/opinion/ed-obama3 Smears 2.0], ''Los Angeles Times'', December 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;   The rumors were subsequently promoted by conservative talk show hosts, including [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]].&lt;ref name="Wapo 11-29-07"/&gt;

In December 2007 [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|the Hillary Clinton campaign]] asked a volunteer county coordinator to step down after she forwarded an e-mail message which repeated the false rumor that Obama was Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2007/12/clinton-campaign-volunteer-out.html Clinton Campaign Volunteer Out Over False Obama Rumors], ''[[Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2008, New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], himself Jewish, spoke out to Jewish voters in Florida against false e-mail rumors which said that Obama was secretly a Muslim and did not support [[Israel]]. Bloomberg said: "I hope all of you will join me throughout this campaign in strongly speaking out against this fear mongering, no matter who you'll be voting for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/n-y-mayor-urges-jewish-voters-to-denounce-obama-muslim-rumors-1.248209 N.Y. Mayor urges Jewish voters to denounce Obama Muslim rumors], [[Associated Press]], June 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Taha al-Lahibi, a former member of the [[Iraqi parliament]] known for promoting fringe conspiracy theories, claimed that Obama was "the son of a [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] Kenyan father." These unfounded claims do not have broad support among [[Iraq]]is, and al-Lahibi's claim prompted mockery.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Taylor, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/08/the-obama-is-a-muslim-conspiracy-theory-gets-a-shiite-twist-from-a-former-iraqi-lawmaker/ The 'Obama is a Muslim' conspiracy theory gets a Shiite twist from a former Iraqi lawmaker], ''Washington Post'' (June 8, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qur'an claim===
A chain e-mail circulating during the presidential campaign claimed that Obama took his oath of office as a [[U.S. Senate|U.S. Senator]] in 2005 while placing his hand on a [[Qur'an]] rather than a Bible. This claim is false, as Obama was sworn into office using a Bible that he owned. The claim may have been inspired by a photo-op re-enactment of the 2007 swearing-in of U.S. Representative [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Keith Ellison]] of Minnesota, who used a Qur'an that had belonged to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="quran"/&gt;

===Madrasah claim===
An early version of a rumor that Obama had "spent at least four years in a so-called ''[[madrassa]]'', or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia"&lt;ref name="Wapo 11-29-07" /&gt; appeared in an article published by ''[[Insight on the News]]'', a magazine published by [[News World Communications]], an international media conglomerate then owned by the [[Unification Church]]. ''Insight on the News'' ceased publication soon after the incident. Its editor, [[Jeff Kuhner]], claimed that a person working for the Clinton campaign had told him that the campaign was "preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack Obama had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was six". Senator Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Kuhner did not name the person said to be his reporter's source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Anatomy of an anonymous political smear | date= January 29, 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/29/news/rumor.php | work = International Herald Tribune | accessdate = February 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama attended two schools during the four years he lived in Indonesia as a child (1967–1971). From the first grade until some time in the third grade he attended the Roman Catholic St. Francis Assisi School, where classes began and ended each day with Christian prayers. He was registered there as Muslim because of his [[Lolo Soetoro|stepfather's]] [[nominal religion]]. At some point during the third grade he transferred to [[State Elementary School Menteng 01]], also known as Besuki School, for less than a year. Besuki is a secular [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. Students there wear Western clothing, and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' described the school as "so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas".&lt;ref name="CBS News August 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wahabi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debunked"/&gt;

Soon after ''Insight''{{'}}s story, [[CNN]] reporter [[John Vause]] visited State Elementary School Menteng 01 and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in his or her own faith. Hardi Priyono, the deputy headmaster of the school told Vause: "This is a public school. We don't focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/index.html |title=CNN debunks false report about Obama |publisher=CNN |date=January 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125023229/http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/index.html |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviews by [[Nedra Pickler]] of the [[Associated Press]] found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama's attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice-principal of the school, told Pickler: "The allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone's welcome here ... it's a public school."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Obama challenges allegation about Islamic school |first= Nedra |last= Pickler |url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20070124-1317-obama-2008.html |work= San Diego Union-Tribune |date= January 24, 2007 |accessdate= February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle name "Mohammed" claim===
One chain e-mail claimed incorrectly that President Obama's middle name is Mohammed or Muhammed. His actual middle name is [[Hussein]].&lt;ref name="mohammed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mohammed2"/&gt;

===Polls and surveys===
Public opinion surveys carried out, beginning in 2008, have shown that a number of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim. In March 2008, a survey conducted by [[Pew Research Center]] found that 10% of respondents believed that rumor. Those who were more likely to believe he is a Muslim included political conservatives (both Republicans and Democrats), people who had not attended college, people who lived in the Midwest or the South, and people in rural areas.&lt;ref name="people press"/&gt;

A study conducted by the [[University of Georgia]] found that the percentage of Americans who believed that Obama is a Muslim remained constant at approximately 20% in September, October, and November 2008, despite frequent attempts by the media as well as the Obama campaign to correct this misconception. However, the study also showed that some people who had initially believed Obama to be a Christian later believed the rumor that he is a Muslim. The survey found that respondents who had shifted to the misconception were generally younger, less politically involved, less educated, more conservative, and more likely to believe in [[Biblical literalism]]. According to Professor Barry Hollander, "These are groups of people who are generally distrustful of the mainstream media...So therefore journalists telling them that this is not true could actually have the opposite effect and make them more likely to believe the rumor."&lt;ref name="univ"/&gt;

In August 2010, a Pew Research poll showed that 18% of Americans and 30% of Republicans believed that Obama is a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41248.html August 2010 Pew Research poll]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, data from the aforementioned Pew Center found that the popularity of the misinformation had increased in some groups. Specifically, over one in seven Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) labeled the President a Muslim. Haris Tarin of the Muslim Public Affairs Council remarked that the survey "shows there's a lot of fear-mongering and politicking in America".&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

==Barack Obama's response==
{{quote|I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most [[Spirituality|spiritual]] people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.

===In person===

Barack Obama has publicly responded to questions regarding his religion on more than one occasion. During a debate of Democratic presidential candidates on January 15, 2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada, the moderator, [[Brian Williams]], asked Obama about the rumor that he was "trying to hide the fact that he is a Muslim". Obama responded that "the facts are: I am a Christian. I have been sworn in [to the US Senate] with a Bible." He then said "in the Internet age, there are going to be lies&lt;!-- Note that the NY Times transcript incorrectly quoted him using the word "lives". He did use the word "lies", as can be seen in the video at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/15/obama-asked-about-false-m_n_81703.html --&gt; that are spread all over the place. I have been victimized by these lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/us/politics/15demdebate-transcript.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Democratic Debate in Las Vegas|date=January 15, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18137417|title=Democrats Cordially Spar at Las Vegas Debate|first=Ina|last=Jaffe|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2010|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2009, [[Barack Obama]] delivered a speech at [[Cairo University]] titled "[[A New Beginning]]".  The entire speech was recorded by [[C-SPAN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|publisher=C-SPAN|date=June 4, 2009|title="President Obama Speech to Muslim World in Cairo."|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_889oBKkNU&amp;t=6m29s|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his speech to the largely Muslim audience,&lt;ref&gt;Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World.

In an interview with NBC journalist Brian Williams on August 29, 2010, Williams asked Obama about a poll that said that 20% of the American public do not believe that he is a Christian or [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|American born]]. Obama gave a similar answer to the one he gave in the January 2008 debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/08/30/in-nbc-interview-obama-again-dismisses-belief-that-he-s-a-muslim.html |title=In NBC Interview, Obama Again Dismisses Belief That He's a Muslim With Joke |date=August 30, 2009 |first=David |last=Graham |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902031100/http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/08/30/in-nbc-interview-obama-again-dismisses-belief-that-he-s-a-muslim.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2011 [[National Prayer Breakfast]], the President stated, "My Christian faith then has been a sustaining force for me over these last few years, all the more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time".&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;

===Institutional===

In addition to Obama's personal responses, the [[2008 Obama presidential campaign]] responded to the [[Smear campaign|false claims]] made against him by people opposed to his candidacy by launching a website called "[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#"Fight the Smears" website|FightTheSmears.com]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5juMJpMhCS5TDzEF2Ds-frHSuHQLQ |title=Obama hits back at Internet slanders |publisher=Agence France-Press |date=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the false claims countered by the website is that he is a Muslim and not a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fightthesmears.com/articles/3/baracksfaith The Truth About Barack's Faith]", Obama for America.

In October 2010 the White House announced that it was cancelling a stop at the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] during Obama's trip to India. The decision to cancel was received with disappointment by the [[Sikh]] community, and it was speculated that the decision was in response to a photo that was circulated during the 2008 campaign of Obama wearing [[Culture of Kenya#National dress|Kenyan traditional wardrobe]] during a 2006 trip to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Question of Appearances: Obama Will Bypass Sikh Temple on Visit to India|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/world/asia/20india.html?_r=1&amp;hpw|date=October 19, 2010 |first=Lydia|last=Polgreen|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101020/pl_yblog_upshot/white-house-cancels-obama-trip-to-sikh-temple-over-muslim-rumor-concerns |title=White House cancels Obama trip to Sikh temple over Muslim rumor concerns |first=Brett Michael |last=Dykes |date=October 20, 2010 |publisher=Yahoo! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023072835/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101020/pl_yblog_upshot/white-house-cancels-obama-trip-to-sikh-temple-over-muslim-rumor-concerns |archivedate=October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 photo was used to raise doubts about Obama's religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama in a turban: Barack accuses Hillary of smear campaign after circulating photos of him dressed as 'a Muslim' |first=David |last=Gardner |date=February 26, 2008 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-518585/Obama-turban-Barack-accuses-Hillary-smear-campaign-circulating-photos-dressed-Muslim.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080923031441/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article%2D518585/Obama%2Dturban%2DBarack%2Daccuses%2DHillary%2Dsmear%2Dcampaign%2Dcirculating%2Dphotos%2Ddressed%2DMuslim.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claim that Obama is the Antichrist==
During the 2008 presidential campaign, one chain e-mail accused Barack Obama of secretly being the biblical [[Antichrist]], saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal....the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, he will destroy everything is it OBAMA?&lt;ref name="antichrist"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[PolitiFact.com]] has analyzed the elements in this false claim and debunked each one: The word ''Antichrist'' does not appear in the Book of Revelation (though it does appear in [[1 John]] and [[2 John]]); the Book of Revelation instead refers to [[The Beast (Revelation)|The Beast]]. The Book of Revelation never mentions the Beast's age, nor does it include any references to "Muslim descent", as the religion of Islam was not founded until hundreds of years after the book was written.&lt;ref name="antichrist"/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]] a '''''Bhagavata''''' (a ''[[vrddhi]]'' formation from  ''[[Bhagavanta]]'', meaning "devotee of  ''Bhagavanta''", the Lord, i.e. God), is a devotee, worshipper or follower of ''Bhagavanta'' namely God in his personal aspect. The form of worship is called ''[[bhakti]]'' which has the meaning of 'adoration'. In Sanskrit language 'Bhaga' stands for desire as well as vagina, 'antha' stands for the end. Hence ''Bhagavanta'' or ''Bhagavan'' means 'the one beyond desire or rebirth', whereas ''Bhagavata'' indicates a worshiper of this purified and persistent entity.&lt;ref name = "Hastings540"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|2003|p=540|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kaz58z--NtUC&amp;pg=PA540&amp;vq=Krishna&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=lo3NqA31k8hJZw7qNc9QDEAYyYA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to a tradition devoted to worship of [[Krishna]], later assimilated into the concept of [[Narayana]]&lt;ref name=Beck2005&gt;{{cite journal

}} Vishnu was by then assimilated with Narayana&lt;/ref&gt; where Krishna is conceived as ''[[svayam bhagavan]]''.

==Definition of Krishnaism==
{{Main|Krishnaism}}
[[File:Heliodorus pillar.jpg|thumb|The [[Heliodorus pillar]], dedicated by a Greek ambassador from the court of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Antialcidas]] circa 100 BCE, contains the first known inscription related to the Bhagavata cult in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Bopearachchi"&gt;[[Osmund Bopearachchi]], 2016, [https://www.academia.edu/25807197/Emergence_of_Vi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87u_and_%C5%9Aiva_Images_in_India_Numismatic_and_Sculptural_Evidence Emergence of Viṣṇu and Śiva Images in India: Numismatic and Sculptural Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the ninth century [[Common Era|CE]] ''Bhagavatism'' was already at least a millennium old and many disparate groups, all following the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' could be found. Various lineages of ''[[Gopal (Krishna)|Gopala]]'' worshipers developed into identifiable denominations. However, the unity that exists among these groups in belief and practice has given rise to the general term ''[[Krishnaism]]''. Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well.&lt;ref name="isbn0-691-11446-3"&gt;{{cite book|first=Graham M. | last = Schweig|title=Dance of Divine Love: The Rڄasa Lڄilڄa of Krishna from the Bhڄagavata Purڄa. na, India's classic sacred love story|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J|year=2005|isbn=0-691-11446-3|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=|nopp=true|page=Front Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many places associated with ''Krishna'' such as ''[[Vrindavan]]'' attract millions of pilgrims each year who participate in religious festivals that recreate scenes from ''Krishna's'' life on Earth.

The center of Krishna-worship has been for a long time Brajbhumi, the district of Mathura that embraces also Vrindavana, Govardhana, and Gokula, associated with Krishna from the time immemorial. Many millions of Krishna ''bhaktas'' visit these places ever year and participate in the numerous festivals that reenact scenes from Krshnas life on Earth | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial History of Bhagavata tradition==
It is believed that Bhagavatas borrowed or shared the attribute or title [[Purusa]] of their monotheistic deity from the philosophy of [[Sankhya]]. The philosophy was formulated by the end of the 4th century BC and as time went other names such as [[Narayana]] were applied to the main deity of Krishna-''Vāsudeva''.&lt;ref name = "Hastings540" /&gt;

==Second Early Stage==
Some relate absorption by [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] to be the characteristic of the second stage of the development of the Bhagavata tradition. It is believed that at this stage Krishna-''Vāsudeva'' was identified with the deity of Vishnu, that according to some belonged to the pantheon of Brahmanism.
&lt;ref name = "Hastings541"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|2003|p=541|loc=Bhakti Marga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulers onwards from [[Chandragupta II]], Vikramaditya were known as parama Bhagavatas, or Bhagavata [[Vaishnavas]]. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] entails the fully developed tenets and philosophy of the Bhagavata cult whereis Krishna gets fused with [[Vasudeva]] and transcends Vedic [[Vishnu]] and cosmic [[Hari]] to be turned into the ultimate object of [[bhakti]].&lt;ref name = Ganguli1988&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
References to ''Vāsudeva'' also occur in early Sanskrit literature. [[Aranyakas#Taittiriya Aranyaka|Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (X, i,6) identifies him with ''Narayana'' and ''Vishnu''. [[Pāṇini]], ca. 4th century BCE, in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] explains the word "Vāsudevaka" as a ''Bhakta'' (devotee) of Vāsudeva. At some stage during the Vedic period, Vasudeva and Krishna became one deity or three distinct deities Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala and Narayana, all become identified with Vishnu.&lt;ref name = "Flood"&gt;{{cite book

}}"Early Vaishnava worship focuses on three deities who become fused together, namely Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala and Narayana, who in turn all become identified with Vishnu. Put simply, Vasudeva-Krishna and Krishna-Gopala were worshiped by groups generally referred to as Bhagavatas, while Narayana was worshipped by the Pancaratra sect."&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time of composition of the redaction of [[Mahabharata]] that survives till today.

A [[Gupta period]] research makes a "clear mention of Vasudeva as the exclusive object of worship of a group of people", who are referred as [[bhagavatas]].&lt;ref name=1Banerjea1966&gt;Banerjea, 1966, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhagavata Sampradaaya is a very old vedic tradition that respects all the darshana shastras &amp; siddantas. It is neutral to any particular practices like only Vaishnava, Smarta, Shakta, Gaanapatya, Saura etc., And instructs to practice the rituals that is in accordance with Vedas. Some of the practices of this Sampradaaya are continuous study of Vedas, all time chanting of Gayatri, Nitya Agni Upaasana, Atiti Satkaara, Vaishwadeva, Pancha Yagnas, Daana-Dharma, Simpleness, humbleness, socially accepted life style, Sachitdananda Dhyana, leaving egotism, Sarva samarpana Bhaava of one's own Sampat-Bhakti-Punya Karma-Knowledge. This is actual Bhagavata.

'''Brian Coffey''' (8 June 1905 – 14 April 1995) was an Irish poet and publisher. His work was informed by his [[Catholicism]], his background in science and philosophy, and his connection to surrealism. He was close to an intellectual European Catholic tradition and mainstream Irish [[Catholic Culture|Catholic culture]]. Two of his long poems, ''Advent'' (1975) and ''Death of Hektor'' (1979), were widely considered to be important works in the canon of Irish poetic [[modernist poetry|modernism]]. He also ran Advent, a [[small press]], during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life and work==
Coffey was born in [[Dublin]] in the suburb of [[Dún Laoghaire]]. He attended the Mount St Benedict boarding school in [[Gorey]], [[County Wexford]] from 1917 to 1919 and then [[James Joyce]]'s old school, [[Clongowes Wood College]], in [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]], from 1919 until 1922. In 1923, he went to France to study for a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Classical Studies at the Institution St Vincent, [[Senlis, Oise]].

His father, Denis Coffey, was a professor of [[anatomy]] who served as the first president of [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) from 1908 to 1940. Coffey entered UCD in 1924 and earned advanced degrees in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. He also represented the college in boxing tournaments.

While still at college, Coffey began writing poetry. He published his first poems in UCD's ''The National Student'' under the pseudonym Coeuvre. These poems, which have never been collected, showed the influence of French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolism]] and of [[T. S. Eliot|TS Eliot]]. During this time Coffey met [[Denis Devlin]] and together they published a volume entitled ''Poems'' in 1930. Coffey and Devlin both also participated in college dramatics, taking roles in French plays.

==Paris==
In the early 1930s, Coffey moved to Paris, where he studied [[Physical Chemistry]] under [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1926. He completed these studies in 1933, and his ''Three Poems'' was printed in Paris by [[Jeanette Monnier]] that same year, as was the poem card ''Yuki Hira'', which was admired by [[George William Russell]] and [[William Butler Yeats]]. He also became friendly with other Irish writers based in the city, including [[Thomas MacGreevy]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. In his 1934 essay ''Recent Irish Poetry'', Beckett picked out Coffey and Devlin as forming 'the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland'.

He entered the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] that year to work with the noted French philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], taking his licentiate examination in 1936. He then moved to London for a time and contributed reviews and a poem to Eliot's ''[[The Criterion (magazine)|Criterion]]'' magazine. On trips home to Dublin, he contributed to programmes on literary topics on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] radio and published poems in ''[[Ireland Today]]''.

He returned to Paris in 1937 as an exchange student to work on his doctoral thesis on the idea of order in the work of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In 1938, Coffey's second volume of poetry, ''Third Person'', was published by [[George Reavey]]'s [[Europa Press]]. He also contributed translations to the same publisher's ''Thorns of Thunder'' (1936), the first collection of [[Paul Éluard]]'s work published in English. The poems of this period saw Coffey shake off his earlier influences and begin to find his own voice but, for a variety of reasons, ''Third Person'' was to be his last poetry publication for a quarter of a century.

==St Louis==
During the war, Coffey taught in schools in [[London]] and [[Yorkshire]], leaving his young family in Dublin. After the war, he returned to Paris and completed his doctoral thesis. The family then moved so Coffey could take up a teaching post at the [[Jesuit]] [[Saint Louis University]]. During this period, Coffey seems to have done very little, if any, creative writing as he focused mainly on philosophical work based on his thesis, publishing a number of essays in ''[[The Modern Schoolman]]''.

By the early 1950s, Coffey had become uncomfortable for a number of reasons, including the nature of his work, his distance from Ireland and the pressures that inevitably came to bear on an academic who had previously associated with well-known left-wing writers in Paris. For these reasons, he began to look for a suitable opportunity to leave the United States and resigned, possibly on a matter of academic principle, in 1952.

==Later life and work==
In 1952, Coffey returned to live in London and, from 1973, [[Southampton]]. He began again to publish his poetry and translations, mainly of [[French poetry]]. The first work in English to appear after this period of silence was ''[[Missouri Sequence]]'', apparently begun in St. Louis but first appearing in the ''University Review'' in 1962. This poem deals with the experience of exile, memories of the poet's dead parents and the premature birth of a child. It is written in a much more conventional syntax than most of Coffey's work and, thanks to this greater accessibility, is one of his most widely read works.
[[Image:coffey collected.jpg|thumb|120px|''Poems and Versions 1929–1990'', Coffey's last major publication.]]
Over the next decade or so, he published regularly in the ''[[Irish University Review|University Review]]'' (later known as the ''Irish University Review''), a relationship that culminated in the 1975 special issue. This featured an introduction by Dr [[JCC Mays]], a selection of translations from French, the satire ''Leo'' and ''[[Advent (poem)|Advent]]'', a meditation on death inspired by the death of the poet's son in a motorcycle accident. The poem is in seven sections, based, according to Coffey, in an interview with [[Parkman Howe]] on the [[canonical hours]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]].

Another key work of this period was ''[[Death of Hektor]]'', which uses the myth of [[Troy]] as a framework for a meditation on war and its victims. The trade editions of ''Advent'' and ''Death of Hektor'' were both published by the [[Menard Press]]. He also edited Devlin's ''Collected Poems'', first for a ''University Review'' Devlin special issue and later as a book from [[Dolmen Press]].

He also set up his own publishing enterprise, [[Advent Press]], which published work by himself and by younger writers he wanted to support. He learned printmaking and produced a good deal of original work, including an interesting set of images based on the plays of his old friend Beckett. His interest in visual art also led to some experiments in [[concrete poetry]], most notably his 1966 Advent Press book ''Monster: A Concrete Poem''. His work was championed by a number of younger Irish poets, especially [[Michael Smith (poet)|Michael Smith]] and [[Trevor Joyce]]. These two published poetry, prose and translations by Coffey in their journal ''[[The Lace Curtain]]'', and his ''Selected Poems'' (1971), under their [[New Writers Press]] imprint. This book was instrumental in helping establish his reputation as a leading Irish exponent of [[modernist poetry]].

The appearance in 1991 of a major selection ''Poems and Versions 1929–1990'' and his translations ''Poems from Mallarmé'' helped confirm his status as one of the leading Irish modernists. He died at the age of 89 and was buried in Southampton, England.

[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|175px|A couple following their marriage in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
'''Celestial marriage''' (also called the '''New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage''', '''Eternal Marriage''', '''Temple Marriage''' or '''The Principle''') is a doctrine of [[Mormonism]], particularly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and branches of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].
 
==In the LDS Church==
Within the LDS Church, celestial marriage is an [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] associated with a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] that takes place inside [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] by those authorized to hold the [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing power]].  The only people allowed to enter the temple, be married there, or attend these [[weddings]] are those who hold an official [[Temple (LDS Church)#Entrance requirements|temple recommend]]. Obtaining a temple recommend requires one to abide by LDS Church doctrine and be interviewed and considered worthy by their [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] and [[stake president]]. A prerequisite to contracting a celestial marriage, in addition to obtaining a temple recommend, involves undergoing the temple [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]], which involves making of certain covenants with God.&lt;ref&gt;Jay M. Todd, [//www.lds.org/new-era/1971/06/information-for-brides-and-grooms-planning-a-temple-marriage "Information For Brides and Grooms Planning a Temple Marriage"], ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In particular, one is expected to promise to be obedient to all the Lord's commandments including living a clean chaste life, abstaining oneself from any impure thing, willing to sacrifice and consecrate all that one has for the Lord. In the marriage ceremony a man and a woman make covenants to God and to each other and are said to be sealed as husband and wife for time and all eternity. Mormonism, citing {{lds|Matthew|matt|16|19}} and {{lds|Matthew|matt|18|18}}, distinguishes itself on this point from some other religious traditions by emphasizing that marriage relationships and covenants made in this life in the temple will continue to be valid in the next life if they abide by these covenants.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the 19th century, the term "celestial marriage" usually referred to the practice of [[plural marriage]],&lt;ref name="dc132"&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenents|dc|132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= On Celestial Marriage |url= http://www.i4m.com/think/temples/celestial_marriage.htm |work= i4m.com |publisher= Rethinking Mormonism |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100925074920/http://i4m.com/think/temples/celestial_marriage.htm |archivedate= 2010-09-25 |df=  }}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2011}}&lt;!-- this is a self published site; does not list name(s) of who is publishing it --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Mormon Temple as a Lasting Relic of Polygamy |url= http://www.i4m.com/think/temples/temple_legacy.htm |work= i4m.com |publisher= Rethinking Mormonism |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100924145805/http://i4m.com/think/temples/temple_legacy.htm |archivedate= 2010-09-24 |df=  }}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2011}}&lt;!-- this is a self published site; does not list name(s) of who is publishing it --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Hales |first= Brian C. |authorlink= Brian C. Hales |title= Is Plural Marriage Required for Exaltation? |url= http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/NEWFILES/IsPMRequiredToday.htm |work= mormonfundamentalism.com |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100724211938/http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/NEWFILES/IsPMRequiredToday.htm |archivedate= 2010-07-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice which the LDS Church formally abandoned in 1890. The term is still used in this sense by [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]] not affiliated with the LDS Church.

In the LDS Church today, both men and women may enter a celestial marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his [[wife]] dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the [[celestial kingdom]] as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died.&lt;ref name = CHOI&gt;{{citation |title= [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Church Handbook of Instructions]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1998 |page= 72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.

==New Testament view==
{{Primary sources|section|date=August 2016}}
In {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:28-30|NIV}}, Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he affirms that at the resurrection "people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven." Mormons do not interpret Jesus' statement as meaning "that marriages will not ''exist'' after the Resurrection, but that marriages will not be ''performed'' after the Resurrection; for all questions of marital status must be settled before that time."&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church, [//www.lds.org/manual/new-testament-student-manual/introduction-to-matthew/chapter-7 "Chapter 7: Matthew 19–23"], ''New Testament Student Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can be the subject of an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for those who have already died. 

==Sealing==
{{Main article|Sealing (Latter Day Saints)}}
Celestial marriage is an instance of the LDS Church doctrine of [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]]. Following a celestial marriage, not only are the couple sealed as husband and wife, but children born into the marriage are also sealed to that family. In cases where the husband and wife have been previously married civilly and there are already children from their union, the children accompany their parents to the temple and are sealed to their parents following the marriage ceremony.

Mormons believe that through this sealing, man, wife and children will live together forever, if obedient to God's commandments.

==Relationship to plural marriage==
{{Weasel|section|date=November 2015}}
There is substantial doctrinal dispute between the LDS Church and its offshoots as to whether celestial marriage is plural or [[monogamous]]   sealings for "time and eternity" (i.e., celestial marriages) were being performed for monogamous couples long before 1890.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Throughout all time periods of the LDS Church's history, the great majority of temple sealings were between one man and one wife.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Some{{Who|date=November 2015}} argue that the official Mormon scripture, [[Doctrine and Covenants]] section 132,&lt;ref name="dc132"/&gt; which describes celestial marriage, specifies that only plural marriages qualify. Others{{Who|date=November 2015}} argue that the text indicates "a wife", which would mean that any temple sealing ordinance of marriage could qualify. The latter view is supported by the official ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', which indicates that marriage for eternity was monogamous except in "some circumstances":&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|1909|pages= 134–136 }} (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is borne in mind that at this time the new law of marriage for the Church—marriage for eternity, ''including plurality of wives under some circumstances''—was being introduced by the Prophet [Joseph Smith], it is very likely that the following article was written with a view of applying the principles here expounded to the conditions created by introducing said marriage system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the following quote, apostle [[Lorenzo Snow]], who later became president of the LDS Church, refers to "celestial plural marriage" rather than simply "celestial marriage":

&lt;blockquote&gt;He knew the voice of God—he knew the commandment of the Almighty to him was to go forward—to set the example, and establish Celestial plural marriage. He knew that he had not only his own prejudices and pre-possessions to combat and to overcome, but those of the whole Christian world...; but God ... had given the commandment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow |pages= 69–70 |publisher= Deseret News |location= Salt Lake City |year= 1884 |first= Eliza R. |last= Snow |authorlink= Eliza R. Snow |oclc= 4623484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it is correct that "celestial marriage" was often used to refer to plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cannon|1869}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pratt|1869}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1869}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mormon fundamentalists cleave to the view that there is no celestial marriage that is not plural, while the LDS Church claims otherwise. As viewed by the LDS Church, plural marriages in the early church, when properly authorized and conducted, were, in fact, celestial marriages; but celestial marriages need not be plural marriages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In addition, since celestial marriages must be performed by someone with proper priesthood authority, and since plural marriage is no longer authorized by the LDS Church, no authorized celestial plural marriages can be performed today. Mormon fundamentalists argue, in return, that they have retained the priesthood authority to perform these marriages.

==Swedenborg==
{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2012}}
A concept of '''celestial marriage''' was described by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] as early as 1749. Swedenborg's Latin term ''conjugium coeleste'' was translated as "celestial marriage" by [[John Clowes (cleric)|John Clowes]] in 1782.  Two more recent translators have preferred the term "heavenly marriage."&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'', John Elliot, trans., (London: Swedenborg Society, 1983), §162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secrets of Heaven,'' (Arcana Coelestia), Lisa Hyatt Cooper, trans., (West Chester, Pennsylvania: Swedenborg Foundation, 2008), §162.&lt;/ref&gt; In all his authoritative writing,&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html ''Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?''] (accessed 08/13/2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg only mentions the term ''celestial marriage'' twice.&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia’’ 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Divine Love and Wisdom'' #414&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg defined the celestial marriage or heavenly marriage as the marriage of love with wisdom or of goodness with truth. He wrote, "Truth and good joined together is what is called the celestial marriage, which constitutes heaven itself with a person."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Arcana Coelestia'' §10300.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg does not use "celestial marriage" to refer to the marriage of husband and wife, although he says that the marriage of husband and wife has its origin in the heavenly or celestial marriage of goodness and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Conjugial Love''  §83,  ''Arcana Coelestia'' §2739&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Swedenborg, true married love forms an eternal bond, an actual joining together of minds, so that married partners who truly love each other are not separated by death but continue to be married to eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Heaven and Hell'' §§366-386, ''Conjugial Love'' §§27, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that this love is "celestial, spiritual, holy pure and clean above every love which exists from the Lord with angels of heaven and people in the church."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Conjugial Love'' §180.&lt;/ref&gt; None can come into this love, he says, but those who are monogamous and "who go to the Lord and love the truths of the church and do the good things it teaches."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, ''Conjugial Love'' §70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Miller has investigated the possibility that Swedenborg influenced [[Joseph Smith]], as there are similarities between some of their teachings. He concludes that Smith may have learned something about Swedenborg through third parties, but was unlikely to have read much if any of Swedenborg's works for himself. Among Smith's connections was Sarah Cleveland, who was married to a Swedenborgian at the time of her plural marriage to Smith in 1842.&lt;ref name="craigwmiller.tripod.com"&gt;[http://craigwmiller.tripod.com/interest.htm Craig Miller, "Did Emanuel Swedenborg Influence LDS Doctrine?"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=January 2012}} It was shortly afterwards, in July 1843, that Smith recorded receiving a revelation regarding eternal marriage in [[Doctrine and Covenants]] 132.&lt;ref name="dc132"/&gt;

'''Christian worldview''' (also called '''Biblical worldview''') refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs through which a Christian individual, group or culture interprets the world and interacts with it. Various [[Christian denominations|denominations of Christianity]] have differing [[worldview]]s on some issues based on biblical interpretation, but many thematic elements are commonly agreed-upon within the Christian worldview.  A common theme is the distrust of secular authority.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, Molly.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/opinion/sunday/the-evangelical-roots-of-our-post-truth-society.html "The Evangelical Roots of Our Post-Truth Society."] ''New York Times''.  13 April 2017.  13 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to [[Leo Apostel]], a [[World view|worldview]] is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994). [http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration"]. [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel|VUB Press]]. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel. See also Vidal C. (2008) Wat is een wereldbeeld? ([http://cogprints.org/6094/2/Vidal_2008-what-is-a-worldview.pdf What is a worldview?]), in Van Belle, H. &amp; Van der Veken, J., Editors, Nieuwheid denken. De wetenschappen en het creatieve aspect van de werkelijkheid, p71–85. Acco, Leuven. http://cogprints.org/6094/&lt;/ref&gt;
# An [[cosmology|explanation of the world]]	
# An [[eschatology]], answering the question "where are we heading?"	
# Values, answers to [[Christian ethics|ethical questions]]: "What should we do?"  In this context, "[[What would Jesus do?]]"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]].: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]. "What is [[truth|true]] and false?" (See, for example [[John 18:38]])
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks," its origins and construction.

==Differing Christian worldviews==
Different denominations of Christianity have varying worldviews. There are varieties of particulars within the Christian worldview, and disputes of the meaning of concepts in a Christian worldview. Certain thematic elements are common within the Christian worldview. For instance, [[Northrop Frye]] indicated as the central clusters of the system of metaphors in the Bible - mountain, garden, and cave. A similar thematic representation of Christian worldview in the Reformed tradition has been formulated as [[Creation myth|Creation]], [[Fall of Man|Fall]], [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]] and [[Consummation]].

==Worldview vs. doctrine==
The U.S. use of the term "worldview" in Christian rhetoric can be traced to the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] philosopher [[H. Evan Runner]] of [[Calvin College]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan.{{dubious|date=October 2011}} Runner used the term in his evangelical Reformed community in North America, promoting the worldview concept from a philosophical concept to a synonym for "doctrine."

'''Christopher Henry Dawson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (12 October 1889, [[Hay Castle]] – 25 May 1970, [[Budleigh Salterton]]) was a British [[independent scholar]], who wrote many books on [[cultural history]] and [[Christendom]]. Dawson has been called "the greatest English-speaking Catholic historian of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ChristianityAndCultureSelectionsFromTheWritingsOfChristopherDawson_989/dawsonChristianityAndCulture-SelectionsFromChristopherDawson_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Christianity and Culture: Selections from the Writings of Christopher Dawson (updated 10/08, PDF)"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988–1989 academic year at the [[College of Europe]] was named in his honour.

==Life==
Dawson was born into family deep roots in the English [[gentry]] as the only son of Lt. Colonel H.P. Dawson and Mary Louisa, eldest daughter of [[William Latham Bevan|Archdeacon Bevan]], [[Hay Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-72/modern-pioneers-christopher-dawson.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up at [[Hartlington]] Hall, [[Yorkshire]]. He was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. He obtained 2nd class honours in Modern History at Oxford in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1913'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; After his degree he studied economics. He also read the work of the German theologian [[Ernst Troeltsch]]. His background was [[Anglo-Catholic]] but he became a [[Roman Catholic]] convert in 1914.  In 1916 Dawson married Valery Mills, youngest daughter of the architect [[Walter Edward Mills]]. They had two daughters and one son.

==Writing==
{{quote|As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the evil that they set out to destroy.|C.H. Dawson}}
He began publishing articles in ''The Sociological Review'', in 1920. His starting point was close to that of [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], others who were also interested in [[grand narrative]]s conducted at the level of a [[civilisation]]. His first book, ''The Age of the Gods'' (1928), was apparently intended as the first of a set of five to trace European civilisation to the twentieth century, but the schematic plan was not followed to a conclusion.

His general point of view is as a proponent of an 'Old West' theory, the later term of [[David Gress]], who cites Dawson in his ''From Plato to Nato'' (1998). That is, Dawson rejected the blanket assumption that the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe failed to contribute any essential characteristics. He argued that the medieval [[Catholic Church]] was an essential factor in the rise of European civilisation, and wrote extensively in support of that thesis.

==Career==
Dawson was considered a leading Catholic historian. He was a Lecturer in the History of Culture, [[University of Exeter|University College, Exeter]] (1930–6), Forwood Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion, [[University of Liverpool]] (1934), Gifford Lecturer at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1947 and 1948), and Professor of Roman Catholic Studies, [[Harvard University]] (1958–62). He was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''Who Was Who, 1961–70, London : A. &amp; C. Black'', 1972, p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940 for a period he was editor of the ''[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]''. He was Chauncey Stillman Chair of Roman Catholic Studies at Harvard University from 1958–1962.

==Influence==
His writings in the 1920s and 1930s made him a significant figure of the time, and an influence in particular on [[T. S. Eliot]], who wrote of his importance. He was on the fringe of '[[The Moot]]', a discussion group involving Eliot, [[John Baillie (theologian)|John Baillie]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Walter Hamilton Moberly|Walter Moberly]], [[Michael Polanyi]], [[Marjorie Reeves]], [[Bernard Lonergan]] and [[Alexander Roper Vidler|Alec Vidler]];&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Marjorie (editor). ''Christian Thinking and Social Order: Conviction Politics from the 1930s to the Present Day,'' p. 25, Cassell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the [[Sword of the Spirit]] [[ecumenical]] group. According to Bradley Birzer, Dawson also influenced the theological underpinnings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings.&lt;ref&gt;Birzer, Bradley J.''Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth'', p. 136, ISI Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Kirk]] was another who greatly admired Dawson, although the two men never met. The topical approach outlined by Dawson for the study of Christian culture forms the core of the [http://www.aquinas.edu/catholicstudies/ Catholic Studies] program at [[Aquinas College (Michigan)|Aquinas College]]. His work was influential in the founding of Campion College in NSW, Australia, and in the formation in 2012 of [http://www.dawsonsociety.com.au The Christopher Dawson Society for Philosophy and Culture Inc.] in Perth, Western Australia.

==Comparable historians==
As a revivalist of the Christian historian, Christopher Dawson has been compared with [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] and [[Herbert Butterfield]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W. A. Speck|Speck, W. A.]] "Herbert Butterfield: The Legacy of a Christian Historian." In ''A Christian View of History?'', [[George Marsden]], [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]], 1975, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparisons have also been made between the work of Dawson and German sociologist and historian [[Max Weber]]. Both employ a metahistorical approach to their subjects, and their subjects themselves bear similarities; namely, the influence of religion on aspects of western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''The Protestant Ethic and the "Spirit" of Capitalism, and Other Writings.'' [[Penguin Books]], 2002, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Church of the New Faith''' was a name used by the [[Church of Scientology]] in Australia from 1969 until 1983 to avoid laws that restricted or banned the practice of [[Scientology]].

== History ==
In 1965 the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed a law, the ''Psychological Practices Act, 1965'', banning the use of the [[E-meter]] and teaching Scientology for money. Considering Scientology to be a form of [[psychology]], it required anyone practising psychology to be registered with a newly established Victorian Psychological Council. However, since the Act's definition of psychology was broad enough to include the pastoral counselling traditionally done by priests and ministers of religion, any religious denomination recognised by the Australian government under the federal Marriage Act was exempted from its provisions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The Scientology organisation in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]], closed in response to this law.

Similar laws were later passed in [[Western Australia]] in 1968 (the ''Scientology Act'') and [[South Australia]] (the ''Psychological Practices Act'') in 1973. The Church changed its name to "Church of the New Faith" and remained active in these two States.

In November 1968, two Australian Scientologists who had been working at [[Saint Hill Manor|Saint Hill]], [[Ian Tampion|Ian]] and Judith Tampion, set up a mission of the Church of the New Faith in an inner suburb of Melbourne. They held meetings and sold books, but Scientologists in Melbourne would travel to [[Adelaide]], South Australia for training.

The Church of the New Faith was incorporated in Adelaide on 18 June 1969&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard (1976) ''Modern Management Technology Defined'' p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Western Australia repealed its ''Scientology Act''. In January 1973, the newly elected federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government recognised Scientology as a religious denomination under the Marriage Act, allowing Scientology ministers to conduct marriages and making them effectively exempt from the provisions of Victoria's ''Psychological Practices Act''. The mission in Melbourne now became a fully functional Church offering training and counselling to the public. However, Victoria's law remained active, though the Victorian Scientology organisation was incorporated in South Australia.

In 1980, the Victorian branch of the Church of the New Faith applied for exemption from [[payroll tax]]. (The Church had exemption already in all other states where it operated). The Commissioner of Pay-Roll&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Tax rejected the application. The Church appealed against the decision, and lost on 18 December 1980. The Church lodged a Victorian Supreme Court appeal against this on 24 February 1981, which the full Supreme Court rejected on 5 May 1982.

Around this time, the Victorian Psychological Practices Act was becoming controversial, and was seen by many to be counter-productive. On 25 February 1981, officials of major religions urged repeal of the Act. Later, leading Churchmen including heads of Theological Colleges had signed a petition: "to remove all prohibitive sections aimed at members of the Church of Scientology purely on religious grounds. It further asks 'that in future no legislation be passed which discriminates against any minority because of its beliefs'".&lt;ref&gt;The Age newspaper (Melbourne), Sat 18 April 1981, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Victorian Minister for Health, Tom Roper, explained to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that the Act was not being enforced in much of Australia.  The Church of Scientology was flourishing in spite of the legislation banning its practice.  Roper urged the lawmakers that in the future they shouldn't single out a minority group for legislation "in the way the Psychological Practices Act discriminates against Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, Victoria, House of Assembly Pages 719–720, 3 June 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National]] Parties did not oppose the Labor Government's action to repeal the Psychological Practices Act. &lt;ref&gt;The Age (Melbourne), Fri 25 Jun 1982, p10&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act was amended by the ''Psychologists Registration (Scientology) Act, 1982'' to remove all references to Scientology on 24 June 1982 and was repealed in 1987.

This did not, however, give the Church tax exempt status in Victoria. The Church appealed against the payroll decision to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] on 9 November 1982 and the case was accepted. They won the case (''Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax (Victoria)'') in late 1983 and immediately started operating as the Church of Scientology once more, with confirmed status as a tax-exempt religion.&lt;ref name="Scientology HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Victoria) |parallelcite=(1983) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |date=27 October 1983 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently in 2013, the UK Supreme Court affirmed the religious status of Scientology in that country, and credited the Australian High Court case judgment of Wilson and Deane as the "most helpful" of various international cases in defining the characteristics of religion. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0030-judgment.pdf paragraphs 40-49 and esp page 18 paragraph 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

Victoria's ''Psychological Practices Act'' was finally repealed by the ''Psychologists Registration Act, 1987''.&lt;ref&gt;[web.archive.org/web/20070615021704/{{cite web|url=http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/95c43dd4eac71a68ca256dde00056e7b/1F235F8E2A661A4BCA256E5B00037E28/$FILE/87-60a011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615021704/http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/95c43dd4eac71a68ca256dde00056e7b/1F235F8E2A661A4BCA256E5B00037E28/%24FILE/87-60a011.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2007 |df=dmy }} Psychologists Registration Act, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian ''Psychological Practices Act'' has remained in force and regulates the activities of [[hypnotist]]s and psychologists in that State.

This did not entail a ban of the group itself, but forbade the use of the e-meter and instruction in return for money. The same happened in 1968 in the States of Western Australia and in 1969 in South Australia. Disrupted by Victoria's legislation, the group legally changed its name to "Church of the New Faith." It remained active, but appeared to either do without the banned activities, or at least to conduct them less openly."''

'''Confucianism''', also known as '''Ruism''', is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.{{sfnb|Yao|2000|pp=38-47}} Confucianism developed from what was later called the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] from the teachings of the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of [[Chinese theology|the theology and values]] inherited from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (c. 1600 BCE–1046 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasties]] (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE).{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}} In the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the "proto-Taoist" [[Huang–Lao]] as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]].

A Confucian revival began during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the [[imperial exams]] and the core philosophy of the [[scholar-officials|scholar official class]] in the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the [[New Culture Movement]] of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the "[[Three Principles of the People]]" with the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and then [[Maoism]] under the [[People's Republic of China]]. In the late twentieth century Confucian [[work ethic]] has been credited with the rise of the [[East Asia]]n economy.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|title=Demystifying the Chinese Economy|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=rxzJoskK_rwC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521191807|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the ''Tiān''.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10|quote=[...] Confucianism is basically ''non-theistic''. While Heaven (''tiān'') has some characteristics that overlap the category of deity, it is primarily an ''impersonal'' absolute, like ''dao'' and ''Brahman''. "Deity" (''theos'', ''deus''), on the other hand connotes something ''personal'' (he or she, not it).}}{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12|quote=Confucianism deconstructs the sacred-profane dichotomy; it asserts that sacredness is to be found ''in'', not behind or beyond, the ordinary activities of human life — and especially in human relationships. Human relationships are sacred in Confucianism because they are the expression of our moral nature (性 ''xìng''), which has a transcendent anchorage in Heaven (''tiān'' 天). Herbert Fingarette captured this essential feature of Confucianism in the title of his 1972 book, ''Confucius: The Secular as Sacred''. To assume a dualistic relationship between sacred and profane and to use this as a criterion of religion is to beg the question of whether Confucianism can count as a religious tradition.}} Confucian liturgy (called 儒 ''rú'', or sometimes 正統/正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', meaning "[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]") led by Confucian priests or "sages of rites" (禮生/礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods in public and ancestral [[Chinese temple]]s is preferred on certain occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|pp=3–5}}

The worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world. Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', and ''zhì''. ''Rén'' (仁, "benevolence" or "humaneness") is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} ''Yì'' (義/义) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. ''Lǐ'' (禮/礼) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. ''Zhì'' (智) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of ''rén'' and ''yì''.

Traditionally, cultures and countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland [[culture of China|China]], [[culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[culture of Macau|Macau]], [[culture of Korea|Korea]], [[culture of Japan|Japan]], and [[culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], as well as various territories settled predominantly by [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], such as [[culture of Singapore|Singapore]].

It is composed of 人 ''rén'' ("man") and 需 ''xū'' ("to await"), itself composed of 雨 ''yǔ'' ("rain", "instruction") and 而 ''ér'' ("sky"), graphically a "man under the rain". Its full meaning is "man receiving instruction from Heaven". According to [[Kang Youwei]], [[Hu Shih]], and [[Xinzhong Yao|Yao Xinzhong]], they were the official shaman-priests (''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'') experts in rites and astronomy of the Shang, and later Zhou, dynasty.{{sfnb|Yao|2000|p=19}}
}}
Strictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to "Confucianism". In the Chinese language, the character ''rú'' 儒 meaning "scholar" or "learned" or "refined man" is generally used both in the past and the present to refer to things related to Confucianism. The character ''rú'' in ancient China had diverse meanings. Some examples include "to tame", "to mould", "to educate", "to refine".&lt;ref name=Eno&gt;{{cite book|last=Eno|first=Robert|title=The Confucian Creation of Heaven: Philosophy and the Defense of Ritual Mastery|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1990|edition=1st|isbn=079140191X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190–197}} Several different terms, some of which with modern origin, are used in different situations to express different facets of Confucianism, including:

* {{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}} – "''ru'' school of thought";
* {{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Rújiào}} – "''ru'' religion" in the sense of "''ru'' doctrine";
* {{cjkv|t=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:學|學]]|s=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:学|学]]|p=Rúxué}} – "Ruology" or "''ru'' learning";
* {{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Kǒngjiào}} – "Confucius' doctrine";
* {{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:家|家]][[wikt:店|店]]|p=Kǒngjiādiàn}} – "Kong family's business", a pejorative phrase used in the [[New Culture Movement]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].

Three of them use ''rú''. These names do not use the name "Confucius" at all, but instead focus on the ideal of the Confucian man. The use of the term "Confucianism" has been avoided by some modern scholars, who favor "Ruism" and "Ruists" instead. Robert Eno argues that the term has been "burdened... with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations". Ruism, as he states, is more faithful to the original Chinese name for the school.&lt;ref name=Eno/&gt;{{rp|7}}

According to [[Zhou Youguang]], 儒 ''rú'' originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by [[Mencius]] (~372–289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}

===Five Classics (五经, ''Wǔjīng'') and the Confucian vision===
[[File:Confucius, fresco from a Western Han tomb of Dongping County, Shandong province, China.jpg|thumb|[[Confucius]] in a fresco from a [[Western Han]] tomb in [[Dongping County|Dongping]], [[Shandong]]]]
Traditionally, Confucius was thought to be the author or editor of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Classics]] which were the basic texts of Confucianism. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao|Yao Xinzhong]] allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that "nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics". Professor Yao says that perhaps most scholars today hold the "pragmatic" view that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics, "contributed to their formation". In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these texts. {{sfnb|Yao|2000|p=52-54}}

The scholar [[Tu Weiming]] explains these classics as embodying "five visions" which underlie the development of Confucianism:
* [[I Ching]] or [[Classic of Change]] or ''Book of Changes,'' generally held to be the earliest of the classics, shows a metaphysical vision which combines divinatory art with numerological technique and ethical insight; philosophy of change sees cosmos as interaction between the two energies yin and yang; universe always shows organismic unity and dynamism.
* [[Classic of Poetry]]  or ''Book of Songs'' is the earliest anthology of [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] and songs. It shows the poetic vision in the belief that poetry and music convey common human feelings and mutual responsiveness.
* [[Book of Documents]] or ''Book of History'' Compilation of speeches of major figures and records of events in ancient times embodies the political vision and addresses the kingly way in terms of the ethical foundation for humane government. The documents show the sagacity, filial piety, and work ethic of Yao, Shun, and Yu. They established a political culture which was based on responsibility and trust. Their virtue formed a covenant of social harmony  which did not depend on punishment or coercion.
* [[Book of Rites]] describes the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou Dynasty. This social vision defined society not as an adversarial system based on contractual relations but as a community of trust based on social responsibility. The [[Four occupations|four functional occupations]] are cooperative (farmer, scholar, artisan, merchant).
* [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] chronicles the period to which it gives its name, [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BCE) and these events emphasise the significance of collective memory for communal self-identification, for reanimating the old is the best way to attain the new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tu|first=Weiming|chapter=Confucian Tradition in Chinese History|editor-last1=Ropp|editor-first1=Paul S.|editor-last2=Barrett|editor-first2=Timothy Hugh|title=The Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=0520064410}} p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Confucian theology}}
Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and the God of Heaven (''Tiān'' 天), or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}}{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Lǐ]]'' 理 or ''[[Tao|Dào]]'' 道), is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of such order.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Joël Thoraval studied Confucianism as a diffused [[civil religion]] in contemporary China, finding that it expresses itself in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Di]]'' 地), the sovereign or the government (''jūn'' 君), ancestors (''qīn'' 親) and masters (''shī'' 師).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Thoraval|first=Joël|title=Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Ancestors, Masters: Some Remarks on the Politico-Religious in China Today|series=Occasional Papers|number=5|year=2016|publisher=Centre for Studies on China, Korea and Japan|location=Paris, France|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116171349/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaven is not some being pre-existing the temporal world. According to the scholar [[Stephan Feuchtwang]], in Chinese cosmology, which is not merely Confucian but shared by all [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]]s, "the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy" (''[[hundun]]'' 混沌 and ''[[qi]]'' 氣), organising through the polarity of [[yin and yang]] which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''. Yin and yang are the invisible and visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order). Confucianism is concerned with finding "middle ways" between yin and yang at every new configuration of the world.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|pp=146–150}}

Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of "sageliness within and kingliness without".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} ''Rén'', translated as "humaneness" or the essence proper of a human being, is the character of compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may achieve oneness with Heaven comprehending his own origin in Heaven and therefore divine essence. In the ''Dàtóng shū'' (《大同書/大同书》) it is defined as "to form one body with all things" and "when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}

{{Main|Tian}}
''Tiān'' (天), a key concept in Chinese thought, refers to the God of Heaven, the [[celestial pole|northern culmen of the skies]] and its spinning stars,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}} earthly nature and its laws which come from Heaven, to "Heaven and Earth" (that is, "all things"), and to the awe-inspiring forces beyond human control.&lt;ref name=Hagen&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagen|first=Kurtis|url=http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_tian.html|title=Confucian Key Terms - Tian 天|publisher=State University of New York at Plattsburgh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203164801/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_tian.html|archive-date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are such a number of uses in Chinese thought that it is not possible to give one translation into English.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=35}}

Confucius used the term in a mystical way.{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}} He wrote in the ''Analects'' (7.23) that Tian gave him life, and that Tian watched and judged (6.28; 9.12). In 9.5 Confucius says that a person may know the movements of the Tian, and this provides with the sense of having a special place in the universe. In 17.19 Confucius says that Tian spoke to him, though not in words. The scholar Ronnie Littlejohn warns that Tian has not to be interpreted as personal God comparable to that of the Abrahamic faiths, in the sense of an otherworldly or transcendent creator.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|pp=35–36}} Rather it is similar to what [[Taoists]] meant by ''Dao'': "the way things are" or "the regularities of the world",&lt;ref name=Hagen/&gt; which Stephan Feuchtwang equates with the ancient Greek concept of ''[[physis]]'', "nature" as the generation and regenerations of things and of the moral order.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} Tian may also be compared to the ''[[Brahman]]'' of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Veda|Vedic]] traditions.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}} The scholar Promise Hsu, in the wake of Robert B. Louden, explained 17:19 ("What does Tian ever say? Yet there are four seasons going round and there are the hundred things coming into being. What does Tian say?") as implying that even though Tian is not a "speaking person", it constantly "does" through the rhythms of nature, and communicates "how human beings ought to live and act", at least to those who have learnt to carefully listen to it.{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}}

[[Duanmu Ci|Zigong]], a disciple of Confucius, said that Tian had set the master on the path to become a wise man (9.6). In 7.23 Confucius says that he has no doubt left that the Tian gave him life, and from it he had developed right virtue (德 ''dé''). In 8.19 he says that the lives of the sages are interwoven with Tian.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=35}}

Regarding personal [[deity|gods]] (''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', energies who emanate from and reproduce the Tian) enliving nature, in the ''Analects'' Confucius says that it is appropriate (義/义 ''yì'') for people to worship (敬 ''jìng'') them,{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=36}} though through proper [[rite]]s (禮/礼 ''lǐ''), implying respect of positions and discretion.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=36}} Confucius himself was a ritual and [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] master.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=37}} Answering to a disciple who asked whether it is better to sacrifice to the god of the stove or to the god of the family (a popular saying), in 3.13 Confucius says that in order to appropriately pray gods one should first know and respect Heaven. In 3.12 he explains that religious rituals produce meaningful experiences,{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=36–37}} and one has to offer sacrifices in person, acting  in presence, otherwise "it is the same as not having sacrificed at all". Rites and sacrifices to the gods have an [[ethics|ethical]] importance: they generate good life, because taking part in them leads to the overcoming of the self.{{sfnb|Shen|Shun|2007|278–279}} Analects 10.11 tells that Confucius always took a small part of his food and placed it on the sacrificial bowls as an offering to his [[ancestor]]s.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=37}}

Other movements, such as [[Mohism]] which was later absorbed by Taoism, developed a more [[theism|theistic]] idea of Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Dubs|first=Homer|title=Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=9|number=3–4|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1960|pages=163–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feuchtwang explains that the difference between Confucianism and Taoism primarily lies in the fact that the former focuses on the realisation of the starry order of Heaven in human society, while the latter on the contemplation of the Dao which spontaneously arises in nature.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

As explained by Stephan Feuchtwang, the order coming from Heaven preserves the world, and has to be followed by humanity finding a "middle way" between yin and yang forces in each new configuration of reality. Social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is expressed in the worship of ancestors and deified progenitors in the male line, at [[ancestral shrines]].{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

Confucian ethical codes are described as humanistic.&lt;ref name=Juergensmeyer/&gt; They may be practiced by all the members of a society. Confucian ethics is characterised by the promotion of virtues, encompassed by the Five Constants, ''Wǔcháng'' (五常) in Chinese, elaborated by Confucian scholars out of the inherited tradition during the [[Han dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Runes&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|editor-last=Runes|editor-first=Dagobert D.|year=1983|publisher=Philosophical Library|isbn=0802223885}} p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; The Five Constants are:&lt;ref name=Runes/&gt;
*''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]]'' (仁, benevolence, humaneness);
*''[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yì]]'' (義/义, righteousness or justice);
*''[[Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ]]'' (禮/礼, proper rite);
*''Zhì'' (智, knowledge);
*''Xìn'' (信, integrity).

These are accompanied by the classical ''Sìzì'' (四字), that singles out four virtues, one of which is included among the Five Constants:
*''Zhōng'' (忠, loyalty);
*''[[Xiào]]'' (孝, filial piety);
*''Jié'' (節/节, contingency);
*''Yì'' (義/义, righteousness).

There are still many other elements, such as ''chéng'' (誠/诚, honesty), ''shù'' (恕, kindness and forgiveness), ''lián'' (廉, honesty and cleanness), ''chǐ'' (恥/耻, shame, judge and sense of right and wrong), ''yǒng'' (勇, bravery), ''wēn'' (溫/温, kind and gentle), ''liáng'' (良, good, kindhearted), ''gōng'' (恭, respectful, reverent), ''jiǎn'' (儉/俭, frugal), ''ràng'' (讓/让, modestly, self-effacing).

====Humaneness====
{{Main|Ren (Confucianism)}}
''Rén'' ({{zh|c=仁}}) is the Confucian virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being [[altruistic]]. It is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the essence of the human being, endowed by Heaven, and at the same time the means by which man may act according to the principle of Heaven (天理, ''Tiān lǐ'') and become one with it.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}

[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yán Huí]], Confucius's most outstanding student, once asked his master to describe the rules of ''rén'' and Confucius replied, "one should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper."&lt;ref&gt;Analects 12:1&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also defined ''rén'' in the following way: "wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 雍也 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning of ''rén'' is "not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yan-yuan/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 顏淵 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius also said, "''rén'' is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it." ''Rén'' is close to man and never leaves him.

====Rite and centring====

[[File:Korean Confucianism-Chugyedaeje-02.jpg|thumb|[[Korean Confucianism|Korean Confucian]] rite in [[Jeju Province|Jeju]]]]
{{Main|Li (Confucianism)}}
''Li'' (禮/礼) is a classical Chinese word which finds its most extensive use in [[Confucian]] and post-Confucian [[Chinese philosophy]]. ''Li'' is variously translated as "[[rite]]" or "[[reason]]," "ratio" in the pure sense of [[Veda|Vedic]] ''[[ṛta]]'' ("right," "order") when referring to the [[cosmos|cosmic]] law, but when referring to its realisation in the context of human social behaviour it has also been translated as "[[convention (norm)|customs]]", "measures" and "rules", among other terms. ''Li'' also means religious rites which establish relations between humanity and the gods.

According to Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as "what makes the invisible visible", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as "centring" (央 ''yāng'' or 中 ''zhōng''). Among all things of creation, humans themselves are "central" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}

''Li'' embodies the entire web of interaction between humanity, human objects, and nature. Confucius includes in his discussions of ''li'' such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] cites "songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation... rice and millet, fish and meat... the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes... spacious rooms and secluded halls, soft mats, couches and benches" as vital parts of the fabric of ''li''.

Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of ''li''. Some Confucians proposed that all human beings may pursue perfection by learning and practising ''li''. Overall, Confucians believe that governments should place more emphasis on ''li'' and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.

====Loyalty====
Loyalty ({{zh|c=忠}}, ''zhōng'') is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the most important way for an ambitious young scholar to become a prominent official was to enter a ruler's civil service.

Confucius himself did not propose that "might makes right," but rather that a superior should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude. In addition, loyalty does not mean subservience to authority. This is because reciprocity is demanded from the superior as well. As Confucius stated "a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness (loyalty)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/ba-yi|title=The Analects : Ba Yi - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Mencius]] also said that "when the prince regards his ministers as his hands and feet, his ministers regard their prince as their belly and heart; when he regards them as his dogs and horses, they regard him as another man; when he regards them as the ground or as grass, they regard him as a robber and an enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mengzi/li-lou-ii|title=Mengzi : Li Lou II - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mencius indicated that if the ruler is incompetent, he should be replaced. If the ruler is evil, then the people have the right to overthrow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mengzi/liang-hui-wang-ii/zh?en=on|title=孟子 : 梁惠王下 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good Confucian is also expected to remonstrate with his superiors when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/xian-wen/zh?en=on|title=論語 : 憲問 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a proper Confucian ruler should also accept his ministers' advice, as this will help him govern the realm better.

In later ages, however, emphasis was often placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled. Like filial piety, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes in China. Nonetheless, throughout the ages, many Confucians continued to fight against unrighteous superiors and rulers. Many of these Confucians suffered and sometimes died because of their conviction and action.&lt;ref&gt;Example: Hai Rui 海瑞 in the Ming dynasty, Yuan Chang 袁昶 in the Qing and so forth.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ming-Qing era, prominent Confucians such as [[Wang Yangming]] promoted individuality and independent thinking as a counterweight to subservience to authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Yangming, Instructions for Practical Living and Other Neo-Confucian Writings by Wang Yang-Ming, Wing-tsit Chan tran. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous thinker Huang Zongxi also strongly criticised the autocratic nature of the imperial system and wanted to keep imperial power in check.&lt;ref&gt;William Theodore De Bary, Waiting for the Dawn: A Plan for the Prince (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 91–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Confucians also realised that loyalty and filial piety have the potential of coming into conflict with one another. This may be true especially in times of social chaos, such as during the period of the Ming-Qing transition.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in 何冠彪 He Guanbiao, ''生與死 : 明季士大夫的抉擇'' (Taipei: Lianjing Chuban Shiye Gongsi, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filial piety====
[[File:尝粪心忧.JPG|thumb|Fourteenth of ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'']]
{{Main|Filial piety}}
In Confucian philosophy, filial [[piety]] ({{zh|c=孝}}, ''xiào'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors, and of the hierarchies within society: father–son, elder–junior and male–female.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} The Confucian classic ''[[Classic of Filial Piety|Xiaojing]]'' ("Book of Piety"), thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of ''xiào''. The book, a conversation between Confucius and his student Zeng Shen (曾參, also known as [[Zengzi]] 曾子), is about how to set up a good society using the principle of ''xiào''.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be [[rebellious]]; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness, for blindly following the parents' wishes is not considered to be ''xiao''; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is "[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]" (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:二十四孝|二十四孝]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Social harmony results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the natural order, and playing his or her part well. Reciprocity or responsibility (''renqing'') extends beyond filial piety and involves the entire network of social relations, even the respect for rulers.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} When Duke Jing of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, [[Confucius]] replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (''Analects'' XII, 11, tr. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Particular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. The same is true with the husband and wife relationship where the husband needs to show benevolence towards his wife and the wife needs to respect the husband in return. This theme of mutuality still exists in East Asian cultures even to this day.

The Five Bonds are: ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, friend to friend. Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties are also extended to the dead, where the living stand as sons to their deceased family. The only relationship where respect for elders isn't stressed was the friend to friend relationship, where mutual equal respect is emphasised instead. All these duties take the practical form of prescribed rituals, for instance wedding and death rituals.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

===''Junzi''===
{{Main|Junzi}}
The ''junzi'' ({{zh|c=君子}}, ''jūnzǐ'', "[[prince|lord's son]]") is a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] term often translated as "[[gentleman]]" or "superior person"&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes "exemplary person." Roger T. Ames and Henry Rosemont, Jr., ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation''. Paul Goldin translates it "noble man" in an attempt to capture both its early political and later moral meaning. Cf. "[http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html Confucian Key Terms: Junzi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520073016/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html |date=20 May 2014 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; and employed by [[Confucius]] in his works to describe the ideal man. In the ''[[I Ching]]'' it is used by the [[King Wen of Zhou|Duke of Wen]].

In Confucianism, the sage or wise is the ideal personality; however, it is very hard to become one of them. Confucius created the model of ''junzi'', gentleman, which may be achieved by any individual. Later, [[Zhu Xi]] defined ''junzi'' as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of the ''junzi'': he may live in [[poverty]], he does more and speaks less, he is [[loyalty|loyal]], obedient and knowledgeable. The ''junzi'' disciplines himself. ''Ren'' is fundamental to become a ''junzi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx 君子——儒学的理想人格] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418015158/http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx |date=18 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the ''junzi'' sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself may become a ''junzi''.

On the contrary, the ''xiaoren'' (小人, ''xiăorén'', "small or petty person") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is [[egotistic]] and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by ''xiaoren'' as opposed to ''junzi'', his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such ''xiaoren'' individuals may range from those who continually indulge in sensual and [[emotion]]al pleasures all day to the [[politician]] who is interested merely in [[power (social and political)|power]] and [[celebrity|fame]]; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.

The ''junzi'' enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure [[virtue]] would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that the government behaves much like a [[family]], the ''junzi'' being a beacon of filial piety.

===Rectification of names===
[[File:Tablet of Confucius.jpg|thumb|Priest paying homage to Confucius' tablet, c. 1900]]
{{Main|Rectification of names}}
Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with [[reality]]. Fundamentally, then, social disorder may stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was ''zhèngmíng'' ({{zh|c=正名|p=zhèngmíng|l=rectification of terms}}). He gave an explanation of ''zhengming'' to one of his disciples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zi-lu said, "The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?"&lt;br&gt;
The Master replied, "What is necessary to rectify names."&lt;br&gt;
"So! indeed!" said Zi-lu. "You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?"&lt;br&gt;
The Master said, "How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man [Junzi] cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect."&lt;br&gt;
(''Analects'' XIII, 3, tr. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xun Zi]] chapter (22) "On the Rectification of Names" claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ({{zh|c=名|p=míng}}) that directly corresponded with actualities ({{zh|c=實|p=shí}}), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong. Since [[harmonious society|social harmony]] is of utmost importance, without the proper rectification of names, society would essentially crumble and "undertakings [would] not [be] completed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Rodney L.|last2=Choy|first2=Howard Y. F.|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|location=New York|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=0823940799}} pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Temple rooftop dragon in Taiwan (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] is one of the oldest symbols of Chinese religious culture. It symbolises the supreme godhead, Di or Tian, at the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]], around which it coils itself as the [[Draco (constellation)|homonymous constellation]]. It is a symbol of the "protean" supreme power which has in itself both [[yin and yang]].{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}}]]
[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|thumb|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers of the Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou dynasty. Confucians are marked by triangles in dark red.]]
{{See also|History of religion in China}}
According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]-[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (~1600 BCE–256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=105, note 45}} Both the dynasties worshipped the supreme godhead, called ''[[Shangdi]]'' (上帝 "Highest Deity") or simply ''Dì'' (帝) by the Shang and ''[[Tian]]'' (天 "Heaven") by the Zhou. Shangdi was conceived as the first ancestor of the Shang royal house,{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} an alternate name for him being the "Supreme Progenitor" (上甲 ''Shàngjiǎ'').{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=227–228, Vol. II}} In Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four 方 ''[[Wufang Shangdi|fāng]]'' ("directions" or "sides") and their 風 ''fēng'' ("winds") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143–144, Vol. II}} With the Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, the name for the supreme godhead became ''[[Tian]]'' (天 "Heaven").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} While the Shang identified Shangdi as their ancestor-god to assert their claim to power by divine right, the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}

John C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient [[Chinese characters]] for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=103, Vol. II}} or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader [[Ursa Major]], and [[Ursa Minor]] (Little Dipper).{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|pp=138–148, "Chapter 4: Bringing Heaven Down to Earth"}} Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. I}} The supreme godhead was also identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], symbol of unlimited power (''[[qi]]''),{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} of the "protean" primordial power which embodies both [[yin and yang]] in unity, associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] which winds around the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]],{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and slithers between the Little and Big Dipper.

By the 6th century BCE the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual cauldrons, and the Zhou ritual system) became "diffuse" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Divine right no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvi–xxxvii, Vol. I}}

Besides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as "wild" (野 ''yě'') traditions, or traditions "outside of the official system", developed as attempts to access the will of Tian. The population had lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the 九野 ("Nine Fields") and of the ''[[Yijing]]'' flourished.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvii–xxxviii, Vol. I}} Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]", each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order.

[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) appeared in this period of political decadence and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang-Zhou theology, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and agency of humans,{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}} and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of 愛人 ''àirén'', "loving others").{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=2}} As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of [[meditation]] that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=xxxviii, Vol. I}} Confucius amended and recodified the [[Chinese classics|classical books]] inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}

Philosophers in the [[Warring States period]], both "inside the square" (focused on state-endorsed ritual) and "outside the square" (non-aligned to state ritual) built upon Confucius' legacy, compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classical metaphysics that became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (一 ''Yī''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii–xxxix, Vol. I}}

Since the 2000s, there has been a growing identification of the Chinese intellectual class with Confucianism.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"&gt;{{cite article|last=Yang|first=Fenggang|title=Cultural Dynamics in China: Today and in 2020|journal=Asia Policy|number=4|date=July 2007|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-LdyJdpkQ8kJ:www.purdue.edu/crcs/itemPublications/articles/YangChina2020s.pdf+confucian+fundamentalism&amp;hl=it&amp;gl=it&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESize70WNJxoIIOMRBt5DEIi_y2d7zHRgHs0t1XQiaSfoaxX05HWwV5f9yKrIVmFA_nmDge95VJc6DFPpZgQfF23oBelDF6eIoOg7iKV_1cJMVWChRZTQ-uA3FSEby7dk4i5t1Nd&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8emeoEif5P2Tuv3SApNEJDQLzNw}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people through standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a [[state church]] is [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]].{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}}

In 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established,&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; and ''[[guoxue]]'' started to be implemented in public schools on all levels. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers have appeared on television since 2006.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; The most enthusiastic New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt;

The idea of a "[[Confucian Church]]" as the [[state religion]] of [[China]] has roots in the thought of [[Kang Youwei]], an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the Chinese empire.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}} Kang modeled his ideal "Confucian Church" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of [[Confucius]].{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}}

In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (''[[shuyuan]]'' 书院),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} the resurgence of [[Confucian rites]] (''chuántǒng lǐyí'' 传统礼仪),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (''shèqū rúxué'' 社区儒学). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of [[lineage churches]] and their [[ancestral temples]], as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015a|p=7}}

Other forms of revival are [[Chinese salvationist religion|salvationist folk religious movements]]{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|pp=203–214}} groups with a specifically Confucian focus, or [[Confucian churches]], for example the ''Yidan xuetang'' (一耽学堂) of [[Beijing]],{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|p=219}} the ''Mengmutang'' (孟母堂) of [[Shanghai]],{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=29}} [[Confucian Shenism]] (儒宗神教 ''Rúzōng Shénjiào'') or the phoenix churches,{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=34}} the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 ''Rújiào Dàotán'') in northern Fujian which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation,{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=34}} and [[ancestral temples]] of the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself) operating as Confucian-teaching churches.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=29}}

Also, the Hong Kong [[Confucian Academy]], one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and other activities.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=148}} In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') in [[Shenzhen]], affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of [[Qufu]] City.{{sfnb|Payette|2014}}{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|pp=152–156}} It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the [[Holy Confucian Church]] (孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì''). The first spiritual leader of the Holy Church is the renowned scholar [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]], the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode (阳明精舍 ''Yángmíng jīngshě''), a Confucian academy in [[Guiyang]], [[Guizhou]].

Chinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called 儒 ''rú'' or 正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', "[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|pp=3–5}} "Confucian businessmen" (儒商人 ''rúshāngrén'', also "refined businessman") is a recently rediscovered concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|p=204}}

==Governance==
[[File:Yushima Seido 002.jpg|thumb|[[Yushima Seidō]] in [[Bunkyō]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it. (''Analects'' 2.1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself according to the universal order. When actual, the king's personal virtue (''de'') spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the [[Great Learning]], and is tightly linked with the [[Taoism|Taoist]] concept of [[wu wei]] ({{zh|t=無為|s=无为|p=wú wéi}}): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the "calm center" around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.

This idea may be traced back to the ancient [[shamanism|shamanic]] beliefs of the [[king]] being the [[axis mundi|axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth]]. The [[emperors of China]] were considered agents of Heaven, endowed with the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. They hold the power to define the hierarchy of divinities, by bestowing titles upon mountains, rivers and dead people, acknowledging them as powerful and therefore establishing their cults.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|pp=146–147}}

==Meritocracy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (''Analects'' 15.39)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (''Analects'' 7.1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[H. G. Creel]] point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. ''Jūnzǐ'' (君子, lit. "lord's child"), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English "gentleman."

A virtuous commoner who cultivates his qualities may be a "gentleman", while a shameless son of the king is only a "small man." That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.

Another new idea, that of [[meritocracy]], led to the introduction of the [[imperial examination]] system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese imperial examination system started in the [[Sui dynasty]]. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations. The practice of meritocracy still exists today in the Chinese cultural sphere, including [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and so forth.

==Influence==

===In 17th-century Europe===
[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|"Life and works of Confucius, by [[Prospero Intorcetta]], 1687]]

The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.{{refn|group=note|The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno.}} [[Matteo Ricci]] was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father [[Prospero Intorcetta]] wrote about the life and works of Confucius in [[Latin]] in 1687.&lt;ref name="Windows into China"&gt;"Windows into China," John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period,&lt;ref name="Mungello"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.2307/1397760}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Western civilisation.&lt;ref name="Windows into China" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]], John Hobson, pp 194–195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism influenced [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own. It is postulated that certain elements of Leibniz's philosophy, such as "simple substance" and "preestablished harmony," were borrowed from his interactions with Confucianism.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt; The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] was also influenced by Confucius, seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma.&lt;ref name="epc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ezra Pound and Confucianism: remaking humanism in the face of modernity  |last= Lan|first= Feng|year= 2005|publisher= University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-8020-8941-0|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.&lt;ref name="epc"/&gt;
{{quote|text=Confucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived...|sign=[[Voltaire]]&lt;ref name="epc"/&gt;}}

===On Islamic thought===
From the late 17th century onwards a whole body of literature known as the [[Han Kitab]] developed amongst the [[Hui people|Hui Muslims]] of China who infused [[Islam]]ic thought with Confucianism. Especially the works of [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] such as ''Tiānfāng Diǎnlǐ''（天方典禮）sought to harmonise Islam with not only Confucianism but also with [[Daoism]] and is considered to be one of the crowning achievements of the Chinese Islamic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=James|title=Uncontrived Concord: The Eclectic Sources and Syncretic Theories of Liu Zhi, a Chinese Muslim Scholar|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2009|volume=20|pages=46–54|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/1/46.abstract|accessdate=12 September 2011|doi=10.1093/jis/etn062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern times===
Important military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord [[Ma Fuxiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+military+academy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_AadTPPfNIP78AaV-OVR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20confucianism%20%20northern&amp;f=false |title= Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |editor1=Stéphane A.

Referred to variously as the Confucian hypothesis and as a debated component of the more all-encompassing Asian Development Model, there exists among political scientists and economists a theory that Confucianism plays a large latent role in the ostensibly non-Confucian cultures of modern-day East Asia, in the form of the rigorous work ethic it endowed those cultures with. These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernise and industrialise as quickly as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and even [[China]] have done.

For example, the impact of the [[Vietnam War]] on Vietnam was devastating, but over the last few decades Vietnam has been re-developing in a very fast pace. Most scholars attribute the origins of this idea to futurologist [[Herman Kahn]]'s ''World Economic Development: 1979 and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, George. 1990. "Explaining the Success of the Four Little Dragons: A Survey." In Seiji Naya and Akira Takayama, eds. ''Economic Development in East and Southeast Asia: Essays in Honor of Professor Shinichi Ichimura.'' Institute of Southeast Asian Studies: Singapore, and the East-West Center: Honolulu, p. 25., {{ISBN|9789813035638}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert and Michael Harris Bond. 1988. "The Confucius Connection: From Cultural Roots to Economic Growth." ''Organizational Dynamics'' 16 (4): p. 6. {{ISSN|0090-2616}}, {{doi|10.1016/0090-2616(88)90009-5}}, PubMed 4640478, [http://www2.seminolestate.edu/falbritton/Summer%202009/FHI/Articles/Hofstede.confucious%20connection%20120505%20science%20direct.pdf URL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626043702/http://www2.seminolestate.edu/falbritton/Summer%202009/FHI/Articles/Hofstede.confucious%20connection%20120505%20science%20direct.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies, for example Cristobal Kay's ''Why East Asia Overtook Latin America: Agrarian Reform, Industrialization, and Development'', have attributed the Asian growth to other factors, for example the character of agrarian reforms, "state-craft" (state capacity), and interaction between agriculture and industry.&lt;ref&gt;2002. ''Third World Quarterly'' 23 (6): pp. 1073–1102. {{doi|10.1080/0143659022000036649}}, [http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/~ibagdadi/INT230/Christobal%20Kay%20-%20Why%20East%20Asia%20Overtook%20Latin%20America.pdf URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Chinese martial arts===
After Confucianism had become the official 'state religion' in China, its influence penetrated all walks of life and all streams of thought in Chinese society for the generations to come. This did not exclude martial arts culture. Though in his own day, Confucius had rejected the practice of Martial Arts (with the exception of Archery), he did serve under rulers who used military power extensively to achieve their goals. In later centuries, Confucianism heavily influenced many educated martial artists of great influence, such as [[Sun Lutang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|title=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston - Sun Style Taijiquan &amp; Qigong|author=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston|work=suntaichiboston.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223080456/http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from the 19th century onwards, when bare-handed martial arts in China became more widespread and had begun to more readily absorb philosophical influences from Confucianism, [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]]. Some argue therefore that despite Confucius' disdain with martial culture, his teachings became of much relevance to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il/2014/08/confucianism-and-martial-arts.html|title=Cook Ding's Kitchen: Confucianism and Martial Arts|work=cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Confucius and Confucianism were opposed or criticised from the start, including [[Laozi]]'s philosophy and [[Mozi]]'s critique, and Legalists such as  [[Han Fei]] ridiculed the idea that virtue would lead people to be orderly. In modern times, waves of opposition and vilification showed that Confucianism, instead of taking credit for the glories of Chinese civilisation, now had to take blame for its failures. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] described Confucianism sages as well as gods in [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as devils. In the [[New Culture Movement]], [[Lu Xun]] criticised Confucianism for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late [[Qing Dynasty]]: his criticisms are dramatically portrayed in "[[A Madman's Diary]]," which implies that Confucian society was cannibalistic. Leftists during the [[Cultural Revolution]] described Confucius as the representative of the class of slave owners.

In [[South Korea]], there has long been criticism. Some South Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernisation of South Korea. For example, South Korean writer Kim Kyong-il wrote an essay {{when|date=March 2017}} entitled "Confucius Must Die For the Nation to Live" (공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다, ''gongjaga jug-eoya naraga sanda''). Kim said that [[filial piety]] is one-sided and blind, and if it continues social problems will continue as government keeps forcing Confucian filial obligations onto families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=39088 |title=공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다고?&amp;nbsp;– 시사저널 |publisher=Sisapress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=하늘날아|url=http://zerocdh.tistory.com/97|title=지식이 물 흐르듯이 :: 공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다|publisher=Zerocdh.tistory.com|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2012-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415153841/http://zerocdh.tistory.com/97|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Confucian thought===
{{See also|Women in ancient and imperial China}}
Confucianism "largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the [[Han dynasty]] onward."&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;  The gender roles prescribed in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] stated that: "To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter."&lt;ref name="ebrey"/&gt; Chaste widows were revered and memorialised during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] periods. This "[[Cult of widow chastity|cult of chastity]]" accordingly condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

For years, many modern scholars have regarded Confucianism as a sexist, patriarchal ideology that was historically damaging to Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41675091 |title=Women Existing for Men: Confucianism and Social Injustice against Women in China |author=Xiongya Gao|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=10|number= 3, Interdisciplinary Topics in Race, Gender, and Class |date=2003| pages= 114–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=15–16 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued by some Chinese and Western writers that the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty had led to a decline of status of women.&lt;ref name="ebrey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have also accused the prominent Song neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] for believing in the inferiority of women and that men and women need to be kept strictly separate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sima Guang]] also believed that women should remain indoor and not deal with the matters of men in the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQiJWZNQZfgC&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Images of Women in Chinese Thought and Culture: Writings from the Pre-Qin Period to the Song Dynasty |first= Robin|last= Wang|chapter=Precepts for Family Life |publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=978-0872206519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, scholars have discussed the attitudes toward women in Confucian texts such as [[Analects]]. In a much-discussed passage, women are grouped together with ''xiaoren'' (小人, literally "small people", meaning people of low status or low moral) and described as being difficult to cultivate or deal with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ID4gMCaLr0MC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and Confucianism: The Essentials |author= Lee Dian Rainey |page=55 |date= 7 June 2010|publisher =John Wiley and Sons Ltd|isbn= 9781444323603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=gb&amp;id=1561#s10028160 |title=儒家 -&gt; 論語 -&gt; 陽貨 -&gt; 25|website=ctext.org }} Original text: "唯女子與小人爲難養也，近之則不孫，遠之則怨。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpcSq6aTcgMC&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Reconceiving Women's Equality in China: A Critical Examination of Models of Sex Equality|first= Lijun |last=Yuan|publisher=Lexington Books |date=29 August 2005|isbn= 978-0739112281 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditional commentators and modern scholars have debated over the precise meaning of the passage, and whether Confucius referred to all women or just certain groups of women.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Chong 邱崇, "释 '唯女子与小人为难养也'" ''Yuejiang Academic Journal,'' vol.6 (December:2013),141-145. http://yj.nuist.edu.cn/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20130621&amp;year_id=2013&amp;quarter_id=6&amp;falg=1 The article points out the various disputes among traditional Confucian commentators on what the passage really means. It also summarizes the debate in contemporary academia regarding the phrase's meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liao Mingchun 廖名春,“'唯女子与小人为难养也'疏注及新解" 
''Renwen Zaizhi,'' vol. 6 (2012). http://www.rujiazg.com/article/id/11256/&lt;/ref&gt;

Further analysis suggests, however, that women's place in Confucian society may be more complex.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt; During the Han dynasty period, the influential Confucian text [[Lessons for Women]] (Nüjie), was written by [[Ban Zhao]] (45–114 CE) to instruct her daughters how to be proper Confucian wives and mothers, that is, to be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the male. However, she does present education and literary power as important for women. In later dynasties, a number of women took advantage of the Confucian acknowledgment of education to become independent in thought.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;

Indeed, as Joseph A. Adler points out, "Neo-Confucian writings do not necessarily reflect either the prevailing social practices or the scholars' own attitudes and practices in regard to actual women."&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt; Matthew Sommers has also indicated that the Qing dynasty government began to realise the utopian nature of enforcing the "cult of chastity" and began to allow practices such as widow remarrying to stand.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Sommers, Sex, Law and Society in Late Imperial China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some Confucian texts like the ''Chunqiu Fanlu'' 春秋繁露 have passages that suggest a more equal relationship between a husband and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/chun-qiu-fan-lu/ji-yi/zh|title=春秋繁露 : 基義 - 中國哲學書電子化計劃|work=中國哲學書電子化計劃}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, some scholars have also begun to discuss the viability of constructing a "Confucian feminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=4, 149&amp;ndash;160 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic controversy over Chinese rites==
{{main|Chinese Rites controversy}}
Ever since Europeans first encountered Confucianism, the issue of how Confucianism should be classified has been subject to debate. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian [[Jesuits]], considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity.&lt;ref name="Elman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Elman|2005|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits, including [[Matteo Ricci]], saw Chinese rituals as "civil rituals" that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Elman"/&gt;

By the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]], creating a dispute among Catholics in [[East Asia]] that was known as the "Rites Controversy."&lt;ref name="Gunn"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunn|2003|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that [[Chinese ancestral worship]] was a form of idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals.&lt;ref name="Gunn"/&gt;

Some critics view Confucianism as definitely [[pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[nontheism|nontheistic]], in that it is not based on the belief in the supernatural or in a personal god existing separate from the temporal plane.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}}&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yang|1961|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius views about Tiān 天 and about the divine providence ruling the world, can be found above (in this page) and in Analects 6:26, 7:22, and 9:12, for example. On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students: "You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?"&lt;ref name="Sinaiko"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sinaiko|1998|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes such as [[ancestor worship]], [[ritual]], and [[sacrifice]] were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; these attributes may be traced to the traditional [[Chinese folk religion]].

Scholars recognise that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion. Using stricter definitions of religion, Confucianism has been described as a moral science or philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm Centre for Confucian Science (Korea)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716073420/http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urantiabook.org/archive/readers/601_confucianism.htm|title=Introduction to Confucianism|work=urantiabook.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; But using a broader definition, such as Frederick Streng's characterisation of religion as "a means of ultimate transformation,"&lt;ref&gt;Streng, Frederick, "Understanding Religious Life," 3rd ed. (1985), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism could be described as a "sociopolitical doctrine having religious qualities."&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt; With the latter definition, Confucianism is religious, even if non-theistic, in the sense that it "performs some of the basic psycho-social functions of full-fledged religions."&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;

'''Dhammacari''' ([[Pali]]: Dhammacārī; lit., "one who follows the [[Dhamma]]") is a term used in some [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]] communities to refer to lay devotees ([[upāsaka]]s) who have seriously committed themselves to Buddhist practice for several years.  Dhammacaris follow four training vows in addition to the traditional [[Five Precepts]] that all lay devotees follow.

Dhammacārī literally means a person who forms his or her thinking and behavior according to the Dhamma. Dhamma is the knowledge that enhances the quality of life. It is the knowledge and understanding of the true nature of things: the knowledge that all things are causally conditioned. After realizing the causes and conditions of things one can generate a desired effect by changing the causes and conditions as necessary. This is the same principle that is used to improve things in science and technology. Dhammacārī applies this method to improve things related to human behavior.

“Dhammacārī” (one who follows Dhamma) is committed to putting effort towards understanding how life works (Dhamma) and reforms the lifestyle and thinking patterns according to this understanding. The goal is the reduction of discomfort of life and becoming more and more effective in handling ups and downs of life. Buddha has taught Dhamma in many different ways and his teachings help us to understand the many subtle details regarding the nature of life. Dhammacārī is convinced that learning the teaching of the Buddha makes learning “life” much easier.

==The Meanings of Taking Refuge==

Buddha: The term Buddha means ultimate human perfection, the perfection of insight and compassion. It is also the absence of fear and all other defects of the human mind. Any one can achieve Buddha-hood by using the correct method. Taking refuge in the Buddha means setting oneself in the direction of perfect wisdom and compassion.

Dhamma: Dhamma is the necessary information regarding the method that gradually leads us toward human perfection. After carefully verifying the accuracy of this method, all Buddhas make that information available to others for their benefit. Dhamma is the knowledge that is utilized and verified by individuals who seek to refine the quality of life. Taking refuge in Dhamma is committing oneself to study and practice it for the benefit of oneself and others.

Sangha:  Sangha is the numerous men, women and children who have tested the method and proved that gradual improvement and final personal perfection is possible. They were average people who achieved perfect wisdom and compassion, by following Dhamma. They became free from sorrow, frustration, stress, fear, and other mental weaknesses that make life difficult. Taking refuge in the Sangha means looking up to them as role models.

==History==
In the early 1990s [http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Madawala_Seelawimala Bhante Madawala Seelawimala] of [http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=American_Buddhist_Seminary_Temple_at_Sacramento American Buddhist Seminary] in West Sacramento and [http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Walpola_Piyananda Bhante Walpola Piyananda] of [http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Dharma_Vijaya_Buddhist_Vihara Dhamma Vijaya Buddhist Vihara] in Los Angeles decided to establish this formal initiation ceremony to train future American Buddhist leadership.

Dhammacārī Initiation is designed to encourage the students of Dhamma to study and practice Dhamma deeply and more seriously. Additionally, they are encouraged to teach Dhamma School for children, give introductory talks on Buddhism, give public Dhamma talks on simple topics, conduct basic meditation sessions and organize Dhamma study groups. The American Buddhist Seminary may even certify Dhammacārīs who have the proper background and in-depth knowledge of Dhamma for Buddhist counseling.

Fr. '''Gommar A. DePauw''' (11 October 1918 - 6 May 2005) was a [[traditionalist Catholic]] priest and founder of the Catholic Traditionalist Movement.

== Early life ==
DePauw was born in [[Stekene]], [[Belgium]], the son of a newspaper editor. After graduating as a Diplomate in Classical Humanities, magna cum laude, from the College of St. Nicholas, he entered the diocesan seminary of [[Ghent]] for his philosophical and theological studies.  During the [[Second World War]] he served as a combat medic with the 9th Belgian Infantry Hunters Regiment, and was taken prisoner at [[Dunkirk]] in 1940. After escaping from prison camp, he returned to his seminary studies and was ordained priest for the [[Diocese of Ghent]] in 1942. He served as a battle-field chaplain with the Belgian Underground Army and the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]] until the end of the war.

== Education and Career ==
For three years DePauw studied at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]], where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and a licentiate in canon law, [[Ethics in religion|moral theology]] and [[History of Christianity|church history]].

In 1949 DePauw joined his family in the United States.  He served as an assistant priest in two [[New York City]] parishes: St. Stephen's in [[Manhattan]] and St. Clare's in [[The Bronx]].  At the same time he pursued graduate studies at [[The Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  In 1953 he received a doctorate in canon law with a dissertation entitled ''The Educational Rights of the Church and Elementary Schools in Belgium''.

From 1952 to 1963 DePauw taught canon law at [[Mount St. Mary's University|Mount Saint Mary's Seminary]] in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]].  In 1955 he requested and was granted [[Excardination and Incardination|incardination]] from the Diocese of Ghent to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] and was named academic dean of the seminary.  On 9 May 1955 he became a United States citizen.  While teaching at the seminary, he contributed articles to the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Bible'', ''Homiletic and Pastoral Review'', and ''Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses''.

During the [[Second Vatican Council]] he was called to [[Rome]] to serve as a [[peritus]], a theological advisor to bishops at the Council.  At the request of the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Amleto Giovanni Cicognani]], [[Pope Paul VI]] made him a [[Monsignor|domestic prelate]] with the title ''Right Reverend Monsignor''.

Towards the end of the Second Vatican Council DePauw came into conflict with Cardinal [[Lawrence Shehan]], Archbishop of Baltimore, over the interpretation of the council's teachings, particularly about liturgical matters.  In January 1965 DePauw incorporated an organization called the ''Catholic Traditionalist Movement'' in New York State, purportedly with the support of Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]], Archbishop of New York.  Shehan demanded that DePauw break with the organization.  In summer 1965 Shehan removed DePauw from teaching duties at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary and transferred him to a parish in a Baltimore suburb.  Shortly thereafter DePauw left for Rome.

On 15 November 1965 [[Luigi Faveri]], [[Bishop of Tivoli]] in [[Italy]], signed a document transferring DePauw's incardination from the Archdiocese of Baltimore to the Diocese of Tivoli.  Faveri said that he had taken this step at the request of Cardinal Spellman and of the Cardinal Secretary of the [[Holy Office]], [[Alfredo Ottaviani]].  This transfer would have allowed DePauw to continue his work with the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in New York.

In January 1966 after the attempted transfer from Baltimore to Tivoli became public, Cardinal Shehan said that the transfer was never legally completed and that DePauw was still a priest incardinated in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. In order to excardinate and incardinate, a priest must request excardination of his bishop, and it must be granted. As Cardinal Shehan was following the universal law of the Church, the Bishop of Tivoli supported Cardinal Shehan.  Bishop Blais Kurz, the exiled [[Prefect Apostolic]] of [[Yungchow]] in [[China]], supported DePauw.

On 23 June 1968 DePauw established the Ave Maria Chapel in [[Westbury, Long Island]], where he ministered until his death. He became well-known among traditionalist Catholics for his Sunday radio Mass, his video and audio cassettes, and pamphlets.  He edited two magazines:  ''Sounds of Truth and Tradition'' and ''Quote .. Unquote''.  His two best-known works are the ''Traditional Roman Catholic Mass'' and ''The Challenge of Peace through Strength'', a critique of the American Catholic bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace, ''The Challenge of Peace''.

DePauw died on 6 May 2005.

'''Hamd''' ({{lang-ar|حمد}}), "praise" in [[English language|English]], is a word that exclusively praises God - whether written or spoken. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/al+hamd+(+the+praise+)/, Translation and meaning of the word 'Hamd' (the praise) in English on almaany.com website, Retrieved 12 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, The word "Hamd" is always followed by the name of God ([[Allah]]) - a phrase known as the [[Tahmid]] - "Alḥamdulillāh" (Arabic: الحَمْد لله) (English:"All praise is due to God alone"). The word "Hamd" comes from the [[Qur'an]], and الحَمْد لله is the phrase which, after the [[Basmala|Bismillah]], establishes the first verse of the first chapter of the [[Qur'an]] - [[al Fatiha]] Mubarak (the opening).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://quran.com/1/2?translations=20 |publisher=quran.com |title=al Fatiha |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e791 |publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies.com |title=Hamd |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hamd is usually written in [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], or [[Urdu]] and recited all over the Muslim world, from [[Indonesia]] to [[Morocco]]. A [[Qawwali]] performance usually includes at least one Hamd, which is traditionally at the beginning of the performance.

==In the five pillars of Islam==
In the [[five pillars of Islam]], the concept of Hamd is in each pillar to emphasize the importance of this word.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pillars-of-islam, Definition and meaning of 'Five Pillars of Islam' on dictionary.com website, Retrieved 12 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In the '''first pillar''' [[Shahada]], Muslims praise [[Allah]] for the blessings of being born [[Muslim]] and the belief in one [[god]] and his [[prophet]]. They also praise Him for giving them better health and wealth than those who suffer. The '''second pillar''' is [[Salat]] which is performing prayer, Muslims pray five times a day in order to keep remembering Allah and this allows a direct link between the worshipper and God. In each prayer Muslims recite [[Surah]] (passage), [[Al-Fatiha]] and choose the next surah they would like to recite, but Al-Fatiha must always be recited in order for prayers to be accepted. The '''third pillar''' is giving [[Zakat]] which is the act of giving a percentage of a Muslim's income to certain classes of needy people; this allows Muslims to remember the poor and to never forget that everything belongs to Allah. Therefore they should be thankful for what they have at all times. Fasting is the '''fourth pillar''', and this emphasizes the depth meaning of Hamd in the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. Muslims fast every year for a month from sunrise to sunset. This helps purify the worshiper's soul and helps them gain true sympathy with the hungry in addition to remind them of their blessings and amounts of food they have. The '''fifth pillar''' is [[Hajj]], the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], the concept of Hamd is implemented in the action of Muslims visiting the [[Kaabah]] or House of God. In all five pillars in [[Islam]], Hamd is used either by action or words.
In all aspects of Islam, Hamd is used and can only be used for Allah alone. Hamd is the root word for '''AlHamdAllah''' which means '''praise to Allah'''. When a Muslim thanks or praises Allah for his favours and bounties it can be done by reciting the word or by act of prayer.&lt;ref name=wordpress&gt;https://tayyibaat.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/what-is-hamd/, Meaning and definition of 'Hamd' on wordpress.com website, Published 8 September 2008, Retrieved 12 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance of God==
Hamd is a word to be recited by every Muslim in order for him/her to keep [[Allah]] in mind. For example, when a Muslim sneezes, first thing they should say is HamdAllah praising God in every small or large situation. It is believed when a person sneezes, his or her soul is taken out for milliseconds and returned, therefore thanking [[God]] for returning the soul is a blessing. Muslims should always praise God no matter what state they are in. 
Hamd is always true and implies admiration, love and magnifying the creator. Hamd is sincere and true praise therefore when praising [[Allah]] most deserving; called Mahmood which comes from the word Hamd. When Muslims say ''AlHamdAllah'', it is out of love, humility and complete submission to the oneness and perfection of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name=wordpress/&gt;

== Hamd singers==
Some well-known Hamd singers are [[Mishary Rashid Alafasy]],  [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Sabri Brothers]], [[Najam Sheraz]], [[Qari Waheed Zafar Qasmi]] and Muhammad al-Muqit. Some modern [[English language]] singers of Hamd are [[Yusuf Islam]] (formerly known as Cat Stevens), [[Sami Yusuf]], Ahmed Mac and ''Nusrullah Khan Noori''. Hamd is a word that is used in the Islamic religion. Muslims use the word Hamd in many aspects in their lives. The [[Quran]] starts with a Hamd opening chapter or [[Surah]] which is [[Al-Fatiha]] starts with praising God ("[[Allah]]"). It is found to be in the first Ayah, the first Surah in the [[Quran]]; [[Al-Fatiha]] . It is significant because it allows Muslims to remember ("[[Allah]]") throughout the day and to keep praising Him for his blessings.

"'''Hīnayāna'''"&lt;!--Please do not insert other languages as the term Hinayana derives from Sanskrit and not other languages.--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|iː|n|ə|ˈ|j|ɑː|n|ə}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term literally meaning the "inferior vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=hina&amp;script=&amp;direct=se&amp;link=didse&amp;mode=3|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehindunames.com/meaningof?foldername=knowyourname&amp;pagename=meaningresults&amp;username=hina|title=Meaning of hina {{!}} hina meaning in sanskrit {{!}} origin and history of hina {{!}} sanskrit syllables and sounds and text in hina {{!}} eHindunames.com|website=www.ehindunames.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan teachers translate it "smaller vehicle".&lt;ref name="Kalu Rinpoche 1995 p. 15"&gt;Kalu Rinpoche (1995) ''Profound Buddhism From Hinayana To Vajrayana'': p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The term was applied to the ''[[Śrāvakayāna]]'', the Buddhist path followed by a [[śrāvaka]] who wished to become an [[arhat]]. This pejorative term appeared around the first or second century. Hīnayāna was often contrasted with ''[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]'', which means the "great vehicle".

In 1950 the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] declared that the term Hīnayana should not be used when referring to any form of Buddhism existing today.

In the past, the term was widely used by Western scholars to cover "the earliest system of Buddhist doctrine", as the ''Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' put it.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Oxford, 1899), "Proper Noun: simpler or lesser vehicle. Name of the earliest system of Buddhist doctrine (opposite to the later Mahayana; see [[Yana (Buddhism)|Yana]])."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Buddhist scholarship has deprecated the pejorative term, and uses instead the term ''[[Nikaya Buddhism]]'' to refer to [[early Buddhist schools]]. 

''Hinayana'' has also been used as a synonym for [[Theravada]], which is the main tradition of Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]]; this is considered inaccurate and derogatory. [[Robert Thurman]] writes, "'Nikaya Buddhism' is a coinage of Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of [[Harvard University]], who suggested it to me as a usage for the eighteen schools of Indian Buddhism to avoid the term 'Hinayana Buddhism,' which is found offensive by some members of the [[Theravada]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thurman and Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University: . Robert Thurman, in ''The Emptiness That is Compassion'', footnote 10, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within Mahayana Buddhism, there were a variety of interpretations as to whom or to what the term ''Hinayana'' referred. [[Kalu Rinpoche]] stated the "lesser" or "greater" designation "did not refer to economic or social status, but concerned the spiritual capacities of the practitioner".&lt;ref name="Kalu Rinpoche 1995 p. 15"/&gt;
{{quote|The Small Vehicle is based on becoming aware of the fact that all we experience in samsara is marked by suffering. Being aware of this engenders the will to rid ourselves of this suffering, to liberate ourselves on an individual level, and to attain happiness. We are moved by our own interest.

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]], who visited India in the [[7th century]], distinguished Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2008 p. 5"&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Both adopt one and the same [[Vinaya]], and they have in common the prohibitions of the [[anantarika-karma|five offenses]], and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hīnayāna'' is formed of ''hīna'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit | url= http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=hina+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "little", "poor", "inferior", "abandoned", "deficient", "defective"; and ''yāna'' (यान):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit | url= http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;tinput=yaana&amp;country_ID=&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU | accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "vehicle", where "vehicle" means "a way of going to enlightenment". The Pali Text Society's ''Pali-English Dictionary'' (1921–25) defines ''hīna'' in even stronger terms, with a semantic field that includes "poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible", and "despicable".

The term was translated by [[Kumārajīva]] and others into [[Classical Chinese]] as "small vehicle" (小 meaning "small", 乘 meaning "vehicle"), although earlier and more accurate translations of the term also exist. In Mongolian (''Baga Holgon'') the term for hinayana also means "small" or "lesser" vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;"It is also certain that Buddhist groups and individuals in [[China]] (including [[Tibet]]), [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Japan]] have in the past, as in the very recent present, identified themselves as Mahayana Buddhists, even if the polemical or value claim embedded in that term was only dimly felt, if at all.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004, page 492&lt;/ref&gt; while in Tibetan there are at least two words to designate the term, ''theg chung'' meaning "small vehicle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/theg_chung |title=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionary:theg chung |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[Rangjung Yeshe Wiki]] |publisher=Tsadra Foundation |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''theg dman'' meaning "inferior vehicle" or "inferior spiritual approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/theg_dman |title=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionary:theg dman |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[Rangjung Yeshe Wiki]] |publisher=Tsadra Foundation |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] has emphasized that ''hinayana'' is in no way implying "inferior". In his translation and commentary of [[Asanga]]'s ''Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata'', he writes, "all three traditions of hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana were practiced in Tibet and that the hinayana which literally means "lesser vehicle" is in no way inferior to the mahayana."&lt;ref name="Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Dharma and Dharmata, note 5"&gt;Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. ''Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata.'' 1999. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to Jan Nattier, it is most likely that the term Hīnayāna postdates the term Mahāyāna and was only added at a later date due to antagonism and conflict between the bodhisattva and śrāvaka ideals. The sequence of terms then began with the term ''Bodhisattvayāna'' "bodhisattva-vehicle", which was given the epithet Mahāyāna "Great Vehicle". It was only later, after attitudes toward the bodhisattva teachings had become more critical, that the term Hīnayāna was created as a back-formation, contrasting with the already established term Mahāyāna.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term Mahāyāna as an epithet and synonym for Bodhisattvayāna, but the term Hīnayāna is comparatively rare in early texts, and is usually not found at all in the earliest translations. Therefore, the often-perceived symmetry between Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna can be deceptive, as the terms were not actually coined in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], "the deep-rooted misconception concerning an unfailing, ubiquitous fierce criticism of the Lesser Vehicle by the [Mahāyāna] is not supported by our texts."&lt;ref name="Williams, Jane 2004. p. 43"&gt;Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 3.'' 2004. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Williams states that while evidence of conflict is present in some cases, there is also substantial evidence demonstrating peaceful coexistence between the two traditions.&lt;ref name="Williams, Jane 2004. p. 43"/&gt;

==Mahāyāna members of the early Buddhist schools==
Although the 18–20 [[early Buddhist schools]] are sometimes loosely classified as Hīnayāna in modern times, this is not necessarily accurate. There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school of Buddhism but rather as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]] has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]]s and [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]]s adhering to the Mahāyāna formally adheres to the vinaya of an early school. This continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] ordination lineage in East Asia and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] ordination lineage in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mahāyāna was never a separate sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] wrote about the relationship between the various "vehicles" and the early Buddhist schools in India. He wrote, "There exist in the West numerous subdivisions of the schools which have different origins, but there are only four principal schools of continuous tradition." These schools are the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Nikāya, [[Sthavira nikāya]], Mūlasarvāstivāda Nikāya, and [[Saṃmitīya]] Nikāya.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining their doctrinal affiliations, he then writes, "Which of the four schools should be grouped with the Mahāyāna or with the Hīnayāna is not determined." That is to say, there was no simple correspondence between a Buddhist school and whether its members learn "Hīnayāna" or "Mahāyāna" teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

To identify entire schools as "Hīnayāna" that contained not only śrāvakas and [[pratyekabuddha]]s but also Mahāyāna bodhisattvas would be attacking the schools of their fellow Mahāyānists as well as their own. Instead, what is demonstrated in the definition of ''Hīnayāna'' given by Yijing is that the term referred to individuals based on doctrinal differences.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2008 p. 5"/&gt;

==Hīnayāna as Śrāvakayāna==

Scholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although "the Mahāyāna ... very occasionally referred  to earlier Buddhism as the Hinayāna, the Inferior Way, [...] the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts." She notes that the term [[Śrāvakayāna]] was "the more politically correct and much more usual" term used by Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, "Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm," D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 72&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Silk has argued that the term "Hinayana" was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A Silk. What, if anything, is Mahayana Buddhism? Numen 49:4 (2002):335-405. Article reprinted in Williams, ''Buddhism, Vol III'', Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hīnayāna and Theravāda==

===Views of Chinese pilgrims===
In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] describes the concurrent existence of the [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihara]] and the [[Abhayagiri vihāra]] in Sri Lanka. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the "Hīnayāna Sthaviras" and the monks of Abhayagiri vihāra as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang further writes, "The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical differences===
Mahayanists were primarily in philosophical dialectic with the [[Vaibhāṣika]] school of [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], which had by far the most "comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics" of the nikāya schools.&lt;ref&gt;""one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs". . . "Indeed, no other competing schools have ever come close to building up such a comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics as the Vaibhāśika." ''The Sautrantika theory of seeds (bija) revisited: With special reference to the ideological continuity between Vasubandhu's theory of seeds and its Srilata/Darstantika precedents'' by Park, Changhwan, PhD, University of California, Berkeley, 2007 pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind it is sometimes argued that the Theravada would not have been considered a "Hinayana" school by Mahayanists because, unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada]] school, the primary object of Mahayana criticism, the Theravada school does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]; in this it maintains the attitude of [[early Buddhism]]. Additionally, the concept of the bodhisattva as one who puts off enlightenment rather than reaching awakening as soon as possible, has no roots in Theravada textual or cultural contexts, current or historical. Aside from the Theravada schools being geographically distant from the Mahayana, the Hinayana distinction is used in reference to certain views and practices that had become found within the Mahayana tradition itself. Theravada, as well as Mahayana schools stress the urgency of one's own awakening in order to end suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Hoffman and Deegalle Mahinda, ''Pāli Buddhism.''

The Mahayanists were bothered by the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrāntika|Sautrāntikins]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[śūnyatā]], David Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravadins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikins (and followers of other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravada arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinions of scholars===
Most western scholars regard the Theravada school to be one of the Hinayana schools referred to in Mahayana literature, or regard Hinayana as a synonym for Theravada.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism in Its Connexion with Brāhmanism and Hindūism: And in Its Contrast with Christianity|author=Monier-Williams, M.|date=1889|publisher=John Murray|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis. 1988.

'''History of Hinduism''' denotes a wide variety of related [[Hindu denominations|religious traditions]] native to the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Brodd|2003}} Its history overlaps or coincides with the development of religion in Indian subcontinent since the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]], with some of its traditions tracing back to [[prehistoric religion]]s such as those of the Bronze Age [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It has thus been called the "[[oldest religion]]" in the world.{{refn|group=note|See:

** Turner: "It is also recognized as the oldest major religion in the world"{{sfn|Turner|1996-B|p=359}}
Smart, on the other hand, calls it also one of the youngest religions: "Hinduism could be seen to be much more recent, though with various ancient roots: in a sense it was formed in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century."{{sfn|Smart|1993|p=1}} See also:

The history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley Civilisation and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE. This period was followed in northern India by the Vedic period, which saw the introduction of the [[historical Vedic religion]] with the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]], starting somewhere between 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=32-36}}{{refn|group=note|There is no exact dating possible for the beginning of the Vedic period. Witzel mentions a range between 1900 and 1400 BCE.{{sfn|Witzel|1995|p=3-4}} Flood mentions 1500 BCE.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=21}}}} The subsequent period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is "a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} and a formative period for Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from c. 200 BCE to 500 CE, saw the classical "Golden Age" of Hinduism (c. 320-650 CE), which coincides with the [[Gupta Empire]]. In this period the six branches of [[Hindu philosophy]] evolved, namely [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta]]. Monotheistic sects like [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] developed during this same period through the [[Bhakti movement]]. The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late Classical period{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} or early Middle Ages, in which classical Puranic Hinduism is established, and [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]], which incorporated Buddhist thought into Vedanta, marking a shift from realistic to idealistic thought.

Hinduism under both Hindu and [[Islamic rulers in South Asia|Islamic]] rulers from c. 1200 to 1750 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell's History of India; Stein 2010, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some Aspects of Muslim Administration, Dr. R.P.Tripathi, 1956, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement, which remains influential today. The [[Colonial India|colonial period]] saw the emergence of various [[Hindu reform movements]] partly inspired by western movements, such as [[Unitarianism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. The [[Partition of India]] in 1947 was along religious lines, with the [[India|Republic of India]] emerging with a Hindu majority. During the 20th century, due to the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the [[Hinduism in the United States|United States]] and the [[Hinduism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

In this process the rude, barbaric Aryan tribes were gradually civilised and eventually merged with the autochthonous Dravidians. Although elements of their domestic cult and ritualism were jealously preserved by Brahman priests, the body of their culture survived only in fragmentary tales and allegories embedded in vast, syncretistic compendia. On the whole, the Aryan contribution to Indian culture is insignificant. The essential pattern of Indian culture was already established in the third millennium B.C., and ... the form of Indian civilization perdured and eventually reasserted itself ({{harvnb|Sjoberg|1990|p=43}}).}}

They mixed with people who spoke Munda or Dravidian languages, who have left no traces of their culture beyond some archaeological remains; we know as little about them as we would about the Indo-Aryans if they had left no texts. In fact we cannot even be sure whether some of the archaeological finds belong to Indo-Aryans, autochthonous populations, or a mixture.{{paragraph break}} It is to be assumed - though this is not fashionable in Indian historiography - that the clash of cultures between Indo-Aryans and autochtones was responsible for many of the changes in Indo-Aryan society.

After the Vedic period, between 500{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}-200{{sfn|Larson|2009}} BCE and c. 300 CE,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}} at the beginning of the "Epic and Puranic" c.q.

Similarly, the worship of many goddesses who are now regarded as the consorts of the great male Hindu gods, as well as the worship of individual unmarried goddesses, may have arisen from the worship of non-Vedic local goddesses.

Thus whereas [[Visnu]] came to subsume the cults of [[Narayana]], [[Jagannatha]], [[Venkateswara]] and many others, [[Shiva|Siva]] became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of ''Isa'' or ''Isvara''to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara."}} and the process of [[Sanskritization]], in which "people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms".&lt;ref group=web name="EBHinbduism6"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266312/Hinduism/8975/Other-sources-the-process-of-Sanskritization Wendy Doniger, ''"Other sources: the process of "Sanskritization"'', Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Sanskritization"|Wendy Doniger: "The process, sometimes called "Sanskritization," began in Vedic times and was probably the principal method by which the Hinduism of the Sanskrit texts spread through the subcontinent and into Southeast Asia.

==Periodisation==
{{see also|Outline of South Asian history}}
{{History of South Asia}}

[[James Mill]] (1773–1836), in his ''[[The History of British India]]'' (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into "ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods", although this periodization has also received criticism.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19-20}}

Romila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to "ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,"{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on "significant social and economic changes," which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|See also Tanvir Anjum, ''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History Temporal Divides: A Critical Review of the Major Schemes of Periodization in Indian History]''.}}

Smart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the "ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:{{sfn|Michaels|2004}}
* Pre-history and Indus Valley Civilisation (until c. 1750 BCE);
* Vedic period (c. 1750-500 BCE);
* "Second Urbanisation" (c. 600-200 BCE);
* Classical Period (c. 200 BCE-1200 CE);{{refn|group=note|Different periods are designated as "classical Hinduism": 
* {{harvtxt|Smart|2003|p=52}} calls the period between 1000 BCE and 100 CE "pre-classical".

For Smart, the "classical period" lasts from 100 to 1000 CE, and coincides with the flowering of "classical Hinduism" and the flowering and deterioration of Mahayana-buddhism in India. 
* For {{harvtxt|Michaels|2004|pp=36, 38}}, the period between 500 BCE and 200 BCE is a time of "Ascetic reformism", whereas the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE is the time of "classical Hinduism", since there is "a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions". 
* {{harvtxt|Muesse|2003|p=14}} discerns a longer period of change, namely between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, which he calls the "Classical Period". According to Muesse, some of the fundamental concepts of Hinduism, namely karma, reincarnation and "personal enlightenment and transformation", which did not exist in the Vedic religion, developed in this time.
* {{harvtxt|Stein|2010|p=107}} The Indian History Congress, formally adopted 1206 CE as the date medieval India began.}}
:* Pre-classical period (c. 200 BCE-300 CE);
:* "Golden Age" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320-650 CE);
:* Late-Classical period (c. 650-1200 CE);
* Medieval Period (c. 1200-1500 CE);
* Early Modern Period (c. 1500-1850);
* Modern period (British Raj and independence) (from c. 1850).

Smart{{efn|Smart 2003, p.52-53}} and Michaels{{efn|Michaels 2004, p.32}} seem to follow Mill's periodisation (Michaels mentions Flood 1996 as a source for "Prevedic Religions".{{efn|Michaels 2004, p. 31, 348}}), while Flood{{efn|Flood 1996}} and Muesse{{efn|Muesse 2003}}{{efn|Muesse 2011}} follow the "ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods" periodisation.{{efn|Muesse 2011, p.16}}

Different periods are designated as "classical Hinduism": 
* Smart calls the period between 1000 BCE and 100 CE "pre-classical". It's the formative period for the Upanishads and Brahmanism (Smart distinguishes "Brahmanism" from the Vedic religion, connecting  "Brahmanism" with the Upanishads.{{efn|Smart 2003, p. 52, 83-86}}), Jainism and Buddhism.

==Prevedic religions (until c. 1750 BCE)==

===Prehistory===

The earliest [[prehistoric religion]] in India that may have left its traces in Hinduism comes from mesolithic as observed in the sites such as the rock paintings of [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older,{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Doniger|2010|p=66}}: "Much of what we now call Hinduism may have had roots in cultures that thrived in South Asia long before the creation of textual evidence that we can decipher with any confidence. Remarkable cave paintings have been preserved from Mesolithic sites dating from c. 30,000 BCE in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters|Bhimbetka]], near present-day Bhopal, in the Vindhya Mountains in the province of Madhya Pradesh."}} as well as neolithic times.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xvii}}: "Some practices of Hinduism must have originated in Neolithic times (c. 4,000 BCE). The worship of certain plants and animals as sacred, for instance, could very likely have very great antiquity. The worship of goddesses, too, a part of Hinduism today, may be a feature that originated in the Neolithic."}} Some of the religious practices can be considered to have originated in 4,000 BCE. Several [[Tribal religions in India|tribal religions]] still exist, though "[w]e must not assume that there are many similarities between prehistoric and contemporary tribal communities".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/india/tribal.html PHILTAR, Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria, ''Tribal Religions of India'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1700 BCE)===

{{further|Prehistoric religion|History of Jainism}}

Some Indus valley seals show [[swastika]]s, which are found in other religions worldwide. Phallic symbols interpreted as the much later Hindu [[lingam|linga]] have been found in the Harappan remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basham|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Plants of life, plants of death| author = Frederick J.

[[File:IndusValleySeals swastikas.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Swastika]] Seals from the Indus Valley Civilization preserved at the [[British Museum]]]] Many Indus valley seals show animals. One seal shows a horned figure seated in a posture reminiscent of the [[Lotus position]] and surrounded by animals was named by early excavators "[[Pashupati]]", an epithet of the later Hindu gods [[Shiva]] and [[Rudra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

Schweig| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1997, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan]] said, "Not too many recent studies continue to call the seal's figure a "Proto-Siva," rejecting thereby Marshall's package of proto-Shiva features, including that of three heads. She interprets what [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Srinivasan|first=Doris Meth|title=Many Heads, Arms and Eyes: Origin, Meaning and Form in Multiplicity in Indian Art|year=1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004107588}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], symbols 47 and 48 of his Indus script glossary ''The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables'' (1977), representing seated human-like figures, could describe the South Indian deity [[Murugan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan |first=Iravatham |title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery |year=2006 |publisher=harappa.com |url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html |archivedate=4 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the large number of figurines found in the Indus valley, some scholars believe that the Harappan people worshipped a [[mother goddess]] symbolizing fertility, a common practice among rural Hindus even today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Search of the Cradle of Civilization:New Light on Ancient India|last=Feuerstein|first=Georg|last2=Kak|first2=Subhash|last3=Frawley|first3=David|publisher=Quest Books|year=2001|page=121|isbn=0-8356-0741-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this view has been disputed by S. Clark who sees it as an inadequate explanation of the function and construction of many of the figurines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sharri R.|last=Clark|title=The social lives of figurines: recontextualizing the third millennium BC terracotta figurines from Harappa, Pakistan|publisher=Harvard PhD|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there were temples, they have not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Thapar, Romila, Early India: From the Origins to 1300, London, Penguin Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, House - 1 in HR-A area in Mohenjadaro's Lower Town has been identified as a possible temple.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Jane. (2008) The Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectives. ABC-CLIO.  Page 84,276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic period (c. 1750–500 BCE)==
{{Main article|Vedic period|Vedic Civilisation|Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Sanskrit}}
{{Further|Iron Age India}}

The commonly proposed period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of India|author=Pletcher, Kenneth|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|page=60|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedism]] was the sacrificial religion of the early [[Indo-Aryans]], speakers of early [[Old Indic]] dialects, ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] peoples of the Bronze Age who lived on the Central Asian steppes.{{refn|group=note|{{harvnb|Mallory|1989|p=38f}}. The separation of the early Indo-Aryans from the Proto-Indo-Iranian stage is dated to roughly 1800 BCE in scholarship.}}

For example, the Vedic god [[Dyaus Pita]] is a variant of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] god [[Dyeus|*Dyēus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ter]] (or simply *Dyēus), from which also derive the Greek [[Zeus]] and the Roman [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Similarly the Vedic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] and [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] derive from the PIE *Manu and *Yemo, from which also derive the Germanic [[Mannus]] and [[Ymir]].

According to the [[Indo-European migration]] theory, the [[Indo-Iranians]] were the common ancestor of the Indo-Aryans and the [[Proto-Iranian language|Proto-Iranians]]. The Indo-Iranians split into the Indo-Aryans and Iranians around 1800-1600 BC.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}}

====Vedas====
Its liturgy is preserved in the three [[Vedas|Vedic Samhitas]]: the [[Rig-Veda]], [[Sama-Veda]] and the [[Yajur-Veda]]. The Vedic texts were the texts of the elite, and do not necessarily represent popular ideas or practices.{{sfn|Singh|2008|p=184}} Of these, the Rig-Veda is the oldest, a collection of hymns composed between ca. 1500-1200 BCE.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=37}}{{sfn|Witzel|1995|p=4}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}} The other two add ceremonial detail for the performance of the actual sacrifice. The [[Atharva-Veda]] may also contain compositions dating to before 1000 BCE. It contains material pertinent to domestic ritual and [[folk magic]] of the period.

These texts, as well as the voluminous commentary on orthopraxy collected in the [[Brahmanas]] compiled during the early 1st millennium BCE,  were transmitted by [[oral tradition]] alone until the advent, in the 4th century AD, of the [[Pallava]] and [[Gupta]] period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.

The Hindu samskaras
{{quote|...go back to a hoary antiquity. The Vedas, the Brahmanas, the Grhyasutras, the Dharmasutras, the Smritis and other treatises describe the rites, ceremonies and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, Rajbali, "Hindu Samskaras" (Motilal Banarasidass Publ., 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest text of the [[Vedas]] is the [[Rigveda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Mary Pat|title=Living Religions (7th edition)|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of  [[Vedic priesthood]]. Many Rigvedic hymns concern the [[fire worship|fire ritual]] ([[Agnihotra]]) and especially the offering of [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] to the gods ([[Somayajna]]). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, [[Agni]]. The royal [[horse sacrifice]] ([[Ashvamedha]]) is a central rite in the [[Yajurveda]].

The [[Rigvedic deities|gods in the Rig-Veda]] are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s – who were gods of nature – such as the weather deity [[Indra]] (who is also the King of the gods), [[Agni]] ("fire"), [[Usha (goddess)|Usha]] ("dawn"), [[Surya]]  ("sun") and Apas ("waters") on the one hand, and on the other hand the [[asura]]s – gods of moral concepts – such as [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] ("contract"),  [[Aryaman]] (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), [[Bhaga]] ("share") or [[Varuna]], the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic ''deva'' is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterised as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.

The Rigveda has 10 Mandalas ('books'). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2–7), [[Mandala 8|book 8]], the "Soma Mandala" ([[Mandala 9|RV 9]]), and the more recent books [[Mandala 1|1]] and [[Mandala 10|10]]. The older books share many aspects of common [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|common Indo-European traditions]]. Especially [[Mandala 8|RV 8]] has striking similarity to the [[Avesta]],&lt;ref&gt;Indo-Iranian Studies: I by J.C. Tavadia, Vishva Bharati, Santiniketan, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; containing allusions to [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] Flora and Fauna,&lt;ref&gt;(RV 8.5; 8.46; 8.56)&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. to camels (''{{IAST|úṣṭra-}}'' = [[Avestan]] ''uštra''). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (''deva'': Latin ''deus''; ''[[hotar]]'': Germanic ''[[god (word)|god]]''; ''asura'': Germanic ''[[ansuz]]''; ''[[yajna]]'': Greek ''hagios''; ''[[brahman]]'': Norse ''[[Bragi]]'' or perhaps Latin ''[[flamen]]'' etc.). In the [[Avesta]], Asura (Ahura) is considered good and Devas (Daevas) are considered evil entities, quite the opposite of the Rig Veda.

====Cosmic order====
Ethics in the Vedas are based on the concepts of [[Satya]] and [[Rta]]. Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda. Swami. A Short History of Religious and Philosophic Thought in India, Divine Life Society. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ṛta is the expression of Satya, which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.&lt;ref&gt;Holdrege (2004:215)&lt;/ref&gt; Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks: 
{{quote|''Ṛta'' is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is "the supreme", although this is not to be understood in a static sense. [...] It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything...."&lt;ref&gt;Panikkar (2001) 350-351&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "dharma" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, Terence P. (1982). ''The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature''. Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. P. 42-45. {{ISBN|0-919812-15-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term rta is also known from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], the religion of the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian peoples]] prior to the earliest [[Vedas|Vedic]] (Indo-Aryan) and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] (Iranian) scriptures. ''[[Asha]]''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; (''aša'') is the [[Avestan language]] term corresponding to [[Vedic language]] [[rta|ṛta]].{{sfn|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|p=46}}

====Upanishads====

===Brahmanism===
{{Further|Brahmana|Aranyaka|Shrauta Sutra}}

In [[Iron Age India]], during a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BCE, the [[Mahajanapadas]] arise from the earlier petty kingdoms of the various [[Rigvedic tribes]], and the failing remnants of the [[Late Harappan]] culture. In this period the ''mantra'' portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of [[Vedic priesthood]] organised in numerous schools ([[shakha]]) develops exegetical literature, viz. the  [[Brahmanas]]. These schools also edited the Vedic ''mantra'' portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by [[patha|oral tradition]] over the following two millennia.

==Second Urbanisation (c. 600–200 BCE)==

===Upanishads and shramana movements===
{{Main article|Upanishads|Shramana}}

Increasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or sramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA82|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of [[Jainism]], and [[Buddha]] (c. 563-483 BCE), founder of [[Buddhism]], were the most prominent icons of this movement.&lt;ref name="World Religions"/&gt;{{rp|184}}  According to [[Heinrich Zimmer]], Jainism and Buddhism are part of the pre-Vedic heritage, which also includes Samkhya and Yoga:
{{quote|[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India - being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems.{{sfn|Zimmer|1989|p=217}}{{refn|group=note|Zimmer's point of view is supported by other scholars, such as Niniam Smart, in ''Doctrine and argument in Indian Philosophy'', 1964, p.27-32 &amp; p.76, ({{harvnb|Crangle|1994|p=7}}) and S.K. Belvakar &amp; [[Inchegeri Sampradaya|R.D. Ranade]] in ''History of Indian philosophy'', 1974 (1927), p.81 &amp; p.303-409 ({{harvnb|Crangle|1994|p=7}}).}}}}

The Sramana tradition in part created the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of [[samsara]], and the concept of liberation, which became characteristic for Hinduism.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Flood|2008|pp=273–274}}: "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterise later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history [...] Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara - the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana - the goal of human existence."}}

Pratt notes that [[Hermann Oldenberg|Oldenberg]] (1854-1920), [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]] (1865-1915) and [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] (1888-1975) believed that the Buddhist canon had been influenced by Upanishads, while [[Louis de La Vallée-Poussin|la Vallee Poussin]] thinks the influence was nihil, and "Eliot and several others insist that on some points the Buddha was directly antithetical to the Upanishads".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pratt|first=James Bissett|title=The Pilgrimage of Buddhism and a Buddhist Pilgrimage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLXwU9e6D4sC&amp;pg=PA90|year=1996|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1196-2|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|King|1999}} notes that Radhakrishnan was a representative of [[Neo-Vedanta]],{{sfn|King|1999}} which had a specific understanding of Indian religions: "The inclusivist appropriation of other traditions, so characteristic of neo-Vedanta ideology, appears on three basic levels. First, it is apparent in the suggestion that the (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy of Sankara (c. eighth century CE) constitutes the central philosophy of Hinduism. Second, in an Indian context, neo-Vedanta philosophy subsumes Buddhist philosophies in terms of its own Vedantic ideology. The Buddha becomes a member of the Vedanta tradition, merely attempting to reform it from within. Finally, at a global level, neo-Vedanta colonises the religious traditions of the world by arguing for the centrality of a non-dualistic position as the ''philosophia perennis'' underlying all cultural differences."}}

===Survival of Vedic ritual===
{{Main article|Śrauta}}
Vedism as the religious tradition of Hinduism of a priestly elite was marginalised by other traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the [[Mimamsa]] school, which as well as all other ''[[Astika and Nastika|astika]]'' traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless (''[[apaurusheyatva]]'') and eternal. A last surviving elements of the [[Historical Vedic religion]] or Vedism is [[Śrauta]] tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in [[Southern India]], with communities in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], but also in some pockets of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]] and other states; the best known of these groups are the [[Nambudiri]] of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by [[Frits Staal]].&lt;ref&gt;Staal, J.

===Mauryan empire===
{{Main article|Maurya Empire}}

The Mauryan period saw an early flowering of [[classical Sanskrit]] [[Sutra]] and [[Shastra]] literature and the scholarly exposition of the "circum-Vedic" fields of the [[Vedanga]]. However, during this time Buddhism was patronised by [[Ashoka]], who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta empire period.

===Sanskritization===
{{Main article|Sanskritization}}

Since Vedic times, "people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms", a process sometimes called [[Sanskritization]].&lt;ref name="EBHinbduism6"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266312/Hinduism/8975/Other-sources-the-process-of-Sanskritization Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Other sources: the process of "Sanskritization"''.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts.&lt;ref name="EBHinbduism6" /&gt;

====Hindu synthesis====
Between 500{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}-200{{sfn|Larson|2009}} BCE and c. 300 CE developed the "Hindu synthesis",{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Larson|2009}} which incorporated [[Sramana|Sramanic]] and Buddhist influences{{sfn|Larson|2009}}{{sfn|Cousins|2010}} and the emerging ''bhakti'' tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the ''smriti'' literature.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=13}}{{sfn|Larson|2009}} This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=21}}

According to Embree, several other religious traditions had existed side by side with the Vedic religion. These indigenous religions "eventually found a place under the broad mantle of the Vedic religion".{{sfn|Embree|1988|p=277}} When Brahmanism was declining{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Michaels|2004|p=38}}: "At the time of upheaval [500-200 BCE], many elements of the Vedic religion were lost".}} and had to compete with Buddhism and Jainism,{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=13}}: "The emerging self-definitions of Hinduism were forged in the context of continuous interaction with heterodox religions (Buddhists, Jains, Ajivikas) throughout this whole period, and with foreign people (Yavanas, or Greeks; Sakas, or Scythians; Pahlavas, or Parthians; and Kusanas, or Kushans) from the third phase on [between the Mauryan empire and the rise of the Guptas].}} the popular religions had the opportunity to assert themselves.{{sfn|Embree|1988|p=277}} According to Embree, 
{{quote|[T]he Brahmanists themselves seem to have encouraged this development to some extent as a means of meeting the challenge of the heterodox movements. At the same time, among the indigenous religions, a common allegiance to the authority of the Veda provided a thin, but nonetheless significant, thread of unity amid their variety of gods and religious practices.{{sfn|Embree|1988|p=277}}}}

====Smriti====
According to Larson, the Brahmins responded with assimilation and consolidation. This is reflected in the ''smriti'' literature which took shape in this period.{{sfn|Larson|2009|p=185}} The ''[[smriti]]'' texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaim the authority of the [[Vedas]], and acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterium for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=14}} Most of the basic ideas and practices of classical Hinduism derive from the new ''smriti'' literature.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Larson|2009|p=185}}: "[I]n contrast to the ''sruti'', which "Hindus for the most part pay little more than lip service to."}}

Of the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta "are rooted primarily in the Vedic ''sruti'' tradition and are sometimes called ''smarta'' schools in the sense that they develop ''smarta'' orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like ''smriti'', directly on ''sruti''.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}} According to Hiltebeitel, "the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of ''bhakti''".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}} It is the ''Bhagavadgita'' that seals this achievement.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}} The result is an "universal achievement" that may be called ''[[Smarta Tradition|smarta]]''.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}} It views Shiva and Vishnu as "complementary in their functions but ontologically identical".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}}

The major Sanskrit epics, ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which belong to the ''smriti'', were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Itihasas|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/texts/itihasas.htm|publisher=ReligionFacts|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about [[deva (Hinduism)|devas and devis]], their interactions with humans and their battles against [[rakshasa]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] "seals the achievement"{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=20}} of the "consolidation of Hinduism",{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=20}} integrating Brahmanic and sramanic ideas with theistic devotion.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2007|p=20}}{{sfn|Scheepers|2000}}{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=211}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-BG"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266312/Hinduism/59830/The-Bhagavadgita Arthur Llewellyn Basham, ''Hinduism - The Bhagavad Gita'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schools of Hindu philosophy====
In early centuries CE several schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] were formally codified, including [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Purva-Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="Radhaxviii-xxi"&gt;{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1967|p=xviii–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sangam literature====
The Sangam literature (300 BCE – 300 CE) is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the [[Tamil language]]. Nonetheless there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to god was written in form of devotional poems. [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] and [[Murugan]] were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidences of monotheistic [[Bhakti]] traditions, preceding the large [[bhakti movement]], which was given great attention in later times.

==="Golden Age" (Gupta and Pallava period) (c. 320-650 CE)===

During this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of near distance trade, standardization of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty,{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=687}} who were Vaishnavas.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=325}} The position of the Brahmans was reinforced,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} the first Hindu temples dedicated to the gods of the [[Hindu deities]], emerged during the late Gupta age.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Michaels|2004|p=40}} mentions the [[Durga temple, Aihole|Durga temple in Aihole]] and the [[Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh|Visnu Temple in Deogarh]]. {{harvtxt|Michell|1977|p=18}} notes that earlier temples were built of timber, brick and plaster, while the first stone temples appeared during the period of Gupta rule.}} During the Gupta reign the first [[Puranas]] were written,{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=19}}{{refn|group=note|name="Puranas-date"}} which were used to disseminate "mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation."{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=19}} The Guptas patronised the newly emerging Puranic religion, seeking legitimacy for their dynasty.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=325}} The resulting Puranic Hinduism, differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmasastras and the ''smritis''.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=19}}

According to P.S. Sharma "the Gupta and Harsha periods form really, from the strictly intellectual standpoint, the most brilliant epocha in the development of Indian philosophy", as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sharma |first=Peri Sarveswara |year=1980 | page= 5| title=Anthology of Kumārilabhaṭṭa's Works |publisher=Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charvaka]], the atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in [[North India]] before the 8th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya|first=Ramkrishna|title=Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59eygxzQTWQC|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Anthem Press|page=65|isbn=978-0-85728-433-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gupta and Pallava Empires====
{{Main article|Pallava|Gupta Empire}}

The [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], and of classical [[Sanskrit literature]] in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous [[Aryabhata]] and [[Varahamihira]] belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.

The [[Pallava]]s (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the [[Gupta]]s of the [[North India|North]], patronisers of Sanskrit in the [[South India|South]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called [[Grantha script|Grantha]]. Early Pallavas had different connexions to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in [[Mamallapuram]], [[Kanchipuram]] and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as [[Kalidasa]].

The practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic [[Hindu temple architecture|temple architecture]] and sculpture (see [[Vastu Shastra]]).

====Bhakti====
This period saw the emergence of the [[Bhakti movement]]. The Bhakti movement was a rapid growth of ''bhakti'' beginning in [[Tamil Nadu]] in Southern India with the Saiva [[Nayanars]] (4th to 10th centuries CE)&lt;ref name="Embree"&gt;{{cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas|author2=Stephen N.

====Expansion in South-East Asia====
{{Further|Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Sanskritisation|Greater India}}
[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]
Hindu influences reached the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] as early as first century.&lt;ref name=jgonda&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 3 Southeast Asia, Religions|page=1}}, pp. 1-54&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]] and numerous urbanised coastal settlements were established there.

For more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] epics.

From the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Hindu and Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence.

[[Langkasuka]] (-''langkha'' [[Sanskrit]] for "resplendent land" -''sukkha'' of "bliss") was an ancient Hindu kingdom located in the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The kingdom, along with [[Old Kedah]] settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century; [[Malay people|Malay]] legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at [[Kedah]], and later moved to [[Pattani province|Pattani]].

From the 5th-15th centuries [[Sri Vijaya|Sri Vijayan empire]], a maritime empire centred on the island of [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]], had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]s. The Empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India. The [[Majapahit Empire]] succeeded the [[Singhasari]] empire.  It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

[[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] was a pre-[[Angkor]] [[Cambodia]]n kingdom, located around the [[Mekong]] delta, probably established by [[Mon-Khmer]] settlers speaking an [[Austroasiatic]] language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, [[K'ang T'ai]] and [[Chu Ying]], the state was established by an Indian [[Brahmin]] named [[Kaundinya]], who in the 1st century CE was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, [[Soma (queen)|Soma]]. Soma, the daughter of the king of the [[Nagas (people)|Nagas]], married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.

The kingdom of [[Champa]] (or ''Lin-yi'' in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central [[Vietnam]] from approximately 192 through 1697. The dominant religion of the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] was [[Hinduism]] and the culture was heavily influenced by India.

Later, from the 9th to the 13th century, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. [[Angkor]] was at the centre of this development, with a temple complex and urban organisation able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world, Angkor Wat, stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan.

===Late-Classical Hinduism - Puranic Hinduism (c. 650-1200 CE)===
:''See also [[History of India#Late Middle Kingdoms - The Late-Classical Age|Late-Classical Age]].''

After the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with "countless vasal states".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Michaels|2004|p=41}}: 
*In the east the [[Pala Empire]] (770–1125 CE), 
*in the west and north the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] (7th–10th century), 
*in the southwest the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] (752–973), 
*in the Dekkhan the [[Chalukya dynasty]] (7th–8th century), 
*and in the south the [[Pallava dynasty]] (7th–9th century) and the [[Chola dynasty]] (9th century).}} The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. "The great king was remote, was exalted and deified",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} as reflected in the [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Mandala]], which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.{{sfn|White|2000|p=25-28}}

The disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|McRae|2003}}: This resembles the development of [[Chinese Chán]] during the [[Chinese Chán#An Lu-shan rebellion|An Lu-shan rebellion]] and the [[Chinese Chán#Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)]], during which power became decentralised end new Chán-schools emerged.}} Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of "Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} was diminished.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Rural and devotional movements arose, along with [[Shaivism]], [[Vaisnavism]], [[Bhakti]] and [[Tantra]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} though "sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Buddhism lost its position after the 8th century, and began to disappear in India.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} This was reflected in the change of puja-ceremonies at the courts in the 8th century, where Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as the "supreme, imperial deity".{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Inden|1998|p=67}}: "Before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa [...] This pattern changed in the eighth century.

====Puranic Hinduism====
{{Further|Puranas}}

The Brahmanism of the [[Dharmashastras]] and the ''smritis'' underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of Puranic Hinduism,{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=19}} "which like a colossus striding across the religious firmanent soon came to overshadow all existing religions".{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=20}} Puranic Hinduism was a "multiplex belief-system which grew and expanded as it absorbed and synthesised polaristic ideas and cultic traditions"{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=20}} It was distinguished from its Vedic Smarta roots by its popular base, its theological and sectarioan pluralism, its Tantric veneer, and the central place of ''bhakti''.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|name="Michaels-legacy"}}

The early mediaeval [[Purana]]s were composed to disseminate religious mainstream ideology among the pre-literate [[Adivasi|tribal societies]] undergoing [[acculturation]].{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=19}} With the breakdown of the Gupta empire, gifts of virgin waste-land were heaped on brahmanas,{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}}{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=325, 487}} to ensure provitable agrarical exploitation of land owned by the kings,{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} but also to provide status to the new ruling classes.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} Brahmanas spread further over India, interacting with local clans with different religions and ideologies.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} The Brahmanas used the Puranas to incorporate those clans into the agrarical society and its accompanying religion and ideology.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} According to Flood, "[t]he Brahmans who followed the puranic religion became known as ''[[Smarta Tradition|smarta]]'', those whose worship was based on the ''smriti'', or ''[[Katha (storytelling format)|pauranika]]'', those based on the Puranas."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=113}} Local chiefs and peasants were absorbed into the [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]], which was used to keep "control over the new ''kshatriyas'' and ''shudras''."{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=487}} The Brahmanic group was enlarged by incorporating local subgroups, such as local priests.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} This also lead to a stratification within the Brahmins, with some Brahmins having a lower status than other Brahmins.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}} The use of caste worked better with the new Puranic Hinduism than with the sramanic sects.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=487}} The Puranic texts provided extensive genealogies which gave status to the new ''kshatriyas''.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=487}} Buddhist myths pictured government as a contract between an elected ruler and the people.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=487}} And the Buddhist ''chakkavatti''{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Thapar|2003|p=325}}: The king who ruled not by conquest but by setting in motion the wheel of law.}} "was a distinct concept from the models of conquest held up to the ''kshatriyas'' and the Rajputs."{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=487}}

Many local religions and traditions were assimilated into puranic Hinduism. Vishnu and Shiva emerged as the main deities, together with Sakti/Deva.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=31}} Vishnu subsumed the cults of [[Narayana]], [[Jagannath]]s, [[Venkateswara]] "and many others".{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=31}} Nath:
{{quote|[S]ome incarnations of Vishnu such as Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and perhaps even Nrsimha helped to incorporate certain popular totem symbols and creation myths, specially those related to wild boar, which commonly permeate preliterate mythology, others such as Krsna and Balarama became instrumental in assimilating local cults and myths centering around two popular pastoral and agricultural gods.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=31-32}}}}

The transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post-[[Gupta period|Gupta]] India was due to a process of [[acculturation]]. The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanism and of the [[Dharmashastras]] underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream "Hinduism" that overshadowed all earlier traditions.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001}}

====Bhakti movement====
{{Main article|Bhakti movement}}
{{See also|Tulsidas|Kabir|Mirabai|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu}}

Rama and Krishna became the focus of a strong ''bhakti'' tradition, which found expression particularly in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''. The Krishna tradition subsumed numerous Naga, yaksa and hill and tree based cults.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=32}} Siva absorbed local cults by the suffixing of ''Isa'' or ''Isvara'' to the name of the local deity, for example Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara.{{sfn|Vijay Nath|2001|p=31}} In 8th-century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas.{{refn|group=note|name="Inden"|Inden: "before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa....This pattern changed in the eighth century.

"Ritual, Authority, And Cycle Time in Hindu Kingship." In JF Richards, ed., ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998, p.67, 55&lt;/ref&gt;}} This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''The Buddhist Visnu''. Columbia University Press, 2004, p.12,15 "The replacement of the Buddha as the "cosmic person" within the mythic ideology of Indian kingship, as we shall see shortly, occurred at about the same time the Buddha was incorporated and subordinated within the Brahmanical cult of Visnu."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented bhakti movement was founded by [[Karaikkal-ammaiyar]]. She wrote poems in  [[Tamil language|Tamil]] about her love for [[Shiva]] and probably lived around the 6th century CE. The twelve [[Alvars]] who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three [[Nayanars]]  who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in [[Tamil Nadu]].

During the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the [[Virashaiva]] movement. It was inspired by [[Basavanna]], a Hindu reformer who created the sect of [[Lingayats]] or [[Shiva]] ''bhaktas''. During this time, a unique and native form of [[Kannada]] literature-poetry called [[Vachanas]] was born.

====Advaita Vedanta====
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Adi Shankara}}

Shankara (8th century CE) is regarded as the greatest exponent of Advaita Vedanta.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Shankara himself, and his grand-teacher [[Gaudapada]], were influenced by Buddhism.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=60-64}}{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177-178}}{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} Gaudapda took over the Buddhist doctrines that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]]{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation".{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} Gaudapada "wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', which was further developed by Shankara".{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177-178}} Gaudapada also took over the Buddhist concept of [[Ajativada|"ajāta"]] from [[Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna's]] [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} Shankara succeeded in reading Gaudapada's ''mayavada''{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|name=mayavada|The term "mayavada" is still being used, in a critical way, by the Hare Krshnas.

Shankara is also regarded as the greatest teacher{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} and reformer of the [[Smartha Tradition]].{{sfn|Roosen|2006|p=166}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} According to Hinduism-guide.com:
{{quote|Not all Brahmins specialized in this Smriti tradition. Some were influenced by Buddhism, Jainism or Charvaka tradition and philosophy. This did not mean that all these people rejected the authority of Vedas, but only that their tradition of worship and philosophy was based not on smriti texts. In time, Shankaracharya brought all the Vedic communities together. He tried to remove the non-smriti aspects that had crept into the Hindu communities. He also endeavoured to unite them by arguing that any of the different Hindu gods could be worshipped, according to the prescriptions given in the smriti texts. He established that worship of various deities are compatible with Vedas and is not contradictory, since all are different manifestations of one [[nirguna Brahman]].

==== Contact with Persia and Mesopotamia ====
Hindu and also [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious and secular learning had first reached [[Greater Persia|Persia]] in an organised manner in the 6th century, when the [[Sassanid]] Emperor [[Khosrau I]] (531–579) deputed [[Burzoe|Borzuya the physician]] as his envoy, to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to the [[Academy of Gundishapur]]. Burzoe had translated the Sanskrit [[Panchatantra]]. His Pahlavi version was translated into Arabic by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Moqaffa]] under the title of  ''[[Kalila and Dimna]]'' or ''The Fables of Bidpai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francisco Rodríguez Adrados|author-link1=Francisco Rodríguez Adrados|author2=Lukas de Blois|author3=Gert-Jan van Dijk|title=Mnemosyne, Bibliotheca Classica Batava: Supplementum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=093Gl8KEktMC&amp;pg=PA707|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11454-8|pages=707–708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, [[Baghdad]] had replaced [[Gundishapur]] as the most important centre of learning in the then vast [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]], wherein the traditions as well as scholars of the latter flourished. Hindu scholars were invited to the conferences on sciences and mathematics held in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Malley|first=Charles Donald|title=The History of Medical Education: An International Symposium Held February 5-9, 1968|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afYzWG1FLroC&amp;pg=PA352|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01578-4|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Islam came to Indian subcontinent in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders, it started impacting Indian religions after the 10th century, and particularly after the 12th century with the establishment and then expansion of [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic rule]].&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|0-19-563921-9}}"&gt;{{Harvnb|Basham|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent A.

It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within. The Hindus had allowed their strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted religions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of their frontiers and their capitals."&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Buddhism declined rapidly while Hinduism faced military-led and Sultanates-sponsored religious violence.&lt;ref name=willdurant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaborieau|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a widespread practice of raids, seizure and enslavement of families of Hindus, who were then sold in Sultanate cities or exported to Central Asia.&lt;ref name=richardeaton&gt;Richard M.

===Unifying Hinduism===
Hinduism underwent profound changes, aided in part by teachers such as [[Ramanuja]], [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]].&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|0-19-563921-9}}"/&gt; Followers of the [[Bhakti movement]] moved away from the abstract concept of [[Brahman]], which the philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible [[Avatar]]s, especially Krishna and Rama.&lt;ref name="JordensISBN 0-19-563921-9"&gt;J.T.F. Jordens, "Medieval Hindu Devotionalism" in {{Harvnb||Basham|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th century, "certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy."{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions"  has also been noted by {{harvtxt|Burley|2007|p=34}}. Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus ({{harvnb|Lorenzen|2006|pp=24–33}}), and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other" which started well before 1800 ({{harvnb|Lorenzen|2006|pp=26–27}}). Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term "Hinduism" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers ({{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|p=2}})}} Michaels notes that a historicization emerged which preceded later nationalism, articulating ideas which glorified Hinduism and the past.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=44}}

===Early Modern period (c. 1500-1850 CE)===
The fall of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. But, taking advantage of an over-stretched [[Mughal Empire]] (1526–1857), Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the [[Maratha Empire]], from 1674 to 1818.

====Mughal Empire====
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|The Mughal Empire]]
{{Further|Mughal period|Indo-Persian culture}}

After the conquest of Persia by the [[Mongol Empire]], a regional Turko-Persio-Mongol dynasty formed. Just as eastern Mongol dynasties inter-married with locals and adopted the local religion of [[Buddhism]] and the [[Chinese culture]], this group adopted the local religion of [[Islam]] and the [[Persian culture]]; their descendants ruled in India as [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s.

The official State religion of the Mughal Empire was [[Islam]], with the preference to the [[jurisprudence]] of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab|Madhhab]] (Mazhab). Hinduism remained under strain during Babur and Humanyun's reigns. Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of North India was comparatively non-repressive. Hinduism came to fore during the three-year rule of Hindu king '[[Hemu]]' during 1553-56 when he had defeated Akbar at Agra and Delhi and had taken up the reign from Delhi as a Hindu 'Vikramaditya' king after his 'Rajyabhishake' or [[coronation]] at '[[Purana Quila]]' in Delhi. However, during Mughal history, at times, subjects had freedom to practise any religion of their choice, though non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the [[Jizya]], which signified their status as [[Dhimmis]].
[[Image:Sun temple martand indogreek.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the Surya Temple, The most impressive and grandest ruins in Kashmir, at Marttand-Hardy Cole's Archaeological Survey of India Report 'Illustrations of Ancient Buildings in Kashmir.' (1869)]]
[[Akbar]], the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]]'s son and heir from his [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor [[Akbar]]'s most unusual ideas regarding religion was [[Din-i-Ilahi]] (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of [[Islam]], [[Zoroastrianism]], Hinduism, [[Jainism]] and [[Christianity]]. It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions however met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the [[Sufi]] Shaykh Alf Sani [[Ahmad Sirhindi]]. Akbar's abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to [[apostasy]].

Akbar's son, [[Jahangir]], half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a centre-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor [[Shah Jahan]], who was by blood 75% [[Rajput]] and less than 25% [[Moghul]].

Religious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan's son and successor, [[Aurangzeb]], a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent – the [[Sikh]] states of the Punjab, the last independent Hindu [[Rajputs]] and the [[Maratha]] rebels – as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian [[Missionaries]], who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Goa]].

====Maratha Empire====
{{Main article|Maratha Empire}}
[[File:Marathas.GIF|thumb|The last [[Hindu]] empire of India – The [[Maratha Empire]] in 1760.]]
The [[Hindu]] Marathas long had lived in the [[Desh, Maharashtra|Desh]] region around [[Satara (city)|Satara]], in the western portion of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the [[Western Ghats]] mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the [[Muslim]] [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers of northern India. Under their ambitious leader [[Shivaji]], the Maratha freed themselves from the [[Muslim]] sultans of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of [[Surat]] in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed 'Chhatrapati' (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji's death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of [[Brahmin]] prime ministers ([[Peshwas]]), the [[Maratha Empire]] reached its zenith; [[Pune]], the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. The empire at its peak stretched from [[Tamil Nadu]]{{sfn|Mehta|2005|p=204}} in the south, to [[Maratha conquest of North-west India|Peshawar]] (modern-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref name="XWiACEwPR8C p.16"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PR22&amp;lpg=PR22&amp;dq=Sailendra+Nath+Sen+baji+rao+1720-40&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kqD8F2ZCF5&amp;sig=UjrO2a19-RelJENaTp3WFNIoQuE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MoiCVYiCG4vl8AWy96xA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Tukoji&amp;f=false An Advanced History of Modern India By Sailendra Nath Sen, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|Many historians consider [[Attock]] to be the final frontier of the Maratha Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bharatiya Itihasa Samiti, Ramesh Chandra Majumdar – ''[[The History and Culture of the Indian People]]: The Maratha supremacy''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2015}}}}) in the north, and [[Maratha expeditions in Bengal|Bengal]] and [[Andaman Islands]] in the east.&lt;ref name="andamanonline.in"&gt;[http://www.andamanonline.in/about/Profile/History/index.html Andaman &amp; Nicobar Origin | Andaman &amp; Nicobar Island History].

In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] to [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]] which halted their imperial expansion into [[Afghanistan]]. Ten years after Panipat, the Peshwa [[Madhavrao I]]'s [[Maratha Resurrection]] reinstated Maratha authority over [[North India]]. In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, he gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, which created a confederacy of Maratha states. They became known as the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda State|Baroda]], the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore State|Indore]] and [[Malwa]], the [[Scindia]]s of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]] and [[Ujjain]], the [[Bhonsale]]s of the [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] and the [[Paramara dynasty|Puars]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]] &amp; [[Dewas State|Dewas]]. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in [[Pune]], which became the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]]. The Marathas remained the preeminent power in India until their defeat in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] which left the East India Company in control of most of India.

====Early colonialism====
{{Further|Christianity in India|Goa Inquisition}}
Portuguese missionaries had reached the [[Malabar Coast]] in the late 15th century, made contact with the [[Saint Thomas Christians|St Thomas Christians]] in [[Kerala]] and sought to introduce the [[Latin Rite]] among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Christian Churches]], they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.

The [[Goa Inquisition]] was the office of the Christian [[Inquisition]] acting in the Indian city of [[Goa]] and the rest of the [[Portuguese empire]] in Asia. [[St. Francis Xavier]], in a 1545 letter to [[John III of Portugal|John III]], requested for an [[Inquisition]] to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552. Established in 1560 and operating until 1774, this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and wayward new converts.

In the century from 1760 to 1860, India was once more divided into numerous petty or unstable kingdoms, gradually coming under the [[British paramountcy|paramountcy]] the [[British Raj|British Empire]]: the "lesser Mughals", the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], [[Hyderabad State]], [[Maratha Confederacy]], [[Rajput Kingdoms]], [[Palaiyakkarar]] states, North-Eastern states such as [[Kingdom of Manipur]], Himalayan states, etc. From 1799 to 1849 the only major stable kingdom in India was the [[Sikh Empire]], although it had a syncretic character with a large number of Hindu and Muslim subjects living in peace. It too became unstable after the death of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. The entire subcontinent fell under [[British India|British rule]] (partly [[indirect rule|indirectly]], via [[List of Indian Princely States|princely states]]) following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

==Modern Hinduism (after c. 1850 CE)==
With the onset of the [[British Raj]], the colonization of India by the British, there also started a [[Bengali renaissance|Hindu renaissance]] in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west.{{sfn|King|2002}} [[Indology]] as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as [[Max Müller]] and [[John Woodroffe]]. They brought [[Vedas|Vedic]], [[Puranic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western [[Orientalism|orientalist]] searched for the "essence" of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas,{{sfn|King|2002|p=118}} and meanwhile creating the notion of "Hinduism" as a unified body of religious praxis{{sfn|King|1999}} and the popular picture of 'mystical India'.{{sfn|King|1999}}{{sfn|King|2002}} This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by [[Hindu reform movements]] as the [[Brahmo Samaj]], which was supported for a while by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian Church]],{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=114}} together with the ideas of [[Universalism in religion|Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], the idea that all religions share a common [[Mysticism|mystic]] ground.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=119-120}} This [[neo-Vedanta|"Hindu modernism"]], with proponents like [[Vivekananda]], [[Aurobindo]] and [[Radhakrishnan]], became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|2002|p=123}}{{sfn|Muesse|2011|p=3-4}}{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=18}}{{sfn|Jouhki|2006|p=10-11}}{{sfn|King|1999}}

[[File:Brit IndianEmpireReligions3.jpg|thumb|'''1909 Prevailing Religions''', Map of British Indian Empire, 1909, showing the prevailing majority religions of the population for different districts.]]

During the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of [[new religious movement]]s, partly inspired by the European [[Romanticism]], [[nationalism]], [[scientific racism]] and [[esotericism]] ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with [[Orientalism]], "[[Hindoo style]]" architecture, reception of [[Buddhism in the West]] and similar). According to Paul Hacker, "the ethcial values of Neo-Hinduism stem from Western philosophy and Christianity, although they are expressed in Hindu terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religions of the Modern World | last=Woodhead | first=Linda |publisher=Routledge |year= |isbn=978-0-415-85881-6 |location=|pages=57, 58| quote=The term 'Neo Hinduism' has been applied to reformed Hinduism by Paul Hacker and others. According to Hacker, the ethcial values of Neo-Hinduism stem from Western philosophy and Christianity, although they are expressed in Hindu terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reform movements are summarised under [[Hindu revivalism]] and continue into the present.
*[[Sahajanand Swami]] establishes the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] sect around 1800.
*[[Brahmo Samaj]] is a social and religious movement founded in [[Kolkata]] in 1828 by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]]. He was one of the first Indians to visit Europe and was influenced by western thought. He died in [[Bristol]], England. The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the Brahmo religion in 1850 founded by [[Debendranath Tagore]] — better known as the father of [[Rabindranath Tagore]].
*[[Sri Ramakrishna]] and his pupil [[Swami Vivekananda]] led a reform in Hinduism in the late 19th century. Their ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Gandhi]], [[Subhas Bose]], [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Megh Nad Saha]], and [[Sister Nivedita]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
*[[Arya Samaj]] ("Society of [[Arya|Nobles]]") is a [[Hindu]] [[reform movement]] in India that was founded by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]] in 1875. He was a [[sannyasin]] (renouncer) who believed in the [[infallible]] [[Moral absolutism|authority]] of the [[Vedas]]. Dayananda advocated the doctrine of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]], and emphasised the ideals of [[brahmacharya]] ([[chastity]]) and [[sanyasa]] ([[Sannyasa|renunciation]]). [[Dayananda]] claimed to be rejecting all non-Vedic beliefs altogether. Hence the Arya Samaj unequivocally condemned [[idolatry]], [[animal sacrifice]]s, [[ancestor worship]], [[pilgrimage]]s, priestcraft, offerings made in [[temple]]s, the [[caste]] system, [[Dalit|untouchability]] and [[child marriage]]s, on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. It aimed to be a universal church based on the authority of the [[Vedas]]. Dayananda stated that he wanted 'to make the whole world Aryan', i.e. he wanted to develop ''[[missionary]]'' Hinduism based on the universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started [[Shuddhi]] movement in the early 20th century to bring back to [[Hinduism]] people converted to [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India. It now has branches around the world and has a disproportional number of adherents among people of Indian ancestry in [[Suriname]] and the Netherlands, in comparison with India.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Reception in the West===
{{main article|Hinduism in the West}}
{{Further|Sanskrit in the West|Esotericism in Germany and Austria|Ramakrishna's impact}}
An important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on [[West]]ern thought and [[new religious movements]]. An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] who in the 1850s advocated ethics based on an  "Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly "Jewish" spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments for the history of philosophy", Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I (1851).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]] moved to India in 1879, and her [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.

The sojourn of [[Vivekananda]] to the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], a Hindu missionary organisation still active today.

In the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include [[Maximiani Portaz]] – an advocate of "Aryan Paganism" – who styled herself ''Savitri Devi'' and [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]], founder of the [[German Faith Movement]]. It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the [[swastika]] became a [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West]] before its association with the [[Nazi Party]] became dominant in the 1930s.

Hinduism-inspired elements in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] were also inherited by the spin-off movements of [[Ariosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]] and ultimately contributed to the renewed [[New Age]] boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term ''New Age'' itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888  ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''.

Influential 20th-century Hindus were [[Ramana Maharshi]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Prabhupada]] (founder of [[ISKCON]]), [[Sri Chinmoy]], [[Swami Rama]] and others who translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, raising the profiles of Yoga and [[Vedanta]] in the West and attracting followers and attention in India and abroad.

== Contemporary Hinduism ==
{{Main article|Contemporary Hindu movements|Hindu denominations|Contemporary Sant Mat movements|List of Hindu organisations|Hinduism by country}}
As of 2007, of an estimated 944 million Hindus, 98.5% live in South Asia. Of the remaining 1.5% or 14 million, 6 million live in Southeast Asia (mostly [[Indonesia]]),  2 million in Europe, 1.8 million in North America, 1.2 million in [[Southern Africa]].

===Indian subcontinent===
Modern Hinduism is the reflection of continuity and progressive changes that occurred in various traditions and institutions of Hinduism during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Its main divisions are into [[Vaishnavism]] (largely influenced by [[Bhakti]]), [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Smartism]] ([[Advaita Vedanta]]).

Besides these traditional denominations, movements of [[Hindu revivalism]] look to founders such as [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]] ([[Arya Samaj]]), [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ramana Maharshi]], [[Aurobindo]], [[Shriram Sharma Acharya]], [[Swami Sivananda]], [[Swami Rama Tirtha]], [[Narayana Guru]], [[Paramhansa Yogananda]], [[Swami Chinmayananda]], [[Shrii Shrii Anandamurti]], [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] ([[Swadhyay Movement]]) and others.

The [[Hindutva]] movement advocating [[Hindu nationalism]] originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), since its foundation in 1980 has won several elections, and after a [[Indian general election, 2004|defeat in 2004]] remained the leading force of opposition against the coalition government of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]]. The last national general election, held in early 2014, saw a dramatic victory of BJP; it gained an absolute majority and formed the government, with [[Narendra Modi]] as [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]].

===Southeast Asia===
{{Main article|Hinduism in Southeast Asia}}

The resurgence of [[Hinduism in Indonesia]] is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early seventies, the [[Toraja]] people of [[Sulawesi]] were the first to be identified under the umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the [[Karo Batak]] of Sumatra in 1977 and the [[Ngaju Dayak]] of [[Kalimantan]] in 1980.

The growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of [[Sabdapalon]] and [[Jayabaya]]. Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of [[Sukarno]]'s PNI, and now support [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]. This return to the 'religion of [[Majapahit]]' (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.

The new [[Hindu communities in Java]] tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (''pura'') or around archaeological temple sites (''candi'') which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is [[Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung]], located on the slope of [[Semeru|Mt. Semeru]], Java's highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of [[Blambangan]], the last Hindu polity on Java, and [[Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya]] (in the village of Menang near Kediri).

{{quote|Many Hindus may not strictly identify themselves as Smartas but, by adhering to Advaita Vedanta as a foundation for non-sectarianism, are indirect followers.&lt;ref group=web name="iskon-smarta" /&gt;}}

Influential in spreading Hinduism to a western audience were [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] ([[Hare Krishna movement]]), [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Meher Baba]], [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] ([[Transcendental Meditation]]),  [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Sathya Sai Baba]], [[Mother Meera]], among others.

===Hindutva===
In the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for national identity in India. With origins traced back to the establishment of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] in the 1910s, the movement grew with the formulation and development of the [[Hindutva]] ideology in the following decades; the establishment of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots [[Jana Sangha]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) in electoral politics in post-independence India.&lt;ref name=Ram-Prasad&gt;{{cite book|last=Ram-Prasad|first=C|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|year=2003|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|isbn=0-631-21535-2|pages=526–550|editor-link=Gavin Flood|editor=Flood, Gavin|chapter=Contemporary political Hinduism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|This conjunction of nationalism and religion is not unique to India. The complexities of Asian nationalism are to be seen and understood in the context of colonialism, modernization and [[nation-building]]. See, for example, [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], for the role of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lankese struggle for independence ({{harvnb|McMahan|2008}}), and [[D.T. Suzuki]], who conjuncted [[Zen]] to [[Nihonjinron|Japanese nationalism]] and [[Bushido|militarism]], in defense against both western hegemony ''and'' the pressure on Japanese Zen during the [[Meiji Restoration]] to conform to [[Shinbutsu Bunri]] ({{harvnb|Sharf|1993}}, {{harvnb|Sharf|1995}}).}}{{refn|group=note|name="neo"|{{harvtxt|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}: Neo-Vedanta also contributed to [[Hindutva]] ideology, [[Hindu politics]] and [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]].

}}
The subject of '''homosexual behavior and Judaism''' dates back to the [[Torah]]. The book of Vayikra ([[Leviticus]]) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a ''[[to'eivah]]'' (something abhorred or detested) that can be subject to capital punishment by the currently non-existent [[Sanhedrin]] under ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law).

[[File:SF Pride 2014 - Stierch 6.jpg|thumbnail|Jewish marchers at [[San Francisco Pride]] 2014]]
[[File:2015MarchaGayDF039.JPG|thumbnail|[[Mexican Jew]] at the 2015 ''Marcha Gay'' of [[Mexico City]]]]

The issue has been a subject of contention within modern [[Jewish denominations]], and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] male ''intercourse'' as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by [[Orthodox Judaism]]. On the other hand, [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] do not hold this view, and allow homosexual intercourse and [[same-sex marriage]]. [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], which until December 2006 held the same position as Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of [[Pluralism (sociology)|pluralism]], with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing its view of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.

==Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible==
{{Further information|The Bible and homosexuality}}

The traditional viewpoint is that the ''[[Torah]]'' mentions homosexuality twice in the book of Leviticus ([[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS]]):

.וְאֶת-זָכָר, לֹא תִשְׁכַּב מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה הִוא
{{quote|
Lev. 18:22 "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is detestable."}}

.וְאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יִשְׁכַּב אֶת-זָכָר מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה עָשׂוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם. מוֹת יוּמָתוּ; דְּמֵיהֶם בָּם
{{quote|
Lev. 20:13 "And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed a detestable act: They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."}}

Deuteronomy 23:17 tells followers:

{{quote|None of the daughters of Israel shall be a [[Qedesha|kedeshah]], nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a [[Qedesha|Kadesh]].}}

This has been interpreted as prohibiting the "sons of Israel" from serving as a homosexual [[temple prostitute]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The story of [[Ruth and Naomi]] in the ''Book of Ruth'' is also occasionally interpreted as the story of a lesbian couple,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5_H76kOJtkC&amp;pg=PA61 |title='&amp;#39;Soliciting Interpretation'&amp;#39; |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&amp;pg=PA699 Finding Our Past: A Lesbian Interpretation of the Book of Ruth]", by [[Rebecca Alpert]], in ''Reading Ruth: Contemporary Women Reclaim a Sacred Story'', edited by J. A. Kates and G.T. Reimer (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; while the biblical description of the relationship between [[David and Jonathan]] in the ''Book of Kings'' is sometimes interpreted as male homosexual love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oocu8JqOz_MC&amp;pg=PA20 |last=Horner |first=Tom |title='&amp;#39;Jonathan Loved David: Homosexuality in Biblical Times'&amp;#39; |publisher='Westminster John Knox Press' |date=1978-01-01 |accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic Jewish application and interpretation of these verses==

===Applicability of Biblical death penalty===

Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation was the [[death penalty]], though minors under 13 years of age were exempt from this, as from any other penalty (Sanh. 54a). However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. The Jewish [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]] states that capital punishment would be applicable only if two men were caught in the act of anal sex, if there were two witnesses to the act, if the men involved were warned that they committed a capital offense, and the two men — or the willing party, in case of rape — subsequently acknowledged the warning, but continued to engage in the prohibited act anyway. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.

Rabbinic tradition understands the Torah's system of capital punishment to not be in effect for the past approximately 2,000 years, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]] and [[The Third Temple|Temple]].&lt;ref name=levine97&gt;{{cite journal |author=Samuel J. Levine| year=1997–1998|title=Capital Punishment in Jewish Law and its Application to the American Legal System: A Conceptual Overview|url=http://digitalcommons.tourolaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=scholarlyworks |journal=St. Mary's Law Journal |volume=29 |pages=1037–1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual ''attraction'' is inherently sinful. However, someone who has had homosexual ''intercourse'' is considered to have violated a prohibition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} If he does [[teshuva]] (repentance), i. e., he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions, he is seen to be forgiven by God.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbian sexual activity===

Why lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible has become a matter of interpretation. Suggestions range from the idea that in ancient times, only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times, sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica | second edition | vol 12 | pg 661 | Lesbianism | Rebecca Alpert&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual liaisons between women are, however, viewed as forbidden by Orthodox [[Rabbinical literature|rabbis]]. This view is based on a [[Midrash|Drash]] interpretation of the Biblical verse, "Do not follow the ways of Egypt, where you once lived, nor of Canaan, where I will be bringing you. Do not follow any of their customs." (Leviticus 18:3).

The Talmud prohibits any activity which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together). The main concern in the Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry a member of [[Kohanim|the priesthood]]. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin, or made them a harlot. Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation, rather than the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica | vol 9 | second edition | pg 518 | Homosexuality&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage in the Midrash and the Talmud===
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to [[same-sex marriage]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they don't sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'"&lt;ref&gt;Chullin 92ab&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Midrash Rabba]] states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Joseph [said]: "The generation of the flood was not obliterated from the world until they wrote marriage contracts from males and beasts.""&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabba, 26:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Homosexuality in classic rabbinic literature ===
The ''Pesikta Zutrasa'' interprets the reason for the prohibition in Leviticus against (male) homosexuality in terms of homosexuality being non-procreative. [[Nachmanides]] and the author of the ''[[Sefer Hachinuch]]'' similarly follow this interpretation.&lt;ref name=roth1&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth. [https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/roth_homosexual.pdf Homosexuality] ''rabbinicalassembly.org'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tosafot]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and the [[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]] understand the reason for the prohibition as that as a result of (male) homosexuality, a man abandons his wife to pursue a homosexual relation.&lt;ref name=roth1/&gt;

==Orthodox Jewish views==
While a variety of views regarding homosexuality as an inclination or status exist within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is some disagreement about which male homosexual acts come under core prohibitions, the majority of Orthodox Judaism puts male-male [[anal sex]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor'', "die rather than transgress", the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Similarly, some consider lesbianism a martyrdom-demanding transgression if only based upon the principle of ''abizrayhu'' (corollary prohibitions of the more severe martyrdom-requiring prohibitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA|title=אביזרייהו דעריות – ויקישיבה|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, homosexual acts are forbidden between non-Jews as well, and this is included among the sexual restrictions of the [[Noachide laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonahweb.org/cms/e/index.php?option%3Dcontent%26task%3Dview%26id%3D78%26Itemid%3D42 |accessdate=March 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330134106/http://www.jonahweb.org/cms/e/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=78&amp;Itemid=42 |title=Judaism and the Modern Attitude to Homosexuality |archivedate=March 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The archetypal model in Judaism is marital heterosexuality with celibacy, fornication, incest, bestiality and homosexuality seen to be part of a continuous prism of wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. Balch|title=Homosexuality, Science, and the "plain Sense" of Scripture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCEjNJexFYC&amp;pg=PA293|year=2000|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4698-3|pages=293–|quote=Judaism's sexual ideal is marital sex; all other forms of sexual behavior deviate from that ideal. There is a continuum of wrong from premarital sex, to celibacy, to adultery, to homosexuality, incest, and bestiality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given in 1986, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], discussed "individuals who express an inclination towards a particular form of physical relationship in which the libidinal gratification is sought with members of one's own gender". He wrote that "society and government must be to offer a helping hand to those who are afflicted with this problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rights or Ills |publisher=Jonah International |url=http://www.jonahweb.org/sections.php?secId=128 |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302205821/https://www.jonahweb.org/sections.php?secId=128 |archivedate=March 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Dr. [[Immanuel Jakobovits]], in his entry ''Homosexuality'' in the ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'' ([[Keter Publishing]]), describes the traditional opinion on homosexuality in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jewish law [...] rejects the view that homosexuality is to be regarded merely as a disease or as morally neutral.... Jewish law holds that no hedonistic ethic, even if called "love", can justify the morality of homosexuality any more than it can legitimize [[adultery]] or [[incest]], however genuinely such acts may be performed out of love and by mutual consent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]] (the Chancellor, ''Rosh Yeshiva'' ["head of the [[yeshiva]]"], and former president of [[Yeshiva University]], a major [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] institution) advocated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judaism and the Modern Attitude to Homosexuality &amp;#124; 2002 |author=Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm |url=http://www.jonahweb.org/sections.php?secId=90 |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302184904/https://www.jonahweb.org/sections.php?secId=90 |archivedate=March 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that some (although not all) homosexuals should be viewed as diseased and in need of compassion and treatment, rather than willful rebels who should be ostracized. He distinguishes between six varieties of homosexuals, including "genuine homosexuals" who have "strong preferential erotic feelings for members of the same sex", "transitory" and "situational" homosexuals who would prefer heterosexual intercourse but are denied it or seek gain in homosexuality, and heterosexuals who are merely curious.

When [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]], who received Orthodox rabbinic ordination, publicly announced in 1999 that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in the Jewish newspapers. Rabbi [[Moshe Tendler]], a leading rabbi at [[Yeshiva University]], stated, "It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tendler said that Rabbi Greenberg's announcement is "the exact same as if he said, 'I'm an Orthodox Rabbi, and I eat ham sandwiches on Yom Kippur.' What you are is a Reform Rabbi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rabbi Ordained by Yeshiva University Announces He is Gay |publisher=Israel Wire |date=May 18, 1999 |url=http://www.israelwire.com/New/990518/99051844.html |access-date=April 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000306064752/http://www.israelwire.com/New/990518/99051844.html |archive-date=March 6, 2000 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orthodox Israeli rabbi [[Ron Yosef]] became in 2009 the first Israeli orthodox [[Rabbi]] to come out, by appearing in Uvda ("Fact"), [[Israel]]'s leading investigative television program, in an episode regarding [[conversion therapies]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=Yermi Brenner |date=2009 |title=Gay Rabbi Comes Out of His Orthodox Closet |publisher=VJ Movement |url=http://www.vjmovement.com/truth/537 |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112130252/http://www.vjmovement.com/truth/537 |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yosef remains in his position as a pulpit Rabbi.&lt;ref name="yn"&gt;{{cite news |author=Nissan Strauchler |date=February 16, 2010 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3849500,00.html |title=Gay with perfect faith |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yosef testified that his Yemenite congregation didn't accept him being a homosexual very easily and it took them a while to accept it. He stated that the younger generation strengthened and supported him, while the older generation had a more difficult experience.↵Yosef received death threats in the year leading up to the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kobi Nahshoni |date=August 2, 2009 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3755595,00.html |title=Rabbis condemn anti-gay shooting |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he stated he is in a relationship with a man.&lt;ref&gt;minute 00:39 in a radio interview with Razi Barkay here [https://web.archive.org/web/20131219122839/http://player.glz.co.il/Player.aspx?FixedPoster=true&amp;FixedPosterName=GLZAOD.jpg&amp;ClipID=131218-10&amp;Type=aod&amp;Width=300&amp;Height=200])&lt;/ref&gt;

Yosef has stated his approach to the issue of homosexuality in Judaism as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is clear to me that lying with another man is forbidden, and our starting point is commitment to [[halacha]] and [[Torah]]. The goal is not to seek permission. But you need to give us a shoulder and support."&lt;ref name="yn" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2008 Israeli Document of Principles ([[Hod (organization)|Hod]])===

In an open letter distributed to Orthodox community leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kobi Nahshoni | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3504952,00.html | title = Religious homosexuals seek acceptance | date=February 10, 2008 | publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hod (organization)|Hod]] organization appealed to the Orthodox community to recognize them as part of the religious society. This was sent to over 100 rabbis in 2008, and eventually was known as the "Document of Principles". In part, the document states:

:: "Anal intercourse between men (Isur Mishkav Zachar) is what is forbidden in the [[Torah]], and not the homosexual [[sexual orientation|orientation]].

:: ... One can advise a person who is interested in doing so, to consult a certified professional mental health worker, on condition that complete information is provided about the type of treatment, its chances of success and its risks. No treatment should be seen as either ultimate or exclusive.

:: A homosexual man may not be coerced into [[marriage]], since marriage provides no inherent solution to a person struggling with his [[sexuality]]...One's capacity to marry does not only include a readiness to fulfill the [[mitzvah|commandment]] of "Be fruitful and multiply" but also the suitability to manage a healthy and moral relationship with one's spouse.

:: On the condition that he does not publicize his actions, a person who has transgressed the prohibition of homosexual intercourse should not be cast out from the religious community. Homosexual activity (as opposed to the homosexual [[sexual orientation|orientation]] itself) is prohibited absolutely by the [[Torah]]...

:: ... A homosexual should be acknowledged as a full member of the religious community, be it in making up a [[minyan]] (prayer quorum), delivering the Priestly Blessing, being called up for a blessing on the [[Torah]] or being recognized as a valid [[witness]] – in these and in any other matter he should not be treated differently to any other person.

:: ... It is of great importance to set up support groups for homosexuals, and such organizations are to be considered [[Charitable organization|charity]] organizations...An "all or nothing" policy is opposed to the way of [[Halakha]]. Every Jewish person should try to keep all the commandments and should do everything he or she can to be as observant of the [[Torah]] as possible".

Up to 2013, 163 Orthodox rabbis from [[Israel]] and abroad have signed this statement, among them: rabbi [[Yuval Cherlow]], rabbi [[Binyamin Lau]], rabbi Haim Navon, rabbi [[Daniel Sperber]], rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]], rabbi [[Shai Piron]], and rabbi [[Yehuda Gilad (politician)|Yehuda Gilad]].

===Statement by Rabbis Schachter, Willig, Rosensweig, and Twersky (2010)===
In 2010, TorahWeb.org published a brief position statement entitled "Torah View on Homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2010/homosexuality.html |title=Torah View on Homosexuality |publisher=Torahweb |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-authored by [[Hershel Schachter|Rav Hershel Schachter]], [[Mordechai Willig|Rav Mordechai Willig]], [[Michael Rosensweig|Rav Michael Rosensweig]], and [[Mayer Twersky|Rav Mayer Twersky]]. These four are all [[rosh yeshiva|roshei yeshiva]] (i. e., rabbinic leaders) at the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] at [[Yeshiva University]], the largest and most influential [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbinic program in America. In part, the statement reads:

::... Prohibited homosexual activity includes any non-platonic physical contact; even ''yichud'' (seclusion) with someone of the same gender is forbidden for homosexually active individuals. ...

::... today's ''galus'' [exile] seeks to legitimize and mainstream the abominable practice (''toeiva'') of homosexuality. Frighteningly, we who live here are not only practically affected, but also axiologically and ideationally infected. Not only our behavior, but our very [[Weltanschauung]] has been compromised and contaminated.

::... Homosexual behavior is absolutely prohibited and constitutes an abomination. Discreet, unconditionally ''[[halacha|halachically]]'' committed Jews who do not practice homosexuality, but feel same-sex attraction (ssa) should be sympathetically and wholeheartedly supported. They can be wonderful Jews, fully deserving of our love, respect, and support. They should be encouraged to seek professional guidance. Moreover, in an uninfected Torah society, appropriate sympathy for discreet ''shomrei Torah u'mitzvos'' who experience, but do not act upon, ssa is clearly distinguished from brazen public identification of their ''yetzer hara'' [temptation] for forbidden behavior. ...

::How painful, sad, and sobering is the sharp contrast between the clear attitude that should prevail in a pure Torah community and the confusion that exists among well-intentioned individuals within our communities. ... ssa is not viewed as a challenge of ''kevishas hayetzer'' (overcoming and taming impulses for forbidden behavior), but rather as a troubling ''halacha'' lacking in compassion, ''rachmanah litzlan'' [God forbid].

::... Inevitably, with respect to homosexuality, ''Talmud Torah'' [Torah study] will place us at odds with political correctness and the temper of the times. Nevertheless, we must be honest with ourselves, and with ''Hakadosh Baruch Hu'' [God], regardless of political correctness, considerations, or consequences.

===July 2010 public statement by some leaders===
On July 22, 2010, a "Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community" was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nati Helfgot |date=July 28, 2010 |url=http://statementofprinciplesnya.blogspot.com/ |title=Statement of Principles |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written primarily by [[Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot|Nathaniel Helfgot]], [[Rabbi Aryeh Klapper|Aryeh Klapper]], and [[Rabbi Yitzchak Blau|Yitzchak Blau]]. Signatories include more than a hundred rabbis and laypeople. Some of the statement's more notable supporters are [[Marc D. Angel|Rabbi Marc Angel]], co-founder of [[The Rabbinic Fellowship]]; [[Shlomo Riskin|Rabbi Shlomo Riskin]], founder of [[Lincoln Square Synagogue]], [[Efrat]], and [[Ohr Torah Stone Institutions]]; and [[Avi Weiss|Rabbi Avi Weiss]], head of the [[Hebrew Institute of Riverdale]], founder of [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]] and [[Yeshivat Maharat]], and co-founder of [[The Rabbinic Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137251 |title=RCA: No Female Rabbis |publisher=Israel National News |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement affirms that homosexual sexual activity is prohibited, saying inter alia that "Halakhah sees heterosexual marriage as the ideal model and sole legitimate outlet for human sexual expression"; "Halakhic Judaism views all male and female same-sex sexual interactions as prohibited"; and "halakhic values proscribe individuals and communities from encouraging practices that grant religious legitimacy to gay marriage and couplehood". The statement emphasizes the community obligation to treat its gay friends, family, and community members with compassion and respect. 

Some of the statement's points that diverge from other common Orthodox positions are:
* We affirm the religious right of those with a homosexual orientation to reject therapeutic approaches they reasonably see as useless or dangerous.
* We believe that the decision as to whether to be open about one's sexual orientation should be left to such individuals, who should consider their own needs and those of the community. We are opposed on ethical and moral grounds to both the “outing” of individuals who want to remain private and to coercing those who desire to be open about their orientation to keep it hidden.
* Communities should display sensitivity, acceptance and full embrace of the adopted or biological children of homosexually active Jews in the synagogue and school setting.
* Jews who have an exclusively homosexual orientation should, under most circumstances, not be encouraged to marry someone of the other gender.

===2016 edict signed by some Israeli Orthodox rabbis===
An edict signed by dozens of Israeli Orthodox rabbis and published in 2016 by the Israeli Modern Orthodox rabbinic group Beit Hillel, a group which promotes inclusiveness in Orthodox Judaism, stated, in part, "According to the Torah and halacha, the [same-sex sexual] acts are forbidden, but not the proclivities, and therefore, people with same-sex tendencies, men and women, have no invalidation in halacha or tradition. They are obligated by the commandments of the Torah, they can fulfill a [ritual] obligation on behalf of the public, and carry out all of the community functions just like any member."&lt;ref name="The Times of Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/dozens-of-orthodox-rabbis-call-for-accepting-gay-congregants/|title=Dozens of Orthodox rabbis call for accepting gay congregants|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated, in part, "Just as it [is] inconceivable to mock someone for being physically, behaviorally, or mentally different, so too those with same-sex tendencies should not be mocked. On the contrary, those around them — family and community — should show special feeling for them, and apply to them the Torah commandment of 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' and to be diligent in avoiding the prohibition of insulting another."&lt;ref name="The Times of Israel"/&gt;

==Conservative Judaism==
{{Main article|Homosexuality and Conservative Judaism}}
As a matter of both [[Jewish law]] and institutional policy, Conservative ("Masorti") Judaism has wrestled with homosexuality issues since the 1980s.

Conservative Jewish writer Herschell Matt initially argued that homosexuals may be excused because Judaism does recognise 'constraint' as a valid excuse to disobey the law. However, Matt later shifted to outright support for homosexuality, viewing it as part of the natural order. Conservative Rabbi Robert Kirshchner states that Jews have historically adapted their laws to new circumstances, indicating accommodation for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David L. Balch|title=Homosexuality, Science, and the "plain Sense" of Scripture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCEjNJexFYC&amp;pg=PA293|year=2000|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4698-3|pages=293–|quote=Herschell Matt, a Conservative Jewish thinker, moved away from the category of 'illness' to speaking of 'sexual deviance, malfunctioning, or abnormality-usually unavoidable and often irredemediable. Matt recignized traditional reasons for condemning homosexuality, but argued that Halakah (traditional law) recognizes the category of 'constraint' (me'ones) excusing one in circumstances beyond one's control. Because there is no possibility of change to a hetereosexual preference, the homosexual should be considered to be acting under 'constraint'. A decade later, Matt went further and rejected his own suggestion that homosexuals should be tolerated because they are acting out of uncontrollable compulsion. Homosexuality is rather part of God's creation; therefore, gay men and lesbians may be ordained to the rabbinate. Matt went further than many other Conservative Jews, but virtually all Jewish writers support the decriminalization of private sexual acts. Another Conservative Rabbi, Robert Kirshchner, pointed out that 'in the interpretation of Jewish tradition, where there is a halachic will, there is a halachic way. In other words, if our understanding of a situation changes, we Jews have always found a way to make the law fit in with our new understanding.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] makes the movement's decisions concerning [[Conservative Halakha|Jewish law]]. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement.

In 2006, the CJLS shifted its position and paved the way for significant changes regarding the Conservative movement's policies toward homosexuality. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three distinct [[Responsum|responsa]] reflecting very different approaches to the subject. One [[responsum]] substantially liberalized Conservative Judaism's approach including lifting most (but not all) classical prohibitions on homosexual conduct and permitted the blessing of homosexual unions and the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. Two others completely retained traditional prohibitions. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, the adoption of multiple opinions permits individual Conservative rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to select which opinion to accept, and hence to choose individually whether to maintain a traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, or to permit openly gay/lesbian/bisexual unions and clergy.

The liberalizing responsum, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 of 25 votes, was authored by Rabbis [[Elliot N. Dorff]], Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. It lifted most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opened the way to the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbis and cantors and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopped short of religiously recognizing same-sex marriage. The responsum invoked the [[Talmud|Talmudic principle]] of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot|kavod habriyot]]'', which the authors translated as "human dignity", as authority for this approach. The responsum maintained a prohibition on male-male anal sex, which it described as the sole Biblically prohibited homosexual act. This act remains a ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor'' ("[[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law|die rather than transgress]]" offense) under the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinevins.org/HHH%20Dorff%20Nevins%20Reisner%20Final2.pdf Elliott N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. ''Homosexuality, Human Dignity, and Halakha''.

Two traditionalist responsa were adopted. A responsum by Rabbi [[Joel Roth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joel Roth, Homosexuality Revisited, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-23 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422081604/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Roth_Final.pdf |archivedate=April 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted as a majority opinion by 13 votes, reaffirmed a general complete prohibition on homosexual conduct. A second responsum by Rabbi [[Leonard Levy (Rabbi)|Leonard Levy]], adopted as a minority opinion by 6 votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.

The Committee rejected a fourth paper by [[Gordon Tucker]] which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual sexual practices.

The consequences of the decision have been mixed. On the one hand, four members of the Committee - Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, [[Mayer Rabinowitz]], and [[Joseph Prouser]] - resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change.&lt;ref name="rothresigns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&amp;intcategoryid=4 |title=Conflicting Conservative opinions expected to open the way for gays |accessdate=2006-12-07 |author=Ben Harris |date=2006-12-06 |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211044018/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17355&amp;intcategoryid=4 |archivedate=11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17372&amp;intcategoryid=4 Rabbi Joel Roth, "Op-Ed: Law committee in its gay ruling stepped outside halachic framework", JTS News, December 10, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205030318/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=17372&amp;intcategoryid=4 |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] of the [[University of Judaism]] (now the [[American Jewish University]]) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it will immediately begin admitting gay/lesbian/bisexual students as soon as the law committee passes a policy that sanctions such ordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Spence |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |title=Conservative Panel Votes To Permit Gay Rabbis |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward |date=December 8, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205536/http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-panel-votes-to-permit-gay-rabbis/ |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2007, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay/lesbian/bisexual candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Conservative_Judaism/The_Halakhic_Status_of_Homosexual_Behavior/Eisen_Letter_-_Ordination.xml |title=Chancellor-elect Eisen's Letter to the Community |publisher=The Jewish Theological Seminary |date=March 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204152904/http://www.jtsa.edu/Conservative_Judaism/The_Halakhic_Status_of_Homosexual_Behavior/Eisen_Letter_-_Ordination.xml |archivedate=December 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Masorti synagogues in Europe and Israel, which have historically been somewhat more traditional than the American movement, continue to maintain a complete ban on homosexual and bisexual conduct, clergy, and unions. As such, most Conservative rabbis outside the United States are exercising their authority as local rabbinic authorities (''mara d'atra'') to reject the more liberal responsa. The head of the Israeli Masorti movement's Vaad Halakha (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi [[David Golinkin]], wrote the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/images/prouser.pdf |author=Rabbi Joseph Prouser |title=The Conservative Movement and Homosexuality: Settled Law in Unsettling Times |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207161228/http://www.uscj.org/images/prouser.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masorti movements in Argentina, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have indicated that they will not admit or ordain openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbinical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rebecca Spence |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/overseas-seminaries-set-to-reject-gay-ordination/ |title=Overseas Seminaries Set To Reject Gay Ordination: Canadian Rabbis Mull Forming Separate Wing of Movement |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masorti Movement's Israeli seminar also rejected a change in its view of the status of homosexual conduct, stating that, "Jewish law has traditionally prohibited homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3382340,00.html |title=No gay ordinations in conservative seminar |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=March 28, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Bradley Artson]], Dean of the Rabbinic School at [[American Jewish University]], claims to have studied every reference he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers. Every citation he found described an encounter between males where one party, the master, physically abused another, the slave. Rabbi Artson could not find a single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. "Homosexual relationships today", Rabbi Artson says, "should not be compared to the ancient world. I know too many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships. I know too many same-sex couples that are loving parents raising good descent {{sic}} ethical children. Who's to say their family relationships are less sanctified in the eyes of God than mine is with my wife and our children?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Elliot Fein |date=October 28, 2008 |title=Religious "No!" to Proposition 8 |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/religious_no_to_proposition_8_20081028/ |publisher=Jewish Journal |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform Judaism==
The [[Reform Judaism]] movement, the largest branch of Judaism in North America, has rejected the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, they do not prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring [[Canaan]]ite nations, rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in light of what is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.

In 1972, [[Beth Chayim Chadashim]], the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, was established in West Los Angeles, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines. [[Beth Chayim Chadashim]] now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.

In 1977, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] (CCAR), which is the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]'s principal body, adopted a resolution calling for legislation decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults, and calling for an end to discrimination against gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="ccarnet2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/2000/same-gender-officiation/ |title=CCAR |publisher=Ccarnet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309232303/http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/2000/same-gender-officiation/ |archive-date=2015-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called on Reform Jewish organizations to develop programs to implement this stand.&lt;ref name="ccarnet2000"/&gt;

In the late 1980s, the primary seminary of the Reform movement, [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], changed its admission requirements to allow openly gay and lesbian people to join the student body.

In 1990, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] announced a national policy declaring lesbian and gay Jews to be full and equal members of the religious community. Also in 1990, the CCAR officially endorsed a report of their own Ad Hoc Committee on Homosexuality and the Rabbinate.&lt;ref name="ccarnet2000"/&gt; This position paper urged that "all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation that they have chosen".&lt;ref name="ccarnet2000"/&gt; The committee endorsed the view that "all Jews are religiously equal, regardless of their sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="ccarnet2000"/&gt;

In 1995, Reform Rabbi [[Margaret Wenig]]'s essay "Truly Welcoming Lesbian and Gay Jews" was published in ''The Jewish Condition: Essays on Contemporary Judaism Honoring [Reform] Rabbi [[Alexander Schindler|Alexander M. Schindler]]''; it was the first published argument to the Jewish community on behalf of civil marriage for gay couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/judaism/2000/11/reform-rabbi-alexander-m-schindler-dies.aspx|title=Reform Rabbi Alexander M.

In 1996, the CCAR passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:

:However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle—we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a "marriage" within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Soc.Culture.Jewish Newsgroups |title=Question 18.3.8: Reform's Position On...Homosexuality |url=http://mljewish.org/S.C.J/faq/18-03-08.html |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and

:That the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.

:That this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.

In 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on Human Sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage "may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community". The report called for the CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at [[gay marriage|same-sex marriages]]. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy ''teshuvah'' (rabbinical opinion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&amp;year=5756 CCARnet.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217072309/http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&amp;year=5756 |title=On Homosexual Marriage| date=December 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.

In March 2000, the CCAR issued a new resolution stating that, "We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not."

Also in 2000, [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] established the [[Institute for Judaism, Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender Identity]] to "educate HUC-JIR students on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues to help them challenge and eliminate homophobia and heterosexism; and to learn tools to be able to transform the communities they encounter into ones that are inclusive and welcoming of LGBT Jews".&lt;ref name=ijso&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Judaism and Sexual Orientation |url=http://ijso.huc.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first and only institute of its kind in the Jewish world.&lt;ref name=ijso/&gt;

In 2003, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, "Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities |url=http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=13462 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720193853/http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=13462 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, [[Women of Reform Judaism]] issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the bisexual and transgender communities, and saying, "Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and
Calls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrj.org/Advocacy/ResolutionsStatements/Resolutions2003/2003TransgenderandBisexualRights.aspx |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516091332/http://www.wrj.org/Advocacy/ResolutionsStatements/Resolutions2003/2003TransgenderandBisexualRights.aspx |title=Transgender and Bisexual Rights - 2003|archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''Siddur Sha'ar Zahav'', the first complete prayer book to address the lives and needs of LGBTQ as well as straight Jews, was published. Publisher: J Levine Judaica &amp; Sha'ar Zahav (2009); {{ISBN|0-982197-91-8}}; {{ISBN|978-0982197-91-2}}. Sha'ar Zahav is a progressive Reform synagogue in San Francisco.

In 2014, the CCAR joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, which is America's first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Price |date=June 3, 2014 |title=Rabbis group joins N.C. same-sex marriage suit |newspaper=Charlotte Observer |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/06/03/4952335/rabbis-group-joins-nc-same-sex.html |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael O'Loughlin |date=June 6, 2014 |title=Rabbis Join Marriage Equality Fight |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/06/06/rabbis-join-marriage-equality-fight |publisher=Advocate |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}f&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Rabbi [[Denise Eger]] became the first openly gay president of the CCAR.&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;Tess Cutler, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/religion/article/rabbi_denise_eger_seeks_to_open_doors_wider_to_all_jews "Rabbi Denise Eger seeks to open doors wider to all Jews"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', March 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/03/16/news-opinion/united-states/reform-rabbis-install-first-openly-gay-president-denise-eger |title=Reform rabbis install first openly gay president, Denise Eger &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, the [[High Holy Days]] Reform Jewish prayer book [[Mishkan HaNefesh]] was released; it is intended as a companion to [[Mishkan T'filah]].&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74278/gates-of-repentance-replacement-advances-reform-trends/ |title=‘Gates of Repentance’ replacement advances Reform trends &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2015-03-26 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishkan HaNefesh can be translated as "sanctuary of the soul".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt; It replaces a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, "Gates of Repentance", that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line "rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]", and adds a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering "mibeit", Hebrew for "from the house of", in addition to the traditional "son of" or "daughter of".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

==Reconstructionist Judaism==
The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist movement]] sees homosexuality and bisexuality as normal expressions of sexuality and welcomes gays, bisexuals, and lesbians into Reconstructionist communities to participate fully in every aspect of community life. Since 1985, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] has admitted openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates to their rabbinical and cantorial programs. In 1993, a movement Commission issued: ''Homosexuality and Judaism: The Reconstructionist Position''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org/rt/transformation.html "Becoming a "Kehillah Mekabelet": The Struggles of Transformation"] by Roberta Israeloff {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113210730/http://www.jrf.org/rt/transformation.html |date=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages/commitment ceremonies, though the RRA does not require its members to officiate at them. In 2007, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi [[Toba Spitzer]], the first openly LGBT person chosen to head a [[rabbi|rabbinical association]] in the United States. In 2013, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi [[Jason Klein]], the first openly gay man chosen to head a national [[rabbi|rabbinical association]] of one of the major Jewish denominations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay man chosen to lead U.S. Reconstructionist rabbis |date=March 12, 2013 |agency=The Forward |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/gay-man-chosen-to-lead-u-s-reconstructionist-rabbis-1.508883 |accessdate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Rabbi [[Deborah Waxman]] was elected as the president of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]].&lt;ref name="thejewishweek.com"&gt;{{cite news |date=October 10, 2013 |title=Reconstructionists Pick First Woman, Lesbian As Denominational Leader |newspaper=[[The Jewish Week]] |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national-news/reconstructionists-pick-first-woman-lesbian-denominational-leader |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anne Cohen |date=October 18, 2013 |title=Trailblazing Reconstructionist Deborah Waxman Relishes Challenges of Judaism |newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/articles/185252/trailblazing-reconstructionist-deborah-waxman-reli/?p=all |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.&lt;ref name="thejewishweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Reconstructionst Rabbinical College |title=RRC Announces New President Elect |date=October 9, 2013 |url=http://www.rrc.edu/sites/default/files/ORPHAN_PDFs/RRC_WaxmanPresidentElect-ForPress3.pdf?hero=1615 |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish Renewal==
[[Jewish Renewal]] is a recent [[Jewish denominations|movement]] in Judaism which endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]], [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], [[music]]al and [[Meditation|meditative]] practices; it describes itself as "a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism's prophetic and mystical traditions". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aleph.org/renewal.htm |title=About Jewish Renewal |publisher=Aleph: Alliance for Jewish Renewal |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007220011/https://www.aleph.org/renewal.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Renewal movement ordains people of all sexual orientations as rabbis and cantors. In 2005, Eli Cohen became the first openly gay rabbi ordained by the Jewish Renewal Movement, followed by [[Chaya Gusfield]] and [[Rabbi Lori Klein]] in 2006, who became the two first openly lesbian rabbis ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2007, [[Jalda Rebling]], born in Amsterdam and now living in Germany, became the first openly lesbian cantor ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement.&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axelrod|first=Toby|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/1999/11/30/14879/Newfemalecantorin|title=New Renewal cantor looks ahead|publisher=JTA|date=1999-11-30|accessdate=2012-04-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415065937/http://www.jta.org/news/article/1999/11/30/14879/Newfemalecantorin|archivedate=2013-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the bisexual rights activist [[Debra Kolodny]] was ordained as a rabbi by the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement and hired as the rabbi for congregation P'nai Or of Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishreview.org/special/Pnai-Or-hires-new-rabbi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415035448/http://www.jewishreview.org/special/Pnai-Or-hires-new-rabbi |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile: Debra Kolodny |publisher=The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Religious Archives Network |url=http://www.lgbtran.org/Profile.aspx?ID=48 |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statement of Principles of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal (and OHALAH and the Rabbinic Pastors Association) states in part, "We welcome and recognize the sanctity of every individual regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We recognize respectful and mutual expressions of adult human sexuality as potentially sacred expressions of love, and therefore, we strive to welcome a variety of constellations of intimate relationships and family forms including gay, lesbian, and heterosexual relationships as well as people choosing to be single." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Principles |publisher=OHALAH |url=http://ohalah.org/about-us/principles/ |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanistic Judaism==
[[Humanistic Judaism]] is a movement in Judaism that offers a non-theistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. In 2004, the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a resolution supporting "the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex", and affirming "the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010054121/http://www.shj.org/MarriageEquality.htm |title=On Homosexual Marriage|archivedate=October 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/Homophobic%20Bullying.html |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725123301/http://www.shj.org/Homophobic%20Bullying.html |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism Pledges to Speak Out Against Homophobic Bullying|archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Humanistic Rabbis]] has also issued a pro-LGBT statement titled "In Support of Diverse Sexualities and Gender Identities". &lt;ref name="humanisticrabbis.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexualities &amp; Identities |publisher=Association of Humanistic Rabbis |url=http://www.humanisticrabbis.org/sexualities-identities/ |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030021945/http://www.humanisticrabbis.org/sexualities-identities/ |archivedate=October 30, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 2003 and issued in 2004.&lt;ref name="humanisticrabbis.org"/&gt;

==LGBT-affirmative activities==
[[File:Pride Minyan.jpg|thumb|A halachic egalitarian Pride [[minyan]] in [[Tel Aviv]] on the second Shabbat of [[Hanukkah]].]]
Jewish LGBT rights advocates and sympathetic clergy have created various institutions within Jewish life to accommodate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender parishioners. [[Beth Chayim Chadashim]], established in 1972 in West Los Angeles, was the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines, including [[Congregation Beit Simchat Torah]] in New York City, [[Bet Mishpachah]] in Washington, D. C., and [[Congregation Or Chadash]] in Chicago. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.

LGBT-inclusive services and ceremonies specific to Jewish religious culture have also been created, ranging from LGBT-affirmative [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jqinternational.org/haggadah.php |title=GLBT Passover Haggadah |publisher=JQ International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112112252/http://www.jqinternational.org/haggadah.php |archivedate=November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a "[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] Shabbat [[Passover Seder|Seder]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Horn |url=http://stonewallseder.com/ |title=The Stonewall Seder |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 17, 2008 |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/an_old_story_finds_new_life_in_lgbt_haggadah_20080418|title=An old story finds new life in LGBT haggadah|author=Nick Street|publisher=Jewish Journal |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 Rainbow Jews, an oral history project showcasing the lives of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1950s until the present, was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Rainbow Jews |title=About us |url=http://www.rainbowjews.com/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the United Kingdom's first archive of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hephzibah Anderson |date= February 12, 2014 |title=Trove of Jewish LGBT history goes on display in U.K. |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/.premium-1.573723 |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives]] has, among other things, the Twice Blessed Collection, circa 1966-2000; this collection "consists of materials documenting the Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender experience, circa 1966-2000, collected by the Jewish Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Archives, founded and operated by Johnny Abush". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finding aid of the Twice Blessed Collection, circa 1966-2000 Coll2010.003 |publisher=Online Archives of California |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6z09s281/ |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by the sociocultural psychologist, Chana Etengoff, has highlighted the therapeutic benefits of LGBTQ petitions to religious leaders, including meaning-making, social action, agency and empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etengoff|first=Chana|date=2016-04-04|title=Petitioning for Social Change: Letters to Religious Leaders From Gay Men and Their Family Allies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2016.1174022|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–29|doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1174022|issn=0091-8369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾIlāh}}''''' ({{lang-ar|إله}}; plural: {{lang|ar|آلهة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾālihah}}'')  is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term meaning "[[deity]]" or "[[god]]". The feminine is ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾilāhah}}'' ({{lang|ar|إلاهة}}, meaning "[[goddess]]"); with the article, it appears as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-ʾilāhah}}'' {{lang|ar|الإلاهة}}. It appears in the name of the monotheistic god of Islam as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[allah|al-Lāh]]}}'', translated, that is, "the god". It is also used by Arabic-speaking [[Christians]] and [[Jews]], but also use other terms such as ''[[Rabb]]'', or "Lord" - a title also used by Muslims for Allah - similar to the [[Hebrew]] use of ''[[Adonai]]'', which is the most frequently used by Jews of all languages, along with ''[[HaShem]]'' or "the Name". Amongst Christians, ''[[Jesus in Christianity|Yasu]]'' - an Arabic transliteration of the name of the Christian [[Jesus]] - [[Yahweh]], or ''[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]'', translated, that is, "Almighty", are common, with some other names and titles generally borrowed as transliterations from Hebrew, [[Aramaic]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In [[Malaysia]], it is illegal for Christians, Jews, or any other non-Muslim to refer to their God as "Allah".&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2009/05/200952894123668106.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾIlāh}} is [[cognate]] to [[Northwest Semitic]] ''[[El (god)|{{transl|sem|ʾēl}}]]'' and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''ilum''. The word is from a [[Proto-Semitic]] archaic biliteral ''{{transl|sem|ʔ-L}}'' meaning "[[God (male deity)|god]]" (possibly with a wider meaning of "strong"), which was extended to a regular [[triliteral]] by the addition of a ''[[هـ|h]]'' (as in Hebrew ''[[Names of God in Judaism|{{transl|sem|ʾelōah}}, {{transl|sem|ʾelōhim}}]]''). The word is spelled either {{lang|ar|إله}} with an optional diacritic alif to mark the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}'' only in [[Qur'an]]ic texts or (more rarely) with a full [[aleph|alif]], {{lang|ar|إلاه}}.

The term is used throughout the [[Quran]] in passages detailing the existence of God and of the beliefs of non-[[Muslims]] in other divinities. Notably, the first statement of the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[shahadah|šahādah]]}}'' (the Muslim confession of faith) is, "there is no ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾilāh}}'' but ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Allah|al-Lāh]]}}''", that is, translated,"there is no god except Allah".

[[File:D1010140.jpg|thumb|18th IAS Conference Doha - Qatar - October 2011]]
[[File:19th international science conference in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|19th international science conference in Dhaka]]

==Foundation==
The establishment of the Islamic world Academy of Sciences (IAS) was initially proposed by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]) Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Co-operation (COMSTECH), and approved by the Fourth Islamic Summit held in [[Casablanca]] in 1984.

Upon the invitation of [[Jordan]], the Founding Conference of the Academy was held in [[Amman]] (Jordan) in October 1986, under the patronage of HRH [[Prince Hassan bin Al Talal|Prince Al-Hassan]], who accepted the patronage of the Academy together with HE the President of Pakistan.
Operating from its Amman Secretariat, the Academy aims to continue the work it had started in 1986, assisting the decision-makers and scientists and technologists of the OIC-Member Countries and helping them achieve an advanced level of development for their countries.

==IAS Objectives==
The main objectives of the IAS are to:

* Serve as a consultative organisation of the Muslim Ummah and institutions of member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), on matters related to science and technology. 
* Initiate scientific and technological programmes and activities in science and technology, and to encourage co-operation among research groups in the various Islamic countries on projects of common interest.  
* Encourage and promote research on major problems of importance facing Islamic countries and to identify future technologies of relevance for possible adoption and utilisation.  
* Formulate standards of scientific performance and attainment, and to award prizes and honours for outstanding scientific achievements to individuals and to centres of excellence in all science and technology disciplines.

==IAS Programme==

===General===

The underlying objective of the programme of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences is to establish a framework for the development of science and technology in the Islamic World.

The programme, by facilitating interaction among scientists, and promoting the exchange of views and ideas on science and technology issues in particular, can catalyse the overall process of socio-economic development in Islamic countries.

Since its inception in 1986, the IAS has been implementing programmes that address serious contemporary issues facing the Islamic World, with the aim of formulating remedial policies that can be adopted by OIC and developing countries in their quest to achieve their development objectives.

Operating on a year to year basis, the IAS has organised several international conferences, published a series of Conference Proceedings, Newsletters and some monographs, and has also established a quality Science Journal which is of an international standard.

Moreover, the IAS has established numerous contacts with national and international non-governmental organisations, as well as governments throughout the World.

==IAS Activities==

===General===

Since its establishment, the IAS has been implementing regular and ad hoc activities that are in line with its programme. The objective of all such activities has been to advance the science and technology sector in OIC and developing countries. This, the IAS believes, can generate increased interest in this sector, enabling countries to reap the fruits of its outputs in the areas of education, health, industry, and human welfare in general.

===What have we accomplished?===

The IAS has built itself into an action-oriented institution of OIC-Member countries utilising most of its limited resources for activities that accelerate the pace of development of OIC-Member countries.
	Operating on a year to year basis, the Academy has been promoting joint Islamic action through its specialised scientific conferences; publishing a series of Conference Proceedings (Policy Documents), journals, books, newsletters, and establishing a quality medical journal that is of an international standard; as well as organising a number of quality training programmes.
	Most of all, the Academy has managed to define a very useful dual role for itself namely as a programme implementation and policy-making body dedicated to contributing to the development of the OIC-Member countries and humanity.

	Further, the Academy has established numerous contacts with a number of international non-governmental organisations, as well as governments throughout the world.

== International Outreach ==

===General===

A primary function of the Academy is to act as a Pan-Islamic affiliating body to the relevant international organisations. Through this, Muslim scholars can have a channel of communication, through the Academy, with such international agencies as the UNESCO, the World Bank, etc.
At the level of the OIC, examples of the co-operation that exists between the Academy and other institutions are outlined

===Co-operation with COMSTECH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comstech.org/default.aspx|title=COMSTECH Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Ministerial on Scientific and Technological Cooperation|first=Usman Quddus|last=Malik|website=comstech.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Islamic World Academy of Sciences and COMSTECH have had solid relations, since COMSTECH helped to create the Academy in 1986, in compliance with the OIC Summit recommendations.

	The IAS and COMSTECH regularly exchange information on programmes and act, each within its catchment area, to promote S&amp;T activities and encourage OIC countries to increase their S&amp;T expenditure.

=== Co-operation with the IDB ===

The IDB has been helping to finance Academy conferences since 1990. It has often delegated its own specialists to present papers describing its activities within the scope of the theme of the annual IAS Conference.

	The IAS has furthermore been active in promoting the IDB’s Prize for Science and Technology, which aims to encourage and promote excellence among OIC S&amp;T institutions.

=== Co-operation with the UNESCO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/|title=UNESCO|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The IAS, during March 2009, participated in the launch of the UNESCO International Science, Technology and Innovation Centre for South-South Cooperation (ISTIC) in Kuala Lumpur and has implemented a number of programmes with this newly founded centre since.

Furthermore, the IAS - through Prof. Adnan Badran FIAS and Moneef Zou’bi, DG-IAS - was commissioned to author the ‘Arab States Chapter’ of the UNESCO Science Report 2010, a task that has been successfully accomplished.

The IAS also has been invited through Dr Moneef Zou’bi to author the ‘Arab States Chapter’ of the UNESCO Science Report for 2015.

===Co-operation with the ISESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isesco.org.ma/|title=Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization – ISESCO – - EN|website=www.isesco.org.ma}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
In its effort to establish scientific and academic relations with similar Islamic organisations, the Academy signed a co-operation agreement with the Islamic Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (ISESCO), in 1989.

	ISESCO has co-sponsored the 2001 Conference of the IAS on Biotechnology, held in Rabat (Morocco), and contributed a paper at that conference on Biotechnology Research in OIC countries. Furthermore, ISESCO participated and sponsored the IAS Conferences of 2006 and 2008.

=== Co-operation with TWAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twas.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617182530/http://twas.org/ |archivedate=2015-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The Academy signed a co-operation agreement with The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) some years ago. That was a first step towards enhancing co-operation between these two international academies, which have been in close liaison recently on their scientific activities. The IAS often joins TWAS at its scientific meetings and both academies exchange information in the context of G77, as well as TWNSO meetings, especially as the IAS has been a member of the Third World Network of Scientific Organisation (TWNSO) for a number of years.

=== Co-operation with the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/|title=IAP  - the global network of science academies|website=www.interacademies.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

In order to interact fully with 100 or so national and international academies of sciences the world over, the IAS joined the Inter-Academy Partnership, which is a global network of science academies. The IAS was elected to join the IAP at latter's General Assembly Meeting which was held in Alexandria, Egypt, during December 2006.

=== Co-operation with Academies of Sciences ===

The IAS has signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Kazakhstan, the Azerbaijan, and the Uzbekistan Academies of Sciences. These agreements lay the foundation for long-term co-operative relationships between OIC institutions and these republics and their scientific infrastructure.

	Contacts with the US National Academy of Sciences have been ongoing for over ten years, resulting in the participation of top US NAS representatives in some IAS activities. Moreover, the US NAS has regularly nominated its Foreign Secretary to participate in IAS conferences.

The IAS has been actively supporting the Palestine Academy of Science and Technology (PALAST) through facilitating the participation of PALAST officials in the various scientific activities in the Middle East, as well as providing help and advice to this sister academy on a regular bases.

The [[Bangladesh Academy of Sciences]] played an important part in organising the 19th IAS conference which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and a number of the BAS Fellows took part in the conference.

=== Co-operation with the Inter Academy Medical Panel (IAMP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamp-online.org/|title=IAMP|website=www.iamp-online.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The Inter Academy Medical Panel on Global Health Issues (IAMP) is an association created by the world’s academies of medicine and academies of sciences or engineering having members from the health sciences for the purpose of working together through bilateral, regional and worldwide. The IAS was elected to join the IAMP at latter's General Assembly Meeting which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during March 2010.

=== Co-operation with the International Union of Academies (IUA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uai-iua.org/|title=Union Académique Internationale|first=|last=leny@flatLand!|website=www.uai-iua.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

During September 2011, the IAS hosted a meeting of the executive council of the IUA at IAS Headquarters in Amman, where a number of IUA matters as well as a number of possible joint initiatives between the IAS and IUA were discussed.

During January 2014, the IAS co-organised an international conference in Erlangen (Germany) under the title The Impact of Arabic Sources on Divination and the Practical Sciences in Europe and Asia in association with the International Union of Academies (IUA).

The IAS will co-organise a second IUA International Conference on the “Impact of Arab Sciences in Europe and Asia from the Middle Ages to the Modern Period,” to be held in Amman (Jordan), during April 2017.

=== Co-operation with the InterAction Council (IAC) ===

The InterAction Council was established in 1983 as an independent international organization to mobilize the experience, energy and international contacts of a group of statesmen who have held the highest office in their own countries.

In May 2013, IAS President presented a keynote address at the 31st Annual Plenary Meeting of the Interaction Council, 9–11 May 2013, Manama, Bahrain, under the title Uprisings in the Arab World: The Reality beyond the Failure of Politics and Policies.

	During November 2013, the IAS-DG contributed a paper to the InterAction Council publication entitled The Arab Pseudo-Spring? A Snapshot of the Underlying Politics and Economics, and the Challenge of Water Insecurity.

On 20 October 2014, the Council launched its latest publication, “Water, Energy, and the Arab Awakening.” This book is the third in the Council’s “Global Agenda” series and the second book the Council has published in partnership with the United Nations University Institute of Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH).

===Periodicals===

====IAS Medical Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaljournal-ias.org/|title=Medical Journal of Islamic World Academy of Sciences|website=www.medicaljournal-ias.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Medical Journal of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences.png|thumb]] --&gt;
The Medical Journal of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences, which first appeared in August 1988, is a quality publication comparable to international scientific journals. The Journal has established itself as a major scientific publication in the Islamic world and has been granted an ISS number (ISSN 1016-3360). It is a forum for scientists and technologists in developing countries through which they can get their research work published.

The Journal, which is published in Turkey and distributed internationally, was launched with the help of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS), and has since, received some grants from the Academy Secretariat and COMSTECH.

====IAS Newsletter====
[[File:IAS Newsletter.jpg|thumb|IAS Newsletter]]
The IAS, through its Secretariat, regularly publishes the Newsletter of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasworld.org/newsletter/|title=IAS  » Newsletter|website=www.iasworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This widely distributed publication aims to publicise the various activities the IAS undertakes, and also to put across the Academy’s programmes. It also often contains news about the Academy, its Fellows and staff.

The Newsletter, as well as regularly profiling some Academy Fellows, frequently contains specialised and guest articles on contemporary scientific and technical topics including such matters as the S&amp;T potential of OIC-member countries and institutions.

====Islamic Thought and Scientific Creativity (in Arabic)====

Upon the request of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Co-operation (COMSTECH), and under its sponsorship, the Academy published for over 6 years (1991 – 1996) the Arabic version of COMSTECH’s Islamic Thought and Scientific Creativity, the high quality quarterly publication.

A total of twenty issues of the Arabic version were published and distributed. This was done, as a joint activity of the Academy and the Amman-based Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research, Al Albait Foundation, Amman, Jordan.

==Structure==
The structure of the IAS consists of a General Assembly, Council, Headquarters, Fellows, Deceased Fellows and Ibrahim Award.

===IAS General Assembly===
The Academy itself is governed by the General Assembly in which all founding and elected Fellows are member. The number of Academy Fellows was 110 on 1 December 2016. They represent more than 40 countries and many scientific disciplines. The Fellows of the Academy are eminent figures, each in his/her field has achieved a great deal and has contributed significantly both to his/her country’s development and the global arena. Since its establishment in 1986, the General Assembly has convened annually and the major issues discussed at each of these gatherings are the planning and accomplishing of future Academy activities.

===IAS Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasworld.org/council/|title=IAS  » Council|website=www.iasworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Council is responsible for the management and direction of the Academy and consists of eleven executive members which are elected by the General Assembly for a four-year term of office, and which is subject to its regulation and supervision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">The '''Isyana Dynasty''', rulers of the '''Kingdom of Medang''', was a dynasty of the [[Hindu]] [[Medang Kingdom]] on the island of [[Java (island)|Java]]. It followed the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and was established by [[Mpu Sindok]], who moved the capital of the Mataram Kingdom from Central Java to East Java around the year 929. Coedes states, "Sindok, under his reign name Sri Isyana Vikramadharmatungadeva, was always considered the founder of Javanese power in the east of the island."  Mpu Sindok's daughter and successor was Isanatungavijaya, who in turn was succeeded by her son Makutavamsavardhana, followed by [[Dharmawangsa]]. The reign of the Isyana Dynasty came to an end when the [[Sriwijaya]] empire attacked and destroyed the capital in 1016-1017.&lt;ref name=indianized&gt;{{Cite book

Eventually, the ruler [[Airlangga]] restored and reunited the kingdom as [[Kahuripan|Kahuripan kingdom]]. Airlangga's heirs ruled the [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|kingdom of Kediri]] and are thought to be the continuation of the Isyana Dynasty.

They were founded in Australia in the early 80's by Dave and Cherry Mckay and have had a three decade long history of controversy documented extensively by the media.

==History and controversies==

The history and activities of the Jesus Christians over the years have been extensively documented by both the group and the mainstream media, attracting both positive and negative attention. Some older newspaper articles were reproduced on the group's website, and where these are used below this is noted in the references.

===Early days===

[[File:JC's-in-Australia.gif|thumb|Jesus Christian members in Medowie, Australia, 1988]]

The group was started in Melbourne, Australia, by Dave and Cherry McKay when Neville Williams moved in with the Mckay family in early 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JC History 1981-1996|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-days/706-jc-history-1981-1996|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy Camped with Cult as Hunt Went On|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/28/sarahhall.jeevanvasagar|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2000|location=London|first1=Sarah|last1=Hall|first2=Jeevan|last2=Vasagar|first3=Stephen|last3=Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christian|first=A|title=Without Thought for Food or Clothing|year=1985|publisher=Christians|location=Australia|isbn=0-9589327-0-0|page=3|url=http://jesuschristians.com/JC/Library/Walk_of_Faith/02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mckay was a former member of the [[Family International|Children of God]] and left following disagreements over practices such as [[Flirty Fishing|flirty fishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Global Contemporary Christianity Movements, Institutions, and Allegiance|last=Barker|first=Eileen|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004310780|location=|pages=414–415|chapter=From the Children of God to the Family International - A Story of Radical Christianity and De-Radicalising Transformation|quote=Another schism, the Jesus Christians, was founded in Australia in 1981 by Dave MacKay (1944– ) following disagreements over practices such as flirty fishing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jesus Christians operated under several different names, including Christians; The Medowie Christian Volunteers; Australian Christian Volunteers, and Voices in the Wilderness.  The name 'Jesus Christians' was selected in 1996.  ("A Change of Name", August, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://cust.idl.net.au/fold/teach/JesusMoney/A%20Change%20of%20Name.html A Change of Name].

====Free work====
In 1983 Australian media followed members of the community who offered to do free work for one day for any
family or business which requested their assistance.&lt;ref name="Excommunicated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Excommunicated|url=http://jesuschristians.com/JC/Library/EXCOMM/chap5.html|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Money burning====
In 1984 group member Boyd Ellery was sentenced to three months prison in Sydney for burning an Australian dollar note in a statement about trusting God and not money. The protest was broadcast on national television by Mike Willisee.&lt;ref name="Excommunicated"/&gt;

====Messages with money====
In January 1985 the group glued Australian $2 notes to pavements to spell out messages against greed and money outside post offices around Victoria and New South Wales.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Christians history|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-days/706-jc-history-1981-1996|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=30 May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian messages also appeared written on a claimed AUS$100,000 worth of $2 notes in Sydney. The group claimed that as a result the federal police confiscated their mail until the Council for Civil Liberties intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JC History 1981-1986|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-days/706-jc-history-1981-1996|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nullarbor Walk====

[[File:Nullabor-Walkers.gif|thumb|Nullabor-Walkers clockwise from top left: Gary McKay, Robin Dunn, Roland Gianstefani, Christine McKay, Dane Frick, Malcolm Wrest, Rachel Sukamaran]]

In May and June 1985, six of the youngest members of the community, 12 -year-old Rachel Sukamaran, Malcolm Wrest, Roland Gianstefani, Robin Dunn and Gary McKay, headed by 15-year-old Christine McKay, walked 1,000 miles across the Nullarbor Desert in the interior of Australia without taking any money, provisions or support vehicle for their journey, prompting controversy and media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walkers Begged Say Locals|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-dayswalk-of-faith/772-walkers-begged-say-locals|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fall of America Prophecy====
In 1990, members of the group travelled to the United States to hand out 290,000 booklets prophesying America's destruction. They wore T-shirts with an upside down American flag (as a symbol of distress) and the caption "Pride Goeth Before a Fall" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern-Day Jeremiahs at Target Zero|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-daysother-campaigns/678-modern-day-jeremiahs-at-target-zero|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
In 1994, Rob &amp; Christine Dunn, Gary, Dave &amp; Cherry McKay, Ross Parry, Rachel Sukamaran, Malcolm Wrest, Craig, Kevin, Rols, Sue, Sinni, Liz, Boyd, Chris, Roshini, and Sheri were among Jesus Christian members who voluntarily cleaned sewers and toilets in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGirk|first=Tim|title=New Untouchables in Madras Sewers (reproduced on the JC website)|url=http://jesuschristians.com/early-daysvision-2000/276-new-untouchables-in-madras-sewers|publisher=The Age|date=26 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one protest where members stood in the sewer for a week to draw attention to the filth that spread disease, Craig Hendry contracted Typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australians find Godliness in Latrines and Sewers of Madras|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australians-find-godliness-in-latrines-and-sewers-of-madras-1425042.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=24 May 2013|location=London|first=Tim|last=Mcgirk|date=26 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the Jesus Christians converted a section of open sewer in Chennai into a children's playground.  The real estate created by covering the sewer was estimated to be worth AUD $950,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australians Good Intentions Drowned in an Indian Cesspit|url=http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=smh&amp;kw=Craig+Hendry&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news950227_0107_8952|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After one year the project was handed over to Indian charities to run, however the Indian government eventually demolished the site because it had been built on government land without permission.

====Nappy Chappies / Children of God====
In April 1997 and 1998 several Jesus Christians were arrested at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney dressed as babies in over-sized nappies while distributing "The Baby Books", highlighting how Jesus said his followers need to become like children to enter into God's Kingdom. The introduction of the books stated "We are children of God"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baby Books|url=http://jesuschristians.com/JC/Library/BB1/BB1.html|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to confusion about the group being the same as the [[Family International|Children of God]] group started by David Berg of the same name. This continuing confusion can be seen in a 2013 article which uses a photograph of the "Nappy Chappies" labelled as the Children of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=Elissa|title=Children snatched from their homes in dramatic raids on the Children of God sect in 1990s trials|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/children-snatched-from-their-homes-in-dramatic-raids-on-the-children-of-god-sect-in-1990s-trials/story-fnat7jnn-1226590249796|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Split====
In 1998 there was a split in the community. Craig and Yesamma Hendry and their family, Kevin and Elisabeth McKay, Boyd and Sheri Ellery and their family, Darren and Donna Cooke, Ray Sippel, Josh and Tim left the community in Australia. Boyd wrote to the remaining community "The Spirit you are following is not Christ's.  We will have no part of your hierarchies and fleshly importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strong Meat, A Collection of forty essays for mature Jesus Christians|last=McKay|first=Dave|date=|publisher=Jesus Christians|year=2003|isbn=|location=|publication-place=Repromen, Chennai, South India|page=156|pages=|chapter=29.

====Kyri and Berni Sheridan====
In July 1999, 19-year-old Kyri Sheridan joined the Jesus Christians in the UK.  His mother reported him missing to the Guildford Police in Surrey. Kyri (accompanied by fellow Jesus Christian Francisco Gonzales) signed in at the Guildford police station to state that he was not actually "missing".  The police confirmed Kyri was happy and making his own decision to be with the Jesus Christians. When his mother held Kyri to stop him from leaving she was pinned down, handcuffed and arrested by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother Slates Police for not Preventing Son Going off with Religious Cult |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/82096_mother_slates_police_for_not_preventing_her_son_going_off_with_religious_cult |publisher=Get Reading News |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130618031048/http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/82096_mother_slates_police_for_not_preventing_her_son_going_off_with_religious_cult |archivedate=18 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000-2010===
[[File:Bobby Kelly and Roland and Sue Gianstefani.jpg|thumb|Bobby Kelly (left) caused a British tabloid media frenzy by "disappearing" with the religious group "Jesus Christians" in June 2000 as a teenager. 17 years later Bobby poses with friends Roland and Sue Gianstefani who were convicted of contempt for refusing to reveal his whereabouts to a High Court judge.]]

====Bobby Kelly controversy====
On 14 July 2000 the group was splashed across the front page of the British tabloid [[Daily Express]], which declared that members Susan and Roland Gianstefani had [[kidnap]]ped a 16-year-old boy, Bobby Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Boy Camped with Cult as Hunt Went On|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/28/sarahhall.jeevanvasagar|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2000|location=London|first1=Sarah|last1=Hall|first2=Jeevan|last2=Vasagar|first3=Stephen|last3=Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby had picked up a Jesus Christians cartoon book called ''The Liberator'' in Romford High Street, Essex, near the end of June 2000,&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pook|first1=Sally|title=Police Find Sect Boy at Woodland Camp|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107120255/http://www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=467&amp;Itemid=8|accessdate=12 December 2017|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 July 2000|quote=A TEENAGER who vanished a month ago with a religious sect was found yesterday with two of its members in a tent in Hampshire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gone home to tell his grandmother about the Christian man he met.  Bobby went out again that afternoon and returned to tell his grandmother he wanted to join the Jesus Christians. A few days later "an Australian couple with their young son, a German and two English men" from the group visited and met Bobby's grandmother.&lt;ref name="Cult Kidnaps Boy Aged 16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendry|first1=Alex|title=Cult Kidnaps Boy Aged 16|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523125908/http:/www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=464&amp;Itemid=8|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=Express Newspaper|date=July 14, 2000|archivedate=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two weeks of July while Bobby was with the group, before the scandal had hit the headlines,  Bobby visited his youth worker from St. Peters Anglican Church in Harold Wood.  He had previously attended that church.  The youth worker, David Whitehouse, told the press a week later, "The group has a veneer of respectability, but there is something very disturbing about them.  When I saw Bobby a week ago, he was with three of them, and he seemed very scared, which was unlike him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendry|first1=Alex|title=Cult Kidnaps Boy Aged 16|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523125908/http:/www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=464&amp;Itemid=8|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=Express Newspaper|date=July 14, 2000|archivedate=May 2015|quote=David Whitehouse, a youth worker at St Peter's Church in Harold Wood, Essex, which Bobby attended, said: "He is a typical cheeky teenager and will talk to anybody and that's what happened here.  This group has a veneer of respectability but there is something very disturbing about them.  When I saw Bobby a week ago he was with three of them and he seemed very scared, which was unlike him."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before July 14, anti-cult expert, Graham Baldwin, was reportedly contacted by "someone close to the family who suspected that something was wrong, and did something to try to save him." It has not been established that David Whitehouse was the person who contacted him.  Baldwin worked for a charity, Catalyst, which helps families of people caught up in groups with whom the family disagrees.  A solicitor who "specialises in cases against cults" was hired after legal aid was acquired and the solicitor succeeded in getting an emergency High Court action to try to "rescue the schoolboy".&lt;ref name="Cult Kidnaps Boy Aged 16"/&gt; The front page newspaper report in ''The Express'' was published two weeks after Bobby first met the Jesus Christians with the story that Bobby had "disappeared" after he met the group: "Within hours Bobby had forsaken his possessions and moved in with the group.  The police were called and the airports and docks were put on the highest alert." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ronson|first1=Jon|title=Lost at Sea, The Jon Ronson Mysteries|date=2013|publisher=Pan Macmillan|location=Part Five, Blood Sacrifice|isbn=9781447246039|page=313|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DDlEpTj8iNIC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=cult+kidnaps+boy+age+16+Jesus+Christians+bobby+kelly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XKvGbzTne8&amp;sig=s9ZYce9fg5y4B2Zd07MCOWzcNPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcoMS-yfjXAhULDsAKHRJRByYQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=cult%20kidnaps%20boy%20age%2016%20Jesus%20Christians%20bobby%20kelly&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''The Express'' broke the story, instead of handing the boy over to the police, the Jesus Christians with Bobby "in tow" panicked went "on the run".  The UK Jesus Christians became fugitives for two weeks.

When the Jesus Christians could not be found in the nationwide search, and when Bobby started doing telephone interviews with the media declaring that he had not been kidnapped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy speaks out for sect|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/852109.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 May 2013|date=26 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; an emergency court ruling was made banning the broadcast of interviews with Bobby or the group, which the BBC successfully challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC barred over cult boy footage|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/838861.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=18 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bobby was eventually located hiding out with two Jesus Christian men, including Reinhard Zeuner, in a Hampshire forest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pook|first1=Sally|title=Police Find Sect Boy at Woodland Camp|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107120255/http://www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=467&amp;Itemid=8|accessdate=12 December 2017|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 July 2000|quote=A TEENAGER who vanished a month ago with a religious sect was found yesterday with two of its members in a tent in Hampshire.

No members of the Jesus Christians were charged with kidnapping but a charge of contempt of court (for failing to answer questions from the High Court judge) resulted in six-month sentences for Susan and Roland Gianstefani. The solicitor for the Gianstefani's told the court that the Gianstefani's feared Bobby might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cult Pair Freed after Bobby Plea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/853876.stm|website=BBC World Services|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=27 July 2000|quote=Mr Bain told the judge that Mr and Mrs Gianstefani feared Bobby might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes before the Gianstefanis were due to be sentenced, Bobby, who was kept in a separate room at the High Court, sent a note to the judge through the representative of the Official Solicitor saying that the Gianstefani's had acted nobly and they feared he (Bobby) might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cult Pair Freed after Bobby Plea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/853876.stm|website=BBC World Services|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=27 July 2000|quote=In his statement the teenager said the couple were acting "nobly" because they did not want a cult [[Deprogramming|deprogrammer]] to "get his hands on me"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby said: "I hope they don't get into trouble.

====Kidney donations====
Over half of the Jesus Christian members donated a kidney to people they did not know prior to agreeing to donate, thus earning them the nickname 'the kidney cult'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/kidney-cult-accused-of-pressuring-donor/2007/06/04/1180809387667.html Hospital refuses to accept kidney - National]. smh.com.au. Retrieved on 2010-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, [[Jon Ronson]]'s documentary called ''Kidneys for Jesus'' aired on [[Channel 4]] in the UK. After an invitation from Dave McKay, Jon Ronson followed the group over a year as they attempted to donate their kidneys to strangers in the UK and the US. The successful donations of members Casey Crouch, Robin Dunn and Susan Gianstefani are featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ronson|first=Jon|title=Blood Sacrifice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/apr/06/weekend.jonronson|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2013|location=London|date=6 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also documents the tension that arose between Ronson and McKay during filming: McKay became increasingly concerned that Ronson was portraying the Jesus Christians in a poor light and Ronson was concerned about McKay's ideas to try to manipulate a media storm around the donations as well as his role in the decisions made by members to donate kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ronson|first=Jon|title=Blood Sacrifice (part 2)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/apr/06/weekend.jonronson1|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 May 2013|location=London|date=6 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the group made headlines in Australia when the leader, David Mckay, revealed that members in Australia had lied to health authorities in order to be able to donate their kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cult push for Living Sacrifices|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/12892/?&amp;place=australia&amp;section=other-nrms}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mckay later admitted it was his teaching that if you must lie, be honest about your dishonesty.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC The Religion Report, full transcript|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/full-transcipt/3363172#transcript|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcast a report on Ash Falkingham's fight for his right to donate a kidney to a stranger. The documentary covers the attempts of his parents to thwart the young Jesus Christian's intentions and his final success. Ash left the community shortly afterwards to work restoring bicycles for a charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/austory/specials/bodyandsoul/default.htm Australian Story :: Body And Soul].

In 2005 a charge of abduction was made against Roland and Susan Gianstefani in Kenya, this time by the father of a 27-year-old single mother, Betty Njoroge, who had joined the community with her 7 year old son.

====Californian whipping trial====

[[File:Joseph Johnson Jesus Christian.jpg|thumb|Jesus Christian, Joseph Johnson, South London, 2006]]

In October 2006 Jesus Christians in the United States, along with Dave and Cherry McKay, held a mock trial in Long Beach, California where they charged the parents and two brothers of one of their members, Joseph Johnson, with attempted murder and with aiding and abetting others in doing this. It followed an attack on one of their members, Reinhard Zeuner, in which he received a fractured spine, bleeding on the brain, broken teeth and numerous cuts to the head and face. An amateur video was made of the attack,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cemriEzDiQk Christian Bashing Covered up by Police]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2010-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; but the police never prosecuted the case. Although the family did not attend the trial, various sentences of 5-25 lashes of the whip were carried out on volunteers from the Jesus Christians themselves, as an attempt to illustrate their understanding of the cross of Christ.  "God hates the sin, but loves the sinner", they said, in an effort to summarize what they were doing.

====''The Jeremy Kyle Show''====
On 11 December 2007, Dave and Cherry McKay and Roland and Susan Gianstefani were interviewed on stage as part of a two-day feature on religious cults on the UK television programme ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]''. The show attempted to link the Jesus Christians with such groups as [[Jim Jones]]' [[People's Temple]], and the [[Family International|Children of God]]. Dave and Cherry and Roland and Sue were questioned by [[Jeremy Kyle]] and opponents of David McKay.  At one point, due to the nature of the questioning, Dave McKay refused to reply to any more questions and McKay walked out of the interview and then returned to say "Just let them do their thing".

In February 2008, Roland, Susan and Daniel Gianstefani were featured on the Channel 4 program ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/W/wifeswap/episodes_s9_1.html Wife Swap].

====Sydney whipping trial====
In July 2010 Jesus Christians held a mock trial in Sydney, Australia, to draw attention to the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners who were being persecuted in China.  The "court" heard testimonies of victims, then Alf Montagu and Jayme Kronmiller submitted to 25 lashes of the whip as a form of substitutionary punishment for the former leader of the [[Communist Party of China]], [[Jiang Zemin]], and the Secret Police, [[Luo Gan]], who unsurprisingly did not attend the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NTD Chinese News|url=http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/b5/2010/07/30/a416302.html#video|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Chinese NTD News|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gianstefanis leave, Group dispersal claimed by Founder.====
In August 2010, long term members Roland, Susan and Daniel Gianstefani left the community after "numerous tensions over their parenting skills". This followed "a number of community discussions", according to the Jesus Christians Newsletter. Susan and Roland had been members of the group for more than twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Christians Newsletter #126 August 2010|url=http://forum.culteducation.com/read.php?12,10965,90072|accessdate=28 May 2013}}{{better source|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- This is a link to an internet forum --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Roland and Susan Gianstefani, continue to identify as Jesus Christians.&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/jesus-christians-uk&lt;/ref&gt; Their current ministry is now focused on anti war and human rights activism.&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/home/anti-war-pro-transparency-activism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/home/about&lt;/ref&gt;

November 2010: Founder, David McKay claims the group has disbanded, graduated or dispersed.&lt;ref name="jesuschristians.com"&gt;http://www.jesuschristians.com/teachings-page/recent-articles/recent-deep-thoughts/831-graduates&lt;/ref&gt;
Long Term members, Roland and Sue Gianstefani and Ross Parry claim they have been excommunicated at this time from all correspondence with other members at the behest of McKay, for objecting to changes in the dishonest manner in which the group is to operate.&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/jesus-christians-uk/disbanding&lt;/ref&gt;
Another member, Alan Wright, is also disfellowshipped from the group for refusing to comply with dictates from the groups leadership regarding not suing his wife for more money in a divorce settlement.&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/jesus-christians-uk/kicked-out&lt;/ref&gt;

====End Time Survivors====

[[File:Paul Henry End Time Survivors - Jesus Christian, London, 2017.jpg|thumb|Paul Henry End Time Survivors - Jesus Christian, London, 2017|Paul Henry, AKA Bruce, Jesus Christian and End Time Survivor, distributes literature outside of Kings College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, November 7, 2017]]

Since the founder David Mckay´s announcement in 2010 of either disbandment or graduation or dispersal, there is some confusion with regard to the continuing organisation of members of Jesus Christians.&lt;ref name="jesuschristians.com"/&gt;

Roland and Susan Gianstefani still identify as Jesus Christians UK, but have been excommunicated by the founder.  Evidence that Jesus Christians appear to be operating under the name of ''End Time Survivors'' with Dave and Cherry Mckay continuing to lead the group in a more covert form has recently come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Global Contemporary Christianity Movements, Institutions, and Allegiance|last=Barker|first=Eileen|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004310780|location=|pages=415|quote=Frequent disagreements and breakups eventually led to the movement being officially disbanded in 2010. However, the official website still exists at the time of writing, and it has been reported that MacKay continues to operate at a covert level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 Roland and Susan Gianstefani had a live radio interview with Bobby Kelly on a Welsh radio station where they discussed their life and the controversies they were involved in when they were a part of the community now called ''End Times Survivors'', formerly called the ''Jesus Christians'' community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with activists Roland and Sue Gianstefani (32:10)|url=http://www.rbfmlive.co.uk/interview-with-activists-roland-and-sue-gianstefani/|publisher=RBFM live|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2017 at the annual conference of ''The Australian Association for the Study of Religion'' in Sydney, an academic paper was presented with a formal discussion about a [[New religious movement]] that was founded in Australia in the 1980s and led by Dave and Cherry McKay.  The author, Geraldine Smith, described the movement as a "Christian millennialist group" called the "End Time Survivors (ETS)". 
There is evidence that a web site and YouTube channel called "End Time Survivors" appeared in 2015. Several ex members of the Jesus Christians know and recognise voices and faces of Jesus Christians long term members despite minor attempts to digitally obscure their identities. Ex members, Roland and Sue Gianstefani assert that it has been a deliberate long term plan by David McKay to take the group underground and hide its identity from the public, by presenting the group or groups under different names while claiming loose associations between members living in different locations. They assert that the influence of the founder over these groups and their real identities is to be kept hidden from the public in order to avoid persecution.&lt;ref&gt;http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/jesus-christians-uk/going-underrground&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Led by Dave and Cherry Mckay a movement mostly based in Australia but with significant global outreach. This movement derives its guiding ethos from a very particular reading of The Bible that prioritises the teachings of Jesus as an apocalyptic figure."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Geraldine|title=The Millenialists Project: A Comparative Study Between the End of Time Survivors and Survivalism in Western Modernity|url=https://www.aasr.org.au/conference-program/|publisher=The Australian Association for the Study of Religion|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EndTime Survivors website contains many identical teachings from the Jesus Christians and promotes David McKay's books [[Survivors (novel)|''Survivors'']], ''Armageddon for Beginners''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armageddon for Beginners|url=http://www.endtimesurvivors.com/books-and-pamphlets|website=End Time Survivors|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus Christian pamphlets such as ''Christian But Not Religious''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian But Not Religious|url=http://www.endtimesurvivors.com/books-and-pamphlets/christian-but-not-religious|website=EndTime Survivors|publisher=Jesus Christians|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many of the Jesus Christians articles from their website.
"End Time Survivors" also appears as a you tube channel and is linked to "Voice in the Desert" with similar topics.

''[[Survivors (novel)|Survivors]]'' is a response to the popular ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind series]]'' of novels on Bible prophecy, written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. In its own words, ''Survivors'' attempts to include material that was left out of the LaHaye-Jenkins series. Mckay has also published a second book in the series, entitled ''Listening''. It purports to be an "equel" (sic) to ''Survivors'', taking place during the same time period, although from another viewpoint. A third book, also set during the same time period as the first two, is entitled ''Destroyers''. It is available on the JC website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jesus-teachings.com/component/kunena/8-survivorsendtime-issues/19671-qdestroyersq]. www.jesus-teachings.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and was released in paperback from around Christmas 2008. The story for that mostly takes place in Kenya and is told through the perspective of someone who takes the mark of the beast.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

As of 2009, the Jesus Christians had produced several videos, including a documentary expounding on various aspects of their lifestyle.  They had also produced several music videos. Their latest videos included a documentary (''The Tyrant Within'') about the implementation of RFID microchip implants and a video about the justice system, its effect on society and a radical Christian approach to mixing justice with mercy (''Beyond Justice'').

While a student at Cambridge, Sacks traveled to New York to meet Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]], to discuss a variety of issues relating to religion, faith and philosophy. Schneerson urged Sacks to seek rabbinic ordination and to enter the rabbinate.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sacks, [http://www.chabad.org/1690783 "How The Rebbe Changed My Life"]. 28 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sacks's first rabbinic appointment (1978–1982) was as the Rabbi for the [[Golders Green]] synagogue in London. In 1983, he became Rabbi of the prestigious [[Marble Arch]] synagogue in [[Central London]], a position he held until 1990. Between 1984 and 1990, Sacks also served as [[Principal (university)|Principal]] of Jews' College, the world's oldest{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Seminary#Jewish|rabbinical seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbisacks.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RABBI-LORD-JONATHAN-SACKS-extended-CV-September-20131.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sacks was inducted{{by whom|date=January 2017}} to serve as [[Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth]] on 1 September 1991, a position he held until 1 September 2013.

A visiting professor at several universities in Britain, the United States and Israel, Sacks holds 16 honorary degrees, including a [[Doctor of Divinity|doctorate of divinity]] conferred on him in September 2001 by the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Lord Carey]], to mark his first ten years in office as Chief Rabbi. In recognition of his work, Sacks has won several international awards, including the Jerusalem Prize in 1995 for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life and The Ladislaus Laszt Ecumenical and Social Concern Award from Ben Gurion University in Israel in 2011.&lt;ref name="rabbisacks.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rabbisacks.org/about-us/|title= About Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks - Rabbi Sacks|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacks' contributions to wider British society have also been recognised. A regular contributor to national media, frequently appearing on [[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Thought for the Day]]'' or writing the Credo column or opinion pieces in ''[[The Times]]'', Sacks was awarded The Sanford St Martin's Trust Personal Award for 2013 for "his advocacy of Judaism and religion in general".

At a Gala Dinner held in Central London in May 2013 to mark the completion of the Chief Rabbi's time in office, [[HRH The Prince of Wales]] called Sacks a "light unto this nation", "a steadfast friend" and "a valued adviser" whose "guidance on any given issue has never failed to be of practical value and deeply grounded in the kind of wisdom that is increasingly hard to come by".&lt;ref&gt;

===Chief Rabbi===
In his Installation address upon succeeding [[Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits|Lord Jakobovits]] as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in September 1991, Sacks called for a Decade of Renewal which would "revitalize British Jewry's great powers of creativity".&lt;ref name="jta.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1991/09/03/archive/new-british-chief-rabbi-speaks-of-need-for-decade-of-renewal|title=New British Chief Rabbi Speaks of Need for Decade of Renewal|date=3 September 1991|publisher=JTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said this renewal should be based on five central values: "love of every Jew, love of learning, love of God, a profound contribution to British society and an unequivocal attachment to Israel."&lt;ref name="jta.org"/&gt; Sacks said he wanted to be "a catalyst for creativity, to encourage leadership in others, and to let in the fresh air of initiative and imagination".&lt;ref name="jta.org"/&gt; This led to a series of innovative communal projects including Jewish Continuity, a national foundation for Jewish educational programmes and outreach; the Association of Jewish Business Ethics; the Chief Rabbinate Awards for Excellence; the Chief Rabbinate Bursaries, and Community Development, a national scheme to enhance Jewish community life. The Chief Rabbi began his second decade of office with a call to 'Jewish Responsibility' and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torahinmotion.org/users/rabbi-lord-jonathan-sacks|title=Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and views==
Much has been written about Sacks' philosophical contribution to Judaism and beyond, most recently in three works: (1) a volume on his work entitled ''Universalizing Particularity'' that forms part of The Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers series, edited by Hava Tirosh-Samuelson and Aaron W. Hughes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jonathan-Sacks-Universalizing-Particularity-Tirosh-Samuelson/dp/B00L6Z97B6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417771891&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=universalizing%20particularity|title=[(Jonathan Sacks: Universalizing Particularity )]|first=Hava|last=Tirosh-Samuelson|date=1 October 2013|publisher=Brill|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) a book entitled ''Radical Responsibility'' edited by Michael J.

===Early influencers===
In a pamphlet written to mark the completion of his time as Chief Rabbi entitled "A Judaism Engaged with the World",&lt;ref name="engaged"&gt;[http://www.rabbisacks.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Judaism_Engaged_JSacks_webpdf2.pdf] A Judaism Engaged with the World&lt;/ref&gt; Sacks cites three individuals who have had a profound impact on his own philosophical thinking. The first figure was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, [[Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] who "was fully aware of the problem of the missing Jews... inventing the idea, revolutionary in its time, of Jewish outreach... [He] challenged me to lead."&lt;ref name="engaged"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Indeed, Sacks called him "one of the greatest Jewish leaders, not just of our time, but of all time"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Mark, [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/chief_rabbi_and_rebbe The Chief Rabbi And The Rebbe]. ''The Jewish Week'', 11/29/11.&lt;/ref&gt; The second was Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] whom Sacks described as "the greatest Orthodox thinker of the time [who] challenged me to think."&lt;ref name="engaged"/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

Sacks argued that for Rav Soloveichik "Jewish philosophy, he said, had to emerge from halakhah, Jewish law. Jewish thought and Jewish practice were not two (sic) different things but the same thing seen from different perspectives. Halakhah was a way of living a way of thinking about the world – taking abstract ideas and making them real in everyday life."&lt;ref name="engaged"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The third figure was Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, a former principal of the [[London School of Jewish Studies]].

Sacks called Rabinovitch "One of the great Maimonidean scholars of our time, [who] he taught us, his students, that Torah leadership demands the highest intellectual and moral courage. He did this in the best way possible: by personal example. The following thoughts, which are his, are a small indication of what I learned from him – not least that Torah is, among other things, a refusal to give easy answers to difficult questions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation-5768-shemot-of-what-was-moses-afraid/] Of What Was Moses Afraid? Covenant &amp; Conversation for Shemot 5768 by R. Sacks&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universalism vs particularism===
As a rabbi, social philosopher, proponent of interfaith dialogue and public intellectual, Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that "his [Sacks's] vision—informed as it is by the concerns of modern Orthodoxy—is paradoxically one of the most universalizing voices within contemporary Judaism. Sacks possesses a rare ability to hold in delicate balance the universal demands of the modern, multicultural world with the particularism associated with Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, Aaron W. Hughes |year=2013 |title=Jonathan Sacks: Universalizing Particularity |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004249813 |chapter=Jonathan Sacks: An Intellectual Portrait |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} This is a view supported by Rabbi Nathan Lopez Cardozo who wrote in The Jerusalem Post that Sacks' "confidence in the power of Judaism and its infinite wisdom enabled him to enter the lion's den, taking on famous philosophers, scientists, religious thinkers and sociologists and showing them that Judaism had something to teach that they couldn't afford to miss if they wanted to be at the forefront of philosophy and science."&lt;ref&gt;"The rebellion of Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks", ''The Jerusalem Post'', 7 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Harris and Rynhold, in their introduction to ''Radical Responsibility'' argued that: "The special contribution made by the thought of Chief Rabbi Sacks is that it not only continues the venerable Jewish philosophical tradition of maintaining traditional faith in the face of external intellectual challenges, but also moves beyond this tradition by showing how core Jewish teachings can address the dilemmas of the secular world itself. What make Lord Sacks' approach so effective is that he is able to do so without any exception of the wider world taking on Judaism's theological beliefs."&lt;ref name="Radical Responsibility"/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

===Torah v'Chokhma===
The framework for Sacks' philosophical approach and his interaction between the universal and the particular is not too dissimilar from those positions adopted by other leading Orthodox thinkers of recent times. The favoured phrase of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was ''Torah im derekh eretz'', 'Torah and general culture'; for Rabbi Norman Lamm it was ''Torah u-mada''. 'Torah and Science'. For Sacks, his favoured phrase has been ''Torah vehokhmah'', 'Torah and Wisdom'. As noted in the introduction to ''Radical Responsibility'': "''Torah'', for Jonathan Sacks represents the particularistic, inherited teachings of Judaism, while ''hokhmah'' (wisdom) refers to the universal realm of the sciences and humanities."&lt;ref name="Radical Responsibility"/&gt;{{rp|xviii}} Framed in religious terms, as Sacks sets out in his book ''Future Tense'': "Chokhmah is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. Chokhmah is the universal language of humankind; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. Chokhmah is what we attain by being in the image of God; Torah is what guides Jews as the people of God. Chokhmah is acquired by seeing and reasoning; Torah is received by listening and responding. Chokhmah tells us what is; Torah tells us what ought to be."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sacks, ''Future Tense'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2009), p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that whilst ''Torah v'Chokhmah'' is certainly a valid overarching framework, they note that Sacks' perspective is one rooted in modern orthodoxy: "Although he [Sacks] will try to understand various denominations of Judaism, he is always quick to point out that Orthodoxy cannot recognize the legitimacy of interpretations of Judaism that abandon fundamental beliefs of halakhic (Jewish law) authority. Judaism that departs from the truth and acceptance of the halakha is a departure from authentic Judaism and, he reasons, is tantamount to the accommodation of secularism. So, while Sacks will develop a highly inclusive account of the world's religions, there were times when he was critical of the denominations ''within'' Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;Universalizing Particularity, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

==="No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth"===
After the publication of his book ''The Dignity of Difference'', a group of [[Haredi]] rabbis, most notably Rabbis [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and [[Bezalel Rakow]], accused Sacks of heresy against what they consider the traditional Orthodox viewpoint. According to them, some words seemed to imply an endorsement of pure relativism between religions, and that Judaism is not the sole true religion, e.g. "No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth." This led him to rephrase more clearly some sentences in the book for its second edition, though he refused to recall books already in the stores.&lt;ref name="Petre"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1422145/Chief-Rabbi-revises-book-after-attack-by-critics.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Chief Rabbi revises book after attack by critics | first=Jonathan | last=Petre | date=15 February 2003 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Preface to the Second Edition" of the book, Sacks wrote that certain passages in the book had been misconstrued: He had already explicitly criticised cultural and religious relativism in his book, and he did not deny Judaism's uniqueness. He also stressed, however, that mainstream rabbinic teachings teach that wisdom, righteousness, and the possibility of a true relationship with God are all available in non-Jewish cultures and religions as an ongoing heritage from the covenant that God made with Noah and all his descendants, so the tradition teaches that one does not need to be Jewish to know God or truth, or to attain salvation.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Jonathan Sacks 2003"&gt;Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, ''The Dignity of Difference'', 2nd edition, 2003, pp. vii, 52–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chiefrabbi.org"&gt;[http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=454 Faith Lectures: Jewish Identity: The Concept of a Chosen People].

===Efforts to accommodate Haredi Jews===
A book by the British historian and journalist Meir Persoff, ''Another Way, Another Time'', has argued that "Sacks's top priority has been staying in the good graces of the Haredi, or strictly Orthodox, faction, whose high birthrate has made it the fastest-growing component of British Jewry."&lt;ref name="MP9996"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/blogpost/is-sacks-britain%E2%80%99s-last-chief-rabbi |title=Is Sacks Britain’s Last Chief Rabbi? |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2013 |author=MP9996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the non-Orthodox denominations===
Sacks provoked considerable controversy in the Anglo-Jewish community in 1996 when he refused to attend the funeral service of the late [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Rabbi [[Hugo Gryn]] and for a private letter he had written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], which (in translation) asserted that Auschwitz survivor Gryn was "among those who destroy the faith", was leaked and published. He wrote further that he was an "enemy" of the Reform, Liberal and Masorti movements, leading some to reject the notion that he is "Chief Rabbi" for all Jews in Britain. He attended a memorial meeting for Gryn, a move that brought the wrath of some in the ultra-Orthodox community.&lt;ref name="Defender"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/jonathan-sacks-defender-of-the-faith-9222878.html | title= Jonathan Sacks: Defender of the faith | work=[[The Independent]] | date=8 September 2001 | accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ian Burrell, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/leaked-letter-widens-schism-in-jewry-1272921.html "Leaked letter widens schism in Jewry"], ''The Independent'', 15 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Dow Marmur, an Israel-based progressive Rabbi, argued that after attending the memorial service, Sacks then attempted to placate the ultra-Orthodox community, an attempt which Marmur has described as "neurotic and cowardly."&lt;ref name= "Criticised"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/40113/lord-sacks-criticised-progressive-rabbi | title=Lord Sacks criticised by progressive rabbi | work= [[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=22 October 2010 | accessdate=12 October 2013 | first =Simon | last = Rocker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in a letter to ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' in May 2013, Jackie Gryn, the widow of Rabbi Gryn, wrote: "I feel the time has come for me to lay to rest, once and for all , the idea… that there ever was a ‘Hugo Gryn Affair’, as far as I am concerned, regarding the absence of the Chief Rabbi at the funeral of my late husband, Hugo… From the beginning, relations were cordial and sympathetic and have remained so", she wrote. "There has never been any personal grievance between us concerning his non-attendance at the funeral, which promoted such venomous and divisive comments and regrettably continues to do so."&lt;ref name= "No more"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/107306/no-more-talk-gryn-affair-says-hugos-wife | title=No more talk of Gryn Affair, says Hugo's wife | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=9 May 2013 | accessdate= 28 November 2015 | author=Simon Rocker | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacks responded to the incident by rethinking his relationship with the non-Orthodox movements, eventually developing what he called the "two principles".  Responding to an interview shortly before his retirement, he wrote that "You try and make things better in the future. As a result of the turbulence at that time, I was forced to think this whole issue through and I came up with these two principles; on all matters that affect us as Jews regardless of our religious differences we work together regardless of our religious differences, and on all things that touch our religious differences we agree to differ, but with respect. As a result of those two principles, relations between Reform and Orthodox have got much better and are actually a model for the rest of the Jewish world. Progressive rabbis sit with me on the top table of the Council of Christians and Jews, we stand together for Israel.  All of this flowed from those two principles. Until then there had been a view never to do anything with the non-Orthodox movements but once you thought it through you saw that there were all sorts of opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sacks |first1= Jonathan|title=Lord Sacks: The full interview (The Jewish News)|url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/lord-sacks-the-full-interview//|website= The Times of Israel |accessdate=19 August 2017|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Sacks would later draw some criticism when he and his Beth Din prevented the retired Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]], who had helped establish the British branch of the [[Conservative Judaism |Masorti movement]], from being called up for the [[Reading of the Torah]] on the Saturday before his granddaughter's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article682446.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location= London | title=Rabbi Dr Louis Jacobs | date=4 July 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secularism and Europe's changing demographics===
Sacks has expressed concern at what he regards as the negative effects of materialism and secularism in European society, arguing that they undermine the basic values of family life and lead to selfishness. In 2009, Sacks gave an address claiming that Europeans have chosen consumerism over the self-sacrifice of parenting children, and that "the major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians". He argued that Europe is in population decline "because non-believers lack shared values of family and community that religion has".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/6507782/Europeans-too-selfish-to-have-children-says-Chief-Rabbi.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Europeans too selfish to have children, says Chief Rabbi |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/05/birth-rate-chief-rabbi-sacks |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Falling birth rate is killing Europe, says chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumerism and Steve Jobs===
Rabbi Sacks made remarks at an inter-faith reception attended by the Queen, in November 2011, in which he criticised what he believed to be the selfish consumer culture that has only brought unhappiness. "The consumer society was laid down by the late Steve Jobs coming down the mountain with two tablets, iPad one and iPad two, and the result is that we now have a culture of iPod, iPhone, iTune, i, i, i. When you're an individualist, egocentric culture and you only care about 'I', you don’t do terribly well."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8899737/Chief-Rabbi-blames-Apple-for-helping-create-selfish-society.html Chief Rabbi blames Apple for helping create selfish society].

===Position on gay marriage===
In July 2012 a group of prominent British Jews criticised Sacks for opposing plans to allow [[civil marriage]] for gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Gay marriage"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/69523/chief-rabbi-lord-sacks-attacked-over-gay-marriage-opposition | title=Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks attacked over gay marriage opposition | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=5 July 2012 | accessdate=12 October 2013 | last =Rocker | first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that he understands "the fear that gays have of prejudice and persecution"&lt;ref name="plight of gays in Britain"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10264449/I-understand-gay-peoples-fears-says-Chief-Rabbi-Lord-Sacks.html | title=I understand gay people's fears, says Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks | work=[[The Daily Telegraph |The Telegraph]] | date=25 Aug 2013 | accessdate=27 November 2016 | last =Malnick | first = Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to say, in a lecture on the institution of marriage, that a world that persecutes homosexuals is one "to which we should never return."&lt;ref name="“The love that brings new life into the world” – Rabbi Sacks on the institution of marriage"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sacks|first1=Jonathan|title= Rabbi|url=http://www.rabbisacks.org/love-brings-new-life-world-rabbi-sacks-institution-marriage/|publisher=humanum.global|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith dialogue===
Rabbi Sacks is an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the [[Elijah Interfaith Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/index.php?id=732 The Elijah Interfaith Institute] - Jewish Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics in the United States under Trump===
In October 2017, Jonathan Sacks inveighed against a “politics of anger” he said was corroding the fabric of U.S. society. “The politics of anger that’s emerged in our time is full of danger,” Sacks said. He decried the breakdown of American society into narrower and narrower identities that nurtured a “culture of grievances.” Sacks warned that “The social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/2017-irving-kristol-award-recipient-rabbi-lord-jonathan-sacks-remarks/|title=2017 Irving Kristol Award recipient Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks' remarks - AEI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semitism===
In 2013, before he became Labour Party leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]] complained that the Palestinian ambassador had been “berated” by “Zionists” who “don't understand English irony”, while the ambassador “does understand English irony”.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Corbyn [http://labourbriefing.squarespace.com/home/2018/8/29/full-texxt-of-that-speech-by-jeremy-on-zionists-and-a-sense-of-irony “Full text of that speech by Jeremy on the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, English irony and certain Zionist critics”], [“Britain’s Legacy in Palestine” conference, 19 January 2013, Friends Meeting House, Palestinian Return Centre], ''Labour Briefing'' website, 29 August, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Rabbi Sacks said these remarks depicted Jews as alien to the UK and that now “we have an anti-Semite as the leader of the Labour Party.”&lt;ref&gt;George Eaton, [https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/corbyn-s-zionist-remarks-were-most-offensive-enoch-powell-says-ex-chief-rabbi “Corbyn’s ‘Zionist’ remarks were ‘most offensive’ since Enoch Powell, says ex-chief rabbi!”], ''New Statesman'', 28 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his remarks, multiple Corbyn supporters made critical statements about Sacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Corbyn-supporters-hound-Rabbi-Sacks-for-labeling-Labour-leader-antisemite-566132 CORBYN SUPPORTERS HOUND RABBI SACKS FOR LABELING LABOUR LEADER ANTISEMITE], JPost, Jeremy Sharon, 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kalasha.jpg|thumb|The Purna-Kalasha]]
A '''kalasha''', also spelled '''kalash''' or '''kalasa''' ({{lang-sa|कलश}}, {{IAST|kalaśa}}; {{lang-ta|பூரணகும்பம்}}, {{IAST|pooranakumbham}}, literally "pitcher, pot"), is a metal ([[brass]], [[copper]], [[silver]] or [[gold]]) pot with a large base and small mouth, large enough to hold a [[coconut]].

Sometimes "Kalasha" also refers to such a pot filled with water and topped with a coronet of [[mango]] leaves and a coconut.  This combination is often used in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rites and depicted in [[Hindu iconography]]. The entire arrangement is called '''Purna-Kalasha''' ({{lang|sa|पूर्णकलश}}), '''Purna-Kumbha''' ({{lang|sa|पूर्णकुम्भ}}), or '''Purna-ghata''' ({{lang|sa|पूर्णघट}}).  Each of these names literally means "full or complete vessel" when the pot is referred to as the Kalasha (to avoid confusion, this article will refer to the pot as Kalasha and the entire arrangement as Purna-Kalasha). Sometimes the Kalasha is filled with coins, grain, gems, gold, or a combination of these items instead of water. The coronet of 5, 7, or 11 mango leaves is placed such that the tips of the leaves touch water in the Kalasha. The coconut is sometimes wrapped with a red cloth and red thread; the top of the coconut (called ''Shira'' – literally "head") is kept uncovered. A sacred thread is tied around the metal pot. The Shira is kept facing the sky. 
The Kalasha is viewed as an auspicious object in [[Jainism]]. The Kalasha is used as a ceremonial object as well as a decorative motif in [[Indian art]] and [[Indian architecture|architecture]]. The Kalasha motif was used in decorating bases and [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of pillars from the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Students' Britannica India'' by Dale Hoiberg,ani p. 183 Published 2000, Popular Prakashan, {{ISBN|0-85229-760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==In Hinduism==
[[File:Kalash pujan.jpg|Thumb|thumb|Worship of a Kalasha]] 

[[File:Bhuvanesvar1022.jpg|Thumb|thumb|Relief detail on [[ Baitala Deula ]]temple with the symbol of Purna Kalasha surrounded by garlands. ]]

The Purna-Kalasha is considered a symbol of abundance and "source of life" in the [[Veda]]s. 
Purna-[[Kumbha]] is preeminently a [[Vedic]] motif, known from the time of [[Rigveda]]. It is also called Soma-Kalasha, Chandra-Kalasha, Indra-Kumbha, Purnaghata, Purna-Virakamsya, Bhadra ghata, or Mangala ghata. It is referred to as "overflowing full vase" (purno-asya Kalasha) in the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Abode of Mahashiva: Cults and Symbology in Jaunsar-Bawar in the Mid Himalayas'' by Madhu Jain. Contributor O. C. Handa. Published 1995, Indus Publishing. 199 pages {{ISBN|81-7387-030-6}} p. 171 "Drona Parva, 11, 29"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalasha is believed to contain [[amrita]], the elixir of life, and thus is viewed as a symbol of abundance, wisdom, and immortality. The Kalasha is often seen in Hindu iconography as an attribute, in the hands of Hindu deities like the creator god [[Brahma]], the destroyer god [[Shiva]] as a teacher, and the goddess of prosperity [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning'' by Eva Rudy Jansen&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purna-Kalasha is believed to be a symbol of auspiciousness embodying either [[Ganesha]], remover of obstacles, or his mother [[Parvati|Gauri]], the goddess of household bounty or [[Lakshmi]]. The Purna-Kalasha is worshipped in all Hindu festivities related to marriage and childbirth, as a mother goddess or [[Devi]]. In this context, the metal pot or Kalasha represents material things: a container of fertility - the earth and the [[womb]], which nurtures and nourishes life. The mango leaves associated with [[Kamadeva|Kama]], the god of love, symbolize the pleasure aspect of fertility. The coconut, a cash crop, represents prosperity and power. The water in the pot represents the life-giving ability of Nature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine'' by Devdutt Pattanaik p.54 Published 2000, Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company , 176 pages, {{ISBN|0-89281-807-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a silver or brass face of the Goddess is attached over the coconut of the Purna-Kalasha. In this form, the Purna-Kalasha symbolizes the Goddess as the manifestation of mother earth with her water, minerals, and vegetation. This method of ''Kalash [[puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]'' (worship) has come in for [[Vishnu]] in household functions too.&lt;ref&gt;''Flipside of Hindu Symbolism (Sociological and Scientific Linkages in Hinduism)'' by M. K. V. Narayan p.137 Published 2007, Fultus Corporation, 200 pages, {{ISBN|1-59682-117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purna-Kalasha is also worshipped at Hindu ceremonies like ''Griha Pravesha'' (house warming), child naming, ''[[havan]]'' (fire-sacrifice), ''[[Vaastu]] dosha'' rectification, and daily worship.

Other intrepretations of the Purna-Kalasha associate with the five [[Mahabhuta|elements]] or the [[chakra]]s. The wide base of metal pot represents the element [[Prithvi]] (Earth), the expanded centre - [[Ap (water)]], neck of pot - [[Agni]] (fire), the opening of the mouth - [[Vayu]] (air), and the coconut and mango leaves - [[Akasha]] (aether). In contexts of chakras, the ''Shira'' (literally "head") - top of the coconut symbolizes ''[[Sahasrara]] chakra'' and the ''Moola'' (literally "base") - base of Kalasha - the ''[[Muladhara]] chakra''.&lt;ref&gt;''India: Known Things, Unknown Secrets'' by R. Venugopalan pp.130-132 Published 2004
B. Jain Publishers 290 pages {{ISBN|81-8056-373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A kalash is placed with due rituals on all important occasions. It is placed near the entrance as a sign of welcome. It is also used in a traditional manner while receiving holy personages.

==In Jainism==

The Kalasha is included in the [[Ashtamangala]] lists of both the [[Svetambara]] and [[Digambar]]a sects of [[Jainism]]. Two eyes are depicted around the Kalasha, symbolising right faith and right knowledge. It is used for religious and social ceremonies. It is used in temples when certain images are being worshipped. When one enters a new home it is customary to carry the kalasha on the head reciting mantras. This ceremony is performed to welcome grace and happiness into the new home. They first appear in stone in the [[Kushan Empire]] period (65-224 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-violence'' by Kurt Titze and Klaus Bruhn p.234 Published 1998, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 267 pages, {{ISBN|81-208-1534-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a symbol of auspiciousness.

==In heraldry==

The Kalasha is part of the official [[Emblem of Andhra Pradesh|state emblem]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] state in [[India]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ap.gov.in/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Kemetism''' (also '''Kemeticism'''; both from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|kmt}}'', usually voweled [[Egypt#Names|Kemet]], the native name of [[Ancient Egypt]]), also sometimes referred to as '''Neterism''' (from ''{{lang|egy-Latn|nṯr}}'' ([[Coptic language|Coptic]] {{lang|cop|ⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ}} ''noute'') "[[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]]"), or '''Egyptian Neopaganism''', is the contemporary revival of [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] and related expressions of religion in [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[late antiquity|late]] antiquity, emerging during the 1970s. A ''Kemetic'' is one who follows Kemetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Daugherty|first=Michelle|title=Kemetism_Ancient Religions in our Modern World|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/2014/10/02/kemetism-ancient-religions-in-our-modern-world/|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=[[Michigan State University]]|date=2 October 2014|location =USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several main groups, each of which take a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from [[eclecticism|eclectic]] to [[polytheistic reconstructionist|reconstructionistic]]. However, all of these can be identified as belonging to three strains, including reconstructed [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Kemetism (adopting a philological approach, also [[Kemetic Orthodoxy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, PM (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="242084">A '''[[New Testament minuscule]]''' is a copy of a portion of the [[New Testament]] written in a small, cursive Greek script (developed from [[Uncial script|Uncial]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minuscules 1001-1500==
* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Caspar René Gregory]], often referred to as the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbers.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 100 year increment where specific date is unknown.
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s, The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline epistles]], and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="powderblue"|Light blue color indicates manuscript not imaged, and is currently lost or ownership unknown.
|-
|bgcolor="mistyrose"|Light pink color indicates manuscript destroyed, presumed destroyed, or deemed too fragile to digitize.
|-
|bgcolor="violet"|Violet color indicates high resolution ultraviolet images available online.
|}
&lt;br&gt;
† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates only a portion of the books were included. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates lost portions of manuscript replaced via supplement of a later hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;abs&lt;/sup&gt; (''abschrift'') Indicates manuscript is copy. All of these have now received new numbers from the INTF.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was formerly numbered as a copy of another manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, was found to be written in modern Greek versus Koine Greek, or has been destroyed.&lt;br&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
!#!!Date!!Contents!!Pages!!Institution!!City, State!!Country!!Images&lt;ref&gt;The two primary collections of manuscript images include the CSNTM ( {{cite web|url=http://www.csntm.org/Manuscript | title=Manuscript Search|publisher=Center for the Student of New Testament Manuscripts |accessdate=2016-08-26}}) and the INTF ( {{cite web|url=http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/manuscript-workspace/| title=Manuscript Workspace|publisher=''Institut für Neutestamentliche Textforschung''|accessdate=2016-08-26}}) Other hosted images are referenced separately.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''misbaḥah'' ({{lang-ar|مِسْبَحَة|misbaḥa}}), ({{lang-ar|سُبْحَة|subḥa}}) ([[Arabic]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Hindi-Urdu]]), ({{lang-ar|تَسْبِيح|tasbīḥ}}) ([[Iran]], [[Tajikistan]] &amp; [[Afghanistan]]), or ''tespih'' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] &amp;  [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), is a string of [[beads]] which is often used by [[Muslims]] to keep track of counting in [[tasbih]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J6JlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT554&amp;dq=misbaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHo9jK9rLPAhWsLsAKHZS2CHk4ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=misbaha&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Islamic Civilization and Religion|last=Netton|first=Ian Richard|date=2013-12-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135179670|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''misbahah'' is also used by [[Arab Christians]] to refer to the Christian [[rosary]] or [[prayer rope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleteia.org/2017/02/11/ever-heard-of-the-orthodox-rosary-called-a-komboskini-or-prayer-rope/|title=Ever heard of the Orthodox rosary called a “komboskini” or “prayer rope”?|last=Esparza|first=Daniel|date=11 February 2017|publisher=Aleteia|language=English|accessdate=14 February 2017|quote=Generally, these prayer strings (called [[komboskini]] in Greek, chotki or vervitsa in Russian and misbaha in Arabic) typically have between 100 and 150 knots, although some with 33 knots can also be found (symbolizing the age of Christ at His death), as well as others with 41 knots (the number of lashes inflicted on Jesus) or 64 knots (according to tradition, the age of the Virgin Mary upon her Assumption into heaven).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The misbaḥah is also known as tasbīḥ ({{lang|ar|تَسْبِيح}}) — not to be confused the of [[dhikr]] of [[tasbih]] — in non-Arab languages, particularly in [[Persian language|Persian]]. In [[Turkey]], it is known as ''tespih''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turkey-now.org/Default.aspx?pgID=534&amp;langid=1 |title=The Tespih Works in Mysterious Ways |accessdate=2007-09-02 |last=Leone |first=Stacie|date=May 2006 |work=Turkey Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
A misbaḥah is a tool which is used as an aid to perform [[dhikr]], including the [[names of God in Islam]], and the glorification of God after [[namaz|regular prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J6JlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT554&amp;dq=misbaha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHo9jK9rLPAhWsLsAKHZS2CHk4ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=misbaha&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Islamic Civilization and Religion|last=Netton|first=Ian Richard|date=2013-12-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135179670|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often made of [[wood]]en or [[plastic]] beads, but also of semi-precious gemstones such as [[carnelian]] and [[onyx]], [[olive]] seeds, [[ivory]], [[amber]], [[pearl]]s. 

They usually consist of 99 beads to assist in the glorification of God following prayers: 33 [[Subhan Allah|Tasbeeh]] (subhāna-llāh ), 33 [[Alhamdulillah|Tahmeed]] (ʾal-ḥamdu li-llāh), and 33 [[Takbir|Takbeer]] (ʾAllāhu ʾakbar). Some suggest the 99 beads also refer to the [[99 names of Allah]]. Smaller misbahas consist of 33 beads, in which case one cycles through them three times to complete 99. However, misbahas may also consist of 100 or 200 count beads to assist in the [[dhikr]] duties of certain [[Sufi order]]s.

Misbahahs are also used culturally to [[worry beads|reduce stress]] or as an indication of status in society.

==History==
It is thought that in the early Muslim era, loose pebbles were used or that people counted on their fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} Hadits Shafiyah binti Hayyi (isteri Rasulullah) yang berbunyi:

عَنْ كِنَانَةَ مَوْلَى صَفِيَّةَ قَال سَمِعْتُ صَفِيَّةَ تَقُولُ دَخَلَ عَلَيَّ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَبَيْنَ يَدَيَّ أَرْبَعَةُ آلَافِ نَوَاةٍ أُسَبِّحُ بِهَا فَقَالَ لَقَدْ سَبَّحْتِ بِهَذِهِ أَلَا أُعَلِّمُكِ بِأَكْثَرَ مِمَّا سَبَّحْتِ بِهِ فَقُلْتُ بَلَى عَلِّمْنِي فَقَالَ قُولِي سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَدَدَ خَلْقِهِ قَالَ أَبُو عِيسَى هَذَا حَدِيثٌ غَرِيبٌ لَا نَعْرِفُهُ مِنْ حَدِيثِ صَفِيَّةَ إِلَّا مِنْ هَذَا الْوَجْهِ مِنْ حَدِيثِ هَاشِمِ بْنِ سَعِيدٍ الْكُوفِيِّ وَلَيْسَ إِسْنَادُهُ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَفِي الْبَاب عَنْ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ

"Dari Kinanah budak Shafiyah berkata, saya mendengar Shafiyah berkata: Rasulullah pernah menemuiku dan di tanganku ada empat ribu nawat (bijian korma) yang aku pakai untuk menghitung dzikirku. Aku berkata,”Aku telah bertasbih dengan ini.” Rasulullah bersabda,”Maukah aku ajari engkau (dengan) yang lebih baik dari pada yang engkau pakai bertasbih?” Saya menjawab,”Ajarilah aku,” maka Rasulullah bersabda,”Ucapkanlah : 
سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَدَدَ خَلْقِهِ. (Maha Suci Allah sejumlah apa yang diciptakan oleh Allah dari sesuatu).” (HR Tirmidzi, beliau berkata,”Hadist ini gharib. Saya tidak mengetahuinya, kecuali lewat jalan ini, yaitu Hasyim bin Sa’id Al Kufi.” Ibnu Hajar dalam kitab At Taqrib menyebutnya dhaif (lemah), begitu juga gurunya, Kinanah Maula Shafiyah didhaifkan oleh Al Adzdi.)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 17th-century ʻ[[Allamah|Allāmah]] [[Muhammad Baqir Majlisi]], after the [[Battle of Uhud|Battle of Uḥud]], [[Fatimah bint Muhammad|Fāṭimah]] the daughter of [[Muhammad]] would visit the Martyrs' graveyard every two or three days, and then made a misbaḥah of [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Ḥamzah ibn ʻAbd al-Muṭṭalib’s]] grave-soil. After that, people started making and using ''misbaḥahs''.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

Some hadiths state the benefit of using the fingers of the right hand to count tasbīḥ following regular prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated Yusayrah, mother of Yasir: The Prophet (saw) commanded them (the women emigrants) to be regular (in remembering [[Allah]] by saying): "Allah is most great"; "Glory be to the King, the Holy"; "there is no god but Allah"; and that they should count them on fingers, for they (the fingers) will be questioned and asked to speak. (Book #8, Hadith #1496)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nakchong.jpg|thumb|Nakchhong, the kirat priest.]]
'''Nakchhong''' (नाक्छोङ) are priests of the [[Kirati]] people, an ethnic group that is predominantly located in the [[Himalayas]].  

Nakchhong maintain a [[vegetarian]] diet as part of their spiritual regime.  The Kirati believe that Nakchhong are chosen bodies of good spirits.  One of the foremost Kirat, Mundhum, has taught that there are two types of spirits.  Rumahang, the divine spirit, is a supreme spirit who created the universe and living beings on this earth.  Rumahang represents truth, happiness, compassion and love.  Conversely, the devil spirit represents destruction, jealousy and hatred. Thus, Nakchhong act under Rumahang against the devil spirits.  

Those who possess a magical weapon (any kind of BAN to harm or kill another) are regarded as chosen bodies of the devil spirit.  On the other hand, Nakchhong do not have any magical weapons to harm or kill other living beings.

Nakchhong frequently work with the following materials:
*[[Aduwa (Kirat culture)|Aduwa]] (ginger)
*[[Pokhemma]]
*[[Tupla (Kirat culture)|Tupla]] (cut pieces of the front part of a banana leaf)
*Chindo: Gourd filled with [[Jand (Kirat culture)|Jand]] (millet beer)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15122">The '''New Forest coven''' were an alleged [[coven|group]] of [[witchcraft|witches]] who met around the area of the [[New Forest]] in southern England during the early 20th century. According to his own claims, in September 1939, a British occultist named [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] was initiated into the [[coven]] and subsequently used its beliefs and practices as a basis from which he formed the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardner described some of his experiences with the coven in his published books ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) although on the whole revealed little about it, saying he was respecting the privacy of its members. Meanwhile, another occultist, Louis Wilkinson, corroborated Gardner's claims by revealing in an interview with the writer [[Francis X. King]] that he too had encountered the coven and expanded on some of the information that Gardner had provided about them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kin70|King 1970]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gardner, the faith which they followed was the continuation of the [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]], a pre-Christian religion that originated in the [[paganism]] of ancient Western Europe. This was in keeping with the widely held theories then propagated by the anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] and her supporters.

As Wicca developed in the latter decades of the twentieth century, some of the figures who were researching its origins, such as [[Aidan Kelly]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel91|Kelly 1991]].&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Leo Ruickbie]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rui04|Ruickbie 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; came to the conclusion that the New Forest coven was simply a fictional invention of Gardner's to provide a historical basis for his faith. The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] accepted this as a possibility, although recognised that it was not "implausible" that the coven had indeed existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research by [[Philip Heselton]] which was published in the early twenty-first century, indicated that there was much evidence for a coven of practitioners - whose members he identified as being [[Dorothy Clutterbuck]], [[Edith Woodford-Grimes]], Ernest Mason, Susie Mason, Rosamund Sabine and Katherine Oldmeadow.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes03|Heselton 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

===Origins===
Gerald Gardner believed that the New Forest coven was a survival of the [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]], a pre-Christian pagan religion that worshipped a [[Horned God]] and a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] and which had been persecuted during the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witch trials of the Early Modern period]]. The existence of the Witch-Cult had been put forward by various writers in the nineteenth century, such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Charles Leland]], but had risen to prominence in the early twentieth century when it was promoted in two of the works of Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray|Dr Margaret Murray]]: ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1933). The idea of the pagan Witch-Cult has been disproved and dismissed by historians specialising in the Early Modern witch trials since Murray's death in 1963, with works by academics like Elliot Rose, [[Norman Cohn]], [[Carlo Ginzburg]] and [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] instead showing the real nature of the witch trials as a combination of social, economic and religious factors. It is for this reason that the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] (1999) dismissed any possibility of the New Forest coven being the continuation of the Witch-Cult.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, it has been proposed that the New Forest coven had been founded in the early twentieth century by various occultists who wished to resurrect the Witch-Cult as described in Murray's works. Philip Heselton (2003), who performed the most exhaustive research into the group, speculated that the coven had been formed by a woman named Rosamund Sabine, who prior to moving to the New Forest in 1924 had been involved in various esoteric groups like the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. He thought that she, after reading ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', became interested in witches, and believed herself to be the [[reincarnation]] of one. It was for this reason, he believed, that she gathered together some of her friends who also had an interest in the occult, and founded the coven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes03|Heselton 2003]]. p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher [[Vikki Bramshaw]] suggests &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vikkibramshaw.wordpress.com/2017/09/02/my-experiences-the-craft-and-its-mysteries/|title=My Experiences, the Craft and its Mysteries|date=2017-09-02|work=Llyn Annwn : Blog of Vikki Bramshaw|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gardner may well have had some, albeit brief, meeting with local traditions in operation at that time. She writes that whilst a number of the members were from [[masonic]] or academic backgrounds of high society, others were working class people outside of those class-bound organisations. They included [[Blacksmith|blacksmiths]], manual labourers, and some with [[gypsy]] connections in the Forest. Davis Stanton writes, 'In other words, Wicca was only 'new' in the sense the New Forest was new - a re-designation of something that was there before, under another name.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanton|first=David|date=Summer 2001|title=Issue 1|url=|journal=Hengistbury Head Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different origin theory was put forward by Steve Wilson (1996), who speculated that the coven might have been founded by members of a scouting organisation, the [[Order of Woodcraft Chivalry]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 1996"&gt;[[New Forest coven#Wil96|Wilson 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; Heselton accepted similarities between the Order and the coven, but did not believe that there was any direct connection.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes00|Heselton 2000]]. pp. 298–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerald Gardner's Involvement===
[[File:NewForestCoven Scourge.JPG|thumb|right|A ritual scourge owned by the New Forest coven which Gardner subsequently inherited.]]

[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] claimed that after moving to the borough of [[Christchurch, Dorset]] in 1939, he got involved with the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship]], an occult organisation based upon [[Rosicrucianism]]. However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, [[George Alexander Sullivan]], believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met a group of people within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of [[Freemasonry]] known as [[Co-Masonry]], who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the Rosicrucian Order when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, [[Mabel Besant-Scott]], had done so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra60|Bracelin 1960]]. pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes00|Heselton 2000]]. pp. 100–112.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gardner:

:They seemed rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves. They were the most interesting element, however. Unlike many of the others, they had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra60|Bracelin 1960]]. p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

This group claimed to have known Gardner from a [[reincarnation|past life]], and in September 1939, revealed to him that they were members of a Witches' coven, and then initiated him into Wicca in a ritual which took place in one of the homes owned by [[Dorothy Clutterbuck]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra60|Bracelin 1960]]. pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Cone of Power ===

Gardner would reveal little about the coven and its members, although claimed that in August 1940, during the midst of the [[Second World War]], they performed a ritual known as Operation Cone of Power which they hoped would influence the High Command of [[Nazi Germany]] and prevent them from invading Britain. This magical ritual, Gardner claimed, took place inside the Forest, and involved the Witches raising a Cone of Power which they directed toward Germany and focused on sending the message into the minds of the German leaders that they would not be able to cross the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra60|Bracelin 1960]]. pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner also noted that several of the older and frailer practicing Witches died after practicing the ritual, something that was confirmed by Louis Wilkinson, who claimed that it was because they had performed the ritual naked, without goose grease on the skin to keep them warm, and that as such they had contracted [[pneumonia]]. Investigating these claims, Heselton found two locals who died soon after the ritual: a reporter, Walter Forder (1881–1940), and a blacksmith, Charles Loader (1864–1940), whom he speculated were involved in the rite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hes00|Heselton 2000]]. pp. 244–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coven members ==
According to Gardner, his first contact with the witches was through an inner group within the [[Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship|Crotona Fellowship]], a [[Rosicrucian]] society that operated a theatre in [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]]. They were a reserved group, who remained somewhat separate from other members of the order and the theatre. Historian [[Philip Heselton]] has identified some of the members of this group as Edith Woodford-Grimes, Ernie Mason, and his sisters Susie Mason and Rosetta Fudge.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"&gt;[[#Hes00|Heselton 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that by the late 1930s some members of the Crotona Fellowship, inspired by the work of [[Margaret Murray]], were performing rituals based on [[Co-Masonry]] and incorporating elements of folklore, and that these were the rituals that Gardner encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mason family===
The Mason family, researched by Heselton, lived in Southampton for a period of over 150 years. One of Heselton's informants described Ernie in particular and the family in general, as 'witches', adding that Ernie, who he had known for several years, had had to give up because he found the rituals too strenuous.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"/&gt; Rosetta was a keen follower of [[Anthroposophy]]; Susie was a [[Co-Freemason]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]], and Ernie, who claimed to have been fully aware from the moment of his birth, was an enthusiastic esotericist and taught mental exercises in the Crotona Fellowship. Their father George Miles Mason, an optician and astronomer, had built a meeting hall in [[Southampton]] which seems to have been used for the meetings of various esoteric groups, including Co-Freemasonry. Heselton points to a reference to nearby Toothill as a "witch centre" in a book by Justine Glass,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gla65|Glass 1965]].&lt;/ref&gt; who does not name her informant. In the 1881 census nearly a quarter of the inhabitants of that hamlet (three families) had the surname Mason (an otherwise uncommon name in that part of England); based on this and other [[circumstantial evidence]] he proposes that the Mason family could have been the custodians of a hereditary witchcraft tradition.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"/&gt;

===Edith Woodford-Grimes===
{{main article|Edith Woodford-Grimes}}
The priestess who initiated Gardner into witchcraft was referred to as "Dafo" or "Daffo".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh69|Johns 1969]].&lt;/ref&gt; She taught music and elocution, and her daughter married a dentist;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Val89|Valiente 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; these and other details identify her as Edith Rose Woodford-Grimes.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"/&gt; She lived in the same street as the Mason family between 1922 and 1937, when they were heavily involved in esoteric activities. By 1938 she was living in Christchurch near the Rosicrucian theatre, and was an active member. In August 1940, at her daughter's wedding, the bride was given away by Gerald Gardner, who was described as a "close friend". Edith remained a close friend of Gardner's for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="HeseltonRoots"/&gt;

The '''religion of the [[Olmec]]''' people significantly influenced the social development and mythological world view of [[Mesoamerica]].   Scholars have seen echoes of Olmec supernatural in the subsequent religions and mythologies of nearly all later [[pre-Columbian era]] Mesoamericans cultures.

The first Mesoamerican civilization, the Olmecs, developed on present-day Mexico southern Gulf Coast in the centuries before 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]].  The culture lasted until roughly 400 BCE, at which time their center of [[La Venta]] lay abandoned.  The Olmec culture is often considered a "mother culture" to later Mesoamerican cultures.  

There is no surviving direct account of the Olmec's religious beliefs, unlike the [[Mayan Civilization | Mayan]] ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', or the Aztecs, with their many [[Aztec codices|codices]] and [[conquistador]] accounts. 

Archaeologists, therefore, have had to rely on other techniques to reconstruct Olmec beliefs, most prominently:&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Typological analysis of Olmec iconography and art.
*Comparison to later, better documented pre-Columbian cultures.
*Comparison to modern-day cultures of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

The latter two techniques assume that there is a continuity extending from Olmec times through later Mesoamerican cultures to the present day.  This assumption is called the Continuity Hypothesis.  Using these techniques, researchers have discerned several separate deities or supernaturals embodying the characteristics of various animals.

==Rulers, priests, and shamans==
Olmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and [[shaman]]s.  The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 106. See also J. E. Clark, , p. 343, who says "much of the art of La Venta appears to have been dedicated to rulers who dressed as gods, or to the gods themselves".&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called "[[Olmec figurine#Transformation figures|transformation figures]]".&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Las Limas left shoulder.svg|left|150px|thumb|Figure from [[Las Limas Monument 1]], generally identified as the Bird Monster.  Note the "flame eyebrows".]]

==Olmec supernaturals==
Specifics concerning Olmec religion are a matter of some conjecture.  Early researchers found religious beliefs to be centered upon a jaguar god.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  This view was challenged in the 1970s by Peter David Joralemon, whose Ph. D. paper and subsequent article posited what are now considered to be 8 different supernaturals.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon originally defined Gods I through X.  However, over time, Joralemon proposed that Gods V, IX, and X were not separate deities (e.g. God IX was to be merged with God II) and has since split the earlier God IV into a rain supernatural and the were-jaguar.  See Joralemon (1996) and Coe (1989), pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;   Over time Joralemon's viewpoint has become the predominant exposition of the Olmec pantheon.  The study of Olmec religion, however, is still in its infancy and any list of Olmec supernaturals or deities can be neither definitive nor comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The names and identities of these supernaturals are only provisional and the details concerning many of them remain poorly known.&lt;ref&gt;See Taube (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The confusion stems in part because the supernaturals are defined as a cluster of icongraphic motifs.&lt;ref&gt;See Joralemon (1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Any given motif may appear in multiple supernaturals.  For example, "flame eyebrows" are seen at times within representations of both the Olmec Dragon and the Bird Monster, and the cleft head is seen on all five supernaturals that appear on [[Las Limas Monument 1]].  To add to the confusion, Joralemon suggested that many of these gods had multiple aspects – for example, Joralemon had identified a God I-A through a God I-F.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the use of the term "god", none of these deities and supernaturals show any sexual characteristics which would indicate gender.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec Dragon (God I)===
Also known as the Earth Monster, the Olmec Dragon has flame eyebrows, a bulbous nose, and bifurcated tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 117.  Joralemon (1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  When viewed from the front, the Olmec Dragon has trough-shaped eyes; when viewed in profile, the eyes are L-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fangs are prominent, often rendered as an upside-down U-shaped bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon (1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Bird Monster, the Olmec Dragon is one of the most commonly depicted supernaturals.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller &amp; Taube differentiate a Personified Earth Cave, equating it with Joralmon's God I-B.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seated Olmec Jaguar from San Lorenzo, Veracruz.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Monument 52 from [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]]. Some researchers identify this figure as the were-jaguar while others state that it instead represents the Rain Deity. The long deep groove carved into the back of this [[basalt]] sculpture indicates it was part of the drainage system.]]

=== Maize deity (God II) ===
Another probable supernatural is identified by the plants sprouting from its cleft head.  A carved [[celt (tool)|celt]] from Veracruz shows a representation of God II, or the Maize God, growing corn from his cleft, and also shows this god with the snarling face associated with the jaguar.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1972), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  This deity is rarely shown with a full body.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rain Spirit and Were-jaguar (God III)===
{{Main|Were-jaguar}}
There is considerable disagreement between researchers whether the Rain Spirit and were-jaguar are one distinct or two separate supernaturals.  Christopher Pool,&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 117, who states: "The were-jaguar is God IV, a god of rain and storms".&lt;/ref&gt; Anatole Pohorilenko, and Miller &amp; Taube each equate the were-jaguar with the Rain Deity, while Joralemon finds them to be two separate supernaturals.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon, pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Joralemon states that the Olmec rain spirit "is based on were-jaguar features", but is not the were-jaguar per se.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon, pp. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship by Carolyn Tate questions the existence of  "were-jaguar" (a fantastical concept coined soon after the release of the ''WereWolf in London'') imagery and instead argues for the centrality of embryo-corn kernel iconography within Olmec iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Carolyn.  Reconsidering Olmec Visual Culture.  Austin: the University of Texas, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later paper, Taube proposed that the Rain Spirit was instead the seed phase version of the Maize God.&lt;ref&gt;Taube (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banded-eye God (God IV)===

This enigmatic deity is named for the narrow band that runs along the side of its face through its almond-shaped eye with its round [[iris (eye)|iris]].  Like many other supernaturals, the Banded-eye God has a cleft head and a downturned mouth.  Unlike others, the Banded-eye God is only known from its profile - these renditions are generally concentrated on bowls from the [[Valley of Mexico]] (as shown on left),&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon (1996), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; although the Banded-eye God is one of the five supernaturals shown on [[Las Limas Monument 1]] from the [[Olmec heartland]].
[[File:Tlapacoya Bowl.PNG|left|frame|Clay bowl from [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], showing the Banded-eye God.]]
Rather than a distinct supernatural in its own right, however, Taube finds God VI to be yet another aspect of the Maize God.&lt;ref&gt;Taube (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feathered Serpent (God V)===
{{main|Feathered Serpent}}
Designated God VII by Scott Pelly, the feathered (or plumed) serpent depicted throughout [[Mesoamerica]] first appears in Olmec times, although there is some disagreement concerning its importance to the Olmec.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemon (1996), p. 58, says "it was a divinity of considerable significance".  However, in counterpoint, Diehl, p. 104, says that the Feathered Serpent's "rarity suggests that it was a minor member of the Olmec pantheon".&lt;/ref&gt;  The Feathered Serpent appears on La Venta Stele 19 (above) and within a [[Juxtlahuaca]] cave painting (see [[: Image: Juxtlahuaca Serpent (M Lachniet).jpg|this Commons photo]]), locations hundreds of miles apart.

===Fish or Shark Monster (God VI)===
Most often recognized by its shark tooth, the head of the monster also features a crescent-shaped eye, and a small lower jaw.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; When depicted in its full-body form, such as on San Lorenzo Monument 58 or on the [[Young Lord (figurine)|Young Lord figurine]], the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Fish Monster also displays crossed bands, a dorsal fin, a split tail.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  This supernatural's profile is shown on the left leg of [[Las Limas Monument 1]] (see  [[:File:Las Limas left leg.svg|Commons drawing]]).

{{clear}}

==Continuity Hypothesis==
[[Marshall Howard Saville]] first suggested in 1929 that the Olmec deities were forerunners of later Mesoamerican gods, linking were-jaguar votive axes with the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1989), p. 71, who in turn cites [[Matthew Stirling]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This proposal was amplified by [[Miguel Covarrubias]] in his 1957 work ''Indian Art of Mexico and Central America'' where he famously drew a family tree showing 19 later Mesoamerican rain deities as descendents of a "jaguar masked" deity portrayed on a votive axe.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Continuity Hypothesis has since been generally accepted by scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube (p. 126) say: ". . . some [of these deities] were to survive, albeit in a changed form, for 2500 years until the Spanish Conquest".&lt;/ref&gt; although the extent of Olmec influence on later cultures is still debated.

[[File:Holy relic sites map of Andhra Pradesh.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy relic sites map of Andhra Pradesh]]
'''Pavurallakonda''' or Pavurallabodu is the local name of a hill, popularly known as Narasimhaswamy Konda, near [[Bheemunipatnam]] about 25&amp;nbsp;km towards north of [[Visakhapatnam]], in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is located at a height of about 150 meters above mean sea level.

Pavurallakonda consists of a ruined hill-top Buddhist monastic complex probably witnessed human habitation from 3rd Century BCE to 2nd century CE. It is one of the Largest Buddhist Monasteries of North Coastal Andhra Region. [[Hinayana]] Buddhism may have flourished at this hill-top site.

Initial Excavation of this site yielded many relics. Two Brahmi label inscriptions, foundations of Viharas, circular chaityas, votive [[stupas]], halls etc. are located among the ruins. Coins, polished ware, beads etc. were recovered from the site by the state archaeology Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museums.ap.nic.in/b-sites.htm |title=Buddhist sites |accessdate=9 September 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209160246/http://museums.ap.nic.in/b-sites.htm |archivedate=9 February 2012 | publisher=Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Andhra Pradesh }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Andhra Pradesh. Nearly Sixteen rock-cut cisterns are carved on the hill for the storage of rain water. Excavations and Restoration Program are under progress at Pavurallakonda.

The [[Gosthani River]] flows close by this site. This site is contemporary with the nearby Buddhist sites in [[Visakhapatnam]] district like [[Bavikonda]] and [[Thotlakonda]]

The Indian National Trust for Arts and Cultural Heritage ([[INTACH]]) has already appealed to the authorities to ensure better protection of Buddhist sites by taking up the declaration of [[Bavikonda]], [[Thotlakonda]], Pavurallakonda and [[Bojjannakonda]] as heritage sites by [[UNESCO]]. This will not only pave the way for steady flow of funds but also generate employment opportunities for the locals.

==Origin of the name==

Pavurallakonda in general gives the meaning as 'The Hill of the Pigeons' ('''pavuralu''' in Telugu means pigeons and '''konda''' means hill).But as per some studies conducted at this site it may be known as Pavurallakonda due to the availability of white stone on the hillock ('''pavurallu''' means white stones locally). The origin of the name of this site needs clarification yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5250">'''Polemon of Athens''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Πολέμων ὁ Ἀθηναῖος}}, fl. 2nd century BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] and [[geographer]]. Of [[Athens|Athenian]] citizenship, he was most widely known as '''Polemon of Athens''', but he was born either in [[Ilium (Epirus)|Ilium]], [[Samos]], or [[Sicyon]], and was also known as '''Polemon of Ilium''' and '''Polemon Periegetes'''. He traveled throughout Greece and wrote about the places he visited. He also compiled a collection of the [[epigram]]s he saw on the monuments and votive offerings. None of these works survive, but many later writers quote from them.

==Life==
Polemon was the son of Euegetes, and he was a contemporary of [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Ptolemy Epiphanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Polemon'', Athenaeus, vi. 234&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a follower of the Stoic philosopher [[Panaetius]]. He made extensive journeys throughout Greece to collect materials for his geographical works, in the course of which he paid particular attention to the inscriptions on votive offerings and on columns, whence he obtained the surname of ''Stelokopas''.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, vi. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In his travels, Polemon collected the [[epigram]]s he found into a work ''[[On the inscriptions to be found in cities]]'' ({{lang-el|Περὶ τω̂ν κατὰ πόλεις ἐπιγραμμάτων}}).&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, x. 436d, 442e&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other works of his are mentioned, upon the votive offerings and monuments in the [[Acropolis of Athens]], at [[Lacedaemon]], at [[Delphi]], and elsewhere, which no doubt contained copies of numerous epigrams. His works may have been a chief source of the ''Garland'' of [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]]. [[Athenaeus]], [[Sextus Julius Africanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotius|first1=Hugo|author2=John CLARKE (Dean of Salisbury.)|title=The Truth of the Christian Religion ...

''Africanus'' says, the ''Greek'' Histories were wrote by him; which is the same Book ''[[Athenaeus|Athenæus]]'' calls, ???. His Words are these: "In the Reign of ''Apis'' the Son of ''Phoroneus'', Part of the ''Egyptian'' Army went out of ''Egypt'', and dwelt in ''Syria'' called ''Palestine'', not far from ''Arabia''."

'''Rishi Mudgal''', also known as Rajarshi Mudgal (or written as Mudgala), is one of the [[Rajarshi]] in Hinduism. He was originally born as a [[Kshatriya]] king but later on due to severe meditation, or [[Yoga]], he received [http://www.achyutashrama.org/brahmatva.php Brahmatva], due to which his descendants were later on known as [[Brahmin|Brahmins]]. He is the only Rishi with his name over a [[Puranas|purana]] named [[Mudgala Purana]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Upreti Vanshavali''. Kathmandu: Upreti Samaj Sewa Samiti, 1995. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rishi Mudgal wrote 1 [[Upnishad]] out of 108 Upnishads named [[Mudgala Upanishad|Mudgal Upanishad]]. [[Mudgala Upanishad|Mudgal Upanishad]] is of very special type and unique amongst all [[upanishads]] ever written. As it's mainly contains information and praises about [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesha]], and how to pray and perform [[Yajna]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] of [[Ganesha|Lord Ganpati]]. The great sage strongly believed in simple living high thinking and had a high level patience amongst other Rishis. That's why still today the persons belonged to Mudgal [[Gotra]] are considered highly ethical and had infinite patience in compare to average.

Rishi Mudgal was also been cited for the infamous curse on his wife when she tried to stop him from becoming a saint at the later part of his life. He cursed his wife that in next birth she will have five husbands. In next life, his wife was born as [[Draupadi]], the daughter of King [[Drupada]]. Draupadi's husbands were the five Pandavas from Mahabharata.

== History ==
'''Rishi Mudgal''' was the son of a [[Chandravanshi |Chandravanshi ]] Kshatriya King Bhamyarswa of [[Panchala Kingdom (Mahabharata)|Panchal]] Rajya, at present the Punjab State of India. He is considered as one of the [[Rajarshi]] in Hinduism next to [[Vishvamitra]]. Mudgal lived in a forest and ruled over his kingdom as well as he taught as a [[Kul guru|Kulguru]] in a [[Gurukula]].    

According to '''''[[Bhagavad Gita]],''''' Mudgal had 50 sons out of which Maudgalya was the eldest one. Maudgalya's son were rewarded as [[Purohita|Rajpurohitas]]. Maudgalya's descendants had castes like [[Upreti]], [[Koirala]], Simkhada, Timalsina,Kar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Salaam TV''' is an independent [[satellite television]] [[television channel|channel]] committed to providing [[Shia Islam]]ic programming. Salaam TV was established in early 2005 by Hajj Sheikh Mohammad Hedayati.  The channel's launch date intentionally coincided with the [[Eid al-Ghadeer|Eid of Ghadeer]].  Salaam TV's producers assert that the channel is not affiliated with any political groups or external organizations, as it aims to provide apolitical Islamic programming.

==Availability==
Salaam TV was originally available through satellite television throughout most of [[North America]] (specifically, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]).  Since its founding, Salaam TV has always been available internationally, as it is viewable [[free of charge]] through the official Salaam TV website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salaamtv.org/ Salaam TV website]&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 22, 2006, Salaam TV became available via satellite programing in [[Europe]] and [[Iran]] through [[Hot Bird]].

==Language==
Throughout the first year of Salaam TV's programming, most of the channel's programs were in [[English language|English]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] (aside from the [[Qur'an|Qur'anic recitations]], [[Islamic prayers]], and [[supplication]]s, which are always recited in [[Arabic]]).  On January 14, 2006, Salaam TV founder Hajj Sheikh Mohammad Hedayati announced that the program would make efforts to increase programming in other languages including [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], and [[Azerbaijani language|Azari]]. Salaam TV's official website is available in [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]], and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salaamtv.com/ Salaam TV website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
There have been accusations that Salaam TV receives [[funding]] from political organizations and other countries, such as the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].  Salaam TV's founders maintain that the channel's expenses are covered by individual [[philanthropists]] who donate money, primarily through [[telethon]] events. In 2005, Salaam TV held two telethons during which callers donated money to support the channel's programming.

==Music==
None of Salaam TV's programming include [[music]], as some [[Muslims]] maintain that music should not be played, especially in religious environments. Instead, the producers have opted to use [[sounds]] from [[nature]], such as [[bird songs]], during the interludes between regular programming.

==Beliefs, practices, and background==
{{Main|Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)}}
Share International's publications claim that the coming of [[Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)|Maitreya]] (meaning "friendly" in [[Sanskrit]]) fulfills not only [[Buddhist]] prophecies about the appearance of a future great teacher named ''Maitreya'', but also the prophecies of a number of other world religions - including [[Christianity]] (the second coming of [[Christ]]), [[Hinduism]] (the [[Kalki]] avatar of [[Vishnu]]), [[Islam]] (the [[Imam Mahdi]]) and [[Judaism]] (the Jewish [[Messiah]]). Creme claims that Maitreya manifested himself through (or ''overshadowed'') [[Master Jesus|Jesus]] 2,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="Mick Brown 1998. page 8"/&gt; that Maitreya resided in the Himalayas, and that in 1977 he descended from his ancient retreat in the [[Himalayas]] and took an aeroplane to [[London]]. His belief is that Maitreya is omniscient and omnipresent, and that he took up residence in the Indian-Pakistani community of London in the Brick Lane area and has been living and working there, seemingly as an ordinary man, his true status known to relatively few. Furthermore, that Maitreya has been emerging gradually into full public view so as not to infringe humanity's free will.&lt;ref name="David V page 347"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mick Brown 1998. page 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Share International website: http://shareintl.org/introduction/introduction3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Mick Brown]].

"[[:nl:Piet Vroon|Vroon]] schreef verder over Maitreya, waar Benjamin Creme al jarenlang de verkondiger van is. Creme beweert dat in 1977 de nieuwe wereldleraar, Maitreya genaamd, in Londen is gearriveerd. Deze zou ook een avatar zijn, degene die de aarde zal helpen de geestelijke revolutie welke naar zijn zeggen gaande is, te begeleiden. Het is een revolutie die liefde als middel en als doel heeft. Maitreya belichaamt in dit gebeuren het planetaire liefdesaspect, Sai Baba het kosmische. Volgens Creme staat Sai Baba hoger in de 'hiërarchie der meesters' dan Maitreya en is hij op aarde gekomen om Maitreya te helpen bij zijn werk.13 De relatie tussen Sai Baba en Maitreya werd door Vroon niet vermeld, maar deze informatie verscheen prompt via een ingezonden brief in de krant."

In 1974, Benjamin Creme introduced a meditation called Transmission Meditation which he says is a way of transmitting spiritual energies through the meditators to create a pool of positive, spiritual energy for the benefit of humanity. Share International says there are 600 Transmission Meditation groups all over the world. The groups sit silently while spiritual energy is transmitted or 'stepped-down' by the Masters of Wisdom (also called by some groups [[Ascended Master]]s). This group meditation is a form of service, rather than the traditional personal meditation, which can be continued as well as this service activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.share-international.org/background/xmission/tm_main.htm|title=Transmission Meditation  |accessdate=2008-05-12|publisher=Share International official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]].

Benjamin Creme was a student of the teachings of [[Alice Bailey]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref name="David V page 348"&gt;[[David V. Barrett|Barrett, David V.]] ''[[The New Believers]]'' 2001 {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}, page 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Share International says that Maitreya appeared before a Christian gathering of 6,000 people on the outskirts of  [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] on 11 June 1988. This happening was widely published, among others by [[CNN]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and photographs of the [[Jesus]]-like apparition were distributed worldwide.&lt;ref name="David V page 348"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]].

==1982 onwards==

In the spring of 1982 Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles, California, USA. Afterwards, Creme wrote: "It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya. &lt;ref&gt;[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme wrote: In January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement living in the Asian community of London. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, this statement was withheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://alcuinbramerton.blogspot.com/2016/04/christ-and-jesus-at-bbc-london-1986.html]  Alcuin Bramerton: '''Christ and Jesus at the BBC''' - London 1986 BBC misses biggest story in English history. UK church establishment rejects Second Coming of Christ. Why did the BBC, the Queen and the Church of England bishops choose to ignore the Second Coming of Christ in 1986?&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1997 Creme made similar announcements that there would be imminent global TV broadcasts from Christ/Maitreya, though with far less media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Canada NewsWire|date=December 2, 1997|title=British Futurist Says 'World Teacher'... will be interviewed on a major American network before the end of the year. This will be followed by appearances on other networks around the world and...will lead to a global satellite hook-up where Maitreya can speak to all people simultaneously -- in their own language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last month of 2008 Creme &amp; Share International distributed a news release stating that soon, a very bright star would appear visible throughout the world, both night and day. Creme said it would be a sign that Maitreya’s first major public appearance would be very soon. In January 2009, several  sightings of the ‘star’ were reported in the media, posted on YouTube, described in letters to Share International's magazine. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.share-international.org/media/newsmedia.htm] For the News Media: What's next? &lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2010 in London, Benjamin Creme reported that Maitreya had given his first television interview recently "...on a major US television network, inaugurating his public work." Creme stated that  Maitreya had given over two dozen television interviews in 2010, and had not been introduced as Maitreya "but as a seemingly ordinary man" and that His media interviews continue with him proposing "practical solutions to our pressing global problems." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.share-international.org/media/newsmedia.htm] For the News Media: What's next? &lt;/ref&gt;

Creme continued until his demise in October of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/11/11/benjamin-creme-artist-and-esotericist--obituary/&lt;/ref&gt; to claim that time is now very near for Maitreya's emergence. He did not receive any money for this work or royalties from his 14 books, and for over 30 years gave free public lectures around the world. A worldwide network of volunteers worked with Benjamin Creme to inform the public of this information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepticfiles.org/ignor/naconspr.htm THE NEW AGE CONSPIRACY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Tara Press 6"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|date=June 3, 1982|page=6|author=The Tara Press|title=Advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Share International maintains that Maitreya's interviews will eventually "lead to an international press conference and, ultimately, Maitreya's 'Day of Declaration' when he will reveal his true identity."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.share-international.org/media/newsmedia.htm] For the News Media: What's next? &lt;/ref&gt;

==Main priorities of Maitreya and the idea of sharing==

Share International does not claim [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] as a religious leader, or that he is to found a new religion, but that he is a teacher and guide for people of every religion and those of no religion. They believe this to be a time of great political, economic and social crisis, that Maitreya will inspire humanity to see itself as one family, and create a civilization based on sharing, economic and social justice, and global cooperation.

They highlight the main goals that Maitreya will immediately recommend dealing with after the 'Day of Declaration.' They say that he will call to action the people of the world to save the 862 million who are starving and hungry in a world of plenty. Among Maitreya's recommendations will be a shift in social priorities so that adequate food, housing, clothing, education, and medical care become universal [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://shareintl.org/maitreya/Ma_main.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers claim that through the years, Maitreya has given 140 messages.&lt;ref&gt;http://shareintl.org/maitreya/messages/Ma_mess.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Share International quotes him as saying, "See your brother as yourself".&lt;ref&gt;http://shareintl.org/magazine/SI_current.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They say that Maitreya says only through sharing can the world be renewed, and that only sharing will bring justice and peace, and that his can only be achieved by the perception of brotherhood.

==''Share International'' magazine and organization==

[[File:Si cover 2008small.jpg|upright|thumb|right|''Share International'' cover, featuring one of [[Benjamin Creme]]'s artwork]]
Share International has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Berkeley,_California|Berkeley]], [[Tokyo]] and several other countries. &lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]]. ''The Spiritual Tourist'', Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 13&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes a monthly magazine, also called ''Share International''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cokky van Limpt|Limpt, Cokky van]] 23 December 1997 'Rouw om Diana teken van Zijn komst'/'Mourning about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] sign of His advent' in Dutch newspaper [[Trouw]] English translation:"Their club magazine Share international [..]" Dutch original "Hun verenigingsblad Share International [..]"&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Creme has published a number of articles that he claims were dictated to him telepathically by a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master of Wisdom]] ([[Ascended Master]]), an enlightened being who apparently has already [[Initiation (Theosophy)|passed through evolution on this planet]] and has an expanded consciousness and therefore does not have to reside in a fixed human body. The magazine documents the gradual Emergence of [[Maitreya]] the World Teacher &amp; the Masters of Wisdom, world changes, and many [[miracle]]s sent in by people experiencing them, that they assert appear all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]]. ''The Spiritual Tourist'', Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 257&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.share-international.org/magazine/SI_main.htm] Share International magazine... covers news, events, and comments bearing on the priorities of Maitreya, the World Teacher: an adequate supply of the right food; appropriate housing for all; health care and education as universal rights; and the maintenance of ecological balance in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticisms==
According to the American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], Creme's statement served as a catalyst for assessment of the [[New Age]] movement by [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]]s.&lt;ref name="John P 1998, pages 180-181"&gt;[[John P. Newport|Newport, John P.]] ''The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue'',  Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8028-4430-8}}, pages 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the advertisements in 1982, other advertisements appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' denouncing Creme as an instrument of the [[Antichrist]]. [[Constance Cumbey]] (an Evangelical Christian and a Detroit area attorney and author) holds that "Maitreya" is a pseudonym for the  Antichrist and regards Share International as an openly Luciferian movement.&lt;ref&gt;
She bases this on Creme's open professions of loyalty to [[Lucifer]] on various talk radio shows - some of which she has personally participated in. She also bases this on Creme's recitation of his belief in the contents of the Alice Bailey books - books which are published by Lucis Press - an organization that originally published under "Lucifer Publishing Company". [[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]]. ''The Spiritual Tourist''. Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 23 "Creme was agent for the AntiChrist. I had come across a pamphlet published by an organisation called the [[Christian Research Institute]] declaring its belief that Mr. Creme was indeed  'deriving his inspiration from a spiritual realm, albeit a malevolent one'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[David V. Barrett|Barrett, David V.]] ''[[The New Believers]]'' 2001 {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}, page 349 Quote "Sensing a good offbeat story, a number of journalists search the Brick Lane area, but no one could point them at the returned Christ. Creme lost credibility and supporters, and gained some serious enemies among Evangelical Christians. An Evangelical book, ''[[The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow]]'' (1983) attacked all New Age and esoteric movements - especially Creme and the Maitreya [sic] - as a [[satanic conspiracy]] [..]"&lt;/ref&gt;
Other Christian Evangelicals distanced themselves from  [[Constance Cumbey|Cumbey]]'s [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref name="John P 1998, pages 180-181"/&gt;

British journalist Mick Brown wrote "I came to enjoy my talks with Mr. Creme. His stories of the Hierarchy, of hidden retreats in Tibet, of... the cogs... guiding the planet towards an age of harmony and enlightenment ..." He described Creme's claims as fantastic and outlandish. [[Mick Brown (journalist)|Mick Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mick Brown (journalist)|Brown, Mick]].

The '''''Tarot Garden''''' (Italian: '''''Il Giardino dei Tarocchi''''') is a [[sculpture garden]] based on the esoteric [[tarot]], created by the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] (1930–2002) in [[Pescia Fiorentina]], [[località]] ''Garavicchio'', in the municipality of [[Capalbio]], [[province of Grosseto]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. The park was opened to the public in 1998.

Niki de Saint Phalle, inspired by [[Antoni Gaudí]]´s [[Parc Güell]] in Barcelona, and [[Parco dei Mostri]] in Bomarzo, as well as [[Palais Idéal]] by [[Ferdinand Cheval]], and [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]],  decided to make something similar in design for her monumental sculpture park based on the [[Tarot]]. In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Ruins|ruin]] in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/niki-de-saint-phalles-tarot-garden|title=The Psychedelic Garden of Tuscany|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146"&gt;Pozzana, Maria (2001). ''Gardens of Florence and Tuscany: A Complete Guide''. Giunti Editore. p. 146. {{ISBN|8809020642}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures can be walked through; the artist lived inside the [[sphinx]]-like ''Empress'' for several months during the construction of the garden.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146" /&gt;

'''''The Way to Happiness''''' is a 1980 booklet written by science-fiction author and [[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] listing 21 moral [[precepts]]. The booklet is distributed by The Way to Happiness Foundation International, a Scientology-related [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 1984.

''The Way to Happiness'' is used as part of Scientology's [[Criminon]] rehabilitation program and is promoted by Scientology celebrities. The unsolicited distribution of personalised copies of the booklet to schools and mayors' offices has caused controversy, and while it is promoted as secular in nature, critics have stated that it includes ideas that are specific to Scientology, and is used as a recruiting tool.{{citation needed|reason=major referenced detail on lead|date=May 2016}} The booklet has been translated into 70 languages, which is a [[Guinness World Record]] for the most translations of a single work.&lt;ref name=Guinness&gt;{{cite web| title=Most translated author, same book| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/6000/most-translated-author-same-book| work=GuinnessWorldRecords.com| publisher=Guinness World Records| accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Booklet==

The ''Way to Happiness'' booklet contains a set of 21 precepts,&lt;ref name="bartholomew" /&gt; which were written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The precepts are: 1.Take Care of Yourself, 2. Be Temperate, 3. Don't Be Promiscuous, 4. Love and Help Children, 5. Honor and Help your Parents, 6. Set a Good Example, 7. Seek to Live with the Truth, 8. Do Not Murder, 9. Don’t Do Anything Illegal, 10. Support a Government Designed and Run for all the People, 11. Do not Harm a Person of Good Will, 12. Safeguard and Improve Your Environment, 13. Do Not Steal, 14. Be Worthy of Trust, 15. Fulfill Your Obligations, 16. Be Industrious, 17. Be Competent, 18. Respect the Religious Beliefs of Others, 19. Try Not to Do Things to Others That You Would Not Like Them to Do to You, 20. Try to Treat Others as You Would Want Them to Treat You, 21. Flourish and Prosper. The code is not limited to negative prohibition of actions that are bad, (stealing, killing, promiscuity, illegalities) but also the positive advisement of good actions (“care of oneself,  temperateness, respect for parents, aid for children, truthfulness, safeguard of environment, etc.”)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Calzolari |first=Silvio |contribution=Scientology Ethics |title=CESNUR |publisher=European Academy of Religion |place=Bologna |date=2017-06-18 |contribution-url=http://cesnur.org/2017/calzolari_en.pdf |accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thewaytohappiness.org/thewaytohappiness.html |title= The Way to Happiness |publisher= The Way to Happiness Foundation International |accessdate= April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1981 by Regent House, Los Angeles as a 48-page paper-covered booklet ({{ISBN|0-9605930-0-4}}).

The Church of Scientology offers two courses based on ''The Way to Happiness'': "The Way to Happiness Course", done at a Church organization or mission and "The Way to Happiness Extension Course", which can be done at home.

==Controversy==

===Deceptive and misleading distribution===
In 1992, teachers in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] found copies of ''The Way to Happiness'' in their school mailboxes accompanied by a letter inviting the teachers to order more copies and distribute them to their students.&lt;ref name="ruskin"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Ruskin | first =Liz | title =Hubbard Book Sent to Schools Parents Work to Keep Texts Out of Classrooms | work =[[Anchorage Daily News]] | page =B1 | date =1992-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents complained to the school district, and the school districts director of secondary education, Bill Mell, instructed school principals to tell teachers not to order ''The Way to Happiness''.&lt;ref name="ruskin" /&gt; Mell told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'': "I don't know that it went to every teacher ... It looks as if they got a hold of the teachers' mailing list."&lt;ref name="ruskin" /&gt; A local businessman and Scientologist who was a member of the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America organization paid for the books to be distributed to the schools, and told the ''Anchorage Daily News'' that he believed both ''The Way to Happiness'' and the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America were not affiliated with the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="ruskin" /&gt;

At a 2005 fundraiser for the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Club]]s of [[Clearwater, Florida]], attendants found ''The Way to Happiness'' booklets in their goodie bags.&lt;ref name="farley992005"&gt;{{cite news | last =Farley | first =Robert | title =Scientology reaches out and touches a nerve | work =[[St. Petersburg Times]] | page =1B | date =2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The booklets contained the insignia of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs on the front cover, and instructions on the back cover stating that additional copies could be obtained at the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of the Suncoast facilities.&lt;ref name="farley992005" /&gt; Carl Lavender, executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, said that this usage of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs was unauthorized: "...I'm not pleased. You can't produce materials with our logo on it unless I give permission. We are going to collect all of them back and have them discarded."&lt;ref name="farley992005" /&gt; Joanie Sigal of the Scientology volunteer group Clearwater Community Volunteers, and a member of the Clearwater Boys &amp; Girls Club's board of managers, had originally suggested adding the Club's insignia and distributing the booklets, and requested that the corporate board officially endorse the booklet.&lt;ref name="farley992005" /&gt; Executive director Lavender denied the request, stating: "The booklet ends as of today ... There needs to be a lesson. This cannot happen."&lt;ref name="farley992005" /&gt;

In 2005, Commander Mike Downing of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] complained that "the Church of Scientology forged his endorsement on The Way To Happiness Web site, prompting the LAPD to disavow any endorsement of Scientology and The Way To Happiness." &lt;ref&gt;

In 2007, The Way to Happiness Foundation produced and distributed pamphlets with sample endorsements from the mayors of [[Dallas, Texas]] and [[San Francisco, California]].  The books were sent to mayor's offices, accompanied by a letter asking mayors to purchase copies of the books for distribution in their city.&lt;ref name="dallasnews" /&gt;  The mayor of Dallas did not appreciate this unauthorized usage of the mayor's logo and the official seal of the city of Dallas, stating: "Clearly we were not very comfortable and did not think it was appropriate to use the seal of the city of Dallas, the mayor's logo or my name on something we were not aware of."&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/101207dnmetpamphlets.2cc31a1.html|title=Bogus Scientology pamphlets irk Dallas mayor: Booklets with Scientology writings have false endorsement|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=The Dallas Morning News, Inc.|accessdate=2008-04-25|date=2007-10-12|last=Bush|first=Rudolph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a report in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', the city attorney's office of Dallas looked into possible options of response regarding the matter.&lt;ref name="dallasnews" /&gt;

Similarly, in [[San Francisco, California]], the mayor's office also received a boxful of the booklets and voiced displeasure with the unauthorized usage of the mayor's image, logo, and the seal of the city.&lt;ref name=Newsompic /&gt;  According to a report by the [[Associated Press]], the city ordered the Scientology group to stop using an unauthorized picture of Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] on its promotional pamphlets.&lt;ref name=Newsompic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20071013-1048-ca-brf-newsom-scientology.html|title=S.F. orders Scientology group to stop using Mayor Newsom pic|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|accessdate=2008-04-25|date=2007-10-13|last=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An official spokesman for the mayor of San Francisco released a statement, saying: "The mayor does not support the unauthorized use of his image or the city seal on this booklet."&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/10/13/MN0JSP2R7.DTL|title=Group censured for using Newsom's image in pro-Scientology booklet|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|accessdate=2008-04-25|date=2007-10-13|last=Vega|first=Cecilia M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city attorney for San Francisco wrote a letter to "The Way to Happiness Foundation", citing [[California]] state law, which prohibits [[False advertising|deceptive and misleading advertising]] that could create an appearance that the pamphlets are from a government agency.  The city attorney also cited San Francisco law, writing that the Board of Supervisors must approve any commercial use of the city's official seal.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

In [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] a box of pamphlets was delivered to the mayor's office with the official City of Winnipeg logo and the image of mayor [[Sam Katz]]. No legal action was taken: "This is obviously a sample sent to our office and it was not approved or paid for by our office... If material was being distributed on our behalf with a false endorsement, it would be a different story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bartley | last = Kives | title = Katz finds religion... or vice versa  | work =  | publisher = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] | date = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Booklet sent to Winnipeg Mayor's office insinuates politician endorses Scientology | work = [[National Post]] | date = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 published US embassy cable, Ursula Caberta, the Director of the Working Group on Scientology (created by the Hamburg State Parliament to address all "destructive groups" which endanger society), obtained a booklet that contained the Hamburg mayor's photograph and signature, yet was actually a publication from The Way to Happiness Foundation. 
Caberta contended that "Scientology regularly used misleading methods to fool individuals into joining and said that such booklets had been distributed to other German cities. For someone unfamiliar with Scientology publications, the booklet looked very much like information brochures from the City of Hamburg."&lt;ref&gt;

In October 2007, uniformed police officers visiting [[Whyalla High School]] in [[Australia]] distributed a booklet called "Whyalla High School presents the way to happiness, a common-sense guide for better living", against the school's guidelines for religious education.&lt;ref name="kleinig"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Xanthe | first =Kleinig | title =Parent anger at religious 'advice' | work =[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page =23 | publisher =Nationwide News Pty Limited | date =2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One parent told the [[Adelaide, Australia]] paper ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' she had specifically told the school not to give religious instruction to her children, and other parents mistakenly thought that the booklets were distributed by the Education Department because Whyalla High School was displayed on the booklet's cover.&lt;ref name="kleinig" /&gt;

In March 2008, The Way to Happiness Foundation agreed to stop sending thousands of unsolicited, personalized copies of the booklet to elected officials in [[Florida]] after hundreds of them complained.&lt;ref name="hatzipanagos "&gt;{{cite news | last =Hatzipanagos   | first =Rachel | title =Scientology group stops guidebook mailings: Officials received unsolicited copies | work =[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] | date =2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kleinberg" /&gt; Booklets sent to mayors had the mayor's name on the front, and an endorsement from the mayor on the back, along with the Florida state flag and the address of the town hall.&lt;ref name="hatzipanagos" /&gt; A note advised prospective readers to contact town hall if they had further questions.&lt;ref name="kleinberg"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Kleinberg | first =Eliot | title =Mayors Find Happiness Booklet Irritating | work =[[The Palm Beach Post]] | page =1C | date =2008-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatzipanagos" /&gt; The Foundation said it had sent about 2,800 mailings, comprising a total of 250,000 booklets, to Florida mayors, businesses and community groups.&lt;ref name="kleinberg" /&gt; Following the complaints, the Foundation explained that the books were only samples meant to encourage the recipients to buy further copies, and said that it would henceforth send out unpersonalized stock copies only.&lt;ref name="kleinberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hatzipanagos" /&gt; Unlike many mayors who were reported to have been displeased at seeing their names on the personalized samples, [[Anthony Masiello]], the mayor of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] from 1994 to 2005, did authorize distribution of the booklet, complete with the city seal and a picture of the city hall, after a Scientology center opened in Buffalo in 2003.&lt;ref name="kleinberg" /&gt;

===False claims of affiliation===
In a speech given at a [[New Year]]'s event in 2007, [[David Miscavige]], the current leader of the Church of Scientology, claimed that the distribution of the booklet is aided by "corporate tie-ins", mentioning [[7-Eleven]] in [[Taiwan]], [[Coca-Cola]] [[Pakistan]], [[Philips|Philips Electronics]] in Pakistan, and [[Dell]] in Africa as companies who supported the Foundation as part of their efforts to address their "third-world image problems".&lt;ref name="companiesdeny"&gt;{{cite news|title=Companies deny Scientology links | work=NEWS.com.au|publisher=News Limited|date=2008-02-11|last=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Friedman | title=Kimora Lee No Scientologist | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,329807,00.html | publisher=Fox News | accessdate=2011-01-05 | date=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the speech was released to [[YouTube]] in February 2008.&lt;ref name="companiesdeny" /&gt; A spokesman for Dell told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that they had researched the matter with their colleagues in Africa and elsewhere and found "no evidence that this is accurate ... it's not our practice to disseminate religious materials of any kind."&lt;ref name="companiesdeny" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATblog&gt;{{cite news | title=Corporations named in Scientology video respond | url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/02/corporations-na.html | date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2011-01-05 | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from Philips and 7-Eleven told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that they were unaware of any such association, but said they were looking into the matter.&lt;ref name="companiesdeny" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATblog /&gt;

===Denying affiliation with Scientology===
''The Way to Happiness'' pamphlet caused controversy in [[Sderot]], [[Israel]] in February 2008, when a group calling itself the "Association for Prosperity and Security in the Middle East" became active in the city.&lt;ref name="unger"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Unger | first =Matthew | title =Sderot social workers concerned by offer of free workshops based on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings. Rabbi slams attempts to exploit residents' distress * Scientology denies any activity in Kassam-hit city | work =[[The Jerusalem Post]] | page =8 | date =2008-02-01  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-profit group sent e-mails to [[social worker]]s in Sderot, offering to help people cope with [[Kassam rocket]] attacks the city has been enduring.&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt; Dalia Yosef, head of an umbrella psychological organization in the region called Hosen Center, received complaints from multiple social workers about the e-mails, and stated: "We intend to investigate this association, as we do every group that offers social and psychological services in Sderot".&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt; In an e-mail response to ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', the Association for Prosperity stated: "We are unaware of any Scientology activity whatsoever being offered to Sderot residents. In general, regarding your question on Scientology activity in Sderot or elsewhere, you should contact the official representatives of the religion and receive their response".&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt;

A representative of Scientology told ''The Jerusalem Post'' that the director-general of the Association for Prosperity was a Scientologist, as were most individuals in the organization, but that some were not, and said that the principles found in ''The Way to Happiness'' were "totally different" from Scientology.&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt; The organization stated: "Claiming our organization is connected with Scientology  just because our director-general studied Scientology  is like saying that other nonprofits are hi-tech because volunteers work in hi-tech."&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt; Director-general of the Israeli Center for Cult Victims Ayelet Kedem described the organization as a [[front group]] for Scientology: "Hiding behind a front organization is a common tactic... The idea is to create a positive image by obscuring the connection with Scientology... Later, people who undergo free workshops are convinced that they must correct flaws in their personality by taking Scientology courses. Those who are hooked end up giving all their possessions to the Church of Scientology".&lt;ref name="unger" /&gt;

In Illinois in 2011, Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago) sponsored a resolution endorsing the "Good Choices" program, which is based on ''The Way to Happiness'', as one of a number of suitable tools for teaching character, morals and values. Actress [[Nancy Cartwright]], the voice of [[Bart Simpson]] and a Scientologist, submitted testimony to a House education committee, stating the program had "nothing to do with religion." Opponents voiced concerns about the program's links to the Scientology belief system, and said that promoting its use in schools would violate the principle of the [[separation of church and state]]. Burke accepted that the program's Scientology links were more substantial than he had thought. He said he would work on the resolution and present it again at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;

===Validity of secular claim===
The Way to Happiness is described by the foundation as "a non-religious moral code, based entirely on common sense, which is having profound effects around the world". The religious scholar [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] states he has performed an extensive search in the history of religions, and has been unable to find a single case in which "a religion was publicly propagating a secular version of its ethical system". To illustrate the uniqueness of the booklet, he gave the following analogy: "How about a secular, improved version of the [[Ten Commandments]]?"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Beit-Hallahmi|first=Benjamin  |title=Scientology: Religion or racket? |journal=Marburg Journal of Religion |volume=8 |date=September 2003|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/beit.html |accessdate=2010-01-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The text uses key words and concepts taken directly from Scientology beliefs – for example that "survival" is the fundamental point of life, that you can be truly happy if you become the "cause" of your own actions, and that the truth is "what is true for you."&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt; A Brooklyn school principal who at first appreciated the booklet as "a values-oriented book about righteousness and peace" stopped using it after becoming aware that it contained "an undercurrent of a religious nature."&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news | title=Scientology In The Schools | work = Newsweek | date=13 June 1993 | accessdate=2 December 2013 |url = http://www.newsweek.com/scientology-schools-194002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that ''The Way to Happiness'' is primarily a recruiting tool for the church. According to Vicki Aznaran, former Inspector General of the Church's highest ecclesiastical organization, the [[Religious Technology Center]], The Way to Happiness Foundation is "a front group to get people into Scientology" and the book is designed "to make Scientology palatable to the masses." &lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

'''{{IAST|Vaṇḍ Chhakō}}''' ({{lang-pa|ਵੰਡ ਛਕੋ}}) is one of the three main pillars of the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of the [[Sikhism]]. The other two pillars are ''[[Naam Japo]]'' and ''[[Kirat Karo]]''. It means to share what you have and to consume it together as a community. This could be wealth, food. etc. The term is also used to mean to share ones wealth with others in the community, to give to charity, to distribute in ''[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]'' and to generally help others in the community who need help. A Sikh is expected to contribute a portion of their wealth/income to people in need or to a worthy cause.

An alternative spelling and meaning, ''"Vand Ke Chakna"'', means to share the fruits of one’s labor with others before considering oneself, thus living as an inspiration and a support to the entire community.

Guru Ji says on page 299 of the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'',
{{quote|"The twelfth day of the lunar cycle: Dedicate yourself to giving charity, chanting the Naam and purification. Worship the Lord with devotion, and get rid of your pride. Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The mind is satisfied by lovingly singing the Kirtan of God's Praises. The Sweet Words of His Bani soothe everyone. The soul, the subtle essence of the five elements, cherishes the Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. This faith is obtained from the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, dwelling upon the Lord, you shall not enter the womb of reincarnation again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhitothemax.com/Page.asp?SourceID=G&amp;PageNo=&amp;ShabadID=1110&amp;Format=2 SikhitotheMax]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Page 718 of the ''Guru Granth Sahib'', 
{{quote|"I have enshrined the Lord's Feet within my heart. Contemplating my Lord and Master, my True Guru, all my affairs have been resolved. The merits of giving donations to charity and devotional worship come from the Kirtan of the Praises of the Transcendent Lord; this is the true essence of wisdom. Singing the Praises of the unapproachable, infinite Lord and Master, I have found immeasurable peace. The Supreme Lord God does not consider the merits and demerits of those humble beings whom He makes His own. Hearing, chanting and meditating on the jewel of the Naam, I live; Nanak wears the Lord as his necklace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhitothemax.com/Page.asp?SourceID=G&amp;PageNo=&amp;ShabadID=2752&amp;Format=2 SikhitotheMax]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bhai Gurdas Ji on page 20 of his ''Vaars'' says: 
{{quote|"The Gurus of the Sikhs inspire the Sikhs of the Guru to serve. Serving the holy congregation they receive the fruit of happiness. Sweeping and spreading the sitting mats they bathe in the dust of the holy congregation. They bring unused pitchers and fill them with water. They bring sacred food and distribute it among others and eat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhitothemax.com/Page.asp?SourceID=B&amp;PageNo=&amp;ShabadID=5992&amp;Format=2 SikhitotheMax]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Walter''' "'''Walt'''" '''Whitman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɪ|t|m|ə|n}}; May 31, 1819&amp;nbsp;– March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist. A [[humanism|humanist]], he was a part of the transition between [[transcendentalism]] and [[literary realism|realism]], incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of [[free verse]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds314/&gt; His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.

Born in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]] on [[Long Island]], Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the [[American Civil War]]. Early in his career, he also produced a [[temperance movement|temperance novel]], ''[[Franklin Evans]]'' (1842). Whitman's major work, ''Leaves of Grass'', was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American [[epic poetry|epic]]. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.&lt;ref name=Loving480/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds589&gt;Reynolds, 589&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Walter Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in [[West Hills, New York|West Hills]], [[Huntington, New York|Town of Huntington]], [[Long Island]], to parents with interests in [[Quaker]] thought, Walter (1789–1855) and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873). The second of nine children,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 17&lt;/ref&gt; he was immediately nicknamed "Walt" to distinguish him from his father.&lt;ref name=Loving29&gt;Loving, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Whitman, Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders: [[Andrew Jackson]], [[George Washington]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months. The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward.&lt;ref name=Loving29/&gt; At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to [[Brooklyn]], living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 24&lt;/ref&gt; One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

At age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 32&lt;/ref&gt; He then sought employment for further income for his family; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] and [[printer's devil]] for the weekly Long Island newspaper the ''Patriot'', edited by Samuel E. Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 44&lt;/ref&gt; There, Whitman learned about the printing press and [[typesetting]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have written "sentimental bits" of filler material for occasional issues.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of [[Elias Hicks]] to create a plaster mold of his head.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Clements left the ''Patriot'' shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Walt Whitman, age 28, 1848.png|thumb|upright|Whitman at age 28]]
The following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=Reynolds45&gt;Reynolds, 45&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved back to West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] weekly newspaper the ''Long-Island Star''.&lt;ref name=Reynolds45/&gt; While at the ''Star'', Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 32&lt;/ref&gt; and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the ''[[New-York Mirror]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 79&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the ''Star'' and Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 77&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] to work as a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 35&lt;/ref&gt; though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where.&lt;ref name=Kaplan81&gt;Kaplan, 81&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district,&lt;ref name=Kaplan81/&gt; and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the [[Panic of 1837]].&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 36&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

After his teaching attempts, Whitman went back to Huntington, New York, to found his own newspaper, the ''[[Long Islander News|Long-Islander]]''. Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery. After ten months, he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839.&lt;ref name=Reynolds60&gt;Reynolds, 60&lt;/ref&gt; There are no known surviving copies of the ''Long-Islander'' published under Whitman.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 38&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in [[Jamaica, Queens]] with the ''Long Island Democrat'', edited by James J. Brenton.&lt;ref name=Reynolds60/&gt; He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; One story, possibly apocryphal, tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in [[Southold, New York]], in 1840. After a local preacher called him a "[[Sodomy|Sodomite]]", Whitman was allegedly [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]. Biographer [[Justin Kaplan]] notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Jerome Loving]] calls the incident a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 514&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called "Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the ''New World'', working under [[Park Benjamin, Sr.]] and [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]].&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 56&lt;/ref&gt; He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the ''[[The New York Aurora|Aurora]]'' and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Daily Eagle2.jpg|thumb|''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''{{'}}s Washington, D.C. bureau office, c. 1916]]

He also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman lost his position at the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' in 1848 after siding with the free-soil "[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Barnburner]]" wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or "[[Barnburners and Hunkers|Hunker]]", wing of the party.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, 87–91&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the [[Free Soil Party]], which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonised western territories. Abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] derided the party philosophy as "white manism."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Louisa May Alcott on Race, Sex, and Slavery|author1=Alcott, L.M.|author2=Elbert, S.|date=1997|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555533076|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6g6kwxBDzxoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, he serialized a novel titled ''Life and Adventures of Jack Engle: An Auto-Biography: A Story of New York at the Present Time in which the Reader Will Find Some Familiar Characters'' in six installments of New York's ''The Sunday Dispatch''.&lt;ref name="jack" /&gt; In 1858, Whitman published a 47,000 word series called ''Manly Health and Training'' under the pen name Mose Velsor.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite news|last= Schuessler |first= Jennifer |title= Found: Walt Whitman's Guide to 'Manly Health' |date= 2016-04-29 |accessdate= 2016-05-01 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/books/walt-whitman-promoted-a-paleo-diet-who-knew.html |quote= Now, Whitman's self-help-guide-meets-democratic-manifesto is being published online in its entirety by a scholarly journal, in what some experts are calling the biggest new Whitman discovery in decades.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= wwqr-vol33-iss3&gt;{{cite journal|title= Special Double Issue: Walt Whitman's Newly Discovered 'Manly Health and Training' |date= Winter–Spring 2016 |accessdate= 2016-05-01 |journal= Walt Whitman Quarterly Review |issn= 0737-0679 |volume=  33 |number= Number 3 |url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol33/iss3/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently he drew the name Velsor from Van Velsor, his mother's family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Whitman |first= Walt |title= Genealogy—Van Velsor and Whitman |type= excerpt from ''Specimen Days'' |year= 1882 |url= http://www.bartleby.com/229/1003.html |website= [[Bartleby.com]] |accessdate= 2016-05-02 |quote= THE LATER years of the last century found the Van Velsor family, my mother's side, living on their own farm at Cold Spring, Long Island, New York State, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This self-help guide recommends beards, nude sunbathing, comfortable shoes, bathing daily in cold water, eating meat almost exclusively, plenty of fresh air, and getting up early each morning.

===''Leaves of Grass''===
{{main|Leaves of Grass}}
Whitman claimed that after years of competing for "the usual rewards", he determined to become a poet.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 185&lt;/ref&gt; He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 85&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1850, he began writing what would become ''Leaves of Grass'',&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 154&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman intended to write a distinctly American [[epic poetry|epic]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 155&lt;/ref&gt; and used [[free verse]] with a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] based on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 187&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''. George "didn't think it worth reading".&lt;ref name=Callow226&gt;Callow, 226&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Walt Whitman, steel engraving, July 1854.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Walt Whitman, age 35, from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', Fulton St., Brooklyn, N.Y., steel engraving by Samuel Hollyer from a lost [[daguerreotype]] by [[Gabriel Harrison]]]]

Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' himself&lt;ref name=Callow226/&gt; and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 178&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 795 copies were printed.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 198&lt;/ref&gt; No name is given as author; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 227&lt;/ref&gt; but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1855/anc.00019.html|title=[Review of ''Leaves of Grass'' (1855)]|publisher=The Walt Whitman Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines.  The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines—1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called "[[Song of Myself]]". The book received its strongest praise from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 203&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 340&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to Emerson's approval,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 232&lt;/ref&gt; but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly "obscene" nature of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 414&lt;/ref&gt; Geologist [[John Peter Lesley]] wrote to Emerson, calling the book "trashy, profane &amp; obscene" and the author "a pretentious ass".&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 211&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 1855, a few days after ''Leaves of Grass'' was published,  Whitman's father died at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months following the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 348&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 238&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 207&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leaves of Grass'' was revised and re-released in 1860&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 238&lt;/ref&gt; again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 363&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first publications of ''Leaves of Grass'', Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's ''Daily Times'' starting in May 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 225&lt;/ref&gt; As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 368&lt;/ref&gt; He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 375&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War years===
[[File:Walt Whitman - Brady-Handy restored.png|thumb|upright.1|Whitman as photographed by [[Mathew Brady]]]]
[[File:Manuscript Whitman Broadway 1861.jpg|thumb|Walt Whitman's handwritten manuscript for "Broadway, 1861"]]
As the [[American Civil War]] was beginning, Whitman published his poem "[[s:Leaves of Grass/Book XXI#Beat! Beat! Drums!|Beat! Beat! Drums!]]" as a patriotic rally call for the North.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 283&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's brother George had joined the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 410&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' included "First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore", which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George.&lt;ref name=Kaplan268&gt;Kaplan, 268&lt;/ref&gt; He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way.&lt;ref name=Reynolds411&gt;Reynolds, 411&lt;/ref&gt; "Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people", Whitman later wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 286&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek.&lt;ref name=Kaplan268/&gt; Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862, with the intention of never returning to New York.&lt;ref name=Reynolds411/&gt;

In Washington, D.C., Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part-time work in the army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 293&lt;/ref&gt; He would write of this experience in "The Great Army of the Sick", published in a New York newspaper in 1863&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 273&lt;/ref&gt; and, 12&amp;nbsp;years later, in a book called ''Memoranda During the War''.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 297&lt;/ref&gt; He then contacted Emerson, this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post.&lt;ref name=Reynolds411/&gt; Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to [[Salmon P. Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as ''Leaves of Grass''.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 281&lt;/ref&gt; and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of [[tuberculosis]] compounded by [[alcoholism]] on December 3.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 293–294&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 454&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] in the [[Department of the Interior]], thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', had written to [[William Tod Otto]], Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on Whitman's behalf.&lt;ref name=Loving283&gt;Loving, 283&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200.&lt;ref name=Reynolds455&gt;Reynolds, 455&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a [[furlough]] because of his poor health.&lt;ref name=Loving283/&gt; By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship&lt;ref name=Reynolds455/&gt; and published ''Drum-Taps''.&lt;ref name=Loving290&gt;Loving, 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job.&lt;ref name=Loving290/&gt; His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former [[Iowa]] Senator [[James Harlan (senator)|James Harlan]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds455/&gt; Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who "were seldom at their respective desks", he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of ''Leaves of Grass''.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 291&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General's office on July 1.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 304&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, ''The Good Gray Poet'', in January 1866. The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 456–457&lt;/ref&gt; Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of "[[O Captain! My Captain!]]", a relatively conventional poem on the death of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential [[pardon]]s. "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, "and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary."&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 293&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped it would be its last edition.&lt;ref name="Loving, 314"&gt;Loving, 314&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1868, ''Poems of Walt Whitman'' was published in England thanks to the influence of [[William Michael Rossetti]],&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 326&lt;/ref&gt; with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 324&lt;/ref&gt; The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer [[Anne Gilchrist (writer)|Anne Gilchrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Another edition of ''Leaves of Grass'' was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 331&lt;/ref&gt; As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 464&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 340&lt;/ref&gt; He also traveled and was invited to [[Dartmouth College]] to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health decline and death===
[[File:WhitmanHouse-CamdenNJ1.jpg|thumb|left|Whitman spent his last years at his home in Camden, New Jersey. Today, it is open to the public as the [[Walt Whitman House]].]]
After suffering a paralytic [[stroke]] in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother—George Washington Whitman, an engineer—at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother's home until buying his own in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 33&lt;/ref&gt; However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother's home in Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of ''Leaves of Grass'' among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Thomas Eakins]]. His other brother, Edward, an "invalid" since birth, lived in the house.

When his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street [[Walt Whitman House|(now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard)]].&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of American Authors''. Washington, D.C.: The Preservation Press, 1991: 141. {{ISBN|0-89133-180-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; First taken care of by tenants, he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 432&lt;/ref&gt; She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 548&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Whitman produced further editions of ''Leaves of Grass'' in 1876, 1881, and 1889.

While in [[Southern New Jersey]], Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of [[Laurel Springs, New Jersey|Laurel Springs]], between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his ''Leaves of Grass'' was written here, and in his ''Specimen Days'' he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was "the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', a version that has been nicknamed the "Deathbed Edition." He wrote, "L. of G. ''at last complete''—after 33 y'rs of hackling at it, all times &amp; moods of my life, fair weather &amp; foul, all parts of the land, and peace &amp; war, young &amp; old."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 586&lt;/ref&gt; Preparing for death, Whitman commissioned a [[granite]] [[mausoleum]] shaped like a house for $4,000&lt;ref name=Loving479&gt;Loving, 479&lt;/ref&gt; and visited it often during construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the last week of his life, he was too weak to lift a knife or fork and wrote: "I suffer all the time: I have no relief, no escape: it is monotony—monotony—monotony—in pain."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 587&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitman died on March 26, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 363&lt;/ref&gt; An [[autopsy]] revealed his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, a result of bronchial pneumonia,&lt;ref name=Loving479/&gt; and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The cause of death was officially listed as "[[pleurisy]] of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general [[miliary tuberculosis]] and parenchymatous nephritis."&lt;ref name="Reynolds, 588"&gt;Reynolds, 588&lt;/ref&gt; A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours.&lt;ref name=Loving480&gt;Loving, 480&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him.&lt;ref name="Reynolds, 588"/&gt; Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at [[Harleigh Cemetery, Camden|Harleigh Cemetery]] in Camden.&lt;ref name=Loving480/&gt; Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments.&lt;ref name=Reynolds589/&gt; Whitman's friend, the orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], delivered the eulogy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Eulogies'', Phyllis Theroux (Editor), 1977, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the remains of Whitman's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
[[File:§Whitman, Walt (1819-1892) - 1887 - ritr. da Eakins, Thomas - da Internet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Whitman by [[Thomas Eakins]], 1887–88]]
Whitman's work breaks the boundaries of poetic form and is generally prose-like.&lt;ref name=Reynolds314&gt;Reynolds, 314&lt;/ref&gt; He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 233&lt;/ref&gt; He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution.&lt;ref name="Loving, 314"/&gt; He is often labeled as the father of [[free verse]], though he did not invent it.&lt;ref name=Reynolds314/&gt;

===Poetic theory===
Whitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of ''Leaves of Grass'', "The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it." He believed there was a vital, [[wikt:symbiotic|symbiotic]] relationship between the poet and society.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 5&lt;/ref&gt; This connection was emphasized especially in "[[Song of Myself]]" by using an all-powerful first-person narration.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 324&lt;/ref&gt; As an American epic, it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 78&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leaves of Grass'' also responded to the impact that recent [[urbanization in the United States]] had on the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle and beliefs==
[[File:Whitman at about fifty.jpg|thumb|upright|Walt Whitman]]

===Alcohol===
Whitman was a vocal proponent of [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] and in his youth rarely drank alcohol. He once stated he did not taste "strong liquor" until he was 30&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 71&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally argued for [[prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 75&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest long fiction works, the novel ''Franklin Evans; or, The Inebriate'', first published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the [[Washingtonian movement]] though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions, as was ''Franklin Evans''.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 95&lt;/ref&gt; Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 91&lt;/ref&gt; and called it "damned rot".&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 75&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including ''The Madman'' and a short story "Reuben's Last Wish".&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 72&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bryan Binns ''A life of Walt Whitman''; p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Whitman was deeply influenced by [[deism]]. He denied any one faith was more important than another, and embraced all religions equally.&lt;ref name=Reynolds237&gt;Reynolds, 237&lt;/ref&gt; In "Song of Myself", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem "With Antecedents", affirming: "I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception".&lt;ref name=Reynolds237/&gt; In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] movement, to which he responded, "It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude [[wikt:humbug|humbug]]."&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 353&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none.&lt;ref name=Reynolds237/&gt; God, to Whitman, was both [[immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development.&lt;ref name="Kummings2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald D. Kummings|title=A Companion to Walt Whitman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uTCiN347lMC&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=13 August 2010|date=7 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9551-5|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0415939263 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
[[File:Whitman, Walt (1819-1892) and Doyle.JPG|thumb|Whitman and Peter Doyle, one of the men with whom Whitman was believed to have had an [[intimate relationship]]]]

Though biographers continue to debate Whitman's sexuality, he is usually described as either [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] in his feelings and attractions. Whitman's sexual orientation is generally assumed on the basis of his poetry, though this assumption has been disputed. His poetry depicts love and sexuality in a more earthy, individualistic way common in American culture before the [[medicalization]] of sexuality in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio, John and Estelle B. Freeman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America''.  University of Chicago Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-226-14264-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Leaves of Grass'' was often labeled pornographic or obscene, only one critic remarked on its author's presumed sexual activity: in a November 1855 review, [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] suggested Whitman was guilty of "that horrible sin not to be mentioned among Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitman had intense friendships with many men and boys throughout his life. Some biographers have suggested that he may not have actually engaged in sexual relationships with males,&lt;ref name="Loving19"&gt;Loving, 19&lt;/ref&gt; while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Rictor "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/whitman.htm Walt Whitman, Prophet of Gay Liberation]" from ''The Great Queens of History'', updated 18 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; English poet and critic [[John Addington Symonds]] spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Robinson, Michael. ''Worshipping Walt''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010: 142–143. {{ISBN|0691146314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he wrote to Whitman, "In your conception of Comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men?" In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting "[T]hat the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream'd &amp; unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me and seem damnable," and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children. Some contemporary scholars are skeptical of the veracity of Whitman's denial or the existence of the children he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html Higgins, Andrew C. in J.R.

Peter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman's life.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Kaplin, ''Walt Whitman: A Life'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics,2003 p287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shively /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 487&lt;/ref&gt; Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: "We were familiar at once—I put my hand on his knee—we understood. He did not get out at the end of the trip—in fact went all the way back with me."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 311–312&lt;/ref&gt; In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code "16.4" (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet).&lt;ref name=Shively&gt;Charley Shively, ''Calamus Lovers: Walt Whitman's Working Class Camerados'', Gay Sunshine Press, San Francisco, 1987: 25. {{ISBN|978-0-917342-18-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]] met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist [[George Cecil Ives]] that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips."&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, John ''Oscar Wilde: Myths, Miracles and Imitations'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p194 Note 7&lt;/ref&gt; The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, [[Edward Carpenter]] told [[Gavin Arthur]] of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Sunshine Interviews, Volume 1'', ''Gay Sunshine Press'', 1978. http://www.leylandpublications.com/exc_gaysuccess.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kantrowitz, Arnie.

[[File:Walt Whitman and Bill Duckett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Walt Whitman and Bill Duckett]]

Another possible lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Adams, Thomas Eakins; ''Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist'', p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Their photograph [pictured] is described as "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth L. Bohan; ''Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art, 1850–1920;'' p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, "You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image068.html?sort=photographer&amp;order=ascending&amp;page=1|title=Image 068 – The Walt Whitman Archive|work=whitmanarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some evidence that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual. He still had a photograph of her decades later, when he moved to Camden, and he called her "an old sweetheart of mine".&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 278&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter, dated August 21, 1890, he claimed, "I have had six children—two are dead". This claim has never been corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his life, he often told stories of previous girlfriends and sweethearts and denied an allegation from the ''[[New York Herald]]'' that he had "never had a love affair".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 490&lt;/ref&gt; As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote, "the discussion of Whitman's sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges."&lt;ref name=Loving19/&gt;

===Sunbathing and swimming===

Whitman reportedly enjoyed bathing naked and sunbathing nude.&lt;ref name="ErkkilaGrossman1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Betsy Erkkila|editor2=Jay Grossman|first=Ed|last=Folsom|chapter=Whitman's Calamus Photographs|title=Breaking Bounds: Whitman and American Cultural Studies|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm9hQfVAxqYC&amp;pg=PA213|date=15 February 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976228-6|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Manly Health and Training'' written under the pseudonym Mose Velsor, he advises men to swim naked.&lt;ref name="Velsor2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velsor|first1=Mose|title=Manly Health and Training, With Off-Hand Hints Toward Their Conditions|journal=Walt Whitman Quarterly Review |volume=33 |issue=3|year=2016 |pages=184–310 |issn=0737-0679 |doi=10.13008/0737-0679.2206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Sun-bathed Nakedness'', he wrote,

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me… Nature was naked, and I was also… Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! – ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.}}

===Shakespeare authorship===
Whitman was an adherent of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]], refusing to believe in the historical attribution of the works to [[William Shakespeare]] of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. Whitman comments in his ''November Boughs'' (1888) regarding Shakespeare's historical plays:

{{quote|Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism—personifying in unparalleled ways the medieval aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)—only one of the "wolfish earls" so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works—works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Paul A. "[http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/whitman.htm Walt Whitman on Shakespeare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324230827/http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/whitman.htm |date=2007-03-24 }}. Reprinted from ''The Shakespeare Oxford Society Newsletter'', Fall 1992: Volume 28, 4A.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Slavery===
Whitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]].&lt;ref name=Reynolds117&gt;Reynolds, 117&lt;/ref&gt; At first he was opposed to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their "[[wikt:ultraism|ultraism]] and officiousness".&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own.&lt;ref name=Reynolds117/&gt; In 1856, in his unpublished ''The Eighteenth Presidency'', addressing the men of the South, he wrote "you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote&lt;ref name=Reynolds473&gt;Reynolds, 473&lt;/ref&gt; and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 470&lt;/ref&gt; George Hutchinson and David Drews have argued, without providing textual evidence from Whitman's own early writings or other sources, that what little that "is known about the early development of Whitman's racial awareness suggests that he imbibed the prevailing white prejudices of his time and place, thinking of black people as servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms".&lt;ref name="Racial Attitudes"&gt;[http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_44.html "Racial Attitudes"], George Hutchinson and David Drews. Print source: J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., ''Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
Walt Whitman is often described as America's national poet, creating an image of America for itself. "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, and the rest of the world in a subordinate position." &lt;ref name="ijas.iaas.ie"&gt;Nathanael O'Reilly, [http://ijas.iaas.ie/index.php/imagined-america-walt-whitmans-nationalism-in-the-first-edition-of-leaves-of-grass/ "Imagined America: Walt Whitman’s Nationalism in the First Edition of 'Leaves of Grass']", ''Irish Journal of American Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman's nationalism: "Whitman's seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away" (xv-xvi). Nathanael O'Reilly in an essay on "Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of ''Leaves of Grass''" claims that "Whitman's imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights."&lt;ref name="ijas.iaas.ie"/&gt; Whitman's imaginative "mawkish" nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay "Racial attitudes","Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche." The authors concluded their essay with:&lt;ref name="Racial Attitudes"/&gt;
{{Quote|Because of the radically democratic and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] aspects of his poetry, readers generally expect, and desire for, Whitman to be among the literary heroes that transcended the racist pressures that abounded in all spheres of public discourse during the nineteenth century. He did not, at least not consistently; nonetheless his poetry has been a model for democratic poets of all nations and races, right up to our own day. How Whitman could have been so prejudiced, and yet so effective in conveying an egalitarian and antiracist sensibility in his poetry, is a puzzle yet to be adequately addressed.}}

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Walt Whitman, 1940.JPG|thumb|Whitman was honored on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|'Famous Americans Series']] Postal issue, in 1940.]]
Walt Whitman has been claimed as America's first "poet of democracy", a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character. A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without ''Leaves of Grass''... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modernism|Modernist]] poet [[Ezra Pound]] called Whitman "America's poet... He ''is'' America."&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra. "Walt Whitman", ''Whitman'', Roy Harvey Pearce, ed. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1962: 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Carnegie]] called him "the great poet of America so far".&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that "people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 475&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic, [[Harold Bloom]] wrote, as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of ''Leaves of Grass'':
{{quote|If you are American, then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and mother, even if, like myself, you have never composed a line of verse. You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for the secular Scripture of the United States. They might include [[Herman Melville|Melville's]] ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Mark Twain|Twain's]] ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', and Emerson's two series of ''Essays'' and ''[[The Conduct of Life]]''. None of those, not even Emerson's, are as central as the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. Introduction to ''Leaves of Grass''. Penguin Classics, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his own time, Whitman attracted an influential coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Edward Carpenter]], viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Michael. ''Worshipping Walt''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010: 143–145. {{ISBN|0691146314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Whitman's [[wikt:vagabond|vagabond]] lifestyle was adopted by the [[Beat generation|Beat movement]] and its leaders such as [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Jack Kerouac]] in the 1950s and 1960s as well as anti-war poets like [[Adrienne Rich]] and [[Gary Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;Loving, 181&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] numbered himself among Whitman's "wild children", and the title of his 1961 collection ''[[Starting from San Francisco]]'' is a deliberate reference to Whitman's ''Starting from Paumanok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whitman also influenced [[Bram Stoker]], author of ''[[Dracula]]'', and was the model for the character of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]. Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death.&lt;ref&gt;Nuzum, Eric.

Thomas Dunne Books, 2007: 141–147. {{ISBN|0-312-37111-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other admirers included the [[Eagle Street College]], an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, [[Bolton]], to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the poet's birthday.&lt;ref name="WWC"&gt;{{Citation |title=C.F.

===Musical renditions and audio recordings===
Whitman's poetry has been set to music by a large number of composers; indeed it has been suggested his poetry has been set to music more than that of any other American poet except for [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancomposers.org/rel990515.htm American Composers Orchestra – May 15, 1999 – Walt Whitman &amp; Music&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have set his poems to music have included [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]; [[Ernst Bacon]]; [[Leonard Bernstein]]; [[Benjamin Britten]]; [[Rhoda Coghill]]; [[Ronald Corp]]; [[George Crumb]]; [[Frederick Delius]]; [[Howard Hanson]]; [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]]; [[Hans Werner Henze]]; [[Paul Hindemith]]; [[Ned Rorem]]; [[Robert Strassburg]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1733&amp;context=wwqr|journal=Walt Whitman Quarterly Review|volume=21|number=3|year=2004|title=In Memoriam: Robert Strassburg, 1915–2003|author=Ed Folsom|publisher=[[University of Iowa]]|pages=189–191|doi=10.13008/2153-3695.1733}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]; [[Kurt Weill]]; and [[Roger Sessions]].

:''Not to be confused with [[Chaim Sofer]], the Hungarian rabbi and author of Machne Chaim
'''Yaakov Chaim Sofer''' (1870–1939)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kwM_CwAAQBAJ|title=Jewish Identities in East and Southeast Asia: Singapore, Manila, Taipei, Harbin, Shanghai, Rangoon, and Surabaya|last=Goldstein|first=Jonathan|date=2015-11-13|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110395464|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hebrew]]: יעקב חיים סופר) was a [[Sephardi]] [[rabbi]], [[Kabbalist]], [[Talmud|Talmudist]] and ''[[posek]]''. He is the author of ''Kaf Hachaim'', a work of [[halakha]] that he came to be known by.

==Biography==
Sofer was born in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He studied the [[Torah]] under [[Abdallah Somekh]] and the [[Yosef Hayyim|Ben Ish Hai]]. In 1904, he journeyed to [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]] together with colleagues [[Sadqa Hussein]] and the Asei HaYa'ar in order to meet with the [[Hakham Bashi|Rishon LeZion]], known as the [[Yaakov Shaul Elyashar|Yisa Berakha]], and to pray at the graves of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Osher, Avishai; [http://cms.education.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/6082B064-8FE4-4C54-BF11-6323CFCCA1E6/180662/resource_1850442337.pdf ''Biography of Rabbi Yosef Ḥayyim, the Ben Ish Hai''], pg. 6, Hebrew; ''cms.edu.gov.il''&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting [[Jerusalem]], he decided to settle there permanently. He studied in the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], well known for the study of [[kabbalah]]. In 1909 he moved to the newly founded ''Shoshanim leDavid'' [[yeshiva]]. It was here that he composed his works.

Sofer authored several works of ''[[halakha]]'' and ''[[aggadah]]''. His books are known for discussing the original traditions of [[Iraqi Jews]].

==Works==
In ''Kaf Hachaim'' (כף החיים),  Sofer discusses the ''halakha'' in light of the ''[[Rishonim]]'' and ''[[Acharonim]]''. ''Kaf Hachaim'', usually published in ten volumes, covers ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' (8 vol.) and parts of ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' (2 vol.). It is often compared to the [[Mishna Berura]] in terms of scope and approach, but differs in its more extensive reliance upon quotations.  This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly [[Isaac Luria]]), when these impact the Halakha. ''Shinun Halacha'' is a work summarising the [[posek|Halakhic conclusions]] presented in ''Kaf Hachaim''.

In addition to the Kaf Hachaim, Sofer  authored:
* ''Kol Yaakov'': on the laws of writing [[torah scroll]]s, ''[[tefillin]]'', and ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'', as well as on the ''tefillin'' in general
* ''Yagel Yaakov'': a compendium of [[Shabbat]] ''drashot'' ([[sermon]]s) delivered while in mourning for his father
* ''Yismach Yisrael'': novellae on the ''[[parsha]]'', the weekly [[Torah]] reading.
* ''Chayim Ad Haolam'' on the [[aggadah]] of the [[Talmud]]
