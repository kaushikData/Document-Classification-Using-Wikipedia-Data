The '''2006 Zakouma elephant slaughter''' refers to a series of [[poaching]] [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] of [[African elephant]]s in the vicinity of [[Zakouma National Park]] in southeastern [[Chad]].  These killings were documented in aerial surveys conducted from May through August 2006 and total at least 100 animals.&lt;ref name=WCS&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-08/wcs-wes083006.php "Widespread elephant slaughter discovered in Chad"] – August 30, 2006 Wildlife Conservation Society Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; This region has a four decade history of illegal killing of this [[species]]; in fact, the Chad population was over 300,000 animals as recently as 1970 and has been reduced to approximately 10,000 as of 2006. The African elephant nominally has Chadian governmental protection, but the implementation practices of the government (backed with certain EU help) have been insufficient to stem the slaughter by poachers.&lt;ref name=WCS /&gt;  The species [[African Bush Elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') occurs in several countries of Eastern Africa.

The most recent aerial surveys were conducted from August 3–11, 2006, overseen by [[J. Michael Fay]], a [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] conservationist and [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] [[explorer]]-in-residence. They found five separate massacre sites.&lt;ref name=WCS /&gt; Zakouma is considered "one of the last bastions of wildlife in all of central Africa".  Commissioned by the government of Chad and Project [[CRUSSE]] (Conservation and Rational Utilization of Sudan-Sahelian Ecosystems), Fay conducted surveys  In 2005 and 2006 of elephants within Zakouma, and found populations to decline from 3885 to 3020 animals, significantly offsetting the precipitous increase of the previous six months, although the counting error could not be fully assessed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Reporting details==
Fay reported that he saw five men at a base camp, who ran when his [[airplane]] approached. At another time he saw one man on [[horseback]] with an [[automatic weapon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html National Geographic reporting source describing use of automatic weapons]&lt;/ref&gt; who fired on his airplane.  "Zakouma elephants are getting massacred right before our eyes.", Fay relayed to reporters. "We hadn't been in the air more than two hours when we saw our first [[Carrion|carcass]]. It was fresh, maybe just a few weeks old, not far from the park headquarters, and the animal's face had been chopped off, the [[tusk]]s removed."   Fay and National Geographic photographer Michael Nichols documented what they found in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080725140836/http://mediastorm.org/0016.htm Ivory Wars, Last Stand in Zakouma].

==History of Zakouma National Park==

Zakouma National Park is located between [[Sarh]] and [[Am Timan]], in the southeastern part of [[Chad]]. Created in 1963, it was Chad's first national park, and has an area of almost 3000 square kilometres. It is entirely surrounded by the [[Bahr Salamat Faunal Reserve]].  Zakouma was neglected during the period of civil conflict, but a restoration programme, supported by the [[European Union]], began in 1989 and is continuing in 2006.

Elephants within the park have protection from the Chadian government, but the elephants who migrate outside Zakouma to forage in the [[rainy season]], are not subject to the same patrol protection as within the park. According to Stephen Sautner of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]: "All hunting of elephants in Chad is illegal, and the sale of ivory has been banned since 1989, though black-market trade is increasing."&lt;ref name=WCS /&gt;

==Logistics of ivory trade==
:''Further information: [[ivory trade]]''
Killing elephants for ivory has been a major cause of the decline of the African elephant population since at least the 1970s.  Most of the ivory harvested is imported into [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Thailand]].  For example, between 1996 and 2002 forty-five tonnes of ivory in transit to China were seized by authorities.  China agreed to reduce imports of ivory; however a Chinese official Chen Jianwei has indicated that many Chinese people are confused about the legality of ivory imports[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921075818/http://www.bornfree.org.uk/elefriends/images/ivorytrade.pdf].

==Relation to regional conflict==

Zakouma is about 260 kilometres west of the conflict area of [[Darfur]], and is in the path of recent warfare in Chad, thus overall security is low and the national border is "porous in this isolated region."&lt;ref name=WCS /&gt;

==Conservation action==

In response to this devastating event, The [[WILD Foundation]] partnered with [[The Wildlife Conservation Society]] and others to deter and detain poachers using aircraft surveillance.  The aircraft will focus on park borders, where elephants are not protected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16259">'''[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]]''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

No specific right of access to information was enshrined in the [[Constitution of Turkey|1982 Turkish Constitution]] that in Article 26 instead refers to the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]], including the "right to receive information". In the 2001 amended Constitution, Article 74 specifically refers to the right to information establishing that everyone has the right to obtain information. Following the 2010 Constitutional amendments, the right to appeal to the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson]] is also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf|title=Constitution of the Republic of Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=global.tbmm.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBRD"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2012 |title=Commercial laws of Turkey.

The Review Board of Access to Information |access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Access to public information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information, Law No: 4982 of 2004. The law was introduced in the framework of the negotiations for accession to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Turchia/Turchia-l-accesso-alle-informazioni-ai-tempi-di-Erdogan-178001#26 |title=Turchia: l'accesso alle informazioni ai tempi di Erdoğan |last=Gülseren |first=Adaklı |date=21 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa / Bianet |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) Steering Committee designated the inactive status of Turkey with regard to the OGP action plan which included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/turkey|title=Turkey's Action Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steering Committee found that the Turkish government acted contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/09/21/turkey-made-inactive-open-government-partnership|title=Turkey made inactive in the Open Government Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partneship Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Framework ==
In addition to Law No: 4982, in 2004 a circular by the Prime Minister on “The exercise of the right of petition and access to information” was also enacted (Circular No. 25356). It identifies the basis of this policy in the principle called “citizen oriented approach in public services”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Prime%20Ministry%20Circular%20on%20Right%20to%20Information.pdf|title=The exercise of the right of petition and access to information, Circular 2004/12|last=|first=|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|series=|location=|orig-year=|publication-place=Official Gazette|publication-date=January 24, 2004|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Law No: 4982, the law applies to any natural and legal person who are entitled to apply to the institutions by way of exercising the right to information. Foreign residents can exercise the right “on the condition that the information that they require is related to them or the field of their activities and on the basis of the [[Reciprocity (international relations)|principle of reciprocity]]”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Turkey_FOI_2008_Report.pdf|title=Freedom of Information in Turkey: A Critical Assessment of the Implementation and Application of the Turkish Right to Information Act 2003|last=Akdeniz|first=Yaman|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|publisher=bilgiedinmehakki.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to “any written, printed or copied file, document, book, journal, brochure, etude, letter, software, instruction, sketch, plan, film, photograph, tape and video cassette, map of the institutions and the information, news and other data that are recorded and saved in electronic format that are within the scope of (the) law”.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Government bodies are required to respond in 15 working days. They must provide either a certified copy of the document or when it is not possible to make a copy, applicants can examine them at the institution.

Initially, the Right to Information Assessment (Review) Council (''[[Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu]]''- BEDK) provided very poor information about its activities and decisions. It started to publish all information on its decision only in 2008 with the launch of its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/default.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu (BEDK)|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBRD" /&gt; The BEDK jurisdiction on appeals for denials to requests of information was originally limited to cases relating to national security and state economic interests. In November 2005, the Law was amended in order to allow any kind of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beb.aku.edu.tr/bilgi-edinme-birimi/5432-sayili-bilgi-edinme-hakki-kanununda-degisiklik-yapilmasina-dair-kanun/|title=5432 sayılı Bilgi Edinme Hakkı Kanununda Değişiklik Yapılmasına Dair Kanun|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2005|website=beb.aku.edu.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 2016 EC progress report, the Board of Review of Access to Information was effective in its role of reviewing applicants' appeals and in publishing related decisions online. The report also notes that, however, there is no quality assurance in the responses given to applicants.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9 November 2016|title=Turkey 2016 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Decision No. 2016/1 of August 4, 2016 on “Applications for Information on Measures and Transactions within the Context of Emergency State Decentralization Laws”, the applicants who ask for information and documents relating with (i) persons who are removed from the public service and (ii) institutions and organizations which are closed down under the Decree Laws in the State of Emergency Law,  are excluded from the scope of the right to obtain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/kurul-ilke-kararlari.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kuruluna itirazda bulunma süresi hakkında 01/09/2016 tarih ve 2016/2 sayılı İlke Kararı|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|publisher=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] (EC) Progress Report on Turkey, the Law on access to public information is not fully aligned with international standards. Another problem highlighted by the EC is the failure to adopt pending legislation on state and trade secrets, which prevents to balance between confidentiality and transparency when assessing freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

=== Exceptions ===
Under Articles No. 20- 28 of Law No. 4982,  the right to information can be restricted if such information refers to:
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Secrets, which would clearly cause harm to the security of the state or foreign affairs or national defense and national security;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Economical Interests of the State, which would harm the economic interests of the state or cause unfair competition or enrichment;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Intelligence, regarding the duties and activities of the civil and military intelligence units;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Administrative Investigation, violating the right of privacy, endangering the security or the life of an individual, jeopardising the security of the investigation, disclosing the source of the information which needs to be kept secret,;
* Information or Documents Pertaining the Judicial Investigation and Prosecution;
* Privacy of the Individuals, which would interfere with the health records, private and family life, honour and dignity, and the economical and professional interests of an individual;
* Privacy of Communication;
* Trade Secrets and Intellectual Property;
* Institutions’ Internal Regulations, Opinions, Information Notes and Recommendations.

In practice, protection of state secrets, commercial secrets and privacy were among the most common grounds for rejecting a request.&lt;ref name="EC2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10 November 2015|title=Turkey 2015 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert, all these conditions largely nullify the legal provisions which are intended to protect the right to public information in Turkey.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

== Access to Public Information in Practice ==
The exercise of the right of access to public information is particularly problematic in the Turkish context, where the management of public affairs is characterized by a secretive approach to power and politics, and several problems affect the exercise of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]] and [[media freedom in Turkey|media freedom]].&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt; The situation has been deteriorating with the [[State of emergency|state of exception]] following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|attempted coupt of July 15, 2016]], entailing severe limitations to media freedom and to dissemination of information, press freedom limitations, sanctions against newspapers and journalists, censorship and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

A right to information request can be made using the BIMER website (''[[Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi]]''), active since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bimer.gov.tr/|title=Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi (BİMER)|last=|first=|date=|website=bimer.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, only 2,7% of requests for access to information were rejected, against 3,4% in 2013.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; The share of appeals refused by the Board of Review of the Access to Information fell from 50,6% in 2013 to 36,3% in 2014.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; According to the European Commission, more than 2 million applications a year for access to information were submitted both in 2015 and 2016. The percentage of requests refused remained small, approximately 3.7% up to June 2016 compared with 3% in 2015.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

Regarding the right to access information for lawyers, especially when they are assisting defendants accused with terrorism charges, they face serious problems. Their access to documents pertaining to the case can be restricted before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mission to Turkey|last=Knaul|first=Gabriela|date=May 4, 2012|editor-last=|website=undocs.org|id=A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|publisher=United Nations, Human Rights Council|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the Steering Committee of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) designated the inactive status of Turkey, for acting contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles. The OGP action plan included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The decision follows a resolution approved unanimously by the OGP Steering Committee during their May 4, 2016 ministerial level meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. That resolution called for the government of Turkey to take steps to re-engage in OGP, including the development of a National Action with broad civil society participation by September 1, 2016.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

In [[Multi-hop routing|multi-hop networks]], '''Adaptive Quality of Service routing''' (AQoS or AQR) protocols {{Definition|date=July 2009}} have become increasingly popular and have numerous applications.  One application in which it may be useful is in [[Mobile ad hoc network]]ing (MANET). 

Adaptive QoS routing is a [[cross-layer optimization]] [[adaptive routing]] mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS information for the adaptive routing algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node; and (3) an integrated
decision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates.

== Introduction ==
A [[wireless ad hoc network]] consists of a collection of mobile nodes interconnected by multihop wireless paths with wireless transmitters and receivers. Such networks can be spontaneously created and operated in a self-organized manner, because they do not rely upon any preexisting network infrastructure.

The emergence of multimedia applications in communications has generated the need to provide
[[mobile quality-of-service]] (QoS) support in ad hoc networks, and such applications require a stable path to guarantee QoS requirements. However, the topology of ad hoc networks is highly dynamic due to the unpredictable node mobility. In addition, wireless channel bandwidth is limited. So, QoS provisioning in such networks is complex and challenging.

QoS routing usually involves two tasks: collecting and maintaining up-to-date state information about the network and finding feasible paths for a connection based on its QoS requirements.  Many approaches currently exist to perform QoS routing, most of which consist of routing across the [[Network layer]] of the [[OSI model]] only.  Some approaches utilize both the Network and [[Data link layer]] but do not consider the cross layer behaviors.  This makes quantifying the QoS parameters difficult and leads to considerations of QoS but does not guarantee QoS.  

To address this problem, appropriate cross-layer cooperation is required.  Adaptive QoS schemes provide QoS information by factoring the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link parameters into QoS performance. 

=== Traditional QoS Approaches ===
Most QoS approaches tend to focus on only one QoS parameter (e.g., packet loss, end-to-end delay, and bandwidth). For example, while many of the QoS-related schemes are successful in reducing packet loss by adding redundancy in the packet, they do this at the expense of end-to-end delay. Because packet loss and end-to-end delay are inversely related, it may not be possible to find a path that simultaneously satisfies the delay, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. Some proposed QoS routing algorithms do consider multiple metrics, but without considering cross-layer cooperation. Multipath routing is another type of QoS routing that has received much attention, since it can provide load balancing, fault tolerance, and higher aggregate bandwidth. Although this approach decreases packet loss and end-to-end delay, it is only efficient and reliable if a relationship can be found between the number of paths and QoS constraints.

== Adaptive QoS Scheme Overview ==
To implement an adaptive multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed in different parts of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selected
routes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manage
and build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptive
routing parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the traffic distribution rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.

QoS requirements can be based on either a delay or a delay and bandwidth requirement, or a packet loss requirement. FEC parity length is derived from the difference between the QoS
delay requirement and the average delay on selected paths under the packet-loss constraint. Average packet loss under this FEC scheme is achieved by using multiple routing paths.
At the same time, the packet distribution rate on each path is determined under fair packet-loss and load-balance principles.  Routing maintenance under the same QoS guarantees
is achieved without increasing its computational complexity.This required to be understand.

== Adaptive QoS Performance ==
Three functions (routing function, local statistic computation and monitoring function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are implemented in the different parts of the mobile network. Due to the distributed structure, the computation and implementation complexity of the
routing scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and traffic distribution rate) are dynamic and optimized. In addition
to supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The distributed structure of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulation
results indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3255">'''Air sovereignty''' is the fundamental right of a [[sovereign state]] to regulate the use of its [[airspace]] and enforce its own [[aviation law]] - ''in extremis'' by the use of [[fighter aircraft]].

The upper limit of national airspace is not defined by international law.

==NATO Air Policing==
As part of the principal of collective defence in peacetime NATO members carry out air policing missions to protect the integrity of Allied airspace.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;[https://www.ac.nato.int/page5931922/-nato-air-policing NATO Air Policing]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the mission aircraft are used in a Quick Reaction Air role to respond to both civilian and military aircraft in distress and any aircraft that approach allied airspace and fail to identify themselves, fail to communicate with Air Traffic Control or fail to file a flight plan.&lt;ref name="nato1" /&gt;

A number of NATO countries cannot sustain a force of quick reaction aircraft, so aircraft of other member states provide cover in the [[Baltic Air Policing|Baltic Area]]. In the Benelux area (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) the Belgian and Dutch air forces provide the quick reaction aircraft in turns of four months each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airn.nato.int/archive/2016/belgium--netherlands-to-take-turns-in-policing-benelux-airspace Belgium, Netherlands to take turns in policing BENELUX airspace]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
The Swiss Air Force provides aircraft and systems to protect the sovereignty of Swiss airspace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vtg.admin.ch/en/organisation/air-force.html Air Force]&lt;/ref&gt; it also covers Liechtenstein airspace.

==United States==
The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1946 that private property owners have exclusive rights to the airspace above their land, up to an altitude of 365 feet (see ''[[United States v. Causby]]'' 328 U.S. 256, 266 (1946)). 

In the United States, the air sovereignty mission had been renamed "Air Sovereignty Alert", but in 2011 it was renamed "Aerospace Control Alert." The [[lion's share]] of the aerospace control alert missions in the U.S. are carried out by the [[Air National Guard]] by units flying, at present time, the [[F-15 Eagle]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] jets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=697707 AIR SOVEREIGNTY ALERT: AMERICA’S SECURITY BLANKET]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/DRArchive/Pages/2011/October%202011/October%2003%202011/NewName,SameMission.aspx New Name, Same Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2010/December%202010/1210sovereignty.aspx Adm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">The '''all-events test''', under [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax law]], is the requirement that all the events fixing an [[accrual]]-method taxpayer's right to receive income or incur expense must occur before the taxpayer can report an item of income or expense.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Under an accrual method of accounting, income is includible in [[gross income]] in the taxable year in which the all-events test is met.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 1.451-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations, 26 C.F.R. 1.451-1(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The all events test is two-pronged concerning the recognition of income, three-pronged when dealing with deductions. It is met when (1) the right to income is fixed (recognition of income) or all events have occurred which establish the fact of liability (deduction), and (2) the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph (4) of subsection (h) of {{usc|26|461}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The third prong which is applicable when dealing with an accrual method taxpayer's right to a deduction is (3) economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability.&lt;ref&gt;See 26 USC 461(h)(1) and (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions apply to certain recurring items.&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 461(h)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other exceptions apply to the all-events test:
1. Taxpayers are put on cash method of accounting in those instances where payment precedes performance or due date of an obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Ruling 74-607, 1974-2 C.B. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the earlier of test. This violates traditional accrual method recognition of income and is an exception to the all-events test because the right to income is not yet fixed. The taxpayer has not yet performed services allowing for the collection of income but through Revenue Ruling the IRS has determined that recognition of income is proper because cash is in hand.
2. Doubt as to Collectibility. This is not a true exception to the all-events test but a clarification. If at the time of sale there was no doubt as to the collectibility of income, doubt that arises subsequent to the time when all events have occurred that fix the right to receipt do not change the fact that all events indeed did occur.&lt;ref&gt;''Spring City Foundry Co. v. Commissioner'', 292 U.S. 182 (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arizona Fourth Amendment Protection Act''' is a bill proposed in the [[Arizona legislature]] that would withdraw state support for collection of metadata and ban the use of warrantless data in courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/sb1156p.htm|title=SB 1156: An Act amending title 41, chapter 9, Arizona Revised Statutes, by adding article 10; relating to prohibited electronic data collection |publisher=Arizona Legislature |accessdate=January 24, 2014}} (further documents at [http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=sb1156 Arizona legislature SB 1156])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nation.lk/edition/breaking-news/item/25562-arizona-first-us-state-to-attempt-legal-resistance-to-nsa-surveillance.html |title= Arizona first US state to attempt legal resistance to NSA surveillance |work= The Nation |location= Colombo, Sri Lanka |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= February 5, 2014 |url= http://rt.com/usa/arizona-lawmakers-nsa-spying-671/ |title=Arizona first US state to attempt legal resistance to NSA surveillance |publisher=RT Network |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Many lawmakers believed that in the wake of the [[Edward Snowden|Snowden disclosures]], restoration of public trust would require legislative changes.&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; More than 20 bills have been written with the goal of reining in government surveillance powers since the disclosures began in June 2013.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

Ward explained her introduction of the bill, saying,"There is no question that the NSA program, as it is now being run, violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. This is a way to stop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Steven |last= Nelson |url= https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/12/09/new-legislation-would-ban-nsa-from-arizona |title= New Legislation Would Ban NSA From Arizona |work= US News and World Report |date= December 9, 2013 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media quoted Lyle Mann, director of the [[Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training board]], who opposes the bill, as saying "if they do nothing with the information, something bad is going to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://azdailysun.com/news/local/state-and-regional/police-group-objects-to-bill-blocking-use-of-metadata/article_285d082a-8d67-11e3-9e3c-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Police Group Objects to Bill Blocking Use of Metadata |work= Arizona Daily Sun |location= Flagstaff, AZ |first= Howard |last= Fischer |agency= Capitol Media Services |date= February 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blasphemy law in Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Undang-undang Penistaan Agama}}) is the legislation, presidential decrees, and ministerial directives that prohibit [[blasphemy]] in [[Indonesia]].

==Criminal Code==
Indonesia prohibits blasphemy by its Criminal Code. The Code's Article 156(a) targets those who deliberately, in public, express feelings of hostility, hatred, or contempt against religions with the purpose of preventing others from adhering to any religion, and targets those who disgrace a religion. The penalty for violating Article 156(a) is a maximum of five years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="US2009"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009 | work = Indonesia | publisher = [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] | date = May 2009 | url = http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/indonesia.pdf | accessdate = 2009-06-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090508193759/http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/indonesia.pdf | archivedate = 8 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zfikri"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://zfikri.wordpress.com/2007/12/04/ruling-against-blasphemy-unconstitutional/ | title = Ruling against blasphemy unconstitutional | last = Al ‘Afghani | first = Mohamad Mova | date = 3 December 2007 | publisher = [[The Jakarta Post]] | accessdate = 2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential decree==
Article 156(a) is the complement to a decree enacted by President [[Sukarno]] and implemented by President [[Soeharto]], namely, Presidential Decree No. 1/PNPS/1965 on the Prevention of Blasphemy and Abuse of Religions. Article 1 of the decree prohibits the "deviant interpretation" of religious teachings, and mandates the President to dissolve any organisation practicing deviant teachings.&lt;ref name="zfikri"/&gt; Until the end of the 20th century, Indonesian society was tolerant of Islam (88% of the population), Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Judaism, and animism.&lt;ref name="US2007"&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90137.htm | title = Indonesia | work = International Religious Freedom Report 2007 | publisher = U.S. State Department | accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government was tolerant of persons with no religion, but does not count them in any census.&lt;ref name="US2007"/&gt;

==Constitution==
Article 29 of Indonesia's Constitution stipulates "the state is based on the belief in the one supreme God." The Constitution does not dictate which religion's version of God should be worshipped.&lt;ref name="zfikri"/&gt; In January 2006, the Ministry of Religious Affairs accorded official status to six religions: Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism. On 9 December 2006, the House of Representatives passed a new civil registration bill requiring citizens to identify themselves on government ID cards as a member of one of the six religions.&lt;ref name="US2007"/&gt;

==MUI==
The Government formed a body of Muslim advisors, the [[Indonesian Ulema Council]] (MUI) in 1975, and continues to fund and appoint its members. The MUI is not formally a government body but it is influential. The Government considers the MUI's [[Fatwa|''fatawa'']] when making decisions or drafting legislation.&lt;ref name="US2007"/&gt; In July 2005, the MUI issued a fatwa that condemned the sect of [[Ahmadiyya]] as a heresy. In June 2008, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Home Ministry issued a Joint Ministerial Letter regarding the Ahmadiyya. The letter told authorities to restrict Ahmadiyya activities to private worship, and to prevent the Amadhi Muslims from proselytising. Provincial governors in West Sumatra, South Sumatra, and West Nusa Tenggara banned all Ahmadiyya activity.&lt;ref name="US2009"/&gt;

==Conflict==
Indonesia's laws and policies have produced many instances where members of one religion have persecuted the members of other religions or of other sects. The authorities have not brought to justice many perpetrators of crimes. Crimes are commonly justified by the perpetrators as actions against hatred, heresy, blasphemy, or deviance.&lt;ref name="US2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US2007"/&gt;

In October 2009, a group of petitioners, including some human rights groups, requested that Indonesia's Constitutional Court review the 1965 Law on Blasphemy. On 19 April 2010, the Court announced its refusal to make the review. "If the Blasphemy Law was scrapped before a new law was enacted ... it was feared that misuses and contempt of religion would occur and trigger conflicts in society," Justice Akil Mochtar said. The Court offered an interpretation of the Law. The interpretation says the state recognises six religions, and "leaves alone" the followers of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* On 2 June 2009, the Central Jakarta District Court convicted Lia Eden, also known as Lia Aminuddin or Syamsuriati, of blasphemy.

* On 10 April 2007, police in the town of Pasuruan, East Java, arrested two men, Rochamim (or Rohim) and Toyib. Toyib was a follower of Rochamim who, according to local residents, said things such as Islam is an Arab religion; prayers five times a day are unnecessary; and the Quran is full of lies.

* In September 2005, an East Java court sentenced each of six drug and cancer treatment counselors at an East Java treatment center to five years in prison and an additional three years in prison for violating key precepts of Islam by using paranormal healing methods.

* In August 2005, East Java's Malang District Court sentenced Muhammad Yusman Roy to two years' imprisonment for reciting Muslim prayers in Indonesian, which, according to the MUI, tarnished the purity of Arabic-based Islam. Roy was released from prison on 9 November 2006 after serving eighteen months of his sentence.&lt;ref name="US2007"/&gt;
* In June 2005, police charged a lecturer at the Muhammadiyah University in Palu for heresy.

'''''Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.''''',&lt;ref&gt;26 N.Y.2d 219, 309 N.Y.S.2d 312 (N.Y. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; was a New York court case in which [[Court of Appeals of New York|New York's highest court]] considered whether permanent damages were an appropriate remedy in lieu of a permanent injunction. The case was one of the first and most influential instances of a court applying permanent damages. It is widely referenced in [[law and economics]] research and case law.

==Background==
Land owners with property adjacent to a cement plant had sued, alleging that dirt, smoke and vibration issuing from it constituted [[nuisance]]. The trial court agreed and awarded damages, but rejected the request for an injunction to cut off the problem.

On appeal, the court observed that ordinarily, "where a nuisance has been found and where there has been any substantial damage shown by the party complaining, an injunction will be granted." Following that path would result in closing the plant, however, and the court sought to avoid that "drastic remedy." Instead, it engaged in a cost-balancing analysis, contrasting the trial court's finding that the total permanent damages done to all plaintiffs was $185,000 with Atlantic Cement's investment in the plant (upwards of $45,000,000) and more than 350 jobs at stake. "The parties could settle this private litigation at any time if defendant paid enough money and the imminent threat of closing the plant would build up the pressure on defendant," the court observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[G]rant[ing] the injunction unless defendant pays plaintiffs such permanent damages as may be fixed by the court seems to do justice between the contending parties. All of the attributions of economic loss to the properties on which plaintiffs' complaints are based will have been redressed ... [and i]t seems reasonable to think that the risk of being required to pay permanent damages to injured property owners by cement plant owners would itself be a reasonably effective spur to research for improved techniques to minimize nuisance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judges also discussed the concept of “servitude on land.” Servitude, in property law, ties rights and obligations to ownership of land so that they run with the land to successive owners. The majority described the damage imposed by the cement plant as a servitude on the land. They claimed that payment of permanent damages would constitute full compensation for the servitude placed on the land. The dissenting opinion posited that imposing a servitude on land where the impairment continues for a private use is unconstitutional. The author cited the state constitution—“private property shall not be taken for public use”—remarking that it does not mention private use and concluding that “the permanent impairment of private property for private purposes is not authorized in the absence of clearly demonstrated public benefit.” However, the majority's interpretation of the damage placed on the land by the nuisance held.

The trial court was ordered "to grant an injunction which shall be vacated upon payment by defendant of ... permanent damage[s] to the respective plaintiffs."

==Significance==
The case is often cited as an illustration of the [[law and economics]] approach in [[nuisance|nuisance law]] and [[property law]]. The court granted an injunction against the cement plant for nuisance, but permitted the plant to pay permanent damages after which the court would vacate the injunction. In essence, the court permitted the plant to pay the [[net present value]] of its effects and to continue polluting.

{{Insolvency}}
'''British Virgin Islands bankruptcy law''' is principally codified in the Insolvency Act, 2003 and to a lesser degree in the Insolvency Rules, 2005.  Most of the emphasis of [[bankruptcy law]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] relates to corporate insolvency rather than personal bankruptcy.  As an [[offshore financial centre]], the British Virgin Islands has many times more [[offshore company|resident companies]] than citizens, and accordingly the courts spend more time dealing with corporate insolvency and reorganisation.

The Insolvency Act largely eschews the [[rescue culture]] and emphasises the protection of creditors' rights (and in particular [[secured creditor]]s' rights) over other stakeholders in a bankruptcy and the rehabilitation and protection of businesses as a [[going concern]].  This reflects the large number of [[structured finance vehicles]] incorporated in the jurisdiction which employ [[leveraged finance]], but do not otherwise trade or have any employees.

Bankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as "[[personal bankruptcy]]" in the British Virgin Islands, whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as "[[corporate insolvency]]".  The legislation largely deals with both separately, although there are some common provisions.

==History==

Prior to the Insolvency Act coming into force on 1 January 2004, bankruptcy legislation in the British Virgin Islands was divided between the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 8) and the Companies Act (Cap 285).  The previous legislation was largely piecemeal, and eventually resulted in a comprehensive review which led to the enactment of the 2003 statute.

After the coming into force of the Insolvency Act 2003 (and the repeal of earlier legislation) the country had to wait nearly 18 months for the Insolvency Rules 2005 to come into force.  In practice this meant that no bankruptcies were possible, because the delegation of certain key provisions, including the particulars of [[preferred creditor]]s, were deferred to the rules.

==Bankruptcy==

Where an individual is unable to pay or provide for his debts he may be placed in bankruptcy by an order of the court.

A court in the British Virgin Islands may make a [[bankruptcy order]] against an individual if:
# that person is unable to pay his debts as they fall due;
# the unsecured liabilities of the debtor exceed the prescribed minimum;&lt;ref&gt;The prescribed minimum was intended to be set out in the Insolvency Rules, but unfortunately the Rules are silent on this point.  Accordingly, the minimum is treated as US$0.&lt;/ref&gt; and
# the value of the debtor’s assets available for distribution exceeds the prescribed minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 295(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make an application for an order it is necessary to show that on the date of the application the debtor was:
# resident, present or carrying on business in the British Virgin Islands;
# the debtor has or appears to have assets in the British Virgin Islands; or
# that there is a reasonable prospect that the making of a bankruptcy order will benefit the creditors of the debtor.

Once appointed pursuant to an order the [[trustee in bankruptcy]] will collect in the assets of the debtor except for certain special assets protected by law,&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 313(2)&lt;/ref&gt; sell those assets and then distribute the proceeds to the creditors of the bankrupt ''[[pari passu]]''.  That distribution discharges the claims of the creditors against the bankrupt individual, and all other creditors who would have claimed in the bankruptcy.  The individual is thereafter discharged from bankruptcy.

==Liquidation==

Where a company is unable to pay or provide for its debts it may be placed in liquidation either voluntary by a resolution of members or compulsorily by an order of the court.  British Virgin Islands law uses the phrase "in liquidation" in preference to the term "winding-up" used in other jurisdictions.

A company is treated as insolvent, and liable to have a liquidator appointed if:&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 8(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
# it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due;
# the value of its liabilities exceeds the value of its assets;
# it fails to discharge a statutory demand for the prescribed minimum; or
# it fails to pay a judgment debt of the British Virgin Islands court.

Liquidation is a class right, and so the court will not make an order if it is opposed by a majority of creditors.

Once a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is appointed, his duty to is collect in all of the assets of the company, liquidate them and pay or provide for the claims of the company's creditors ''pari passu''.  Once a liquidator is appointed, creditors may not commence or continue legal proceedings against the company.

At the conclusion of the liquidation the company is dissolved.

Where the assets of the company are in jeopardy, or where the company has engaged in misconduct, it is possible to seek the appointment of a [[provisional liquidator]].&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 170(4).  The grounds which need to be satisfied were set out in ''Akai Holdings Limited v Brinlow Investments Limited'' (BVIHCV 2006/0134) at [44] onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set-off and subordination==

For both individual and creditors, where any creditor also owes money a company or an individual who goes into liquidation or bankruptcy, then upon the making of the order the sums due between the parties are [[Set-off (law)|set-off]] so that only a net sum due is owed either to the creditor or the insolvent party.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the benefit of that provision can be waived by the creditor so long as any waiver does not operate to the prejudice of other creditors.  Where a person has actual notice of the insolvency of another party at the time they extended credit, they cannot set-off any obligations owed if that other party subsequently goes into bankruptcy.

Creditors of a person are entitled to enter into [[Subordination (finance)|subordination agreement]] to reorder the priority of claims against an insolvent party upon the bankruptcy of that party.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Insolvency Act has incorporated [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] Model Netting legislation (pre-2007 form) and so any [[Netting|netting agreement]] relating to financial contracts will prevail over the statutory insolvency set-off provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, Part XVII&lt;/ref&gt;  Financial contracts for these purposes are defined in some detail in the Insolvency Rules.

==Secured creditors==

The Insolvency Act is "predicated heavily towards the protection of [[secured creditor]]s' rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels |title=British Virgin Islands Commercial Law |url= |edition=2nd |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |location= |isbn=9789626614792 |at=para 7.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secured creditors are not ordinarily subject to the usual stays and delays on creditors' rights when enforcing a valid [[security interest]].

Similarly, provisions such as creditors' arrangements and recognition of foreign insolvency representatives are circumscribed to the extent that they interfere with the rights of secured creditors.

==Restructuring==

Although the Insolvency Act does not focus on rehabilitation of financially distressed companies, the legislation does contain various provisions for corporate rescue.

Part II of the Insolvency Act provides for creditors' arrangements, whereby the creditors of an individual or a company may, by a 75% vote, approve an arrangement which may enable the company to continue trading.  This is subject to the rights of the secured and preferred creditors.

Part III of the Insolvency Act deals with [[Administration (law)|administration orders]], designed to enable a trading company to have breathing space to deal with its creditors.  If a company had granted a [[floating charge]] the court may not make an administration order without the consent of the holder.

A company may also enter into a [[scheme of arrangement]] whereby a compromise between the company and its creditors may be sanctioned by the court if approved by 75% in value and a majority in number of the company's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;BVI Business Companies Act 2004, section 179A&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voidable transactions==

For both personal&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, Part XIV&lt;/ref&gt; and corporate bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, Part VIII&lt;/ref&gt; the Insolvency Act provides that certain transactions entered into in the "twilight" period prior to bankruptcy may be challenged by a liquidator by application to the court.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ '''Voidable transactions'''
! width="150"|Type|| width="200"|Vulnerability period || width="100"|Insolvency requirement?|| width="500"|Description
|-
| [[Unfair preference]] || 2 years for connected persons, 6 months otherwise || align="center"|Yes || Any transaction has the effect of putting the creditor into a position which, in the event of the individual becoming a bankrupt, will be better than the position he would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into
|-
| [[Undervalue transaction]] || 2 years for connected persons, 6 months otherwise || align="center"|Yes || A transaction for the consideration received is worth significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by the bankrupt
|-
| [[Voidable floating charge]] / general assignment || 2 years for connected persons, 6 months otherwise || align="center"|Yes || Any floating charge (for companies) or general assignment (for individuals)
|-
| Extortionate credit transaction || 5 years || align="center"|No || Credit which require grossly exorbitant payments to be made, or otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair trading
|}

In each case (except for extortionate credit) the bankrupt must have either been insolvent at the time of entering into the transaction or the transaction must have caused them to become insolvent.

The relevant vulnerability period is the period prior to the commencement of liquidation (for companies) or the presentation of a petition for a bankruptcy order (in the case of individuals).&lt;ref&gt;Insolvency Act 2003, section 400(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  The vulnerability period is extended for transactions involving persons who are connected persons to the bankrupt.

The voidable transactions regime contains certain provisions designed to protect bona fide attempts to provide credit to financially distressed companies and individuals.  These provisions are presumed not to apply to transactions involving connected persons.

==Insolvency practitioners==

Insolvency practitioners are required to be licensed in the British Virgin Islands in order to act as a liquidator, administrator, administrative receiver or supervisor of a creditors' arrangement.  A foreign insolvency practitioner may act jointly with a licensed insolvency practitioner provided that (a) the [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]] has been notified in advance of the proposed appointment in writing and has not objected within the statutory time limit.

==Cross-border insolvency==

Most corporate insolvencies in the British Virgin Islands involve a cross border element.  The Insolvency Act contains two parts dealing with [[cross-border insolvency]].  Part XVIII is based upon the [[UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/insolven/1997-Model-Law-Insol-2013-Guide-Enactment-e.pdf|title=UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with Guide to Enactment and Interpretation|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=6 June 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The provisions do not sit easily within the remaining structure of the Insolvency Act as they are predicated on the centre of main interest (or "COMI") concept, which is otherwise unknown under British Virgin Islands law, and that Part has not yet been brought into force.  Part XIX deals with orders in aid of foreign insolvency proceedings.  Those provisions have been utilised by the British Virgin Islands courts on a number of occasions, including most notably recognising and assisting [[Irving Picard]] in the British Virgin Islands during the [[Madoff investment scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Picard v Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC'' (BVIHCV 0140/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Credit Abuse Resistance Education''' (CARE) is a national program founded by the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|WDNY]] and the Bankruptcy Committee of the Monroe County Bar Association.  It was founded in 2002&lt;ref name="uscourts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Abuse Resistance Education|url=http://www.nyeb.uscourts.gov/credit-abuse-resistance-education|website=United States Bankruptcy Court: Eastern District of New York|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Chief Judge John C. Ninfo, II (retired).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

CARE is a free financial literacy initiative that makes experienced members of the Bankruptcy Community available to teach the importance of financial education. These presentations are available to educational establishments. CARE's primary target is high school seniors and college freshmen who are most at risk because they are aggressively marketed by the credit card industry at a time when they carry a very low Financial I.Q.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

CARE has a presence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

The '''Directorate-General for Competition''' ('''DG COMP''') is a [[Directorate-General]] of the [[European Commission]], located in [[Brussels]]. The DG Competition is responsible for establishing and implementing competition policy for the [[European Union]]. The DG Competition has a dual role in antitrust enforcement: an investigative role and a decision-making role.

DG Competition is also considered to be one of the most sophisticated antitrust enforcers in the world, alongside US agencies Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=Patrick|title=Background: What is the EC’s Competition Directorate?|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/consumer/background-what-is-the-ec-s-competition-directorate-1.3143166|website=Irish Times|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its fines to corporations climbed from €3.4bn between 2000 and 2004, to €9.4bn between 2005 and 2009. Between 2010 and 2012, it totalled €5.4bn.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/3953051-brussels-informers-12 The fight against the cartels: The Brussels informers (1/2)]'', Les Echos, 9 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DG Competition policy areas include the following: 
* antitrust (agreements and conduct prohibited under Articles 101 and 102 of the [[TFEU]]),
* mergers (Commission Regulation (EC) No 802/2004 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (The "Implementing Regulation") and its annexes (Form CO, Short Form CO and Form RS)),
* liberalisation (Article 106 of the [[TFEU]]),
* state aid - ensuring that government interventions do not distort competition within the EU by selectively benefiting one company or a subset of companies over others (Articles 107 - 109 of the [[TFEU]]),
* international cooperation.

The DG Competition is led by commissioner [[Margrethe Vestager]], who is currently serving a five-year term ending in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''The Commissioners: Margrethe Vestager, Competition | url=http://www.ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager_en | website=European Commission | access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of England}}
The '''Exclusion Crisis''' ran from 1679 through 1681 in the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland]]. Three Exclusion bills sought to exclude the King's brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], from the thrones of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] because he was Roman Catholic.  None became law. Two new parties formed. The [[Tory|Tories]] were opposed to this exclusion while the "Country Party", who were soon to be called the [[Whigs (UK)|Whigs]], supported it.
==Background==
[[File:James Stuart, Duke of York.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Portrait of [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] as [[Lord High Admiral of England]].  In 1673, the Duke of York, who had converted to Catholicism, resigned as Lord High Admiral rather than take the anti-Catholic oath prescribed by the [[Test Act]].]]
[[Image:The Solemn Mock Procession of the Pope (1680).jpg|thumb|right|Engraving showing "A Solemn Mock Procession of the Pope" held in London on 17 November 1680.  The Whigs arranged to have effigies of the Pope, [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], [[friar]]s, and [[nun]]s paraded through the streets of London and then burned in a large bonfire.]]
In 1673, when he refused to take the oath prescribed by the new [[Test Act]], it became publicly known that the Duke of York was a Roman Catholic. His secretary, [[Edward Colman]], had been named by [[Titus Oates]] during the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) as a conspirator to [[subversion (political)|subvert]] the kingdom. Members of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] English establishment could see that in France [[Louis XIV of France|a Catholic king]] was ruling in an [[Political absolutism|absolutist]] way, and a movement gathered strength to avoid such a form of monarchy from developing in England, as many feared it would if James were to succeed his brother [[Charles II of England|Charles]], who had no [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] children. [[Henry Capel|Sir Henry Capel]] summarised the general feeling of the country when he said in a parliamentary debate in the [[House of Commons of England]] on 27 April 1679:

{{quote|From [[popery]] came the notion of a [[standing army]] and arbitrary power... Formerly the crown of Spain, and now France, supports this root of popery amongst us; but lay popery flat, and there's an end of arbitrary government and power. It is a mere chimera, or notion, without popery.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenyon, ''The Popish Plot'' (Phoenix Press, 2000), pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==Crises==
The occasion which brought these sentiments to a head was the [[impeachment]] of [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby]], as a scapegoat for a scandal by which Louis XIV bought the neutrality of Charles's government with an outright bribe. Charles dissolved the [[Cavalier Parliament]], but the [[Habeas Corpus Parliament|new Parliament]] which assembled on 6 March 1679 was even more hostile to the king and to his unfortunate minister, thus Danby was committed to the [[Tower of London]].
[[Image:1stEarlOfShaftesbury2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Earl of Shaftesbury, the leader of the Whigs who introduced the Exclusion Bill in the House of Commons on 15 May 1679.]]
On 15 May 1679, the supporters of [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], introduced the Exclusion bill in the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] with the intention of excluding James from the [[Succession to the British Throne|succession to the throne]]. A fringe group there began to support the claim to the throne of Charles's illegitimate – but Protestant – son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]]. As it seemed likely that the bill would pass in the House of Commons, Charles exercised his [[royal prerogative]] to dissolve Parliament again. Successive Parliaments attempted to pass such a bill, and were likewise dissolved.
==The End of the Crisis==
While it should be treated with caution, the Exclusion Crisis is often identified as the point at which discernible political parties first emerged in England. Those who supported petitions asking Charles to recall Parliament and complete the passage of the Exclusion Bill were known as 'Petitioners' and later became [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]. Those who opposed the Bill or so-called [[Abhorrers]] developed into the Tories.

The nature of politics in this period is illustrated by the fact that Shaftesbury, who opposed James due to his similarities to the absolutist Catholic French regime was supported financially by [[Louis XIV of France]] who saw benefit in deepening English internal divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corp|first1=Edward|title=A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689-1718|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521108373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popish Plot]] was used by the Whigs to mobilise support but moderates grew increasingly concerned by the hysteria it generated which caused the execution of 22 'conspirators' and accused [[Catherine_of_Braganza|the Queen]] of conspiring to poison her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tapsell|first1=Peter|title=The Personal Rule of Charles II, 1681-85: Politics and Religion in an Age of Absolutism|date=2007|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1843833050|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Shaftesbury's supporters like [[Theophilus_Hastings,_7th_Earl_of_Huntingdon|the Earl of Huntingdon]] now switched sides and after two failed attempts to pass the Bill, Charles succeeded in labelling the Whigs as subversives. Louis now switched financial support to Charles, allowing him to dissolve the [[Oxford_Parliament_(1681)|1681 Oxford Parliament]]. It was not called again during his reign, depriving the Whigs of their main source of political support, i.e., government patronage; the failed 1683 [[Rye House Plot]] then completed their isolation.

One long-lasting result of the crisis was the codification of the writ of [[Habeas Corpus]]: the one concrete achievement of the short-lived [[Habeas Corpus Parliament]] of 1679 before it was dissolved. In passing this act, the Whig leaders were concerned for their own persons, apprehensive (correctly) that the King would try to move against them through the courts. But the act far outlived the specific crisis, having long-term implications for the British legal system (and later, the American one).

==In fiction==

[[Robert Neill (writer)|Robert Neill]]'s 1972 historical novel ''The Golden Days'' depicts the Exclusion Crisis as experienced by two Members of Parliament representing a rural constituency. Sir Harry Burnaby is a staunch Royalist who had been knighted for having helped Charles II's Restoration; his neighbor and fellow MP is Richard Gibson, an ex-Colonel in Oliver Cromwell's [[New Model Army]], and an outspoken member of the [[Green Ribbon Club]] and of the emerging [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] party. Despite their sharp political differences, Burnaby and Gibson come to deeply respect each other, and they share the anxiety lest the unfolding crisis escalate beyond control and England be plunged again into all-out civil war. Eventually, Burnaby's son marries Gibson's daughter, with the full blessing of both fathers.

'''Export restrictions''',  or a '''restriction on exportation''', are limitations on the quantity of [[good (economics)|goods]] [[export]]ed to a specific country or countries by a Government.

An export restriction may be imposed:
* To prevent a shortage of goods in the domestic market because it is  more profitable to export
* To manage the effect on the domestic market of the importing country, which may otherwise impose [[Dumping (pricing policy)|antidumping duties]] on the imported goods
*As part of [[foreign policy]], for example as a component of [[trade sanction]]s
*To limit or restrict arms or dual-use items that may be used in proliferation, terrorism, or nuclear, chemical, or biological warfare.
*To limit or restrict trade to embargoed nations.

In the United States, the [[Export Administration Regulations]] are issued by the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]) for all items except munitions.  The [[Department of State]] has the responsibility of overseeing export of defense and military-related articles as per the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] or ITAR.

'''Extraterrestrial real estate''' refers to claims of land ownership on other [[planet]]s or [[natural satellite]]s or parts of [[outer space|space]] by certain organizations, individuals, and scam artists. Such claims are not recognized by any authority, and have no legal standing.&lt;ref name=whoowns&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
The topic of real estate on celestial objects has been present since the 1890s. Dean Lindsay made claims for all extraterrestrial objects on June 15, 1936.  The public sent offers to buy objects from him as well.&lt;ref name=whoowns/&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{International ownership conventions}}

The [[United Nations]] sponsored 1967 "[[Outer Space Treaty]]" established all of outer space as an international commons by describing it as the "province of all mankind" and forbidding all the [[nation state|nations]] from claiming territorial sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = United Nations Treaties And Principles On Outer Space

| accessdate = 2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article VI vests the responsibility for activities in space to States Parties, regardless of whether they are carried out by governments or non-governmental entities. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 had been ratified by 102 countries by 2013,&lt;ref name="treatystatus"&gt;{{cite web

A subsequent treaty document, the international [[Moon Treaty]]—finalised in 1979 (just five countries had ratified it by 1984, but five countries was sufficient for it to be considered officially "in force")—went further and forbade private ownership of extraterrestrial real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several individuals and private organizations claimed ownership of the moon and other extraterrestrial bodies, but no such claims have yet been recognized. A white paper by the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggested legislation whereby the US would recognize claims made by private entities, American and others, which meet certain conditions regarding habitation and transportation. &lt;ref name=tsr20120409&gt;

==Private purchase schemes==
A number of individuals and organisations offer schemes or plans claiming to allow people to purchase portions of the [[Moon]] or other celestial bodies. Though the details of some of the schemes' legal arguments vary, one goes so far as to state that although the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered force in 1967, forbids countries from claiming celestial bodies, there is no such provision forbidding private individuals from doing so. However, Article VI of this treaty states "The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty." Thus, while it does not explicitly prohibit such schemes, the treaty does require they be authorized by the schemers' government.

The [[short story]] ''[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], which was written in 1949, offers a portrayal regarding such plans or schemes, and created the concept of a Lunar Republic. Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' also makes reference to a space law case called the ''Larkin Decision''.

===Geostationary orbits{{anchor|Bogota Declaration}}===
A space ownership issue of current practical importance is the allocation of slots for satellites in [[geostationary orbit]]. This is managed by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. The 1976 Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries, also known as the '''Bogotá Declaration''', signed by several countries located on the Earth's [[equator]], attempted to assert sovereignty over those portions of the geostationary orbit that continuously lie over the signatory nation's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]]
| accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims did not receive wider international support or recognition and were subsequently largely abandoned.

==Notable claims==
Chilean lawyer [[Jenaro Gajardo Vera]] became famous for his 1953 claim of ownership of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name=whoowns/&gt;

Martin Juergens from Germany claims that the Moon has belonged to his family since July 15, 1756, when the Prussian king Frederick the Great presented it to his ancestor Aul Juergens as a symbolic gesture of gratitude for services rendered, and decreed that it should pass to the youngest born son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 9 December 1948 as '''General Assembly Resolution 260'''. The Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-1&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#Participants Status of the Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924170456/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=UNTSONLINE&amp;tabid=2&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-1&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=24 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines [[genocide]] in legal terms, and is the culmination of years of campaigning by lawyer [[Raphael Lemkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Auron, Yair, ''The Banality of Denial'', (Transaction Publishers, 2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All participating countries are advised to prevent and punish actions of genocide in war and in peacetime. As of December 2017, 149 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty, most recently Benin on 2 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-1&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One state, the Dominican Republic, has signed but not ratified the treaty.

==Definition of genocide==
Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as

{{quote|... any of the following acts committed with [[Genocide#.22Intent to destroy.22|intent to destroy]], [[Genocide#.22In part.22|in whole or in part]], a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
:(a) Killing members of the group;
:(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
:(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
:(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
:(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article 2&lt;ref name="Convention-text"&gt;[http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html Text of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide], website of the [[UNHCHR]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article 3 defines the crimes that can be punished under the convention:

{{quote|
:    (a) Genocide;
:    (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;
:    (c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;
:    (d) Attempt to commit genocide;
:    (e) Complicity in genocide.|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article 3&lt;ref name="Convention-text"/&gt;}}

The convention was passed to outlaw actions similar to [[the Holocaust]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Gellately &amp; Ben Kiernan |title=The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-52750-3 | pages= 267 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay76mYBLU3sC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=where+Stalin+was+presumably+anxious+to+avoid+his+purges+being+subjected+to+genocidal+scrutiny&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with some other nations would not accept that actions against groups identified as holding similar political opinions or social status would constitute genocide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Staub, Ervin |title=The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages= 8|isbn=0-521-42214-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=29u-vt_KgGEC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=genocide+political+economic+groups+soviet+union#PPA8,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so these stipulations were subsequently removed in a political and diplomatic compromise.

== Breaches ==

=== Iraq ===
In 1988, following the campaign of chemical weapons attacks and mass killings of Kurdish persons in northern Iraq, legislation was proposed to the United States House of Representatives, in the, "Prevention of Genocide Act". The bill was defeated to allegations of "inappropriate terms" such as "genocide".  Contemporary scholars and international organizations widely consider the Anfal Campaign to have been genocide following the Iran-Iraq war, killing tens of thousands of Kurds. Saddam Hussein was charged individual with genocide though executed prior to a return for the charge. Associates of Hussein such as "Chemical Ali", and others have been widely accused of genocide and the events widely cited as one of the atrocities most commonly associated with the Hussein regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dave Johns |title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Iraq - Saddam's Road to Hell - A journey into the killing fields . PBS |url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq501/events_anfal.html |website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rwanda ===
The first time that the 1948 law was enforced occurred on 2 September 1998 when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] found [[Jean-Paul Akayesu]], the former mayor of a small town in Rwanda, guilty of nine counts of genocide. The lead prosecutor in this case was [[Pierre-Richard Prosper]]. Two days later, [[Jean Kambanda]] became the first head of government to be convicted of genocide.

=== The Former Yugoslavia ===
The first state and parties to be found in breach of the Genocide convention was Serbia and Montenegro, and numerous Bosnian Serb leaders. In the ''[[Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro]]'' case the International Court of Justice presented its judgment on 26 February 2007. It cleared Serbia of direct involvement in [[genocide]] during the Bosnian war.
International Tribunal findings, have addressed two allegations of genocidal events, including the 1992 Ethnic Cleansing Campaign in municipalities throughout Bosnia, as well as the convictions found in regards to the Srebrenica Massacre of 1995 in which the tribunal found, "Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide, they targeted for extinction, the 40,000 Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica ... the trial chamber refers to the crimes by their appropriate name, genocide ...". Individual convictions applicable to the 1992 Ethnic Cleansings have not been secured however. A number domestic courts and legislatures have found these events to have met the criteria of genocide, and the ICTY found the acts of, and intent to destroy to have been satisfied, the "Dolus Specialis" still in question and before the MICT, UN war crimes court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chambers, The Hague |title=ICTY convicts Ratko Mladić for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia |url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/icty-convicts-ratko-mladi%C4%87-for-genocide-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity |website=www.icty.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSL26638724._CH_.2400

== Situations under investigation ==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] is the organization entitled to mandate the [[International Criminal Court]] with [[International Criminal Court investigations|investigations]] relating to breaches of the [[genocide convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/cases.aspx?k=genocide|title=Listing of genocide cases pending at the ICC|last=|first=|date=|website=International Criminal Court (ICC)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present (2018) the procedure relating to [[International Criminal Court investigations#Darfur, Sudan|Darfur, Sudan]], opened in 2005, is the only genocide related pending one. Warrants to arrest [[Omar Hassan Ahmad al- Bashir|Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir]], president of the [[Sudan|Republic of Sudan]], were issued in 2009 and 2010. The case remains in the Pre-Trial stage as the suspect is still at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/darfur/albashir|title=Al Bashir Case, The Prosecutor v.

== Other accusations ==

===United States===
One of the first accusations of genocide submitted to the UN after the Convention entered into force concerned treatment of [[African Americans|Black Americans]]. The [[Civil Rights Congress]] drafted a 237-page petition arguing that even after 1945, the United States had been responsible for hundreds of wrongful deaths, both legal and extra-legal, as well as numerous other genocidal abuses. Leaders from the Black community, including [[William L. Patterson|William Patterson]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[W. E. B. DuBois]] presented this petition to the UN in December 1951.&lt;ref name=Docker&gt;John Docker, "[http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Humanities+Research+Vol+XVI.+No.+2.+2010/5271/docker.xhtml Raphaël Lemkin, creator of the concept of genocide: a world history perspective]", ''Humanities Research'' 16(2), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this accusation was a domestic political act by the Civil Rights Congress, without any reservations that a formal charge would be levied against the U.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3849">The '''Germany–Korea Treaty of 1883''' was negotiated between representatives of Germany and Korea.

==Background==
In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached [[Ganghwado]] and threatened to fire on the Korean capital city. Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil. (2005). {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|''The History of Korea,'' pp. 107-108.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations,&lt;ref&gt;Yŏng-ho Ch'oe ''et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|A9LoA9L1ABcC|''Sources of Korean Tradition,'' p. 235|page=235}}; excerpt, "''Korea signed a similar accord with the United States (the ''Treaty of Chelump'o'', 1882) that was followed by similar agreements with other Western nations'';" Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921-1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament,'' p. 29.|page=29}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Korea. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation dated May 22, 1882."&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.

==Treaty provisions==
The Germans and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.&lt;ref name="mission32"&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 32.|page=32}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between Germany and Korea. Treaty of Amity and Commerce dated November 23, 1883"; Kim, {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|p. 107.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers from Germany to Korea were appointed in accordance with this treaty; and these diplomats were: Capt. Zembisch, appointed November 18, 1884; T. Kempermann, appointed May 17, 1886; H. Weipert, appointed September 29, 1900.&lt;ref name="mission32"/&gt;

The treaty remained in effect even after [[Korea under Japanese rule|the protectorate was established]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 36.|page=36}}; excerpt, "''Official rescript issued by Japan, November 22, 1905, declares: 'In bringing this agreement to the notice of the powers having treaties with Korea, the Imperial Government declares that * * * they will see that these treaties are maintained and respected, and they also engage not to prejudice In any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of those powers in Korea'.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22855">The '''Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' was established in 2004 based on the events of November 3, 1979. On that date, the [[Communist Workers' Party (United States)|Communist Workers Party]] (CWP) led by Robert Johnson gathered at the Morningside Homes in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], to protest for social and economic justice along with protesting against the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK). The chant that united the 40–50 protesters was “death to the Klan”. Shortly after 11&amp;nbsp;am, a nine-vehicle convoy that contained 37 members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party arrived. After a short skirmish, the KKK and American Nazis retrieved their firearms and 88 seconds later, five protesters lay dead and ten others were wounded. During the marking of the 20th anniversary of the events that became known as the “[[Greensboro massacre]]”, the idea was raised to bring closure and to bring to light the truth to the events of November 3, 1979. Within five years, The Greensboro [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was formed by mainly private and local donations. The seven commissioners in 2006 released their report, which condemned not only the KKK and the American Nazi Party, but also the Greensboro Police Department and the city itself for being responsible for the events of November 3, 1979, and the subsequent cover-up.

== Events of November 3, 1979 ==
On November 3, 1979, a group numbering between 40 to 50 demonstrators arrived at the Morningside Housing projects in Greensboro, North Carolina at 11 a.m. for a peaceful march, aimed at advancing social, economic and racial justice and to protest against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The march, organized by Nelson Johnson of the Communist Workers Party and set to begin at twelve noon, was confronted by a convoy of nine vehicles, containing 37 members of the KKK and the [[American Nazi Party]]. These members proceeded to leave their vehicles, confronted the protesters with long pieces of lumber, igniting a violent fight. After a short skirmish, members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party retreated to their vehicles and retrieved their firearms, including shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and pistols. A number of individuals began to fire their weapons, lasting a span of eighty-eight seconds, at the protesters. Five protesters, Cesar Cauce, Dr. James Waller, Sandra Smith, Bill Simpson and Dr. Michael Nathan, were killed, and ten others wounded. Nelson Johnson was, for his part, tackled by law enforcement, detained, and ultimately arrested for starting a riot. Johnson later stated, “I knew that in the depths of my soul that we had been set up.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy, Dialogue and Community Action: Truth and Reconciliation in Greensboro|last=Jovanovic|first=Spoma|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Fayetteville|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A curfew was immediately implemented at the Morningside neighborhood, followed by the deployment of the North Carolina National Guard, and public service announcements to deter anyone from participating in any further marches.
        
At a neighboring area adjacent to the Morningside Housing Project, Claudette Burroughs-White was home when a child ran up to her and informed her of the events he witnessed. “I thought he was losing his mind. When I found out that it was the truth, I was just so angry. It was scary that in broad daylight the Klan was shooting. You start gathering up your children and say come in this house until we find out what’s going on. [The fact that] you can look on television and see people just shooting people, and at the end of all of that, nobody gets a day in prison time. It is still unbelievable. It is just unbelievable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
        
These events, termed the “Greensboro Massacre,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions|last=B. Hayner|first=Priscilla|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; were captured live by the press and profiled on national news outlets including the CBS Evening News, anchored by Walter Cronkite.  The “Greensboro Massacre” would ironically be quickly overshadowed the following day with the onset of the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iran Hostage Crisis]].
       
Funeral services for the protesters were attended by upwards of 800 people, with 1,000 law enforcement officials specifically assigned to maintain social order in Greensboro.

== The commission ==
The impetus for the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission emerged in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary of the events of November 3, 1979. The driving force behind the creation of the commission was to objectively review precisely what transpired that day. For years, rumours circulated suggesting that the Greensboro Police Department was directly involved, and that the city, in order to protect its police department and itself, immediately undertook steps following the massacre to initiate a cover up. A commission, its supporters argued, could bring closure to the families of the deceased, as well as the remaining survivors.
         
Between November 3, 1979, and November 3, 1999, three significant criminal and civil cases directly pertaining to the “Greensboro Massacre” unfolded. In the case of the first two trials – the second of which was a federal court case – [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] acquitted the accused parties, despite eyewitness testimony and above all, video news footage of the KKK and the American Nazi Party shooting at the crowd of protesters. The third trial case, focusing on the death of one of the “Greensboro Massacre” victims, resulted in the conviction of two Greensboro Police officers, four Klansmen, and two members of the American Nazi Party. The city of Greensboro was ordered to pay $351,500 in [[restitution]]. This judicial finding and associated financial penalty suggested that the city of Greensboro and its police department were more prominently involved and directly aware of the events of November 3, 1979, than previously suggested. These reasons directly contributed to the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
         
The Greensboro Truth and Community Reconciliation Project, or simply “the Project”, founded in November 1999, called for an independent [[truth and reconciliation commission]] to be created to investigate the events of November 3, 1979. The principal and most immediate issue confronting the establishment of a potential commission was the ability to secure necessary funding to undertake the required work. Significant funding primary was ultimately donated by the Andrus Family Fund, with the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] providing supplementary financial support. The overriding objectives of the Andrus Family Fund and the Project itself were not punitive in nature; they were not seeking to legally or financially sanction the responsible parties (i.e., the KKK and the American Nazi Party), but instead sought to identify constructive avenues designed to facilitate [[Restorative justice|societal reconciliation]].  This reconciliation, it was held, could be most fully realized by utilizing an approach that objectively examined the truth surrounding the Greensboro Massacre. It was later decided in October 2002, to remove the term “Massacre” in respect to the victims and survivors.  On January 10, 2003, 32 prominent Greensboro community members with ties to both the city and county government, including then city councilor Claudette Burroughs-White, declared their support for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.
       
A process was identified for the selection of seven volunteer commissioners to serve on what would come to be known as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The mandate of the Commission was decidedly specific – no matter how painful it might prove to be, its core mission would be to reveal and disseminate the truth. From a total of 67 nominees put forward in February 2004, the selection committee was given 90 days to agree on 7 commissioners. This committee, in considering applicants, was empowered to consider an applicant’s character and relationship to Greensboro. Specific characteristics that the selection committee sought out included “demonstrating commitment to the values of truth, reconciliation, equity and justice; will commit to seek the truth; will commit to not allow outside forces to taint the work/report of the commissioners; interest in racial, socio-economic, religious and gender diversity; and knowledge of human rights and legal framework.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
         
On May 27, 2004, the seven commissioners (five women and two men) were publicly announced; the list included Muktha Jost, Bob Peters, Barbara Walker, Pat Clark, Cynthia Brown, Angela Lawrence, and Mark Sills. Three (Jost, Brown and Lawrence) were African American, and Lawrence, Sills (who also served on the selection committee) and Brown were native North Carolinians.

=== Research conducted ===
Initially, the commission encountered significant difficulty in collecting statements from the survivors, as many individuals were wary of the commission's mandate and its ability to effect durable social change. The commission was ultimately successful in securing the cooperation of survivors by conducting one-on-one interviews. This resulted in the collection of 145 oral statements. The commission also granted requests from a dozen individuals (who wished to remain anonymous), to include their statements in the final report. Included in the oral statements were testimonials of 17 demonstrators and 14 people from the-then Morningside Homes (which were demolished in 2002), along with 7 written accounts. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was also successful in obtaining statements from six current or former Greensboro police officers, five current or former members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and a judge. Three public hearings were held (two at local area universities, and one at a high school), each of which transpired over a two-day period (Friday and Saturday). For the commissioners' safety, each public hearing featured a significant police presence. 
    
Following the conclusion of the first hearing, Bongani Finca, a commissioner on the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] reminded commissioners that, “your credibility is on the line; you need to be pressing for answers. You can be respectful, but you need to ask tougher questions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Margarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
    
The ability of the commission, however, to secure additional statements was constrained by a range of factors:
# People were ultimately unwilling to provide statements for fear of retaliation;
# the commission was not given direct subpoena powers;
# a police attorney advised retired Greensboro police officers from providing statements; and,
# the newspaper editor of the Greensboro ''News and Record'' instructed his staff members not to provide statements. To avoid scrutiny, the newspaper agreed to let the commission have access to its archives. All five of the victims' widows also gave permission to the commission to grant immunity to any individual willing to offer a testimonial, so more information and statements could be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell  Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
       
Members of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in the course of their work, realized that there was not a consensus in Greensboro on which parties or specific actions were culpable, nor on who constituted a victim.

=== Findings ===
On May 25, 2006, the commission “held a ceremony in the chapel at [[Bennett College|Bennett College for Women]] to release its final report to the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell  Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Totaling in excess of 500 pages, the commission’s report found that Nelson Johnson did indeed plan the march, which was state-wide, for the stated purposes of promoting social, economic and racial justice. Johnson had also followed proper procedure by applying for a parade permit from the Greensboro Police Department, listing Morningside Homes as the starting point for the march. The police, however, gave their informant, Klan member Eddie Dawson, a copy of the permit which provided the exact route and time of the march. The report also revealed that the police were well aware of the history between, on the one hand, the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and the Communist Workers Party (CWP) on the other. There had been an earlier confrontation between the groups in China Grove, North Carolina, and it was clear that the KKK and the American Nazi Party were purposely looking for an opportunity to exact revenge. The police also knew that it was the intention of both the KKK and the American Nazi Party to confront the protesters, make an attempt to prevent the march from occurring, and above all, that members from each group would very likely be armed with firearms.  The police further knew that if the march was in fact disrupted, that Klan and American Nazi Party members would be acting in direct violation of the protesters' right of free speech and their right to assemble, both of which are protected in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment of the United States constitution]]. In advance of the march, Johnson was required by the Greensboro police to sign a form agreeing that he and his fellow protesters and he would not be armed. Though some did defy the agreement, North Carolina laws in 1979 did not make it illegal for the protesters to carry weapons. The commission found, “The idea of armed self-defense is acceptable and deeply embedded in our national identity and tradition [yet] there is a double standard by which armed black people are seen as an unacceptable threat.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
           
Johnson, the report of the commission makes clear, was never notified or warned in advance by Greensboro police of the Klan and American Nazi Party’s intentions regarding the march. The police went so far as to purposely station all of its officers in a perimeter some five to twenty-four blocks away from the Morningside Housing Projects. When Officer April Wise and her colleague were at the Morningside Homes to investigate an act of domestic violence, they were intentionally called back by their superiors. Police in the field were effectively ordered to stay at their posts. They did this even when a plainclothes officer reported the approaching caravan of KKK and American Nazi Party members. Greensboro police officers even stayed put after the shootings, deciding to only stop the last car in the caravan.
      
Immediately following the “Greensboro Massacre”, the commission’s report found that the city of Greensboro took immediate and significant steps to purposely deflect critical attention and deliberately conceal critical facts from the public. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Report underscores the “intentionality [of the Greensboro Police] to provide adequate protection and deliberately [mislead] the public in regarding what happened on November 3, 1979.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Remaking Transitional Justice in the United States: The Rhetorical Authorization of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission|last=Beitler III|first=James Edward|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further claimed that compelling “evidence of deliberate manipulation and concealment of the facts that we can only interpret as intended to sever the Greensboro Police Department from any responsibility”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy, Dialogue and Community Action: Truth and Reconciliation in Greensboro|last=Jovanovic|first=Spoma|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Fayetteville|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; existed.  Greensboro’s mayor and other city officials, the commission’s report advances, went so far as to intimidate news stations to not broadcast footage of the “Greensboro Massacre.”   "The events of November 3, 1979 and the days that followed produced “general distrust of police, the justice system, elected officials and the media.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission found that the police department had underestimated the threat posed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and overestimated their perceived threat of Johnson and the CWP.

=== Recommendations ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}The commission offered several recommendations.
* First, as a city, it was recommended that Greensboro undertake meaningful gestures to acknowledge the events of November 3, 1979. The commission, for example, recommended the issuance of public and private apologies to those harmed and affected by the events.
* Second, the Greensboro Police Department was strongly encouraged to issue a public apology, issue compensation, and erect public exhibitions about November 3, 1979.
* A third recommendation suggested the need to reform institutional practices of local government by paying all of its city workers a fair and decent wage, while training them along with county workers on [[Anti-racism|antiracism]].
* The fourth recommendation advanced by the commission called for increased funding for low-income residents, via the Department of Social Services and Public Health.
* Fifth, along with educating school children about what transpired on November 3, 1979, the commission recommended a citizens review board to examine the workings of the Greensboro Police Department.
* Next was a call to expand the lists and field of potential jurors, so that all future impaneled juries could fairly represent the community by avoiding the selection of all-white juries.
* Seventh, a list of current allegations of corruption by the Greensboro Police Department should be made public and fully investigated.
* The commission also encouraged the use of criminal and civil lawsuits, to encourage people’s faith in the justice system and to hold the Greensboro Police Department accountable.
* The ninth and arguably the most important recommendation of the commission was a call for active and vigilant citizen engagement. Examples provided included, attending education programs that focus on anti racism and diversity, so the community can be well versed on a range of subjects including privilege, oppression, and economic and social justice. The community was recommended to work together to find solutions to everyday problems, couple with a need for study and dialogue groups, aimed at examining the beliefs and ideologies held by the Greensboro community.

== Reactions ==
The work of the commission and its subsequent recommendations elicited both positive and negative responses. The commission’s report, according to Nelson Johnson, was a “gift” suggesting others in the community of Greensboro needed to read and benefit from it. An editorial on the commission's final report, authored by Allen Johnson of the [[News &amp; Record|Greensboro ''News &amp; Record'']], found that as an “overall body of work, the report is well researched and documented”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell  Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that, “despite its flaws and arguably even because of them, the report provides a valuable opportunity for reflection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
         
The mayor of Greensboro, Jim Melvin, on November 3, 1979, – within a day or two of the final report being made public - stated that, “I’ll stand on the reputation of the police department. We had a good police department on November 3[rd.]”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning from Greensboro: Truth and Reconciliation in the United States|last=Magarnell Wesley|first=Lisa Joya|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor Keith Holliday, who was Greensboro’s mayor when the report was publicly issued, decided to reject the commission’s recommendations calling for the Greensboro police department and the city itself to apologize for what happened on November 3, 1979. Holliday instead preferred to simply express regret for the events of that day. Two Democratic Party [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County]] Commissioners expressed their support for the commission’s specific recommendations in favor of a living wage and antiracist training – both of which were opposed by a Republican-controlled Guilford County commission.

'''Hans Paul Oster''' (9 August 1887 – 9 April 1945) was a general in the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] who was also a leading figure of the [[German resistance]] from 1938 to 1943. As deputy head of the counter-espionage bureau in the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence), Oster was in a strong position to conduct resistance operations under the guise of intelligence work; he was dismissed for helping Jews to avoid arrest.

He was a key planner of the [[Oster Conspiracy]] of September 1938.  Oster was arrested in 1943 on suspicion of helping Abwehr officers caught helping Jews escape Germany.  After the failed 1944 [[20 July Plot|July Plot]] on Hitler's life, the Gestapo seized the diaries of [[Admiral (Germany)#German navies until 1945|Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''Abwehr'', in which Oster's long term anti-Nazi activities were revealed. In April 1945, he was hanged with Canaris and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] at [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].

==Early career==
Oster was born in [[Dresden]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1887, the son of an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] pastor of the French Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz73909.html Biography of Hans Oster], deutsche-biographie.de; accessed 28 September 2015. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the artillery in 1907. In [[World War I]], he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] until 1916, when he was appointed as captain to the [[German General Staff]]. After the war, he was thought of well enough to be kept in the reduced ''[[Reichswehr]]'', whose officer corps was limited to 4,000 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. However, he had to resign from the army in 1932, when he got into trouble because of an indiscretion during the carnival in the demilitarised zone of the [[Rhineland]], where ''Reichswehr'' officers were prohibited.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

He soon found a job in a new organisation which [[Hermann Göring]] set up under the [[Prussia]]n police. He transferred to the ''Abwehr'' in October 1933. It was in this connection that he met future conspirators [[Hans Bernd Gisevius]] and [[Arthur Nebe]], who were then working in the ''[[Gestapo]]''. Oster also became a close confidant of Admiral Canaris.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', pp. 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to Hitler==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
Like many other army officers, Oster initially welcomed the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], but his opinion changed after the 1934 ''[[Night of the Long Knives]]'', in which the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) extrajudicially murdered many of the leaders of the rival ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and their political opponents, including General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], the second to last [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], and [[Generalmajor]] (Major General) [[Ferdinand von Bredow]], former head of the ''[[Abwehr]]''. In 1935, Oster was allowed to re-enlist in the army, but never on the [[German General Staff|General Staff]]. By 1938, the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]] and ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (the state-sanctioned pogrom against Jews in Germany), turned his antipathy into a hatred of Nazism and a willingness to help save Jews.&lt;ref&gt;AJR Journal, February 2014 http://www.ajr.org.uk/journalpdf/2014_February.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the Fritsch crisis, Oster met [[Generaloberst]] (Colonel General) [[Ludwig Beck]], Chief of the General Staff, for the first time, laying the connections for the [[Oster Conspiracy]] of September 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Oster's position in the ''Abwehr'' was invaluable to the conspiracy. The ''Abwehr'' could provide false papers and restricted materials, provide cover by disguising conspiratorial activities as intelligence work, link various resistance cells that were otherwise disparate, and supply intelligence to the conspirators. He also played a central role in the first military conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, which was rooted in Hitler's intention to invade [[Czechoslovakia]]. In August 1938, Beck spoke openly at a meeting of army generals in [[Berlin]] about his opposition to a war with the Western powers over Czechoslovakia. When Hitler was informed of this, he demanded and received Beck's resignation. Beck was highly respected in the army and his removal shocked the officer corps. His successor as Chief of Staff, [[Franz Halder]], remained in touch with him and also with Oster. Privately, he said that he considered Hitler "the incarnation of evil."&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler’s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933–1945'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
Comment out: unsourced from Sept 2015 ||| Oster, Gisevius and [[Hjalmar Schacht|Schacht]] urged Halder and Beck to stage an immediate coup against Hitler, but the army generals argued that they could mobilise support among the officer corps for such a step only if Hitler made overt moves towards war. Halder nevertheless asked Oster to draw up plans for a coup. It was eventually agreed that Halder would instigate the coup when Hitler committed an overt step towards war. Therefore, emissaries of the conspirators travelled to [[UK|Great Britain]] with assistance of Oster's ''Abwehr'' to urge the British to stand firm against Hitler over the [[Sudeten crisis|Sudeten]] [[crisis]]. On 28 September, however, [[Prime Minister of the UK|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] agreed to a [[Munich Agreement|meeting in Munich]], at which he accepted the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Hitler's diplomatic triumph undermined and demoralised the conspirators. Halder would no longer support a coup. This was the nearest approach to a successful conspiracy against Hitler before the [[20 July plot]] of 1944.{{cn|date=September 2015}}--&gt;
&lt;!--
As war again grew more likely in mid-1939, the efforts for a pre-emptive coup were revived. Oster was still in contact with Halder and Witzleben. But many officers, particularly those from Prussian [[Landowner|landowning]] backgrounds, were strongly anti-[[Poland|Polish]] and saw a war to regain [[Danzig]] and other lost eastern territories as justified. After the outbreak of [[World War II]], resistance in the army became more problematic since it could lead to the defeat of Germany. However, when Hitler decided to attack [[France]] soon after the Polish campaign in 1939, Halder along with other ranking generals thought it to be hopelessly unrealistic and again entertained the idea of a coup, urged by Oster and Canaris. However, when Hitler vowed to destroy the ''spirit of [[Zossen]]'' (Zossen was where headquarters of the Army High Command was located), by which he meant defeatism, Halder feared that their conspiracy was about to be discovered and destroyed all incriminating documents.

[[File:Flossenbürg April 9 1945 Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to members of resistance, including Oster, executed at Flossenbürg.]]--&gt;

Oster informed his friend [[Bert Sas]], the [[Netherlands]]' military attaché in Berlin, more than twenty times of the exact date of the repeatedly delayed [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]]. Sas passed the information to his government, but was not believed. Oster calculated that his "treason" could cost the lives of 40,000 German soldiers and wrestled with his decision, but concluded that it was necessary to prevent millions of deaths that would occur in what would be undoubtedly a protracted war should Germany achieve an early victory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hoffmann, ''The History of the German Resistance, 1933–1945'', p. 171.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Comment out: unsourced from Sept 2015 ||| The period between 1940 and 1942 was the nadir of German resistance. Some officers were pleased to be wrong to have feared military disaster. Others still opposed Hitler and the Nazi regime, but felt that his enormous popularity with the people made any action impossible. Tireless, Oster nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. In 1941, when the systematic extermination of [[European Jews]] began with the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], his ''Abwehr'' group established contact with [[Henning von Tresckow]]'s resistance group in [[Army Group Centre]]. In 1942, his most important recruit was General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], head of the General Army Office headquartered at the [[Bendlerblock]] in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units all over Germany. Oster's ''Abwehr'' group supplied British-made bombs to Tresckow's group for their various attempts to assassinate Hitler in 1943.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In 1943, the ''Abwehr'' group's efforts to rescue Jews were discovered by the ''[[Gestapo]]'' and Oster was dismissed from his post. [[Hans von Dohnanyi]], who joined the ''Abwehr'' shortly before the war, and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], the famous [[Lutheran]] theologian and Dohnanyi's brother-in-law, helped 14 Jews to flee to [[Switzerland]] disguised as ''Abwehr'' agents in Operation U-7. Dohnanyi and Bonhoeffer were arrested on charges of alleged breach of monetary exchange laws, amongst others with the leading German insurance brokers Jauch &amp; Hübener, Captain Walter Jauch of the [[Jauch family]], being a first cousin-in-law of Oster, and Otto Hübener later being hanged. Oster was placed under house arrest. Their involvement in the German resistance was discovered after the failure of the 20 July plot.{{cn|date=September 2015}}--&gt;

==Death==
Oster was arrested one day after the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. On 4 April 1945, the diaries of Admiral Canaris were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that all current and past conspirators—Oster among them—be executed.&lt;ref name="PlottingHitler'sDeath"&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|author=[[Joachim Fest]]|isbn=0-297-81774-4|title=[[Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933-1945]]|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
On 8 April 1945, Oster, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], Wilhelm Canaris, and other anti-Nazis were convicted and sentenced to death by an SS [[drumhead court-martial]] presided over by [[Otto Thorbeck]]. At dawn the next day, Oster, Bonhoeffer and Canaris were hanged in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]]. They were forced to strip naked before being taken to the [[gallows]]. The camp was liberated two weeks later by American forces. --&gt;

[[Fabian von Schlabrendorff]], one of the few major coordinators of anti-Nazi activities to survive the war, described Oster as "a man such as God meant men to be, lucid and serene in mind, imperturbable in danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William L.

==Background==
===Facts===

The appellant, Alexia Harriton, was a 25-year-old woman with severe congenital disabilities that had been caused by her mother's infection with the [[rubella virus]] while pregnant with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCA|15|2006}} See Crennan J at [210].&lt;/ref&gt; These disabilities left Harriton unable to care for herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCA|15|2006}} See Crennan J at [212].&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendant, Paul Richard Stephens, was the doctor of Harriton's mother while she was pregnant. After conducting and reviewing pathological tests, Dr Stephens advised the mother that she did not have the rubella virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCA|15|2006}} See Crennan J at [211].&lt;/ref&gt; Harriton's mother claimed that she would have had her pregnancy terminated had she known of the chances of having a disabled child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/court-says-life-is-not-a-sentence/2006/05/09/1146940549607.html|title=Court says life is not a sentence|last=Shiel|first=Fergus|date=10 May 2006|publisher=[[The Age]]|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation history===

Harriton sued Dr Stephens in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]], claiming that Dr Stephens failed to exercise reasonable care in his treatment of her mother, and but for that failure her mother would have terminated her pregnancy and Harriton would not have been born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCA|15|2006}} See Kirby J at [21] and [22].&lt;/ref&gt; The judge hearing the action, Justice Tim Studdert, dismissed the action as well as two other wrongful life cases brought at the same time.

Two of the three wrongful life cases dismissed by Justice Studdert (''Harriton'' and ''Waller v James''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|461|2002|litigants=Harriton v Stephens |courtname=[[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) were appealed to the [[New South Wales Court of Appeal]] (an appellate division of the Supreme Court).  The Court of Appeal, by a majority of 2&amp;ndash;1 dismissed both appeals.  According to Chief Justice [[James Spigelman]], the proposition that the duty of doctor to an unborn child extended to conduct that, properly performed, would lead to the termination of the pregnancy "should not be accepted as it does not reflect values generally, or even widely, held in the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walmsley|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|93|2004|litigants=Harriton v Stephens |parallelcite=(2004) 59 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 694 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Appeal]]}} per Spigelman CJ at [21].&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Court appeal==

On 29 April 2005, Harriton and Waller were granted special leave to appeal to the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCATrans|301|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their appeals were heard together on 10 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Case AU|HCATrans|918|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brett Walker]] acted as [[senior counsel]] for Harriton instructed by [[Maurice Blackburn (law firm)|Maurice Blackburn Cashman]]; [[Blake Dawson Waldron|Blake Dawson]] acted for Stephens with Stephen Gageler as senior counsel.

The High Court decided on 9 May 2006, by a 6–1 majority, to dismiss Harriton's appeal.&lt;ref name="Harriton v Stephens HCA"/&gt; Waller's appeal was dismissed on the same day with the majority in that judgment following the reasons in Harriton's appeal.&lt;ref name="Waller v James"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|16|2006|litigants=[[Waller v James]] |parallelcite=(2006) 226 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 136 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading judgment was written by Justice [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]], with whom Chief Justice [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] and Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]] and [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon]] concurred, giving her reasons majority support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis and McGivern|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justices [[Ian Callinan|Callinan]] and [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]] wrote separate judgments agreeing to dismiss the appeal, while Justice [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Kirby]] dissented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walmsley et al.|2007|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to judgment==
===Press reaction===

The High Court's judgment was reported in the media as a "landmark case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2006/1634889.htm|title=Wrongful life decision|date=10 May 2006|publisher=[[Radio National]]|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Ackland, a journalist and lawyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1003095.htm|title=Richard Ackland returns to ABC Radio National this summer|date=2 December 2003|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticised the judgment in the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], arguing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What the majority position fails to accommodate is that there is a new modern order. Medical technology can detect abnormalities at very early stages of the development of a foetus. Good medical practice regularly results in the non-existence of human beings. What has been created by way of Alexia [Harriton] and Keeden [Waller] is precisely what the doctors were engaged to prevent being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/justice-missing-in-wrongful-life-cases/2006/05/11/1146940674458.html|title=Justice missing in wrongful life cases|last=Ackland|first=Richard|date=12 May 2006|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Academic reaction===

Margaret Fordham, a legal academic, wrote after the judgment that for wrongful life claims to gain acceptance, "the courts would have to undergo a complete change of heart with respect to the moral and ethical implications of such actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fordham|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics Evelyn Ellis and Brenda McGivern referred to the judgment as an emphatic rejection of claims for wrongful life and compared the judgment to similar rejections of wrongful life claims by courts in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellis and McGivern|2007|p=135 (headnote)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the judgment was criticised in the ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'', which concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Logic might have demanded the outcome reached by the High Court in ''Harriton'', but fairness demands another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grey |first=Alice |title=Harriton v Stephens: Life, Logic and Legal Fictions||url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/2006/25.html}} (2006) 28(3) [[Sydney Law Review]] 545 {{issn|0082-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dean Stretton, a lawyer writing in the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'', claimed that the High Court's judgment "regressed", "depriving the plaintiffs of a legally justified remedy by resort to inconsistent logic and ill-considered policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stretton |first=Dean |title=Wrongful life and the logic of non-existence |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2006/31.html}} (2006) 30(3) [[Melbourne University Law Review]] 972 {{issn|0025-8938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Egypt}}
The '''[[Constitution of Egypt]]''' has passed over a long period of evolution from the liberal constitution of 1923 to the contemporary constitution.

==Ancient Egypt==
Egypt is known for having one of the earliest administrative and legislative codes in history. 
Pharaonic civilization laid the groundwork in Egypt in terms of governance and management. The king, or [[Pharaoh]], at the top of the state hierarchy, appointed high-ranking government officials.

==Early Islamic era==
During the Islamic era, governance and legislation were principally drawn from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah|Sunna]] (Traditions of the Prophet) based on the formula of consultation as one of the fundamental principles of Islamic law.

When Egypt became the capital of the Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate (969-1171) governance and legislation developed. Furthermore, the city of [[Cairo]] became the capital of Egypt.

Throughout the era of the Ayubi state (1171–1250), the Citadel became the headquarters and the center of power. Legislative and judicial councils diversified, and there was a justice council and another to attend to complaints lodged. Their duties involved laws as well as treaties with foreign countries

In the Mamluk era (1250–1517) Sultan El-Zaher Bebars built the Court of Justice at Salah El-Deen El-Ayoubi Citadel to be the government premises. Its competence covered enforcement of laws, settling of disputes, and negotiations with nearby countries.

==Ottoman Empire==
During the Ottoman era, (1517–1805) Islamic courts constituted the judicial system. Judges had their verdicts directly based on Islamic jurisprudence ([[Sharia]]) as far as civil and criminal disputes were concerned. This continued in effect until the end of the 18th Century. Thus, Egypt had been the scene of crucial political and social developments.

In 1795, almost six years after the French revolution, a major political uprising demanding rights, freedoms and justice fueled. It brought together national forces and popular leaderships in support of national demands for justice, equality, and freedom.

As a result of the mounting resistance against the Ottoman ruler, the Wali, and [[Mamluks]], Egypt was on the verge of a massive revolt. This led to the Ulama laying their hands on a written document which outlined the relationship between the ruler and subject which averted a raise in taxes without the consent of the people's representatives.

==20th century==
{{Wikisourcelang|ar| 1923|1923 Constitution of Egypt}}
The first 20th century constitution for Egypt is [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|that of 1923]].

[[File:Egypt constitution of 1953-arabic.pdf|thumb|10th of February 1953 second constitutional declaration]]
In December 1952 there was the first constitutional declaration then in 10th of February 1953 there was a second constitutional declaration.

In 1956, a new Constitution was proclaimed stipulating the formation of the National Assembly on 22 July 1957. It was made up of 350 elected members and remained effective until 10 February 1958, when the Egyptian-Syrian merger was given force and the 1956 Constitution revoked. The Provisional Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt was formulated in March 1958, and a joint National Assembly was established. It first met on 21 July 1960 and lasted to 22 June 1961.

On 27 September 1962, after the secession of the Syrian Arab Republic from the United Arab Republic, a Constitutional Proclamation was made, which stipulated that the Provisional Constitution of 1958 should remain in force insofar as it did not contradict the Proclamation. In March 1964, a further provisional Constitution was declared, leading to a 350-elected member National Assembly. This Assembly lasted from 26 March 1964 to 12 November 1968. New elections were held on 20 January 1969, and the Assembly was valid until 30 August 1971.

In 1971, when President [[Anwar Sadat]] took office, he moved towards the adoption of a new democratic constitution that would allow more freedoms; the return to a more sound parliamentary life, correct democratic practice{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and made Sharia "a source of legislation" (article II), amended in 1980 to read "the principal source of legislation."

In 2005, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] asked the parliament to amend Article 76 of the constitution that defines how the [[President of Egypt]] is elected.

===2011 Egyptian revolution===

A '''holdout''' is a piece of property that did not become part of a larger [[real estate development]] because the owner either refused to sell or wanted more than the developer would pay.  There are many examples of hold-outs in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Japan, and other countries.&lt;ref name="cra"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Craze |first1=Kirsten |title=The real estate deals where money could not buy happiness |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/the-real-estate-deals-where-money-could-not-buy-happiness/news-story/4dff5213b1ba217143f3d17915dd9fc5?sv=2a07a86de699c37d1cdb7dee9da45042 |accessdate=11 August 2016 |work=Home | date = 9 November 2015 |agency=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wickham's Department Store Mile End Road.jpg|thumb|Wickhams Department Store, Mile End Road, built around the Spiegelhalter jewellers shop]]

[[Macy's]] department store in [[New York City]], for example, does not cover the whole block because of a holdout named the [[Million Dollar Corner]] on the corner of Broadway and W 34th Street. Now decorated as a Macy's shopping bag, the building is a holdout from the construction of [[Macy's Herald Square]], and received its name from the fact that it sold for a million dollars in 1911, an unprecedented sum at the time.

Similarly, [[30 Rockefeller Center]], also in New York, has slight setbacks at its corners of 49th and 50th streets on 6th Avenue due to two buildings at those corners. The owner of 1258 6th Avenue, John F. Maxwell, grandson of the original owner, outright refused to sell to John D. Rockefeller during his land grab for construction of the complex, whereas, while Rockefeller was successful in purchasing the townhouse at 1240 6th Avenue, the lessees, who had signed a long-term lease, refused to vacate unless they were bought out to their asking sum of $250 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.25|1931|r=1}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}).&lt;ref name="mil"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Tom | date = 28 November 2012 |title=Rockefeller Center's David vs. Goliath -- No. 1240 6th Avenue |url=http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.co.za/2012/11/rockfeller-centers-david-vs-goliath-no.html |website=Daytonian in Manhattan|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Whitechapel]], in the [[East End of London]], the construction of the department store [[Wickhams (department store)|Wickhams]], completed in 1927, on the north side of the [[Mile End Road]] was obstructed by the Spiegelhalter brothers who owned and ran a jewellers at no. 81.

==Property law==
[[File:Edith Macefield's house.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Edith Macefield]]'s Seattle home]]

In the United States, private property is protected by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment to the Constitution]] from seizure by the government without "just compensation". Under the concept of [[eminent domain]], local and national government agencies are entitled to take private property for purposes in the public interest, but must offer owners compensation amounting to the value of the property. The United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland have a comparable process called [[compulsory purchase]], and there are equivalent laws in Australia and South Africa. In ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that the government is entitled to take land from private parties for any reason, including to give to private developers. The decision was widely unpopular, and spurred various states to enact laws prohibiting the practice, restricting eminent domain seizures to public works projects. However, the practice is common in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Institute of Justice|url=http://www.ij.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1828&amp;Itemid=245|date= June 2003|accessdate=2 June 2011|title=Public Power, Private Gain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts generally begin with an offer by the private group or government agency to purchase the land, and only become a question of eminent domain if the parties cannot negotiate a purchase price.

When eminent domain seizures do occur there are often disputes over the value of the property, and whether it should fully compensate the landowner for the holdout value of the land. A historical example of a San Francisco nail house resulted in railroad investor [[Charles Crocker]] building a [[spite fence]] around a house owned by undertaker Nicolas Yung in the late 1870s, after Yung refused to sell his small property to Crocker, who was consolidating lots on which to build a mansion. Other contemporary examples include [[Edith Macefield]], who refused to sell her Seattle house to a developer, and [[Figo House|Randal Acker]] who challenged the power of eminent domain in Portland, Oregon.

The People's Republic of China passed its first modern private property law in March 2007 amid the [[Chinese property bubble (2005–11)|property development bubble]].&lt;ref name="asia times"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=12 November 2007|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/IC14Cb02.html|date=14 May 2007|title=China's rough ideological transition|author=Wu Zhong|publisher=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt;

A '''nail house''' is a Chinese [[neologism]] for homes belonging to people (sometimes called "stubborn nails") who refuse to make room for real estate development. The term, a [[pun]] coined by developers, refers to nails that are stuck in wood, and cannot be pounded down with a hammer.&lt;ref name="at"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=The Independent |location=London  |title=A Chinese man's home is his castle: kung fu master keeps bailiffs at bay in the siege of Chongqing|author=Clifford Coonan|date=31 March 2007|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2407977.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical background===
In the People's Republic of China, during most of the Communist era, private ownership of [[real property]] was abolished. The [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|central government]] officially owned all real estate, and could in theory dictate who was entitled to control any piece of property according to national interests. Private citizens, therefore, did not have a legal right to keep their property if the government decided they should leave (although in practice, entitlements arose for various reasons). With a strengthening economy and the rise of [[free market]]s beginning in the late 1990s, private developers began building shopping malls, hotels, and other private developments in densely populated urban centers, which required displacing residents who lived on the land. Developers would typically offer relatively low compensation to the residents, reflecting the pre-development value of their properties or the cost of obtaining alternative housing elsewhere. Should residents resist, or try to take advantage of their [[Bargaining power|bargaining position]], powerful developers could persuade local officials and courts to order residents off the land. In other cases, residents would be arrested on false charges or thugs would be hired to scare away the residents.&lt;ref name="at"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=13 November 2007|title=In China, Fight Over Development Creates a Star|date=26 March 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/world/asia/26cnd-china.html?ex=1332561600&amp;en=a821e4ef4e73851a&amp;ei=5090 | first=Howard W. | last=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently,{{when|date=June 2015}} the People's Republic of China has begun to accept private ownership of real estate, {{citation-needed|date=May 2015}} including the still-controversial notion that owners are free to earn money when their land becomes more valuable due to planned developments, or even simply not to sell. Discontent arose among the people over accusations of illegal land seizures by developers and corruption by complicit government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6483997.stm|date=23 March 2007|title=Woman defies Chinese developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, the People's Republic of China passed its first modern private property law.&lt;ref name="asia times"/&gt; The law prohibits government taking of land, except when it is in the public interest. The law strengthened the position of nail house owners, but did not entirely resolve whether making room for private commercial developments was a public interest that entitled the taking of land.&lt;ref name="china property test case"&gt;{{cite news|title=First Test Case for Newly Approved Property Law?|publisher=China.org|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/204173.htm|author=Zhang Rui|date= 23 March 2007|accessdate=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
[[File:Nail house near Shenzhenbei Railway Station (20160812144108).jpg|thumb|A holdout near [[Shenzhen North Railway Station]] in 2016]]
A number of high-profile nail houses have received widespread attention in the Chinese press. In one case in 2007, one family among 280 others at the location of a six-story shopping mall under construction at the location of a former "snack street" in [[Chongqing]] refused for two years to vacate a home their family had inhabited for three generations.&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt;  Developers cut their power and water, and excavated a 10-meter deep pit around their home.&lt;ref name="at"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=12 November 2007|publisher=Asia Times|date=31 March 2007|title=The coolest nail house in history|author=Kent Ewing|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/IC31Cb01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="danwei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danwei.org/bbs/property_rights_the_coolest_na.php|accessdate=12 November 2007|publisher=Danwei|title=Property rights: the coolest nail house in history|author=Jeremy Goldkorn|date=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners broke into the construction site, reoccupied it, and flew a Chinese flag on top. Yang Wu, a local martial arts champion, used [[nunchaku]]s to make a staircase to their house, and threatened to beat any authorities who attempted to evict him.&lt;ref name="at"/&gt; His wife, a [[restaurateur]] named [[Wu Ping]] who had planned to open a restaurant in the home's ground floor, granted interviews and frequent press releases to generate publicity.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; The owners turned down an offer of 3.5 million yuan (US $453,000), but eventually settled with the developers in 2007.&lt;ref name="demo"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=China Daily|title=Nail house in Chongqing demolished|date=3 April 2007|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/03/content_842221.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, a nail house remained in [[Changsha]], even after a shopping mall was built around it, and now sits in a courtyard of the mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=13 November 2007 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/dayinpictures?o=3&amp;f=/g/a/2007/11/13/dip.DTL |title=Day In Pictures |date=13 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525091230/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/dayinpictures?o=3&amp;f=/g/a/2007/11/13/dip.DTL |archivedate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One owner in [[Shenzhen]] was paid between 10 and 20 million yuan (US $1.3 million to $2.7 million) for selling a seven-story building at the site of the future 439-meter (1,440 foot) [[Kingkey Finance Tower]], that had cost him 1 million yuan ($130,000) to build ten years before. The resident held out for months following an eviction order, and was subject to harassment and extortion attempts even after he reached a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nail house owner receives millions of yuan in compensation|date=30 September 2007|accessdate=13 November 2007|work=China Daily|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-09/30/content_6149005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other nail house owners held out against the Kingkey development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=13 November 2007|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/IK02Cb01.html|publisher=Asia Times|date=2 November 2007|title=Chinese homeowners nail down their rights|author=Catherine Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another nail house became notable after it ended up in the middle of a new road in [[Wenling]], [[Zhejiang]] Province. The elderly couple had refused to sell the property for the price offered by the government since 2001.&lt;ref name="scmp"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1089100/nail-house-couple-refuse-move|title='Nail House' Couple Refuses to Move|date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually a major two-lane road to a new train station was constructed around the house. Pictures of the home went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] on the Internet and were widely published by Chinese media.&lt;ref name="scmp"/&gt; The property was demolished in December 2012 after the owners accepted a compensation offer worth $41,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20566295|title=China home marooned in middle of road is bulldozed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Houston, Texas was an example of a commercial building that was a nail house.  When a new skyscraper office complex (Bank of America Center) was built in 1983 at the block bordered by Louisiana Street, Capitol Street, Rusk Street and Smith Street, the corner of Louisana and Rusk Streets held a major communications hub for the Western Union Company.  It was not possible for them to move this hub in an economical fashion, so they became a special kind of holdout.  The builder (Gerald D. Hines) negotiated with them, and actually built the new office tower over the top of the existing Western Union building, and completely wrapped the old building with a new facade that matched the new building.   In 2018 , the Western Union facility was abandoned, demolished and the office tower took over that space also.  &lt;ref&gt;http://swamplot.com/a-curtain-call-for-the-hidden-western-union-building-before-bank-of-america-center-digests-it/2018-08-15/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Bank-of-America-Center-to-bring-hidden-building-12456235.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.houstoniamag.com/articles/2014/11/11/houston-skyline-november-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
Nail houses have received an unusual degree of coverage in the Chinese press. The Chongqing incident was initially called "coolest nail house in history" by a blogger,&lt;ref name="danwei"/&gt; after which the incident was picked up by major media throughout China, including state-run newspapers, and became a national sensation.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; 85% of respondents to a poll on [[sina.com]] supported the couple rather than the developers.&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt; Later, however, the Chinese government forbade newspapers from reporting on the event.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2007/03/chinese_government_forbidden_media_reports_about_the_na.php|publisher=China Digital Times|title=Chinese Government Forbids Media Reporting of The "Nailhouse" Story|accessdate=13 November 2007|author=Xiao Qiang|date=24 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080203080903/http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2007/03/chinese_government_forbidden_media_reports_about_the_na.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nail house tests China's new property rights law|url=http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/20533.|publisher=Scripps News|accessdate=13 November 2007|author=Geoffrey York|date=26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another blogger, vegetable vendor [[Zhou Shuguang]], traveled by train from his home in [[Hunan province]] to cover the incident, funded by donations from his readers. Writing under the pen name "zola", Zhou interviewed the participants, as well as crowds that had gathered and others who claimed to have been evicted from their homes. He was popularly referred to as China's first "citizen journalist" although his site was blocked as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.cn/displayarticle.asp?aid=25175&amp;slug=CHINA-IT-INTERNET|publisher=Interfax|title=Interview with "citizen reporter" Zhou Shuguang, aka Zola|accessdate=13 November 2007|date=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others defied the prohibition as well, including the Chinese edition of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', which worked a subtle reference of the incident into a magazine cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports Illustrated Nods At The Nailhouse|author=Jonathan Ansfield|date=12 June 2009|accessdate=13 November 2007|url=http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2007/04/sports-illustrated-nods-at-the-nailhouse-updated/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In early 2010 the [[China Film Group Corporation]], China's state-run film distributor, withdrew the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' from screens early.

'''Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing''' ('''IUU''') is an international issue around the world. Industry observers believe IUU occurs in most fisheries, and accounts for up to 30% of total catches in some important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Fund: [http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm Fishing problems: Illegal fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411060604/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/marine/problems/problems_fishing/illegal_fishing/index.cfm |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illegal fishing''' takes place when vessels or harvesters operate in violation of the laws of a [[fishery]]. This can apply to fisheries that are under the jurisdiction of a coastal state or to [[International waters|high seas]] fisheries regulated by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO). According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, illegal fishing has caused losses estimated at US$23 billion per year with about 30% of illegal fishing in the world occurring in [[Indonesia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/07/19/056594269/Almost-Half-of-Illegal-Fishing-in-the-World-Occur-in-Indonesia |title=Almost Half of Illegal Fishing in the World Occur in Indonesia |author=Ella Syafputri |date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unreported fishing''' is fishing that has been unreported or misreported to the relevant national authority or RFMO, in contravention of applicable laws and regulations.

'''Unregulated fishing''' generally refers to fishing by vessels without nationality, vessels flying the flag of a country not party to the RFMO governing that fishing area or species on the high seas, or harvesting in unregulated areas.

The drivers behind illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are similar to those behind many other types of international [[environmental crime]]: pirate fishers have a strong economic incentive -- many species of fish, particularly those that have been [[over-exploited]] and are thus in short supply, are of high financial value.

Such IUU activity may then show a high chance of success – i.e. a high [[rate of return]] – from the failure of governments to regulate adequately (e.g. inadequate coverage of international agreements), or to enforce national or international laws (e.g. because of lack of capacity, or poor levels of governance). A particular driver behind IUU fishing is the failure of a number of flag states to exercise effective regulation over ships on their registers &amp;mdash; which in turn creates an incentive for ships to register under these [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]].

Since no one reports catches made by pirates, their level of fishing cannot be accurately quantified. 

==Economic and environmental impacts==
One economic impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on developing countries is the direct loss of the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if the IUU fishing were not taking place.

These losses include a loss to GNP, and government revenues from [[landing fee]]s, licence fees, and taxes payable by legal fishing operators. There are further indirect impacts in terms of loss of income and employment in related industries; losses in income will tend to reduce the consumer expenditures of families working in the [[fishing industry]].

IUU harvests may be brought to market at a lower price as unfair competition to the same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product. In either situation this illegal unregulated contribution to the market may lower the overall quality and price of products available, thus creating an economic burden on harvesters following the laws and regulations.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing can have a significant impact on the sustainability of both the targeted species and the ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as [[coral reef]]s, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight [[sea turtle]] species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem.

This may lead to reduced [[food security]] in communities heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein.

IUU fishing can also lead to increased pressure on endangered fish species.  IUU fishing can directly affect the population of fish species by increasing the number of fish caught within the population in spite of population management efforts by the international community.  Indirectly, the substitution ([[Applied Food Technologies#Economic fraud resulting from fish mislabeling|mislabeling]]) of IUU caught fish for popular, but threatened or endangered species, increases the perceived supply of these species, thus decreasing the price and increasing the demand for the fish species.

==Certification and labeling==
Mandatory [[product certification]] and catch documentation are increasingly part of fishery monitoring and enforcement, and to exclude IUU products from consumer markets. Certification is also used for timber and for diamonds, which have analogous enforcement problems. Labels can reward harvesters and supply chains which honor regulations. Labeling may also provide accountability for [[adaptive management]] planning, as well-managed fisheries may provide higher quality products and more stable economics for producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/noaa_taskforce_report_final.pdf Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Action Plan for Implementing the Task Force Recommendations] at noaa.gov. 2014-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waitt Institute. [http://waittinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IUU-Waitt-Institute-Factsheet-13Mar2015.pdf Factsheet: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of certification or catch document schemes is encouraged in the [[FAO]]'s [[International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing]]. Several [[RFMOs]] include them, including [[CCAMLR]]'s [[Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish]], [[CCSBT]]'s [[Trade Information Scheme for Southern Bluefin Tuna]] and [[ICCAT]]'s [[Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme]]. Similar systems are applied at a national level, including the USA's [[Certification of Origin of Tuna and Tuna Tracking and Verification Systems]], Japan's reporting requirements (including area of capture) for all imports or transportation of tunas into Japan by boat, and the EU’s labelling of all fish products (including area of capture).

===Marine Stewardship Council===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MSC ecolabel.png|thumb|right|125px|The MSC ecolabel for certified, traceable sustainable seafood]] --&gt;The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an international [[non-profit organization]] that runs a certification and ecolabelling program for traceable, sustainable seafood.

To achieve certification as sustainable a fishery must meet a standard based on three principles:

# ensuring healthy [[fish stock]]s
# minimal impact on the marine ecosystem
# effective management (which includes ensuring the fishery operates within national and international laws).

Fisheries that meet the MSC standard for a sustainable fishery can use the blue MSC ecolabel on their [[seafood products]].

The second element of the program is a certification for seafood traceability. This is called MSC Chain of Custody. From the fishery, every company in the [[supply chain]] that handles the certified fish is checked to ensure the MSC label is only applied to fish products that come from a certified fishery. This requires effective record-keeping and storage procedures. This traceability element of the program helps to keep illegally fished seafood out of the supply chain by linking seafood sold in shops and restaurants to a certified sustainable fishery.

The MSC eco-label enables consumers to easily identify sustainable seafood when shopping or dining out. As of June 2014, there are over 14,000 MSC-labelled seafood products sold in over 90 countries around the world.  The MSC website lists outlets selling MSC-certified seafood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msc.org/where-to-buy/msc-labelled-seafood-in-shops-and-restaurants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The six MSC certified [[Patagonian toothfish]] and Antarctic toothfish fisheries (which are the South Georgia, Ross Sea, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands and Falkland Islands fisheries) provide a good example of how good [[fisheries management]] can reverse the trend of illegal fishing. These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters:

* strict vessel licensing systems are rigorously enforced,
* each vessel must have at least 1 CCAMLR approved Government observer on board its vessel to verify catch data,
* each vessel must have port-to-port monitoring of its movements via two tamper-proof Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) units on board,
* all toothfish product that is transported must be accompanied by a CCAMLR Dissostichus Catch Document (DCD), with details of where and when that fish was caught.

These are only some of the measures taken by the toothfish fisheries to achieve MSC certification.  Further information on each of these toothfish fisheries can be found on the MSC website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Responsible Fishing Scheme====
The Responsible Fishing Scheme is the only global standard that audits compliance on board fishing vessels, including ethical and welfare criteria. First launched in 2006 by Seafish to help fishing vessels demonstrate their commitment to a responsibly sourced catch, in January 2016 a revised scheme was launched to include the health and safety and welfare of crew on board. The new scheme has been re-developed in accordance with the requirements of internationally recognised standard ISO17065. Initially focused on vessels supplying the UK market, the scheme will be rolled out internationally over the next two years. 

The Responsible Fishing Scheme website has the most up to date information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seafish.org/rfs&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafish is the UK's authority on seafood. It was founded in 1981 by an Act of Parliament and aims to support all sectors of the seafood industry for a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible future. It is the only pan-industry body offering services to all parts of the industry, from the start of the supply chain at catching and aquaculture; through processing, importers, exporters and distributors of seafood right through to restaurants and retailers. Seafish is funded by a levy on the first sale of seafood landed in the UK. Its services are intended to support and improve the environmental sustainability, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the industry, as well as promoting responsibly-sourced seafood.

==Enforcement==
[[File:Proposed modification to the Damen Stan patrol vessel for the USCG.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Design for an environmental protection patrol vessel]]

Illegal and unreported fishing (two of the three components of IUU fishing) essentially arise from a failure to adequately enforce existing national and international laws. There are, however, many factors underlying enforcement failure, including, notably, poor levels of national governance.

There are obvious problems with enforcing fisheries regulations on the high seas, including locating and apprehending the pirate ships, but solutions are available, chiefly through improved monitoring and surveillance systems. 

Many fishermen are getting away with illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) ocean fishing due to the difficulty of monitoring every single fishing boat. This will begin to change with new technology that is able to watch and follow each boat from space consistently. This will be done through radio beacons, which all boats in the ocean are required to have. By implementing this new monitoring system, it will be impossible for fishermen to get away with IUU fishing in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/09/08/the-fight-against-illicit-fishing-of-the-oceans-is-moving-into-space|title=The fight against illicit fishing of the oceans is moving into space|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC]] systems are similarly of value within exclusive economic zones, including, for example, offshore patrols and licensing schemes.

==Flag state liability==
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states bear responsibility for the vessels (including fishing vessels) that fly their flag. While it is uncontroversial that individuals engaged in IUU fishing may be subject to legal sanctions, the extent to which flag states may be held liable under international law for the IUU fishing activities of their vessels is less clearly defined.
	
In March, 2013 the issue of flag state liability for IUU fishing was brought before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in a request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf] "Request for an Advisory Opinion Submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC)" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC asked the Tribunal to advise on the following four questions:

# What are the obligations of the flag State in cases where illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities are conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of third party States? 
# To what extent shall the flag State be held liable for IUU fishing activities conducted by vessels sailing under its flag? 
# Where a fishing license is issued to a vessel within the framework of an international agreement with the flag State or with an international agency, shall the State or international agency be held liable for the violation of the fisheries legislation of the coastal State by the vessel in question? 
# What are the rights and obligations of the coastal State in ensuring the sustainable management of shared stocks and stocks of common interest, especially the small pelagic species and tuna? 

In its submissions to the Tribunal, the SRFC emphasized the severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/written_statements_round1/C21_19_CSRP_orig_Eng_rev.pdf] "Written Statement of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission" &lt;/ref&gt; The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings due to a lack of support and cooperation from flag states.
	
A number of states and international organizations also made submissions&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/en/cases/list-of-cases/case-no-21/#c2272]&lt;/ref&gt; adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to perform due diligence with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another more substantive requirement.
	
In its Advisory Opinion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.21/advisory_opinion/C21_AdvOp_02.04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the  “due diligence” approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state.

==Political processes==
===EU action plan===
The [[European Union|EU]] helped draw up FAO's international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, endorsed by the FAO Council in June 2001. The EU then developed its own plan to implement the commitments agreed at international level, and the European Commission‘s action plan for the eradication of IUU fishing was published in May 2002. It is intended to be implemented at four levels:

At the EU level, more responsibility will be requested with regard to member state nationals acting under a [[flag of convenience]]. Moreover, market measures concerning fisheries products caught in violation of the international agreements will be adopted. In addition, information actions addressed to the fishing industry, consumers, and the public will be launched to raise their awareness.

In the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and their catches would be quantified.

At the international level, concepts like genuine link would be defined, and a number of rights and obligations of the port state would be established. Moreover, the exchange of information on IUU activities and the international co-operation would be strengthened.

In partnership with developing countries, the necessary means would be provided to enable them to effectively control fishing activities undertaken in waters under their jurisdiction.

===High Seas Task Force===
The [[WCPA High Seas Task Force|High Seas Task Force]] comprises a group of fisheries ministers and international NGOs working together to develop an action plan designed to combat IUU fishing on the high seas.

Launched in 2003, the Task Force includes fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the [[Earth Institute]], [[IUCN]]-World Conservation Union, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] International and the [[Marine Stewardship Council]].

The goal of the Task Force is to set priorities among a series of practical proposals for confronting the challenge of IUU fishing on the high seas. A series of expert panels have been convened to identify the legal, economic, scientific and enforcement factors that permit IUU activity to thrive, and then determine key points of leverage that can brought to bear at national, regional, and global levels to minimise the incentives to carry out IUU fishing on the high seas. The completed action plan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.high-seas.org/docs/HSTFfinal/HSTF-Final-Report-09-03-06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; published on 3 March 2006, will be placed by ministerial members of the Task Force directly in the hands of other ministers.

=== Regional Fisheries Management Organizations ===
[[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]]s (RFMOs) are affiliations of nations that co-ordinate efforts to manage fisheries in a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=4566&lt;/ref&gt;

RFMOs may focus on certain species of fish (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of [[Southern bluefin tuna]]) or have a wider remit related to living marine resources in general within a region (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ([[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|CCAMLR]])). This wide diversity of mandates and areas of application, and also effective implementation of regulations, opens up opportunities for IUU vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fi/website/FIRetrieveAction.do?dom=topic&amp;fid=2940 FAO website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN high seas processes===

The present system of high seas governance has evolved over a period of several hundred years, the end result being a [[patchwork quilt]] of measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation.

Most legal instruments build on the foundation established by the UN [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which was agreed in 1982 and entered into force in 1992.

The UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which entered into force in 2001, sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and establishes that such management must be based on the precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation on conservation and management, but since only about a third of the parties to the Law of the Sea Convention have ratified it, its impact is inevitably limited.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out much of the technical work on international fisheries management, and provides a forum for the negotiation of agreements and codes of conduct. In 1995 the FAO agreed its [[Code of Conduct]] for Responsible Fisheries to promote long-term [[sustainable management]].

In 2001, the FAO adopted the International Plan of Action (IPOA) on IUU Fishing. The aim of this voluntary instrument is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all states with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organisations established in accordance with international law.

The FAO Compliance Agreement, which entered into force in 2003, is designed to close a major loophole in international fisheries management, that of the circumvention of fisheries regulations by ‘re-flagging‘ vessels under the flags of states that are unable or unwilling to enforce such measures.

In 2009, the FAO brokered the [[Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing]], which entered into force in 2016. The agreement closes ports to vessels suspected of illegal fishing.&lt;ref name=MercoPress/&gt; The treaty requires that fishing vessels request permission to dock and inform the port of the details of its fishing operations. Permission to dock can be denied if unregulated fishing was occurring. The measure is intended to block illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace. Other measures in the treaty include inspections of equipment, paperwork, catches, and ship's records. Though the treaty does not compel countries to apply these measures to ships under their own flags, they may choose to do so under the agreement.&lt;ref name=MercoPress&gt;{{cite news | title = FAO: New treaty will leave fish pirates without safe haven | url = http://en.mercopress.com/2009/09/01/fao1 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = [[MercoPress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 91 countries agree to illegal fishing treaty | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jozF6o3ZudxKjNHdVnaj8w7cOVHQD9AEO9Q82 | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirunapartiet''' (The Kiruna Party) is a local [[political party]] in [[Kiruna Municipality]], Sweden. It was founded in 1994 as a splinter group of the local branch of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and was led by [[Lars Törnman]] from 1994 until 2010, when Törnman left the party for the Social Democrats. After Törnman's leaving the party, Henry Emmoth was selected as its new leader.

In the municipal elections in 1994, Kirunapartiet got 33% of the total vote, which meant that the party was the largest of the parties in the municipal government, and got the right to appoint the [[municipal commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuriren.nu/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4156420 Kirunapartiet: En historisk tillbakablick] ''[[Norrbottens-Kuriren]]'' 12 September 2008, retrieved 14 November 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It held this right until 2006, when the Social Democrats received more votes in the municipal elections of that year. Following Törnman's realignment and a (failed) internal attempt to dissolve the party in favor of a stronger Social Democratic party, the municipal election of 2010 resulted in poor figures for the party.

The Kiruna Party attempted to reach [[Riksdag|parliament]] in 2002 (as a part of the [[Norrbotten Party]] ticket) and [[Norrbotten County]] [[County council|council]] in 2002 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, the party failed by a mere 137 votes to gain representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1425">A '''labor court''' (or '''labour court''' or '''industrial tribunal''') is a governmental judiciary body which rules on labor or employment-related matters and disputes. In a number of countries, labor cases are often taken to separate national labor high courts. Other states, such as the United States, possess general non-judiciary [[labour relations]] boards which govern union certifications and elections.

'''Legal issues with fan fiction''' arise due to the prospect that a piece of [[fan fiction]] may constitute a [[derivative work]], most prominently (but not exclusively) under [[United States copyright law]].

==United States copyright law==
{{off topic|Copyright law of the United States|date=December 2017}}
Significant amounts of [[copyright]]able [[creative work]]s such as motion pictures, television programs, music, and computer gaming works are produced in the [[United States]].  In addition, a significant amount of fan fiction is created in the United States. For these reasons, although every nation's law is different and different laws may apply to different works of fan fiction, U.S. law is often centrally relevant when determining the legality of writing and/or sharing fan fiction.

Under U.S. Copyright law, the legality of a given work of fan fiction will depend principally on three legal doctrines: (1) copyrightability of the underlying source work; (2) the derivative work right; and (3) fair use.

To have copyright protection under U.S. law, a work must be an "original [work] of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which [it] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §102(a)(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such works of authorship include but are not limited to literature, music, plays, pictures and architectural works.  Copyright can not be applied to ideas, concepts, facts or other broad principles regardless of whether they are expressed in a tangible medium or otherwise.  Copyright goes into effect automatically, even if a work is not published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §104(a)(b)(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For works created in 1978 or later, copyright protection persists for the life of the author plus 70 years; in the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a [[work made for hire]], the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from publication, or for 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §302(1998).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to current [[United States]] [[copyright]], copyright owners have the [[exclusive right]] "to prepare derivative works based upon [their] copyrighted work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §106(2)(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A derivative work is any work, including fanfiction{{Dubious|Is fanfiction a derived work?|date=September 2012}} based upon one or more preexisting works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §101(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case where a copyright owner chooses to exercise his/her exclusive right to prepare derivative works against a work of fanfiction, s/he can sue the fanfiction writer for [[copyright infringement]].  To prove infringement, an owner must present evidence establishing that the accused has copied protected elements of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillingeffects.org/fanfic/faq.cgi#QID310|title=Fan Fiction|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possible remedies available if infringement can be proven include an order to cease sharing and/or to destroy the work (known as an injunction), or monetary damages.  The remedy is dependent on the harm done to the copyright owner, the intent of the infringing person, and the grievousness of the infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §502 - 504(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   An example of injunction as remedy was seen in the case of ''[[Anderson v. Stallone]]''.  There, Sylvester Stallone successfully pursued an action for copyright infringement against Anderson, an author who wrote a proposed script for ''[[Rocky IV]],'' by proving that the copyright-protected characters used in the previous Rocky movies were central to the new script.  The court enjoined Anderson from pursuing the creation of a movie or other published work based on his script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Anderson v. Stallone (11 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1161) | website=Chicago-Kent College of Law | date=26 April 1989 | url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rwarner/classes/legalaspects_ukraine/copyright/cases/anderson_v_stallone.html | access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanfiction is not infringing if it constitutes [[fair use]] of the underlying copyrighted work.  In determining whether a particular use constitutes fair use, courts consider the following four factors:
# "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
# the nature of the copyrighted work;
# the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."&lt;ref name="17 U.S.C. §1072009"&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf 17 U.S.C. §107(2009).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009143055/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair use is assessed on a case-by-case basis.  While such genres as [[parody]] and [[criticism]] are enumerated by statute and case law as presumptively fair uses of a copyrighted work, fan fiction has not historically been recognized by U.S. courts as necessarily constituting these or other enumerated fair use genres, and thus neither falls categorically inside nor categorically outside the presumptive boundaries of fair use.  Works of fanfiction are more likely to constitute fair use if they are "transformative" with respect to the original work, if they are non-commercial, if they appropriate relatively little of the original work, and/or if they do not tend to detract from the potential market for or value of the original work.&lt;ref name="17 U.S.C. §1072009"/&gt;

In a 2009 case,  [[United States District Court]] judge Deborah A. Batts permanently prohibited publication in the United States of a book by Swedish writer Fredrik Colting, whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of J.D. Salinger's ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Judge Batts explicitly rejected arguments of parody and criticism, stating,
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodic comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |last=Chan|first=Sewell|title=Ruling for Salinger, Judge Bans 'Rye' Sequel|newspaper=New York Times |department=City Room|date=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case was vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with orders to apply the  ''[[eBay v. MercExchange]]'' test in determining whether publication of a work can be prohibited on a theory of intellectual property infringement before the case has gone to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/arts/salingerruling.pdf Salinger v. Colting, Docket No. 09-2878-cv]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled in 2011, with Colting agreeing to cease distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bulgrien | first=Amy | title=Salinger v. Colting (2011) | website=ARL® | date=3 August 2009 | url=https://www.arl.org/focus-areas/court-cases/2471-salinger-v-colting#.W-gPW5NKhPY | access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, in ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co.]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] vacated a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction sought by the copyright holders of [[Margaret Mitchell|Margaret Mitchell's]] ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' against Alice Randall's ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]''.  In determining whether Randall's work rose to the level of transformative, Circuit Judge Birch used the guidelines for transformative works laid out in the Supreme Court's ''[[Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music]]''.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web | author=Souter | title=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510 U.S. 569 (1994). | website=LII / Legal Information Institute | date=March 7, 1994 | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birch found Randall's work to be transformative because it "[provided] social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one."&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.

==Trademark law==

Separate from the legal issues raised by fanfiction’s interaction with copyright law, legal issues may also develop from United States [[trademark law]].

Current federal [[trademark law]] follows the [[Lanham Act]], otherwise known as the Trademark Act of 1946.  Under the [[Lanham Act]], a [[trademark]] is "any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof" used in commerce to identify a service or good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitlaw.com/source/15usc/1125.html15 U.S.C. § 1125 (2010)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, it is possible for the names and likenesses of television, film and book characters, fictional settings, or other elements of entertainment products to act as trademarks.  Unlike [[copyright]], however, [[trademark]] rights are not automatic.  To establish a right in [[trademark]], the rights-seeker must establish that his/her mark acts as a distinctive "source identifier" for a particular type of good or service.  Thus, trademark rights may arise when a fictional character’s name or likeness may serve to identify the source of an entertainment product or related good.  For example, the use of Mickey Mouse’s name or likeness may serve to identify a particular book or toy as originating from Disney.  One way to establish that a mark acts as a distinctive source identifier is to establish that the relevant purchasing public has developed a strong association between the mark and its originating source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hoffman | first=Ivan | title=The Protection of Fictional Characters | website=IVAN HOFFMAN, B.A., J.D. Attorney At Law | url=http://www.ivanhoffman.com/characters.html | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In legal terms, this is known as "secondary meaning."

If the trademark holder can show that its creation acts as a distinctive source identifier, s/he still must prove a [[likelihood of confusion]] to prevail in a [[trademark infringement]] claim.  Different courts consider similar but not identical factors when deciding likelihood of confusion.  Common factors that may be relevant to fanfiction include:

#How well known and distinctive the mark allegedly being infringed is;
#How similar the infringing mark is to the original mark;
#How similar the allegedly infringing goods or services are to the markholder’s goods or services;
#Whether the infringer intended to deceive the purchasing public or to trade on the good will of the markholder;
#The level of sophistication of those persons or groups likely to be the consumers of the mark;
#Whether consumers were actually confused as to the source of the goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Polaroid Corp. | website= Berkman Klein Center | date=June 30, 1956 | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can weigh the factors in individual cases, and may consider additional factors as they please.

To the extent that fanfiction uses source-identifying characters, settings and such, the marks are often well known are identical to the original, and are used in similar types of goods (i.e., written fiction).  In this way, the first three factors relayed here weigh for the trademark holder.

However, fanfiction writers generally do not intend to deceive the consuming public as to the source of the work, and often include prominent disclaimers at the outset of their works stating that the works are not the products of the original creators, both to honor the original creator and to prevent any possible confusion as to source.  In addition, as a consuming audience, fanfiction readers are generally sophisticated regarding works' status as fanfiction, and are aware that fanfiction is not written or endorsed by those who hold the trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Tushnet]], [http://tushnet.com/legalfictions.pdf "Legal Fictions: Copyright, Fan Fiction, and a New Common Law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203144950/http://www.tushnet.com/legalfictions.pdf |date=2011-02-03 }}, 17 Loy. L.A. Ent. L.J. 651 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the last three factors tend to weigh in the direction of fanfiction writers.

Trademark holders may also allege that the use of trademarked characters, settings, etc. may constitute trademark dilution.  The concept of trademark dilution is that overuse or improper use of a mark, even when it does not create consumer confusion, can lessen the mark’s uniqueness and value as a source identifier.  A dilution claim requires that the mark in question be famous throughout general consuming public and that the use of the mark create a likelihood of either "blurring" or "tarnishment."  A likelihood of blurring occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark; a likelihood of tarnishment occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark.

Even if a likelihood of confusion or dilution were found, trademark law provides various defenses to alleged infringement.  These defenses fall into the categories of "fair use" and "First Amendment."

Trademark "fair use" differs significantly from [[fair use]] under [[copyright law]].  In trademark law there are two types of [[fair use]]: [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|descriptive]] and [[nominative use]].   Descriptive fair use permits the use of a descriptive mark in a descriptive way; for example, an advertisement could say that a particular dress shoe "feels like a sneaker" even though the phrase "Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker" is the trademark of another company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. SHOE CORP. v. BROWN - 740 F.Supp. 196 (1990) - supp1961919 | website=Leagle | date=May 11, 1990 | url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/1990936740fsupp1961919 | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominative fair use permits the use of a mark to identify the product that bears that mark, when (1) the product or service in question is not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) no more of the mark is used than is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and (3) the user does nothing beyond use of the mark that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. For example, a news story about the New Kids on the Block can use the mark "New Kids on the Block" to identify the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Kids on the Block | website=Berkman Klein Center | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/newkids.htm | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominative fair use is often particularly relevant to fanfiction, since a fanfiction writer’s use of trademarked names, settings, etc. to identify characters, story settings, etc. will generally meet the three requirements for nominative fair use.  For this reason, fanfiction is harder to succeed on than an allegation of copyright infringement.

An additional defense to trademark infringement or dilution relies on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantee of freedom of speech.

Courts have shown reluctance to curtail creative uses of trademarks in expressive works. For example, in ''[[Mattel v. MCA Records]]'', United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit permitted the band [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]’s use of Mattel’s trademark in "Barbie" to sell songs, that MCA had a valid parody defense, as Aqua needed to use the word "Barbie" in its song "[[Barbie Girl]]," based on the fact that the use of the mark was (1) artistically relevant to the song and (2) not explicitly misleading as to the source of the song.  Because there was a relatively small likelihood of confusion, the Ninth Circuit held that the First Amendment protected Aqua’s use of the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Court cases - 9th Circuit COA - Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc. | website=Tabberone Main Page. | date=July 24, 2002 | url=http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/CourtCases/9thCircuitCOA/MattelVsMCARecords.shtml | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] defense has not stood up where the trademark holder was able to prove the existence of significant actual confusion.  An example of this is a parodic publication running a parody ad for a product, and the parody not being well done enough or labeled clearly enough for people to realize it is not a real ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawschool.courtroomview.com/acf_cases/10227-anheuser-busch-inc-v-balducci-publications|title=Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications, 814 F.Supp. 791(1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these differences in the legal doctrines of [[trademark]] and [[copyright]], [[trademark law]] is less likely to come into conflict with fanfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/scitech/volume92/mccardle.pdf Meredith McCardle, Fandom, Fan Fiction and Fanfare: What's All the Fuss?, 9 B.U.

L. 443 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leanne Stendell, Comment, Fanfic and Fan Fact: How Current Copyright Law Ignores the Reality of Copyright Owner and Consumer Interests in Fan Fiction, 58 SMU L.

A brief note on non-U.S. perspectives: while other countries do not necessarily weigh the interests of trademark owners and other speakers in the same way, noncommercial and expressive uses may receive protection under other nations' laws as well.  For example, in South Africa, a T-shirt company was able to sell T-shirts parodying Black Label beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=Laugh It Off Promotions CC v South African Breweries International (Finance) BV t/a Sabmark International and Another (CCT42/04) &amp;#91;2005&amp;#93; ZACC 7; 2006 (1) SA 144 (CC); 2005 (8) BCLR 743 (CC) (27 May 2005) | website=SAFLII | date=May 27, 2005 | url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/7.html | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right of publicity==

Many countries, and some U.S. States, have laws governing [[rights of publicity]].  In the United States, rights of publicity are governed by state statutes and state common law, and thus vary from state to state.  As a general matter, the [[right of publicity]] grants a right to famous persons to control the commercial use of their "name, image and likeness,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Right of Publicity | website=Right Of Publicity | date=January 11, 1999 | url=http://rightofpublicity.com/brief-history-of-rop | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes extends to one’s broader identity or persona.  The case of ''[[White v. Samsung]]'' provides an example of the right of publicity protecting a celebrity’s persona even when her name and likeness were not used: Samsung created an ad that pictured a robot in a blond wig and a red dress, in a pose that evoked [[Vanna White]]’s work on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. White prevailed under California law on the theory that although Samsung had not used her name or likeness.  Samsung had used a recognizable depiction of her persona without permission for their commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc., 971 F. 2d 1395 - Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit 1992 | website=Google Scholar | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763501998860364615&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarrWhite | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguably, celebrities whose names, images, likenesses or personas are used in [[real person fiction]], have the right to assert claims against fanfiction authors based on [[rights of publicity]].

To date, though, no recorded right of publicity suits have been brought regarding noncommercial fan fiction about real persons.  This may be, in part, because most states’ right of publicity laws only apply to uses for commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rightofpublicity.com/statutes/restatement-third-of-unfair-competition-s46-49Restatement(Third) of Unfair Competition §46]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the ruling in ''White'', courts have shown hesitation in other suits to shut down even commercial artistic pursuits based on the right of publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing, Inc., 99 F. Supp. 2d 829 - Dist.

Major League Baseball Advanced Media, L.P., 505 F3d 818 (8th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have relied directly on the First Amendment.  In ''ETW v. Jireh'', the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected a right of publicity claim brought by Tiger Woods against an artist who depicted Woods and other golf legends, holding that the transformative nature of the work exempted it from right of publicity liability under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1158418.htmlETW|title=FindLaw's  case and opinions.|work=Findlaw|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in ''Parks v. LaFace'', the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the [[Outkast]] song "[[Rosa Parks (song)|Rosa Parks]]" violated the civil rights icon’s right of publicity because it was not sufficiently transformative.  The court explained that the use of a name or likeness is not transformative for right of publicity purposes when it "is used solely to attract attention to a work that is not related to the identified person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca6/05-2297/07a0261p-06-2011-02-25.pdf?1301254556Parks v. LaFace Records]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on these cases, it is not clear that a court would be willing to abridge free speech by holding that fictional writing about a real person constitutes a violation of that person’s right of publicity.

==Advocacy regarding the legality of fan fiction==
In 2007 two [[UC Davis Law School]] professors argued in the ''[[California Law Review]]'' that "[[Mary Sue]]" fan fiction "that challenge the orthodoxy of the original likely constitute fair use". Citing ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]''&amp;mdash;which established that commercial parody can qualify as fair use if it can be perceived as commenting or criticizing on the original&amp;mdash;and the subsequent ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]'', the authors wrote that "Similarly, many Mary Sues comment on or criticize the original, while at the same time create something new ... Mary Sues can be commercial and still be fair."&lt;ref name="jstor20439103"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chander | first1 = Anupam | last2 = Sunder | first2 = Madhavi | year = 2007 | title = Everyone's a Superhero: A Cultural Theory of "Mary Sue" Fan Fiction as Fair Use | journal = California Law Review | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 597–626 | jstor = 20439103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, a group of fans who engage in creating fan works and are part of the larger fan community founded the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] (OTW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transformativeworks.org/|title=Organization for Transformative Works|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OTW has since advocated the legitimacy of fan fiction due its [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] nature.  OTW's position is that fan fiction and other [[fan labor]] products constitute copyright fair use under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.shtml 17 U.S.C. § 107] because they add "new meaning and messages to the original" work,&lt;ref name="otw-legal-faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus fall under the exemption to U.S. copyright law the Supreme Court defined in ''Campbell''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Souter | title=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510 U.S. 569 (1994). | website=LII / Legal Information Institute | date=March 7, 1994 | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was later revisited and followed in ''Suntrust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hilden | first=Julie | title=The Organization for Transformative Works and Its Bid to Protect Fan Fiction: Are Its Proposed Changes to Copyright Law, Creating Immunity for Suits Against FanFic, a Good Idea? | website=writ.news.findlaw.com | date=September 26, 2016 | url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hilden/20080121.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926194621/http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hilden/20080121.html | archive-date=September 26, 2016 | dead-url=unfit | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OTW's vision includes seeing "all fannish works recognized as legal and transformative and ... accepted as a legitimate creative activity."&lt;ref name="otw-vision"&gt;{{cite web | title = What We Believe  | publisher = [[Organization for Transformative Works]] | url = http://transformativeworks.org/about/believe  | accessdate = 5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward this end OTW works to educate fan writers and published writers about copyright laws, particularly the open legal questions around fan fiction and other  fan works.

OTW also maintains its own fan fiction archive, the [[Archive of Our Own]], commonly called AO3. All fan fiction on the site is recognized as non-profit derivative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiveofourown.org/ | title = Archive of Our Own | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While OTW provides a centralized netspace for fans to acquire knowledge and aid regarding their own creative works, and a voice for the fan community, it does not represent all fans.  Fans have many different views on the legalities of fan works, from the pure question of whether these works are transformative, to differences in how fans feel fan works should be disseminated.

Fan writers who argue that their work is legal through the [[fair use]] doctrine use specific [[fair use]] arguments in the context of fan works, such as:
#Fan works do not deprive the owner of the source material of income
#Fan works may work as free advertisement and promotion of the original source material
#Fan works are usually non-profit.
#Fan works do not copy, or attempt to substitute for, the original work.

OTW is also not the only organization to support the idea that fan works are transformative.  In ''Salinger v. Colting'', the ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=16b57676-8b36-4d5c-b6f1-669b97e05cb0|title=Amici Curiae brief filed on behalf of The New York Times and various other media organizations.|work=JD Supra|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other major media conglomerates filed an amicus brief supporting Colting's book, as did the Library Copyright Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/salingeramicusbrief.pdfLCA|title=Search Publications - Association of Research Libraries® - ARL®|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright holders' attitude towards fan fiction==
Some copyright holders have stated specific positive or negative attitudes towards fanfiction.

=== Examples ===

==== Studios, Productions Companies, and Producers ====
Most major studios and production companies tolerate fan fiction, and some even encourage it to a certain extent.  [[Paramount Pictures]], for example, allowed the production of ''[[Star Trek: The New Voyages]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The New Voyages 2]]'' from [[Bantam Books]], fan fiction anthologies which followed Bantam's ''[[Star Trek Lives!]]'' by reprinting stories from various fanzines; as well as ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]]'', a series of ten anthologies from [[Pocket Books]] in which the short stories were selected through an open submissions process geared toward novice writers.

Due to the ongoing nature of television production, some television producers have implemented constraints, one example being ''[[Babylon 5]]'' creator [[J. Michael Straczynski]].  His demand that ''Babylon 5'' fan fiction be clearly labeled or kept off the Internet confined most of the ''Babylon 5'' fan fiction community to mailing lists during the show's initial run.

Many writers and producers state that they do not read fan fiction, citing a fear of being accused of stealing a fan's ideas, but encourage its creation nonetheless.  When ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' went off the air, for instance, creator [[Joss Whedon]] encouraged fans to read fan fiction during the show's timeslot.

==== Authors ====
While many authors, (''e.g.'' [[Neil Gaiman]], [[J.K. Rowling]], [[D.J. MacHale]], [[Stephenie Meyer]], [[Terry Pratchett]]) do not take issue with authors of derivative works, a number of authors do. They may request that fan fiction archival sites remove and ban any pieces of fan fiction based on their original works. To date, no fan fiction archive has failed to comply with an author’s request to remove works, and many archives feature a full list of authors whose work cannot be the source of a fan fiction on their site.

Fan fiction hosting sites like MediaMiner and Fanfiction.net have lists of authors whose fandoms are prohibited from their sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[J. K. Rowling]] has also complained about sexually explicit [[Harry Potter]] fan fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Walter | first=Natasha | title=Natasha Walter: Works in progress | website=the Guardian | date=October 27, 2004 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/27/technology.news | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;{{cite news

Showbiz |publisher=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Steven Brust]] published a Firefly novel with a CC copyright notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brust|first=Steven|title=My Own Kind of Freedom|year=2007|url=http://dreamcafe.com/firefly.html|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noteworthy in regard to the acceptance of fan fiction is [[Eric Flint]], who has set up a formal site for the submission of fan fiction into his canon in the [[1632 series|''1632'' series]] at [[Baen's Bar]] and has to date (March 2015) published 58 issues of ''[[The Grantville Gazette]]'' in electronic form and six in book form.  These feature fan fiction and fan non-fiction alongside his original work (paying first semi-pro, and now [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America|SFWA]] rates). Flint (a former labor organizer and socialist) contends that this collective work allows the expansion of his [[alternate history]] universe into something approaching the complexity of reality. It can be argued, however, that since work published in the ''Gazette'' is paid (at professional rates) and cleared by Flint for [[canonicity]], that this is not actually "fan fiction" in the commonly-understood sense of the term.

Also noteworthy is the series of ''[[Darkover]]'' anthologies published by [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], beginning in 1980, consisting largely of fan fiction extended into her canon. These books led to a much talked about controversy. Bradley read something in a fan story that meshed well with a Darkover book she was currently writing, so she wrote the fan author, Jean Lamb, offering her "a sum and a dedication for all rights to the text." In a 1991 Usenet post, Jean continued, "I attempted at that point to _very politely_ negotiate a better deal. I was told that I had better take what I was offered, that much better authors than I had not been paid as much (we're talking a few hundred dollars here) and had gotten the same sort of 'credit' (this was in the summer of 1992)...a few
months later I received a letter from Ms. Bradley's lawyer threatening me with
a suit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

Either way, her attorney advised her against reading fan fiction of her work. Versions of this incident are credited by many to have led to a "zero tolerance" policy on the part of a number of other professional authors, including [[Andre Norton]], and [[David Weber]]. [[Mercedes Lackey]] used to strictly disallow any posting of fan fiction set within in her universes on the Internet, though she did allow stories to be published in approved fanzines with signed releases for each story. Recently, she has changed her stance to allow nonprofit fan fiction of her works so long as the fan fiction is licensed as a derivative work and uses a [[Creative Commons license]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Anne Rice]] objected to fan fiction based on any of her characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'') or other elements in her books, and she formally requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"However, it’s been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I’d want to own my own ideas.

Martin]], and [[Robin McKinley]] among others. Many authors do this, they state, in order to protect their copyright and especially to prevent any dilution, saturation, or distortion of the universes and people portrayed in their works.

[[Sharon Lee (writer)|Sharon Lee]] and [[Steve Miller (writer)|Steve Miller]], creators of the [[Liaden universe]], strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe. "I don’t want “other people interpreting” our characters. Interpreting our characters is what Steve and I do; it’s our job.  Nobody else is going to get it right.

We built our universes, and our characters; they are our intellectual property; and they are not toys lying about some virtual sandbox for other kids to pick up and modify at their whim.

In an author's note in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'', [[Larry Niven]] stated that he was finished writing stories in the ''[[Known Space]]'' universe, and that "[i]f you want more ''Known Space'' stories, you'll have to write them yourself." Internet writer [[Elf Sternberg]] took him up on that offer, penning a [[parody]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pendorwright.com/other/html/The_Only_Fair_Game.html|title=The Only Fair Game|last=Sternberg|first=Elf|accessdate=2009-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130015722/http://pendorwright.com/other/html/The_Only_Fair_Game.html|archivedate=2009-01-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which members of Niven's hyper-masculine [[Kzin]] species engage in gay sex and [[BDSM]].  Niven responded by denouncing Sternberg's story in the introduction to ''Man-Kzin Wars IV'' ([[Baen Books]], 1991) and issuing a [[cease-and-desist]] for copyright violation. To date, Sternberg holds that the story is constitutionally protected parody,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

Some authors have said that they wrote fan fiction before they were published, or are pro-fan fiction.

Some companies like [[CBS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/fanfic/notice.cgi?NoticeID=1067|title=Caroline in the City Fan Fiction|publisher=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Star Wars - Fan History Wiki: The Fandom History Resource | website=fanhistory.com | date=November 5, 2015 | url=http://fanhistory.com/wiki/Star_Wars | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105002219/http://fanhistory.com/wiki/Star_Wars | archive-date=November 5, 2015 | dead-url=yes | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been historically hostile to fan fiction,  changed parts of their model in order to be more fan friendly. This included trying to encourage fan works and integrating them into official sites.

When not hosting the [[fan fiction]] or being openly tolerant of existing fan sites, companies created partnerships with other companies like FanLib &lt;!-- defunct site [http://www.fanlib.com/cms.do?page=press.html]--&gt; to aid them in the task.  The reaction from fans to such alliances and interference in their activities has been mixed, with some people thinking that it violates the basic rules of fan fiction communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Life Without FanLib | website=Community Center | date=February 11, 2009 | url=http://community.livejournal.com/life_wo_fanlib | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211090317/http://community.livejournal.com/life_wo_fanlib | archive-date=February 11, 2009 | dead-url=no | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those fans seem to be increasingly in the minority, as acceptance of such interference is tolerated because of the positives that can result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gperiodenglish.blogspot.com/2007/09/tuesday-september-18.html|title=TUESDAY September 18 &amp; a WRITING CONTEST OPPORTUNITY|date=2007-09-18|work=Mrs. Ehle's G Period|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude of copyright holders toward incorporating fan fiction into the canon varies. Some copyright holders, such as the [[BBC]] in the case of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', have mechanisms to allow for unsolicited submissions of stories into the official canon, and it is also the case that the writers of canon stories have sometimes been recruited from the ranks of fan fiction writers.  In the case of the ''Doctor Who'' novels published by [[Virgin Books]], once the BBC reclaimed the license to publish novels regarding the Doctor, many readers immediately categorized all the [[Virgin New Adventures]] as non-canonical fan fiction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Legal issues with fan fiction outside the United States==

In Great Britain, ''[[Discworld]]'' author [[Terry Pratchett]], up until the point of his death in 2015, emphasized that he was careful not to read fanfics, and had voiced the opinion that "everything works if people are sensible" and didn't mind "so long as people don't put it where I can trip over it". However, Pratchett emphasized that the Discworld and all its characters are ultimately his intellectual property, and stressed that "it is not a franchise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lspace.org/fandom/fanfiction/index.html|title=Fandom : Fan Fiction|author=The L-Space Librarians|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Gaiman, another English author who has written such works as ''[[Stardust (novel)|Stardust]]'', ''[[Coraline]]'', and ''[[American Gods]]'', says he does not mind fan fiction as long as the author notes that the characters are the intellectual property of another and so long as the fiction is not for profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2002/04/in-relation-to-current-burning-topic.asp | title = Neil Gaiman's Journal | accessdate = 2010-11-07 | last = Gaiman | first = Neil | date = 2002-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, fanfiction is legal in the UK following passage into law of an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody, or pastiche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014 | website=Legislation.gov.uk | date=October 15, 2015 | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made | access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as [[Russia]] and [[China]], where copyright laws are more lenient or less well enforced, it is not uncommon to see fan fiction based on the work of popular authors published in book form. [[Sergey Lukyanenko]], a popular science fiction author, went as far as to incorporate some fan fiction based on his stories into official canon (with permission of the writers of the said fan fiction). Perhaps the most famous case, however, is [[Dmitri Yemets]]' ''[[Tanya Grotter]]'' book series, a "cultural response" to ''[[Harry Potter]]'', which provoked a lawsuit from J. K. Rowling.

In Japan, the ''[[dōjinshi]]'' subculture is similar to a combination of the United States subcultures surrounding [[underground comics]], [[science fiction fanzines]], and fan fiction. The dōjinshi artists rarely secure the permission of the original creator. Many ''dōjinshi'' works are [[manga]]-format fan fiction, which in Japan is, while not strictly legal, generally tolerated and usually encouraged, being looked upon as a form of free advertising or a breeding ground for new talent, most famously the group [[Clamp (manga artists)|CLAMP]] and [[Love Hina]] author [[Ken Akamatsu]].

A '''letter of wishes''' is a non-binding indication by the [[settlor]] of the manner in which he wishes the trustees to exercise their discretion in relation to a [[discretionary trust]].

Letters of wishes are normally used in [[testamentary trust]]s, although theoretically there is no reason why they should not be used in an [[inter vivos trust|''inter vivos'' trust]].

Letters of wishes are useful where a [[trust instrument]] gives the trustees very wide powers and discretions.  The letter of wishes principally sets out the manner in which the settlor wishes the trustees to exercise their powers and discretions, but is not binding on the trustees. All binding requirements must be contained in the trust instrument itself.  It is also quite common for letters of wishes to make posthumous expressions of thanks or love to the objects of the trust.

'''''Malum prohibitum''''' (plural ''mala prohibita'', literal translation: "wrong [as or because] prohibited") is a [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] used in [[law]] to refer to conduct that constitutes an unlawful act only by virtue of [[statute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Malum prohibitum - LII / Legal Information Institute - Cornell University Law School|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/malum_prohibitum|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to conduct that is evil in and of itself, or ''[[malum in se]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Malum in se - LII / Legal Information  - Cornell University Law School|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/malum_in_se|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conduct that is so clearly violative of society's standards for allowable conduct that it is illegal under English [[common law]] is usually regarded as ''malum in se''. An offense that is ''malum prohibitum'' may not appear on the face to directly violate [[morality|moral standards]]. The distinction between these two cases is discussed in ''State of Washington v. Thaddius X. Anderson'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=No. 67826-0. - STATE v. ANDERSON - Supreme Court of the State of Washington, 67826-0, decided August 2000|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/2000/67826-0-1.html|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal offenses can be broken down into two general categories  ''malum in se'' and ''malum prohibitum''.  The distinction between ''malum in se'' and ''malum prohibitum'' offenses is best characterized as follows:  a ''malum in se'' offense is "naturally evil as adjudged by the sense of a civilized community,"  whereas a ''malum prohibitum'' offense is wrong only because a statute makes it so. ''State v. Horton'', 139 N.C. 588, 51 S.E. 945, 946 (1905).&lt;br/&gt;"Public welfare offenses" are a subset of ''malum prohibitum'' offenses as they are typically regulatory in nature and often "'result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize.'" ''Bash'', 130 Wn.2d at 607 (quoting ''Morissette v. United States'', 342 U.S. 246, 255-56, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952)); ''see also State v. Carty'', 27 Wn. App. 715, 717, 620 P.2d 137 (1980).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of crimes and torts that might be considered as ''malum prohibitum''—but not ''[[malum in se]]''—include:
*building or modifying a house without a [[Construction permit|license]]
*[[copyright infringement]]
*[[illegal drug]] use
*[[poaching|illegal hunting]]
*operating a business without a [[Business license|license]]
*[[prostitution]]
*violating [[prohibition]] of [[alcohol]]
*modern [[statutory rape]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Richard|title=Eliminating the (Absurd) Distinction Between Malum In Se and Malum Prohibitum Crime|journal=Washington University Law Review|date=January 1995|volume=73|issue=3|pages=1129–30|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1686&amp;context=law_lawreview | quote=Presumably, in rejecting the importance of the actor's intent in [statutory rape] cases, these [several] jurisdictions label statutory rape as a malum prohibitum activity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinfield|first1=Joshua|title=A Theory of Criminal Victimization|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=May 2013|volume=65|pages=1119–1124|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/06/Kleinfeld_65_Stan._L._Rev._1087.pdf | quote=The conventional story holds that the ordinary logic of rape is that it is sex without consent; children can’t consent; therefore sex with children constitutes rape....Yet this story, however reasonable in principle, does not hold up when one actually looks at the penal codes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[English law|English]] system of [[common law]], judges have devised a number of '''mechanisms''' to allow them to cope with [[judicial precedent|precedent decisions]].

==Issues of the common law==
According to [[Montesquieu]], it is [[Parliament]] that has the rightful power to legislate, not the judiciary.  The legal fiction is that judges do not make law, they merely "declare it".  Thus, common law is declaratory, and this is often retrospective in effect.  For example, see ''[[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds#The Shaw v DPP case|Shaw v DPP]]'' &lt;ref&gt;1962 AC 220 HL&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Conspiracy (criminal)|R v Knuller]]''&lt;ref&gt;1973 A C 435&lt;/ref&gt;  In the search for justice and fairness, there is a tension between the needs for, on one hand, predictability and stability, and "up-to date law", on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Darbyshire on the English Legal System'' - 2017 - 12th ed - Penny Darbyshire&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a hierarchy of courts, and a hierarchy of decisions.  All lower courts are bound by the judgments from higher courts; and higher courts are not bound by decisions from lower courts.
	
With one exception, [[courts of record|courts of record]] are bound by their own precedent decisions. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] used to be bound by its own decisions, but in 1966 it issued a [[Practice Direction]] declaring that it would no longer feel so constrained;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[R v Shivpuri]]'' 1986, the House of Lords overruled its own decision in ''[[Anderton v Ryan]]'', made less than a year earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] is similarly free to depart from earlier decisions.  By contrast, the Court of Appeal is bound by its own decisions, although for a period [[Lord Denning]], [[Master of the Rolls|MR]], acted as though it were not.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Intention to be legally bound#Classical usage|Connell v MIB]]'' Lord Denning addressed but ignored the Court of Appeal's recent judgment in ''[[Coward v MIB]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the end of his career, Denning relented and acknowledged that the Court of Appeal was indeed bound by its own precedents.&lt;/ref&gt; Inferior courts are not strictly courts of record, but some, such as [[employment tribunal]]s methodically report their own cases, and have built up a specialist body of common law.  Courts such as the [[magistrates court]] cannot establish precedent.

Even if a court is bound to observe a precedent decision, it does not follow that the whole of the judgment is binding.  One must distinguish between ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' and ''[[obiter dicta]]''.  ''Ratio decidendi'' is the "reason for the decision", and forms the crux of the cases; whereas  ''obiter dicta'' is "other things that are said", i.e. matters said in passing, judicial asides, hypothetical issues, and broad issues. ''Ratio decidendi''  is binding on other courts,  whereas ''obiter dicta'' is persuasive only.

An effective test to see if a part of the judgment is ''ratio'' or ''obiter'' is "[[Eugene Wambaugh|Wambaugh's Inversion Test]]", whereby one must invert the question, and ask, "would the decision have been different without this part of the judgment?".  In other words, ask, "Is it '''crucial'''?".  If not, it is ''obiter dicta''.

If a judgment establishes a broad principle of law, then strictly speaking that principle is too wide to be said to be ''ratio decidendi''.  Nevertheless, if that broad principle is approved and applied by later courts, then the principle will eventually be treated as ''ratio''.  A particular example is the broad "neighbour principle", enunciated by [[Lord Atkin]] in ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''  1932, which has become the basis of the modern law of negligence.  When judges may face conflicting precedents, they may select the preferable case.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|Wagon Mound (No. 1)]]'', the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] opted to follow ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' rather than ''[[Re Polemis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissenting judgments are not ''ratio'', and so must be ''obiter''.  Sometimes, with the passage of time, more attention is given to the dissenting judgment that to the majority judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''English Legal System'' - 2015 - Slapper &amp; Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Junior Books v Veitchi]]''  1984, and ''[[Candler v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co]]'' 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish decisions (and decisions from the USA and common law jurisdictions in the Commonwealth) are, like ''obiter dicta'', merely persuasive in England.

==The mechanisms==

If faced with a binding judicial precedent, a court has a number of ways to respond to it, and may use the following legal devices and mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sixthformlaw.info/01_modules/mod2/2_1_1_precedent_mechanics/02_precedent_reversing_overuling_distinguishing.htm 6th form law]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Applying''' - simply following the precedent, and using its ''ratio'' in the current case.
* '''Approval''' - showing approval of the earlier case, without necessarily applying it.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Coward v MIB|Albert v M.I.B.]]'' [1971] 2 All ER 1345, the House of Lords approved Denning's decision in ''Connell v MIB''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Overruling''' - declaring the precedent to be wrong, making it bad law.&lt;ref&gt;A lower court may not overrule a judgment from a higher court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC]]'' overruled  ''[[Anns v Merton London Borough Council]]'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Disapproval''' - showing disapproval of the earlier case, without necessarily overruling it.&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC]]'' also disapproved [[Lord Denning]]'s controversial analysis of [[Negative and positive rights|rights and duties]] in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC]]'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris (International) Ltd|The Great Peace]]'' the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] disapproved ''[[Solle v Butcher]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Per incuriam]]''''' - declaring the precedent to be mistaken, because the earlier court failed to take note of a crucial precedent or statute.&lt;ref&gt;Lower courts, afraid of seeming impertinent or [[lèse-majesté|worse]], are disinclined to declare a precedent from a higher court to be ''per incuriam''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' 1884 is arguably ''per incuriam'' for ignoring ''[[Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson ]]'' is arguably ''per incuriam'' for ignoring ''[[Derry v Peek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Distinguishing]]''' -	failing to follow a case because of a material distinction of fact.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Distinguishing#Examples|Read v Lyons]]'' 1947, the court distinguished ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' on the basis that there had been "no escape" in the current case.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In both ''[[Balfour v Balfour]]'' (1919) and ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' (1971) a wife claimed against her husband for alleged breach of contract. In ''Balfour'' her claim failed for lack of intention to create legal relations; but in ''Merritt'', ''Balfour'' was distinguished and it was held the spouses had intended to be bound.[http://www.lawmentor.co.uk/glossary/D/distinguishing/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open content''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[David A. Wiley|David Wiley]] in 1998&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News|accessdate = 2010-01-12| date = 18 July 1998| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 19 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes a [[creative work]] that others can copy or modify freely, [[Permission culture|without asking for permission]]. The term evokes the related concept of [[open-source software]].&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2012-04-17| year = 1998| url = http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990128224600/http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archivedate = 28 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[content (media)|content]] is said to be under an '''open licence'''.

== History ==
Originally, the Open content [[concept]] was invented by Michael Stutz, who in 1994 wrote the paper "[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonsoftware-copyleft.en.html Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information]" for the GNU Project. The "Open Content" term was later evangelized via the ''[[Open Content Project]]'' by [[David A. Wiley]] in 1998, and described works licensed under the [[Open Content License]] (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt;

It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The [[openness]] of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opencontent.org/definition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[free content]] and content under [[Open-source license|open-source licenses]], there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.

Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to [[copyright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdip.net/publications/fosseprimers/foss-opencontent-nocover.pdf |title=Lawrence Liang, "Free/Open Source Software Open Content", '&amp;#39;Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme: e-Primers on Free/Open Source Software'&amp;#39;, United Nations Development Programme – Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, 2007. |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, similarly as [[copyleft]] which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.

In 2003 Wiley announced that the Open Content Project has been succeeded by [[Creative Commons]] and their [[Creative commons license|licenses]], where he joined as "Director of Educational Licenses".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed. And that's just fine.] on opencontent.org (30 June 2003, archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030806102812/http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3733 Creative Commons Welcomes David Wiley as Educational Use License Project Lead] by matt (23 June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Creative Commons]]' successor project was the ''[[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomdefined.org/index.php?title=Definition&amp;action=history |title=Revision history of "Definition" – Definition of Free Cultural Works |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[free content]], put forth by [[Erik Möller]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Richard Stallman]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[Benjamin Mako Hill]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Angela Beesley,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomdefined.org/History |title=History – Definition of Free Cultural Works |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The ''Definition of Free Cultural Works'' is used by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy |title=Resolution:Licensing policy |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike [[Creative Commons licenses]] were marked as "Approved for Free Cultural Works" among other licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 |title=Approved for Free Cultural Works |publisher=Creative Commons |date=24 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OK LOGO COLOUR RGB.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open Knowledge]] Foundation]]
Another successor project is the ''[[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'' (''OKF''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.timdavies.org.uk/2014/04/12/data-information-knowledge-and-power-exploring-open-knowledges-new-core-purpose/|title = Data, information, knowledge and power – exploring Open Knowledge's new core purpose |first = Tim|last = Davies|date = 12 April 2014|work = Tim's Blog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Rufus Pollock]] in [[Cambridge]], UK in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.okfn.org/2004/05/24/open-knowledge-foundation-launched/|title = Open Knowledge Foundation launched|work = Open Knowledge Foundation Weblog|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Open Knowledge: About|url = https://okfn.org/about/|website = okfn.org|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] gave an ''Open Knowledge Definition'' for ''"Content such as music, films, books; Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; Government and other administrative information"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070818100846/http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0 version 1.0] on opendefinition.org (archived 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 with version 2.0 ''Open Works'' and ''Open Licenses'' were defined and "open" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the [[Open Source Definition]], the [[Free Software Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct difference is the focus given to the [[public domain]] and that it focuses also on the accessibility ("[[open access]]") and the readability ("[[open format]]s"). Among several conformant licenses, six are recommended, three own (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL), Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY), [[Open Data Commons Open Database License]] (ODbL)) and the [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]] creative commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefintion.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2014/10/07/open-definition-2-0-released/ Open Definition 2.0 released] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.rog (7 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Open content" definition ==

The OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'.&lt;ref name="OpenContent19990128"/&gt; However, such a definition would exclude the [[Open Content License]] (OPL) because that license forbade charging 'a fee for the [OpenContent] itself', a right required by free and open-source software licenses.{{citation needed|reason=The FOSS licences require a right to charge a fee for creating or delivering a copy, not a right to charge for the content itself|date=March 2015}}

The term since shifted in meaning. OpenContent ''"is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities."''&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;

The 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
#Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
#Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
#Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
#Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for [[open educational resources]], which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.&lt;ref name="oer-review"&gt;{{Cite conference | publisher = The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last = Atkins | first = Daniel E. | author2 = John Seely Brown | author3 = Allen L. Hammond | title = A Review of the Open Educational Resources (OER) Movement: Achievements, Challenges, and New Opportunities | location = Menlo Park, CA | date = February 2007 | accessdate = 2010-12-03 | page = 4 | url = http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67UwoyzbR?url=http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf | archivedate = 8 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first = Guntram|last= Geser |title= Open Educational Practices and Resources.

The later ''[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]'' by the Open Knowledge Foundation (now known as [[Open Knowledge International]]) define [[open knowledge]] with open content and [[open data]] as sub-elements and draws heavily on the [[Open Source Definition]]; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content,&lt;ref name="Open Definition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Open Definition| work = OpenDefinition.org| accessdate = 2011-11-18| url = http://opendefinition.org/okd/}}&lt;/ref&gt; unifying both.

==Open access==
[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open access]] logo, originally designed by [[Public Library of Science]]]]
"[[Open access]]" refers to toll-free or [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]] access to content, mainly published originally [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] scholarly journals. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution ("libre open access"), which would qualify them as open content.

==Open content and education==
{{further|Open Education Resources}}
[[File:Global_Open_Educational_Resources_Logo.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
[[File:Ocaheader.jpg|thumb|[[Open Content Alliance]] logo]]
Over the past decade, open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing.&lt;ref name="Tuition Inflation" &gt;{{cite web
| last = Kantrowitz| first = Mark| title = Tuition Inflation| work = FinAid.org| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://www.finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation.phtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is "focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content."&lt;ref name="Horizon Report"&gt;{{cite web| last = NMC| first = | title = One Year or Less: Open Content| work = 2010 Horizon Report| accessdate = 2012-04-18| year = 2012| url = http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120303/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/open-content/| archivedate = 16 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including [[OpenCourseWare| OpenCourseWare Initiative]], [[The Saylor Foundation]] and [[Khan Academy]]. Some universities, like [[MIT]], [[Yale]], and [[Tufts]] are making their courses freely available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum.&lt;ref name="funny monkey" /&gt; There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks. Some of these organizations and projects include The University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library, [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]], [[OpenStax College]], The Saylor Foundation Open Textbook Challenge and [[Wikibooks]]

==Licenses==

According to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.'&lt;ref name="OpenContentDefinition" /&gt;

However, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to [[libre content]], any [[free content]] license, defined by the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]], would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">'''Orvietan''' or ''orviétan'' was a medical concoction popular during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was used as a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]] against poisonings with criminal intent, as well as against [[mushroom poisoning]]s, [[snakebite]], [[scorpion]] stings, bites by [[rabid]] animals, and the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

== Origins ==
[[Gerolamo Ferranti]] started producing and selling ''orviétan'' in early 17th-century [[Paris]]. He was a fairground attraction, asking onlookers to give him unknown poisons to swallow and watch him cure himself with the remedy. Other [[charlatan]]s in the business were Jean Vitrario, Desiderio Descombes, and Cristoforo Contugi. Though most physicians and pharmacists were skeptical, the reputed medical doctor [[Johann Schröder (physician)|Johann Schröder]] published his own recipe in ''Pharmacopeia Medico-Chymica'' in 1655. The first pharmacist to include ''orviétan'' in his compendium was [[Moyse Charas]] in ''Pharmacopée Royale Galénique et Chymique'', 1676.

== Ingredients ==
Orvietan was a concoction of partially toxic herbs, wine, and dissolved honey, but existed in powdered form too (sold in lead boxes). Patrizia Catellani and Renzo Console analyzed 35 different recipes for mixing ''orvietan'', published between 1655 and 1857. The number of ingredients varies from 9 to 57. The most frequent 26 ingredients are: [[garden angelica]], [[Aconitum anthora|healing wolfsbane]], [[birthwort]], [[bistort]], [[sweet flag]], [[Carline thistle]], [[Dittany (disambiguation)|dittany]], [[gentian]], [[masterwort]], [[black salsify]], [[tormentil]], [[Valerian (plant)|valerian]], [[blessed thistle]], [[dittany of Crete]], [[rue]], [[germander]], [[Bay laurel|laurel berries]], [[Juniper|juniper berries]], [[cinnamon]], [[cloves]], [[viperidae|viper meat]], and the two concoctions [[mithridate]] and [[theriac]], as well as [[white wine]] and [[honey]].

== Literary references ==
Literary works mentioning orvietan include:
* [[Tabarin]]'s ''Inventaire Universel des Œuvres de Tabarin'' (1622), 
* [[Molière]]'s ''L'Amour médecin'' (1665),

* [[Francis Parkman]], in his ''La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West'' (1869), notes the explorer [[Louis Hennepin]]'s devotion to the use of orvietan, "the famous panacea of his time", as an antidote to the toxic effects of various plants eaten while a captive of the [[Sioux]] in 1680
* La Salle's [[Tonty]] also used orvietan as he noted in ''Relation of Henri de Tonty Concerning the Explorations of La Salle from 1678 to 1683'', Melvin B. Anderson, translator.

The '''Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism''' (also known as the '''Prague Declaration'''), which was signed on 3 June 2008, was a declaration initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by prominent European politicians, former political prisoners and historians, among them former Czech President [[Václav Havel]] and future German President [[Joachim Gauck]], which called for "Europe-wide condemnation of, and education about, the crimes of communism."&lt;ref name="RFE-RL"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/interview_how_much_does_west_know_about_communist_crimes/24358883.html |title= How Much Do Western Europeans Know About Communist Crimes? |author= Charles Recknagel |date= 13 October 2011 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/6595himxu?url=http://www.rferl.org/content/interview_how_much_does_west_know_about_communist_crimes/24358883.html | archivedate = 2 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="declaration-text"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/media/article.php?article=3849 |title= Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism |author=  |date= 3 June 2008 |work=  |publisher= [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/64otCtAyz?url=http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/media/article.php?article=3849 |archivedate= 20 January 2012 |accessdate= 2012-01-20 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the most visible proposal set forth by the declaration was the adoption of the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]] (known as the International Black Ribbon Day in some countries), adopted by the [[European Union]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], as the official international remembrance day for victims of [[totalitarian]] regimes. On 14 October 2011, the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], an EU educational project to raise awareness about totalitarian crimes and to combat intolerance, [[extremism]], and anti-democratic movements, was established by the governments of the [[Visegrád Group]] and a number of European government institutions and NGOs, as an initiative of the Polish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU presidency]] and following decisions by the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]] supporting the project.

==Conference==
The declaration concluded the conference European Conscience and Communism, an international conference that took place at the [[Czech Senate]] from 2 to 3 June 2008, hosted by the [[Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions (Czech Republic)|Senate Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions]], under the auspices of [[Alexandr Vondra]], Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic for European Affairs, and organised by [[Jana Hybášková]] MEP and Senator [[Martin Mejstřík]] in co-operation with the [[Government of the Czech Republic|Office of the Government of the Czech Republic]], the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] and the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]]'s [[Robert Schuman Foundation (European People's Party)|Robert Schuman Foundation]].

The conference on European Conscience and Communism received letters of support from president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (France), Lady [[Margaret Thatcher]] (UK), Secretary of State [[Jason Kenney]] (Canada) and former National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] (United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/media/article.php?article=3850 |title= Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism – Press Release |author=  |date= 9 June 2008 |work=  |publisher= [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5yf4HFF6d?url=http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/media/article.php?article=3850 |archivedate= 13 May 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-10 |quote=  |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Declaration==
The declaration was preceded by the [[European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes]]. The declaration is part of a wider process at the European and international level, aimed at reaching similar objectives to those stated in the declaration.&lt;ref name="RFE-RL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MeetingREH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group|url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/meeting-of-the-reconciliation-of-european-histories-group-3/#more-417|publisher=[[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]]|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meike-Wulf"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wulf |first1=Meike |editor1-first=Mihail |editor1-last=Neamtu |title=History of Communism in Europe |volume=1 |year=2011 |publisher=Zeta Books |location=Bucharest |pages=243–265 |chapter=Politics of History in Estonia: Changing Memory Regimes 1987–2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the declaration is the call for an "all-European understanding that [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes]] [...] should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century." The declaration or its proposals have received support from the [[European Parliament]], notably in its [[European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism|2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism]], from other bodies of the [[European Union]], from the governments of multiple European countries affected by communist [[totalitarian]] rule and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation, and from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].

The declaration called for:&lt;ref name="declaration-text" /&gt;
# "reaching an all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes each need to be judged by their own terrible merits to be destructive in their policies of systematically applying extreme forms of terror, suppressing all civic and human liberties, starting aggressive wars and, as an inseparable part of their ideologies,  exterminating and deporting whole nations and groups of population; and that as such they should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century"
# "recognition that many crimes committed in the name of Communism should be assessed as crimes against humanity serving as a warning for future generations, in the same way Nazi crimes were assessed by the Nuremberg Tribunal"
# "formulation of a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia [[Communist regime]]s, and raising a Europe-wide awareness of the Communist crimes to clearly define a common attitude towards the crimes of the Communist regimes"
# "introduction of legislation that would enable courts of law to judge and sentence perpetrators of Communist crimes and to compensate victims of Communism"
# "ensuring the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination of victims of all the totalitarian regimes"
# "European and international pressure for effective condemnation of the past Communist crimes and for efficient fight against ongoing Communist crimes"
# "recognition of Communism as an integral and horrific part of Europe's common history"
# "acceptance of pan-European responsibility for crimes committed by Communism"
# "establishment of 23 August, the day of signing of the Hitler-Stalin Pact, known as the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], as a day of remembrance of the victims of both Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes, in the same way Europe remembers the victims of the Holocaust on 27 January"
# "responsible attitudes of National Parliaments as regards acknowledgement of Communist crimes as crimes against humanity, leading to the appropriate legislation, and to the parliamentary monitoring of such legislation"
# "effective public debate about the commercial and political misuse of Communist symbols"
# "continuation of the European Commission hearings regarding victims of totalitarian regimes, with a view to the compilation of a Commission communication"
# "establishment in European states, which had been ruled by totalitarian Communist regimes, of committees composed of independent experts with the task of collecting and assessing information on violations of human rights under totalitarian Communist regime at national level with a view to collaborating closely with a Council of Europe committee of experts"
# "ensuring a clear international legal framework regarding a free and unrestricted access to the Archives containing the information on the crimes of Communism"
# "establishment of an Institute of European Memory and Conscience"
# "organising of an international conference on the crimes committed by totalitarian Communist regimes with the participation of representatives of governments, parliamentarians, academics, experts and NGOs, with the results to be largely publicised world-wide"
# "adjustment and overhaul of European history textbooks so that children could learn and be warned about Communism and its crimes in the same way as they have been taught to assess the Nazi crimes"
# "the all-European extensive and thorough debate of Communist history and legacy"
# "joint commemoration of next year's 20th anniversary of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|massacre in Tiananmen Square]] and the killings in Romania"

The Declaration cites [[Council of Europe resolution 1481]] as well as "resolutions on Communist crimes adopted by a number of national parliaments."&lt;ref name="declaration-text" /&gt; The Declaration was preceded by the [[European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes]].

===2008===

The [[European Parliament]] proclaimed the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]] on 23 September 2008 with the support of 409 MEPs from all political factions&lt;ref name="EP-Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0439+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title= Declaration of the European Parliament on the proclamation of 23 August as European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Europa.eu]] |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for its implementation by the member states in its 2009 [[European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism|resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism]] (adopted 533–44 with 33 abstentions), which also called for the establishment of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]]. Co-sponsored by the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]], [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]], and the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]], the resolution called for the recognition of "Communism, Nazism and fascism as a shared legacy" and "an honest and thorough debate on all the totalitarian crimes of the past century," reconfirmed "its united stand against all totalitarian rule from whatever ideological background," and condemned "strongly and unequivocally all crimes against humanity and the massive human rights violations committed by all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes."&lt;ref name="EP-Resolution"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0213+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title= European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Europa.eu]] |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2008, [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] hosted a public hearing in the European Parliament on "Totalitarian Regimes and the opening of the secret files archives in Central and Eastern Europe," based on the Prague Declaration, and organised by MEPs [[Milan Horáček]] and [[Gisela Kallenbach]].

Similar proposals to those of the Prague Declaration received support in the [[European Parliament]], which adopted a [[European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism|2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism]].

On 25 April 2009, the [[European Democrat Students]] adopted a resolution, stating that "we, the European Democrat Students, support the Prague Declaration to its full extent and take on the integration of the content to our general policy." The organisation stated that "communism as a totalitarian regime [...] can only distinct itself from Fascism and Nazism by a more recent expiry date and the consequent damage over time it was able to cause."&lt;ref name=EuropeanDemocrats&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion on Prague declaration on European conscience and communism.

On 28 April 2009, the governments of [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] were thanked by the President of the European Parliament, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], for their efforts to better inform western Europe on the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union. Pöttering brought up [[The Origins of Totalitarianism|the classic study on totalitarianism]] by [[Hannah Arendt]], which developed "the scientific basis criteria to describe totalitarianism," concluding that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible," Pöttering said.&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title= Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism – EP chairman in Vilnius |author=  |date= 28 April 2009 |work=  |publisher= BNS |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5yf88YFCY?url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate= 14 May 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-10 |quote=  |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2009, the EU [[General Affairs Council]] adopted conclusions stating that, "in order to strengthen European awareness of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes, the memory of Europe's troubled past must be preserved, as reconciliation would be difficult without remembrance."&lt;ref name="EUReport20102014" /&gt;

On 3 July 2009 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] issued the [[Vilnius Declaration]] which, among other resolutions on several issues, contained a "Resolution on Divided Europe Reunited: Promoting Human Rights and Civil Liberties in the OSCE Region in the 21st Century" and supported the designation of 23 August as a [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oscepa.org/images/stories/documents/activities/1.Annual%20Session/2009_Vilnius/Final_Vilnius_Declaration_ENG.pdf |title= Vilnius Declaration of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and resolutions adopted at the eighteenth annual session |author= |date= 3 July 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCEPA) |accessdate= 2011-05-14 | quote= }}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Daul]], chairman of the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party group]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2009 is a deeply symbolic year, since we celebrate both the 60th anniversary of the creation of NATO and the beginnings of the cold war, and the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which ended it. This is why we have proposed to launch a Europe-wide day of remembrance which will help Europe reconcile its totalitarian legacy, both from the Nazis and the Communists.&lt;ref name="neurope-daul"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neurope.eu/articles/93920.php |title= A day to condemn Communism |author= |date= 6 April 2009 |work= |publisher= [[New Europe (newspaper)|New Europe]] | archiveurl  =https://www.webcitation.org/5ymbQkAU4?url=http://www.neurope.eu/articles/93920.php | archivedate =18 May 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-16 | quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the European Parliament, an all-party group of MEPs named [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]] was established. Its objective is to "reconcile the different historical narratives in Europe and to consolidate them into a united European memory of the past." It is chaired by former EU Commissioner [[Sandra Kalniete]]. Its members also include [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], [[László Tőkés]], [[Heidi Hautala]], and [[Gunnar Hökmark]].&lt;ref name="EUReport20102014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/pdf/com(2010)_873_1_en_act_part1_v61.pdf |title= Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council: The memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe |author= |date= 22 December 2010 |work= |publisher= [[European Commission]] |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="REH-about"&gt;{{cite web|title= About Us |url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=[[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64ouBTQwq?url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/about/|accessdate=1 August 2011|archivedate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2010, the [[Declaration on Crimes of Communism]] was adopted, concluding the international conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes, which was organised by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] and the [[Government of the Czech Republic]] in co-operation with the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]], and the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], under the patronage of [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]], [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]], and [[Heidi Hautala]] ([[The Greens–European Free Alliance|Greens]]), Chair of the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights|Human Rights Subcommittee of the European Parliament]], among others. The 2010 declaration reiterated many of the suggestions of the Prague Declaration, stating that "the justice done to perpetrators of Communist crimes over the past 20 years has been extremely unsatisfactory" and calling for "the creation of a new international court with a seat within the EU for the crimes of communism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html |title= Declaration on Crimes of Communism |author= |work= |publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] | archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5yfNE22gE?url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html | archivedate = 14 May 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-14 | quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union's [[Stockholm Programme]] states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Union is an area of shared values, values which are incompatible with crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, including crimes committed by totalitarian regimes. Each Member State has its own approach to this issue but, in the interests of reconciliation, the memory of those crimes must be a collective memory, shared and promoted, where possible, by us all.&lt;ref name="StockholmProgramme"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:115:0001:0038:EN:PDF |title= The Stockholm Programme—An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens |author=  |date= 2010-05-04 |work=  |publisher= [[Official Journal of the European Union]] C 115/8 |archiveurl= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111010175237/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:115:0001:0038:en:PDF |archivedate= 10 October 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-17 |dead-url= yes |quote=  |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the [[European Union]] officially observed the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]] in 2010, the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was described by the [[European Parliament]]'s President [[Jerzy Buzek]] as "the collusion of the two worst forms of totalitarianism in the history of humanity."&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title= President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[European Parliament]] | archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html | archivedate = 13 May 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2011, the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], an EU educational project to raise awareness about [[totalitarian]] crimes and to combat intolerance, [[extremism]], and anti-democratic movements, was established by the governments of the [[Visegrád Group]] and a number of European government institutions and NGOs, as an initiative of the Polish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU presidency]] and following decisions by the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|EU Council]] supporting the project.&lt;ref name="REH3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform of European Memory and Conscience to be established in Prague on 13–14 October 2011 as a parallel event of the summit of the Prime ministers|url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/platform-of-european-memory-and-conscience-to-be-established-in-prague-on-13-14-october-2011-as-a-parallel-event-of-the-summit-of-the-prime-ministers/|publisher=Reconciliation of European Histories Group|accessdate=30 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012164141/http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/platform-of-european-memory-and-conscience-to-be-established-in-prague-on-13-14-october-2011-as-a-parallel-event-of-the-summit-of-the-prime-ministers/|archivedate=12 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platform14October2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/platform-of-european-memory-and-conscience-to-be-established-in-prague |title= Platform of European Memory and Conscience to be established in Prague during the summit of the Prime ministers of the Visegrád Group |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] | archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/62BRvP3nW?url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/platform-of-european-memory-and-conscience-to-be-established-in-prague | archivedate = 4 October 2011 |accessdate= 30 September 2011 | quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing together government institutions and organisations from EU countries active in research, documentation, awareness raising and education about the crimes of totalitarian regimes, the platform's member institutions include the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]], the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], the [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial]], the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]], and other institutions.

===2012===
In February 2012, the sixth Mene Tekel international culture festival against totalitarianism, evil and violence took place in Prague, supported by the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]]. A 2012 declaration asking the former communist states to pass legislation enabling the just punishment of communist criminals and scrapping all advantages they may still enjoy was passed, and signed by 17 Czech NGOs as well as NGOs from Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.&lt;ref name="praguemonitor2012"&gt;[http://praguemonitor.com/2012/02/15/prague-hosts-6th-intl-festival-against-totalitarianism Prague hosts 6th int'l festival against totalitarianism], ''[[Prague Daily Monitor]]'', 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/65vKpRQ0A?url=http://praguemonitor.com/2012/02/15/prague-hosts-6th-intl-festival-against-totalitarianism --&gt;

On 5 June 2012, the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], the [[European Network Remembrance and Solidarity]], and the [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]] hosted the conference Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes in the [[European Parliament]], under the auspices of [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] and [[Jerzy Buzek]], devoted to the issue of forming a special court tribunal for the crimes of communism,&lt;ref name="praguemonitor2012"/&gt; and "raising the issue of justice for the most serious crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe from the national to a European level." The conference was a response "to growing calls for strengthened international justice formulated e.g., in the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2009/05/15/conference-programme/|title=Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes – conference programme - Platform of European Memory and Conscience|website=www.memoryandconscience.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/june-5th-conference-in-the-ep-legal-settlement-of-communist-crimes/|title=Materials from the Conference "Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes"|date=22 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conference, the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]] founded an international legal expert group to "work on a road map for establishing a supranational institution of justice" devoted to the "crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2012/06/07/platform-will-seek-establishment-of-a-supranational-court-for-international-crimes-committed-by-communists/ Platform will seek establishment of a supranational court for international crimes committed by Communists], [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], 7 June 2012&lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/68IkJKd72?url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2012/06/07/platform-will-seek-establishment-of-a-supranational-court-for-international-crimes-committed-by-communists/ --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2012, during a ceremony in the [[House of Terror]] museum and in the Hungarian Parliament commemorating the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Totalitarianism in Budapest, opened by the Hungarian President [[János Áder]], and attended by the Ministers or State Secretaries of Justice from several European countries, an agreement on the creation of a European museum of totalitarianism was signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2012/08/23/european-day-of-remembrance-of-victims-of-totalitarianism-commemorated-in-budapest/ European Day of Remembrance of Victims of Totalitarianism commemorated in Budapest], [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], 23 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14–15 May 2013, the EU [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], the Polish state [[Institute of National Remembrance]], the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] and the Czech state [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] hosted the conference "Modern Forms of Commemoration of Totalitarian Genocide Places" in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2013/05/09/conference-modern-forms-of-commemoration-of-totalitarian-genocide-places-on-14-15-may-in-warsaw/ Conference "Modern Forms of Commemoration of Totalitarian Genocide Places" on 14-15 May in Warsaw], [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]], May 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Since it was signed in 2008, the Prague Declaration has been opposed by various groups. ''[[The Economist]]'' states: "It has attracted support in bodies such as the [[European Parliament]]. But it has infuriated some, if not all, Jewish activists; left-wing politicians (mostly from western Europe); and inevitably, Russia."&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Old wounds: Clashing versions of Lithuania's history and how to treat it|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18114903 |publisher= The Economist |accessdate=16 May 2011|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Russia protested against the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]'s support for the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]]; its delegation tried but failed to have [[Vilnius Declaration|the resolution]] withdrawn.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8133749.stm Resolution on Stalin riles Russia]. [[BBC]]. 3 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Several representatives of the Russia-based organisation [[World Without Nazism]] have criticised the Prague Declaration. The organisation's founder and chairman, [[Boris Spiegel]], claimed that the Prague Declaration is supported by "supporters of the Nazis," and accused the countries that were formerly part of the [[Communist Bloc]] (except Russia and Belarus) of "rapid nazification." In response to the Prague Declaration's condemnation of Stalinism, he criticised the role of Western European democracies in starting WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rusembassy.nl/index.php/en/component/content/article/122-wwn-statement |title= Statement by the "World without Nazism" movement |author=[[Boris Spiegel]] |date= 22 November 2011 |work= |publisher= [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Embassy of Russia in the Netherlands]]|archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/65CZKcFDU?url=http://www.rusembassy.nl/index.php/en/component/content/article/122-wwn-statement | archivedate = 4 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Efraim Zuroff]] of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] has criticised the Prague Declaration repeatedly, describing it as "the main manifesto of the false equivalency movement."&lt;ref name="Zuroff"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/141355 |title= Lithuania Has Not Changed |author=[[Efraim Zuroff]] |date= 2010-12-26 |work= |publisher= [[Israel National News]] |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Rubin]] argues that "it is in the interest of Jews and Israelis to support the Prague Declaration which seeks to discuss, expose and recognize Communist crimes of war in the same way Nazi crimes were." Rubin criticises "a tiny group of people" of waging "a relentless campaign" against the declaration, and "[making] Jews the defenders of the Communist totalitarian system that murdered and tortured millions of people, including hundreds of thousands of Jews."&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=184542 |title= Those who neglect their past have no future |author=[[Barry Rubin]] |date= 13 August 2010 |work= |publisher= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate= 2011-05-16 | quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Efraim Zuroff]] responded: "The opposition to the Prague Declaration has never been based on a desire to hide communist crimes, nor do we oppose any initiative to honor and commemorate their victims or punish those guilty of committing those crimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zuroff|first=Efraim|title=Right of Reply: A threat to Holocaust memory|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=186060|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Šarūnas Liekis]], a Yiddish studies professor from Vilnius, criticised the actions of both sides of the debate, stating that "we are squeezed between two Talibans" and suggesting that "the same obstinacy that plagues Lithuania's relations with Poland lies behind politicians' refusal to reverse their mistakes on Jewish issues."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

[[Soviet and Communist studies|Post-communist studies]] scholar [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] argues that the Prague Declaration and the Vilnius Declaration "…can be seen as the fulfillment of the second stage of postcommunist development in the region […] both documents condemn the atrocities of the last century and resolve to proceed on a path of democracy and tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tismăneanu |first= Vladimir | authorlink= Vladimir Tismăneanu |year= 2010 |title= Citizenship Restored |journal= [[Journal of Democracy]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages= 128–135 |publisher= |doi= 10.1353/jod.0.0139 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">The '''Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005''' (S. 1313) is a [[United States]] bill "[t]o protect [[home]]s, small [[business]]es, and other [[private property]] [[rights]], by limiting the power of [[eminent domain]]."  The bill was introduced on June 27, 2005, to the first session of the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]].

This bill was introduced to counter the controversial [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in the case of ''[[Kelo v. New London]]'', which expanded the power of [[U.S. state|states]] to use eminent domain to confiscate homes, businesses, and private property for "economic development", rather than just "public use".

This [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was sponsored by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Cornyn]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Texas]].

== Status ==
* On June 27, 2005, this bill was referred to the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Judiciary|Senate Committee on the Judiciary]].

==Complaints about this bill==
Some claim that, although this bill may have the right idea, it lacks the means to enforce itself.  One organization, [[Downsize DC Foundation|DownsizeDC.org, Inc.]], has proposed an [https://web.archive.org/web/20060617201844/http://action.downsizedc.org/background.php?cid=33 amendment]  to this bill, one which it says would give this bill "teeth", as it calls it, or in other words, a means of enforcement.

Followers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as '''Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments''', and have called them frivolous and vexatious.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; There is no recorded instance of such tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include [[freemen on the land]] and the [[sovereign citizen movement]]. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]].

Also under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the [[redemption movement]] believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim money from this fund. See [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the "legal name fraud" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a [[personal name]] and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalgleish|first1=Katherine|title=Guns, border guards, and the Magna Carta: the Freemen-on-the-Land are back in Alberta courts|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=018e9df4-b9fe-4c88-9db9-d784f423348c|website=lexology.com|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=The mystery of the 'legal name fraud' billboards|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36499750|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name.

'''''R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 2)''''' was a case in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] concerning the removal of the [[Chagossians|Chagos Islanders]] and the exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]]. The [[Chagos Islands]], acquired by the United Kingdom in 1814, were reorganised as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) in 1965 for the purpose of removing its inhabitants. Under a 1971 [[Order in Council]], the Chagossians were forcibly removed, and the central island of [[Diego Garcia]] leased to the [[United States]] for use as a military outpost.

In 2000, [[Louis Olivier Bancoult|Olivier Bancoult]] brought a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] claim against the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' on the grounds that the ordinance was ''[[ultra vires]]'' ("beyond power" - that is, that the ordinance had been made without legal authority), a claim upheld by both the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. In response, [[Robin Cook]], the Foreign Secretary, repealed the 1971 Order in Council and announced he would not appeal against the decision, allowing the Chagossians to return home.

In 2004, a second Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again reinstating the off-limits nature of the Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ''ultra vires'' and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated [[legitimate expectation]] by passing the second Order after giving the impression that the Chagossians were free to return home.

The new Order was again struck down by the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before proceeding to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]], [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Rodger]], [[Robert Carswell, Baron Carswell|Carswell]] and [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Mance]] between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.

The reaction to the decision was negative,&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; with academics accusing the majority Law Lords of failing to do their job as members of the judiciary to "rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law";&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; at the same time, their approach to legitimate expectation was also questioned, with the case described as an "unfortunate regression" from ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'', where judges were willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

In 2015 Bancoult went to court to argue that the judgement should be set aside due to the non-disclosure of a 2002 feasibility study relating to the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Islands. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled against reviewing the case on 29 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2015-0021.html|title=R (on the application of Bancoult (No 2)) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Respondent) - The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Chagos Islands===
[[File:Diegogarcia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Diego Garcia]], now the site of an important US armed forces base.]]
The [[Chagos Islands]] are a cluster of 60 islands and seven [[atolls]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. First occupied by lepers from [[Mauritius]], France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;Poole (2010) p.149&lt;/ref&gt; who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery (2006) p.229&lt;/ref&gt; Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.

In 1965, the British government reconstituted the islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) through the British Indian Ocean Territory Order 1965, a [[statutory instrument]] under the [[Colonial Boundaries Act 1895]]. This instrument created the office of "Commissioner of BIOT", who given power to "make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory". Accordingly, the Commissioner issued the Immigration Ordinance 1971, an Order in Council under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]] which required anyone entering or remaining in BIOT to seek permission beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott (2009) p.697&lt;/ref&gt;

This ordinance, with the reorganisation of the islands, was enacted to provide a method for removing the [[Chagossian|Chagos Islanders]] so that the islands could be used by the [[United States]] as a military base, particularly the island of [[Diego Garcia]]. From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US for military purposes, and by an [[exchange of notes]] dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base. This agreement was to last for 50 years, with an additional 20-year extension if neither party wished to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Allen  (2007) p.443&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1967 and 1972 all 1,600 islanders were evacuated,&lt;ref&gt;Sand (2009) p.317&lt;/ref&gt; and Diego Garcia continues to play a vital role in US military operations.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn (2009) p.264&lt;/ref&gt; Following a billion-dollar expansion program, the base has served as a "bomber forward operating location" for offensive operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (2009) p.318&lt;/ref&gt; A US State Department letter dated 21 June 2000 described it as an "all but indispensable platform".&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel (2006) p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bancoult (No 1)===
{{main|R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 1)}}
In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, a native Chagossian and leader of the Chagos Refugees Group,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery (2006) p.230&lt;/ref&gt; brought a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] claim against the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' on the grounds that the ordinance was ''[[ultra vires]]'' and failed the ''[[Wednesbury unreasonableness|Wednesbury]]'' test of reasonableness, as it was irrational.

The case, ''R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', went to the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]], where it was heard by judges [[Richard Gibbs (judge)|Richard Gibbs]] and [[John Laws (judge)|John Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;McBride p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Bancoult's argument was made on several grounds: firstly, that the Crown could not exclude a British citizen from British territory, except in times of war, without a valid statutory basis or prerogative power. Secondly, the Chagossians had a constitutional right to inhabit their land under the [[Magna Carta]], one which could not be abridged with delegated legislation, and third, the Commissioner of BIOT's duty to legislate "for the peace, order and good government" of BIOT's inhabitants could not be said to be fulfilled by relocating those inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

The respondent, the [[Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office]] (FCO), argued that the English courts had no jurisdiction over the case, since the Crown is divisible amongst its territories, and the BIOT had its own courts. According to the FCO, Magna Carta, as a British constitutional document, was inapplicable to the Chagos Islands. They also maintained that "make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory" gave the Commissioner a wide enough jurisdiction to account for the order forcibly removing the Chagossians, and that the court could not decide in such a way as to force the government to break its treaty with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divisional Court gave its judgment on 3 November 2000, on three main issues: firstly, the court's right to hear the case, secondly, the Chagossians' constitutional right of residence and, thirdly, the status of the Commissioner's actions. The court found that it did have discretion to hear the case: while the Crown was divisible, the actions of the BIOT were clearly the actions of the British government, since every BIOT action was ordered and dealt with by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. Laws J found that the Magna Carta did apply to foreign nations, as it was "the nearest approach to an irreplaceable 'fundamental statute' that England has ever had... For in brief it means this, that the King is and shall be below the law". This did not alone validate Bancoult's case, since it did not mean that the government's actions were illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

The final section of the judgment was on the legality of the Commissioner's 1971 ordinance. Laws J held that it was "elementary" that "a legislature created by a measure passed by a body which is legally prior to it must act within the confines of the power thereby conferred"; in this case that the Commissioner's jurisdiction was to legislate "for the peace, order and good government" of BIOT. While the latitude given to the Commissioner was wide, it "may be a very large tapestry, but every tapestry has a border".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (2001) p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that in the 1971 ordinance, the Commissioner had exceeded his authority, and the ordinance was made ''ultra vires''. Therefore, the ordinance was quashed.&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
{{Wikisource|British Indian Ocean Territory Constitution Order 2004}}
In response to the Divisional Court's decision, Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] stated on 3 November 2000 that he would accept the ruling, issuing the Immigration Ordinance 2000 which repealed the 1971 ordinance in its entirety. Due to "security issues", the British government was only prepared to let the Chagossians return to the outer islands, which were lacking in basic amenities.  A "feasibility study" was conducted;  a preliminary study was produced on 20 June 2000&lt;!-- 2001? --&gt; and the full study was published on 10 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Nauvel p.111&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that:{{quotation|anything other than short-term resettlement on a purely subsistence basis would be highly precarious and would involve expensive underwriting by the UK Government for an open-ended period - probably permanently. Accordingly, the Government considers that there would be no purpose in commissioning any further study into the feasibility of resettlement; and that it would be impossible for the Government to promote or even permit resettlement to take place. After long and careful consideration we have therefore decided to legislate to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2008) p.685&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 1 June 2004, a second Order in Council was produced{{mdash}}the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004{{mdash}}Section 9 of which provided that "no person has the right of abode in the territory" and "no person is entitled to enter or be present in the territory except as authorised by or under this Order or any other law for the time being in force in the territory". At the same time, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Immigration) Order 2004 came into effect, prohibiting entry to or presence in BIOT without a permit. In response, Bancoult brought a second case, claiming that Cook's statement had created a [[legitimate expectation]] (later frustrated by the 2004 orders) and questioning the validity of the Constitution Order 2004, particularly the legality of Section 9.&lt;ref&gt;McBride p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The case first went to the Divisional Court, where [[Anthony Hooper (judge)|Hooper LJ]] and [[Peter Cresswell (judge)|Cresswell J]] decided in favour of Bancoult on 11 May 2006. The court found that the "interests of BIOT must be or must primarily be those whose right of abode and unrestricted right to enter and remain was being in effect removed", and that as Section 9 of the Constitutional Order did not serve the interests of it or its inhabitants, it was irrational. At the same time, the court was asked to rule on whether an Order in Council could be questioned in judicial review proceedings. It decided that, under ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'', the decisive element was not the origin of the power (in this case, the Royal Prerogative) but the nature of the power. Accordingly, Orders in Council were subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2007) p.445&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], composed of [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss|Butler-Sloss]], [[Stephen Sedley|Sedley]] and [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Neuberger]] LJJ, who agreed with the Divisional Court in their judgment issued on 23 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (2009) p.319&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
The case was then taken to the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lords [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]], [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Rodger]], [[Robert Carswell, Baron Carswell|Carswell]] and [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Mance]]. The pleadings occurred between 30 June and 3 July 2008, and judgment was issued on 22 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2008) p.684&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment covered two matters: firstly, whether the courts could subject Orders in Council to judicial review and, secondly, the legality of the 2004 Order. The Lords unanimously agreed that, while Orders in Council are pieces of primary legislation, similar to Acts of Parliament (which cannot be subject to judicial review), there is a significant difference in that Orders in Council are an executive product and lack the "representative character" that comes with Parliamentary authority and approval. Accordingly, the Lords saw "no reason why prerogative legislation should not be subject to review on ordinary principles of legality, rationality and procedural impropriety in the same way as any other executive action".&lt;ref&gt;Poole (2010) p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by a majority of 3 to 2, the Lords upheld the legality of the Constitutional Order, including Section 9. The majority{{mdash}}Lords Hoffmann, Rodger and Carswell{{mdash}}held that BIOT was a "conquered or ceded colony" and therefore was subject to the prerogative powers of the Crown. They rejected the principle that there was a constitutional right to reside in one's own country, calling it "extreme", and concluded that in any case no such right could not trump legislation such as an Order in Council.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (2009) p.320&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "peace, order and good government", they thought, should be understood as referring not just to the inhabitants of BIOT but to the governance of the region. The wording was to be treated "as apt to confer plenary lawmaking authority" and reviewing the Order was a matter for the government and Parliament, not for the courts, since it was a political issue of national security and foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;Poole (2010) p.151&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, no legitimate expectation had been created following ''Bancoult (No 1)''. The standard requirement for legitimate expectation, as decided in ''[[R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan|R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan]]'', was that there must be a "clear and unambiguous" promise made that led to a reliance or a detriment; Robin Cook's statement after the first Bancoult case could not be described as a clear and unambiguous promise of resettlement, and the requirements of reliance and detriment were not met.&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;

Lords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, took the view that the Order in Council was unreasonable and therefore invalid. Bingham noted that the proper way to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was to look at how it had been exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to "exile an indigenous population from its homeland".  He argued that this prerogative power did not exist: "[t]he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it".&lt;ref&gt;McBride p.192&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Order was ''ultra vires''. Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be "construed according to the ordinary meaning that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed"; Bingham saw the ordinary meaning as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.&lt;ref name=mc&gt;McBride p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
''Bancoult'' was the first case to directly state that, where there is a legitimate expectation, the information must have been relied upon, leading to a detriment. In prior cases it was simply an additional element, and not explicitly required. At the same time, ''Bancoult'' raised questions about the oversight of Orders in Council, given that it highlighted the courts are unwilling to review a piece of executive legislation where there are political elements in play. The decision also raised "the classic problem of balancing human rights issues and concerns relating to security and defence".&lt;ref&gt;McBride p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

The public and academic reaction to the decision was negative.&lt;ref name=p1 /&gt; Thomas Poole considered that the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] had failed in their duty as members of the judiciary: "where old principles no longer fit contemporary constitutional and moral standards, why should we follow them? Surely the judicial task is to rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law".&lt;ref name=p1&gt;Poole (2010) p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Margit Cohn agreed, writing on the legitimate expectation issue that "It is difficult to accept that a public statement made by a Secretary of State, followed by the promulgation of an order that removed the previous prohibition to return, could not have created at least some sort of expectation".&lt;ref&gt;Cohn (2009) p.265&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn further described the case as an "unfortunate regression" from the [[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|GCHQ case]], where judges had been willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Cohn (2009) p.266&lt;/ref&gt;  T.T. Arvind went further, drawing parallels with the judicial response to the [[Zong Massacre]] to argue that the decision, despite its formalist rhetoric, was in reality a pragmatic one which abandoned centuries of settled constitutional jurisprudence in relation to the limited scope of the Royal Prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">Under the [[law of the United Kingdom]], [[whales]] and [[sturgeon]]s are '''royal fish''', and when taken become the [[personal property]] of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the United Kingdom]] as part of his or her [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].

==In England and Wales==
According to [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', the "superior excellence" of whale and sturgeon made them uniquely suited for the monarch's use.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', book I, ch. 8 "Of the King's Revenue", ss. X, p. *280&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]] added [[porpoise]] as one of the royal fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hale ''De Jure Maris'' c.7&lt;/ref&gt; Near the English coast they belong to the monarch immediately upon being caught, while ownership is also transferred to the monarch when a catch from any location is cast up on the shores.  The kings of [[Denmark]] and the [[duke of Normandy|dukes of Normandy]] enjoyed a similar prerogative.

The monarch's right to royal fish was recognized by a statute enacted during the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].&lt;ref&gt;17 Edw. II c. 11, ''De prærogativa regis''.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Henry de Bracton]], ''de balena vero sufficit ... si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam'': "the king owns the head of the whale, the queen owns the tail".&lt;ref&gt;Bracton, ''[http://140.247.226.46/bracton/Unframed/Latin/v2/340.htm De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliæ]'', book 3. c. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Herman Melville]] quoted the speculations of jurist [[William Prynne]], that the queen received the tail, in order to be supplied with whalebone for her [[corset]]s and stays&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Melville]], ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', ch. [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 90|XC]].&lt;/ref&gt; (although as Melville points out, "whalebone" is in fact [[baleen]], from the ''mouths'' of [[Baleen whales|certain whales]]).  

Under current law, the [[Receiver of Wreck]] is the official appointed to take possession of royal fish when they arrive on [[England|English]] shores. The law of royal fish continues to excite some notice and occasional controversy, as evidenced when a fisherman caught and sold a sturgeon in [[Swansea Bay]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3773171.stm Police inquiry over sturgeon sale], June 3, 2004, accessed Oct. 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

KC Caviar, established in [[Yorkshire]] in 2012, has permission granted by the Queen allowing the company to farm the royal sturgeon fish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/26/yorkshire-fish-first-ethical-sturgeon-kc-caviar  Frances Perraudin, "Yorkshire fish-lovers set up first ethical sturgeon caviar firm", ''The Guardian'', 26 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Scotland==
In [[Scotland]], the monarch's property right inheres in those whales too large to be pulled to land by a "wain pulled by six oxen"; in practice, this is interpreted as requiring the whales to be over 25 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1221/0052925.pdf ''Royal Fish: Guidance in Dealing with Stranded Royal Fish]&lt;/ref&gt; Authority to collect them on behalf of the monarch is given to the [[Scottish Government Marine Directorate]].

==In Ireland==
In Ireland the  [[English Crown]],   which held  the [[Lordship of Ireland]], also claimed the prerogative of taking royal fish,  which extended to porpoises and [[dolphin]]s. There is  a record of a dispute between the Crown and [[Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth]]  in about 1440 over the  ownership of an exceptionally large  [[grampus (genus)|grampus]] ([[Risso's Dolphin]]) which had been  stranded on Howth peninsula in [[Dublin Bay]].  The Crown claimed  it as a royal fish, while  Lord Howth claimed it  on foot of the immemorial right of his family to  take possession of every grampus and [[porpoise]] found on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' Vol.5 1917:Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10694">The '''rulings of the Constitutional Court of Thailand''' have, since the Court's establishment in 1998, had an important impact on Thai politics and jurisprudence.  Major rulings having included the 1999 ruling that Deputy Minister of Agriculture Newin Chidchop could retain his Cabinet seat after being sentenced to imprisonment for defamation, the 2001 acquittal of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] for filing an incomplete statement with the National Counter-Corruption Committee, the 2003 invalidation of [[Jaruvan Maintaka]] appointment as Auditor-General, and the 2006 invalidation of the nationwide results of a [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|House election]].

==Chuan-government emergency decrees during the 1997 economic crisis==

===Unconstitutionality of emergency economic decrees===
In its very first decision, the Court ruled on the constitutionality of four emergency
executive decrees issued by the [[Chuan Leekpai|Chuan]] government to deal with the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;James R. Klein, "The Battle for Rule of Law in Thailand: The Constitutional Court of Thailand", [http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf PDF] and {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320070648/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf |date=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government had issued the decrees in early May 1998 to expand the role of the [[Financial Restructuring Authority, Thailand|Financial Restructuring Authority]] and the [[Assets Management Corporation, Thailand|Assets Management Corporation]], to settle the debts of the [[Financial Institutions Development Fund]] through the issue of 500 billion THB in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and to authorize the Ministry of Finance to seek 200 billion THB in overseas loans. The opposition [[New Aspiration Party]] (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the Constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.

The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional
clause.  The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions
under Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was
obvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were
designed to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.

The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will
be invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning
of Parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.

On the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.

== Thaksin Shinawatra and the allegation of hiding assets and stocks ==
After the sounding victory of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s party, [[Thai Rak Thai]], in 2001 election, the Anti-Corruption Committee filed a case charging him as hiding a handful of assets in form of stocks, which is unlawful due to the 1997 Constitution. According to Thai law, senior government officials are required to declare their assets, along with those of their spouses and children under the age of 20, to the NCCC when they start and finish their terms in office. However Thaksin could escape the guilty as the judges ruled 8 to 7. Thaksin said it was his 'honest mistake'.

===Treaty status of IMF letters of intent===
The NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the [[National Counter Corruption Commission, Thailand|National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC)]] against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and the Minister of Finance [[Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda]] for violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The NAP argued that the [[letter of intent]] that the government signed with the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] to secure emergency financial support was a [[treaty]], and that Article 224 of the Constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty.

The NCCC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty.  Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not [[contractual agreement]]s.

==Appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General==
On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its ruling on the constitutionality of [[Jaruvan Maintaka|Jaruvan Maintaka's]] appointment by the Senate as Auditor-General.  Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes.  However, on July 3, 2001, the SAC Chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.

The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as Auditor-General was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p3.php Chronology of events in the auditor-general’s deadlock, The Nation August 30, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] chairman [[Sirin Thoopklam|Sirin Thoopklam's]] election to the body was unconstitutional, the President of the Court noted "When the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post".&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php "Jaruvan again in eye of the storm"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004821/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php |date=2007-03-12 }}, 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted ""I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163322/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p26.php Jaruvan waits for royal word, Nation September 09, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, for the post of Auditor-General. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan, The Nation, 11 October, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2006 The State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate Auditor-General Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the Office of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|Bhumibol Adulyadej's]] Principal Private Secretary, advising that the situation be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145651/http://bangkokpost.net/News/05May2006_news01.php Poll booths 'the decider', Bangkok Post Friday May 05, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy led many to [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal powers|reinterpret the political and judicial role of the King in Thailand's constitutional monarchy]].

==Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest==
In February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the Prime Minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, [http://english.people.com.cn/200607/29/eng20060729_287811.html Students submit voters petition to impeach Thai PM], 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senators said the Prime Minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.

== History ==
[[File:Schengen Agreement place.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Schengen, Luxembourg]]]]
The free movement of persons was a core part of the original [[Treaty of Rome]] and, from the early days of the [[European Economic Community]], nationals of EEC member states could travel freely from one member state to another on production of their passports or national identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive on administrative practices and procedures concerning settlement, employment and residence in a Member State of the Community of workers and their families from another Member State ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31961L1513:EN:NOT OJ 80, 13 December 1961, p. 1513].)&lt;/ref&gt; However, systematic identity controls were still in place at the border between most member states.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Disagreement between member states led to an impasse on the abolition of border controls within the Community, but in 1985 five of the then ten member states, [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[West Germany]], signed an agreement on the gradual abolition of common border controls. The agreement was signed on the river-boat ''Princess Marie-Astrid'' on the river [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] near the town of [[Schengen, Luxembourg]],&lt;ref name ="BBCWorld"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Oana|last1=Lungescu|title=Fortress Europe|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/theneweurope/wk22.htm|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the territories of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Three of the signatories [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]] had already abolished common border controls as part of the [[Benelux|Benelux Economic Union]].{{cn|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Schengen Area participation.svg|thumb|{{legend|#0088cc|EU member states participating}} {{legend|#ffff00|EU member states not participating but obliged to join}} {{legend|#ff6666|EU member states with an opt-out}} {{legend|#7CFC00|non-EU member states participating}} {{legend|#FFA500|non-EU member states de facto participating}} {{legend|#4B0082|non-EU member states with an open border}}]]

The Schengen Agreement was signed independently of the [[European Union]], in part owing to the lack of consensus amongst [[Member states of the European Union|EU member states]] over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Craig|first1=Paul|last2=Gráinne de Burca|title=EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials|edition=3rd|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-924943-1|page=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no [[enhanced co-operation]] mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.&lt;ref name="Schengen Agreement"&gt;Respectively Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:42000A0922%2801%29:EN:NOT Schengen Agreement], eur-lex.europa.eu; accessed 27 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a [[Visa policy in the European Union|common visa policy]]. It was this Convention that created the [[Schengen Area]] through the complete abolition of border controls between Schengen member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

The Schengen Agreement along with its implementing Convention was implemented in 1995 only for some signatories, but just over two years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Schengen Agreement. It was during those negotiations, which led to the [[Amsterdam Treaty]], that the incorporation of the ''Schengen acquis''&lt;ref&gt;The complete acquis, including the fundamental Agreement and Convention and some subsequent acts and instruments brought about meanwhile in its legal framework, had been published here: {{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2000/l_239/l_23920000922en00010473.pdf|title=Official Journal of the European Communities – The Schengen Acquis|date=22 September 2000|accessdate=25 November 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area.{{cn|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Ponteminho4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A simple [[traffic sign|sign]] marks the border between [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]]]

In December 1996 two non-EU member states [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]] signed an association agreement with the signatories of the Schengen Agreement to become part of the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;Article 140 of the Schengen Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Switzerland]] finalised its official entry to the Schengen Area with the acceptance of an association agreement by [[popular referendum]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Allen M. (March 2009). [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/switzerland_schengen/Switzerlands_Schengen_entry_finally_complete.html?cid=653802 Switzerland's Schengen entry finally complete]. swissinfo.ch; retrieved 14 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the Schengen Agreement is part of the ''[[acquis communautaire]]'', the Agreement has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended according to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure of the EU]] under [[Treaties of the European Union|EU treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;At first the [[Council of the European Union]], later the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union]] in the [[codecision procedure]], took the place of the Executive Committee that had been created under the agreement; [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2004/l_396/l_39620041231en00450046.pdf Council Decision of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing some or all of the former Schengen acquis.&lt;ref&gt;Example: By article 39 subsection 1 of the Schengen Borders Code, Articles 2 to 8 of the Schengen Agreement had been repealed – {{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_105/l_10520060413en00010032.pdf|title=Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)|date=13 April 2006|accessdate=25 November 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the legislative bodies of the [[European Union]]. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

This led to the result that non-EU Schengen member states have few formally binding options to influence the shaping and evolution of Schengen rules; their options are effectively reduced to agreeing, or withdrawing from the agreement. However, consultations with affected countries are conducted prior to the adoption of particular new legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schengen area and cooperation|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33020_en.htm|work=Summaries of EU legislation|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=4 April 2013|quote=In practice, this involvement takes the form of mixed committees that meet alongside the working parties of the EU Council. They comprise representatives of the Member States' governments, the Commission and the governments of third countries. Associated countries therefore participate in discussions on the development of the Schengen acquis,but do not take part in voting. Procedures for notifying and accepting future measures or acts have been laid down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Rhodesia}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Southern Rhodesia]], then a constituent territory of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], on 26 July 1961. The new constitution was approved by about 66% of those who voted; turnout was 77%. Registered voters at the time were mostly white because of the qualified franchise, under which only those who met certain financial, educational and property standards were eligible to vote.&lt;ref name=wood92&gt;{{cite book

==Background==
Following three years of negotiations with the Southern Rhodesian government and other parties, the British government had put forward a draft constitution on 13 June 1961. It provided for a parliamentary system, with a 65-seat parliament;&lt;ref name=blake335&gt;{{cite book

There were 50 "A"-roll constituencies and 15 larger "B"-roll districts, with a complicated mechanism of "cross-voting" allowing "B"-roll voters to slightly influence "A"-roll elections and ''vice versa''. This system was theoretically non-racial, but in practice the "A" roll was largely white and the "B" roll was almost all black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Unofficial National Democratic Party referendum==
In protest against the official referendum, the black nationalist [[National Democratic Party (Southern Rhodesia)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP) ran its own poll, professedly based on "[[one man, one vote]]", on 23 July. This was peacefully operated, but reportedly amateur and potentially biased in its execution, garnering criticism from British officials, rival nationalists and other observers amidst its virtually unanimous rejection of the constitution. The British High Commission commented that voters in the NDP referendum appeared to be subject to intimidation by the NDP officials running the exercise, and that the votes did not seem to be secret. The rival Zimbabwe National Party called the NDP poll "phoney" and said it was designed "to hoodwink the African people".&lt;ref name=wood90/&gt; There were many cases of people posting multiple ballots: two whites told the press they had voted twice and one black man proudly announced that he had done so 11 times.&lt;ref name=wood90/&gt; After the government released the results of the official referendum, the NDP announced that their poll had garnered 467,189 votes against the constitution, and only 584 in favour—a reported majority of about 99.9% against.&lt;ref name=wood90&gt;{{Harvnb

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">The '''Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification''' (or '''IPC'''), also known as the '''IPC Agreement''', was signed in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]], on March 24, 1971 and entered into force on October 7, 1975. It establishes a common classification for [[patent]]s for [[invention]], [[inventors' certificate]]s, [[utility model]]s and [[utility certificate]]s, known as the "[[International Patent Classification]]" (IPC).&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the Agreement&lt;/ref&gt; The Agreement was amended on September 28, 1979.

States that are parties to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (1883) may become party to the Strasbourg Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12(1) of the Agreement&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2013, there are 62 contracting parties to the Strasbourg Agreement.&lt;ref name="wipo contracting parties"&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&amp;treaty_id=11 ''Contracting Parties  &gt; Strasbourg Agreement (Total Contracting Parties : 62)''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12496">'''Tribal-State Compacts''' are declared necessary for any Class III gaming on reservations under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988]] (IGRA).  They were designed to allow tribal and state governments to come to a "business" agreement.  A compact can be thought of as "negotiated agreement between two political entities that resolves questions of overlapping jurisdictional responsibilities&lt;ref&gt;Witmer, Corntassel. Forced Federalism: Contemporary Challenges to Indigenous Nationhood. Volume 3 of American Indian Law and Policy Series. University of Oklahoma Press, 2006 (110-111).&lt;/ref&gt; Compacts affect the delicate power balance between states, federal, and tribal governments.  It is these forms that have been a major source of controversy surrounding Indian gaming.   Thus, it is understandable that the IGRA provides very detailed instructions for how states and tribes can make compacts cooperatively and also details the instructions for how the federal government can regulate such agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, David M. Legalized Gambling. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2006 (235).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The IGRA of 1988 and Tribal-State Compacts==
Section 3A of the Act includes specific instructions for the process of developing a tribal-state compact.  Tribes(Native Americans) are expected to request a compact with states if they should desire to have Class III gaming. (States have no jurisdiction over Class I and II gambling.)  Following such a request, states are required to enter negotiations and deal with the tribes in "good faith".  The original text of the act implied that if states tried to "stone-wall" tribal gambling, the tribes could look to the federal courts for support.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, David M. Legalized Gambling. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2006. (44-45)&lt;/ref&gt; But while the IGRA gives states unprecedented influence on tribal economic concerns, it also seeks to maintain the federal government as the "guardian" of the tribes. Accordingly, section 3B maintains the power of the federal government in this aspect. No compact will be valid until the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] has entered the compact into the Federal registry. Also, tribes who feel that a state is not negotiating in "good faith" have the right to sue the states in federal court.
 
The topics that compacts may cover include provisions relating to criminal/civil laws of the tribe or state in relation to the gambling activity, the allocation of court jurisdiction  between the State and Indian tribe necessary to enforce these laws, money the State should receive to defray the costs of regulating the gambling, and any other such subjects directly related to the operation of gaming activities.  It also specifies that Indian tribe shall have the right to regulate gaming concurrently with the state, unless some aspect of the compact is broken.

The IGRA takes specific notice of the fact that the text is not "conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions the authority to impose any taxes, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe.  This reference indicates that the Congress realized it was not following the norm of tribal governments operating independently of states.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, David M. Legalized Gambling. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2006. (235-237)&lt;/ref&gt;

The compacts between states and tribes have caused a great deal of controversy and the original definition of Tribal-State Compacts has been redefined by several court cases and congressional acts.  This section will address the more prominent actions that have refined the methods of establishing Tribal-State compacts.

==Balance between federal, state, and tribal government==
Indian gambling has been the source and focus of a great deal of controversy.  Part of the reason for this is the ambiguity that surrounds  [[tribal sovereignty]] in the legal sense.

===Brief history of tribal sovereignty and the law===
Much of the current understanding of tribal sovereignty can be traced back to [[John Marshall]] and his decisions.  American government has long operated under the legacy of ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated strongly that the history of relations with Indians had established the understanding that tribes were "distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Canby, William C. ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul, MN: West, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, tribes were still subject to federal regulation and laws.  As Marshall had already confirmed in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' where he labeled tribes as having a ward relationship to the "guardian" national government.&lt;ref name="Canby, William C 2004"&gt;Canby, William C. American Indian Law in a Nutshell. St. Paul, MN: West, 2004. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
These decisions occurred quite some time ago, but have shaped much of the modern dealings with tribal sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, William C. American Indian Law in a Nutshell. St. Paul, MN: West, 2004. 18&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some exceptions made to allowing states some impact on tribes (such as [[Public Law 280]] and crimes committed by a non-Indian to a non-Indian on tribal land), but for the most part have restricted states from interfering.  When states are allowed to regulate tribal activity, there are strict guidelines to be met.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, William C. American Indian Law in a Nutshell. St. Paul, MN: West, 2004. (88-89)&lt;/ref&gt; On the part of federal action, the assumption is that tribes have the inherent right to govern themselves unless federal action specifically prevents an action.&lt;ref name="Canby, William C 2004"/&gt;

===Indian gambling and tribal sovereignty===
The first major case to address Indian gambling and state regulation was ''[[California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]'' in 1987.  In this case, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that California did not have the right to regulate gaming unless there were criminal prohibitions against gaming in the state.  Furthermore, the case set the precedent of only allowing state regulation of the tribes rarely and with federal preemption only.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In denying the states the right to regulate tribal gambling, the court had essentially forced the task on to Congress.  Thus, the emergence of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act came on October 17, 1988.  The act itself was an attempt to provide regulation while maintaining tribal sovereignty.  The only "sticky" problem had to do with [[casino]]-style gambling.  Because casino-style gambling is a "cash business" (relative to bingo) there were many{{Who|date=July 2010}} who were concerned that it would attract crime (organized and otherwise).  In fact, this was perhaps one of the main concerns on part of the states who were lobbying the federal government for some right to regulate gaming because of the chance of such infiltration.  The tribal-state compacts came about as a compromise in concern for the casino-style gambling (Class III).&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005 (44-46)&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribal-state compacts were seen as a necessary and fair political compromise by Congress, but in reality by incorporating these compacts, the IGRA seems to be illustrating a contemporary move towards [[devolution]] in some experts' opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Witmer, Corntassel. Forced Federalism: Contemporary Challenges to Indigenous Nationhood. Volume 3 of American Indian Law and Policy Series. University of Oklahoma Press,2006.(17)&lt;/ref&gt;  Compacts do require that tribes cede some jurisdictional powers to state governments.  Some{{Who|date=July 2010}} may view the IGRA as a means of respecting tribal sovereignty, but in placing the necessity of compacts, the IGRA is actually establishing limitations on the authority of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005. (6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the original legislation of the IGRA, Congress did try to maintain the tribal sovereignty.  The act created a mechanism to limit state's ability to take advantage of the tribes by allowing tribes to sue states who did not operate in "good faith".  If the federal court found that states did not negotiate in good faith, it could then require that a compact be agreed upon within 60 days.  If after this time had passed, the interior secretary would be assigned the task of drafting a compact- which may would most likely be a disadvantage to the states.  This ability together with the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior approve all gaming compacts worked to ensure federal oversight of any state regulation- which should have softened the blow of tribal state compacts on sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005 (48-49)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, however, ''[[Seminole Tribe v. Florida]]'' upset the tribal-state balance that Congress had intended under the IGRA.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Kelly B.. "Current Issues in Indian Gaming: Casino Lands and Gaming Compacts." Gaming Law Review 7, Number 5(2003): 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case ultimately denied tribes the right to sue states based on the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (which grants states [[sovereign immunity]]).  Furthermore, the case ruled that Congress had overstepped its authority in drafting the IGRA.  ''Seminole Tribe'', then, acted to remove Congress's limited protection for tribes and removed any mechanisms for enforcing the "good-faith" clause.  Experts have noted that in drafting the IGRA, Congress sought to protect the tribes, but in passing the decision in this case, the Court ignored this intention and allowed the balance of power shift in favor of the states.&lt;ref name="Rausch, Chris 2007"&gt;Rausch, Chris. "The Problem with Good Faith: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act a Decade after Seminole." Gaming Law Review 11, Number 4(2007): 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compacts in the wake of ''Seminole''===
The ''Seminole'' case greatly expanded the state power over tribal gaming.  In denying tribes the right to bring suit against states, the Court did not halt the compact process, but it did destroy the only remedial scheme devised by
Congress for compelling states to negotiate in good faith with their tribal counterparts.&lt;ref name="Rausch, Chris 2007"/&gt; Congress had already recognized that without any way to enforce the "good faith" of states, states could simply refuse to negotiate compacts and the tribes would essentially lose its right to conduct gaming.  The Court, however, did not seem concerned with this particular consequence to its decision.  After the case, some states refused to negotiate, but even more demanded concessions from the tribes (sharing gaming profits among other demands).  In some states, tribes had to give up [[treaty rights]] to gain receive a chance to get a compact.  In [[Wisconsin]], for instance, [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] Tommy Thompson sought to include tribes' rights to [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] treaty rights as issues for [[negotiations]].  Some states have an attempted to bring about [[revenue sharing]], though there are strict regulations under the IGRA for this.&lt;ref&gt;Light, Steven Andrew, and Kathyryn R.L. Rand. Indian Gaming and Tribal Sovereignty: The Casino Compromise. University Press of Kansas, 2005.56-59&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had attempted to uphold these restrictions, such as in ''In re Indian Gaming Related Cases''  the court held that a state could not violate IGRA’s prohibition against the imposition of taxes and should negotiate rather than impose.  However, once again in lieu of Seminole, tribes have no means by which to negotiate.  Tribal gambling under the law is a dynamic issue that is still contested and there are many proposals for ways to fix the "gap" that the ''Seminole'' case left in the IGRA.&lt;ref name="Rausch, Chris 2007"/&gt;

The '''United States Army Corrections Command''' (ACC) exercises [[command and control]] and operational oversight for policy, programming, resourcing, and support of [[Army Corrections System]] (ACS) facilities and [[Table of Distribution and Allowances|TDA]] elements worldwide.

On order, ACC coordinates the execution of condemned military prisoners.

==History==
Prior to its establishment in 2007, prisons operated under the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|U.S. Army Training and Doctrine
Command]], [[United States Army Forces Command|U.S. Army Forces Command]], [[U.S. Army Europe]], and [[U.S. Forces Korea]].&lt;ref name="wood.army.mil"&gt;[http://www.wood.army.mil/MPBULLETIN/pdfs/Fall%2008/Watson-Vanguards.pdf Vanguards of Justice: The Activation of the Army Corrections Command]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2007, the US Army Corrections Command (ACC) was established as a Field Operating Agency (FOA) under the Operational Control of the [[United States Army Provost Marshal General]], [[Department of the Army]]. It is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref name="wood.army.mil"/&gt;

The Army Corrections Command exercises command and control, operational oversight, and support of the ACS. ACS facilities are located at the following installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Fort Lewis]], [[Coleman Barracks]] [[USAREUR]], and [[Camp Humphreys]] [[USFK]].

The [[Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)]] (ASA) (M&amp;RA) exercises [[Army Secretary]] oversight for Army Corrections, parole and clemency functions.

ACC will standardize, eliminate command layers and streamline corrections operations across the Army.

[[File:BrokenHillWomensMemorial.JPG|right|thumb|250px|''The [[Broken Hill Women's Memorial]], dedicated to "the women of Broken Hill who have stood by their men during troubled industrial times".'']]
The '''Women's Brigade''' was a labour protest organisation for women formed during the first of several strikes to occur in the mining town of [[Broken Hill]], NSW, Australia between 1889-1920.&lt;ref name="bhs"&gt;http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE4102b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precedents===
As early as 1874, Australian women were engaging in direct action in mining disputes in Australia. During the 1874 strikes at the Wallaroo and Moonta mines in South Australia, women entered the mines armed with brooms, forced the men out and closed down the engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=7344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SCENE AT THE WALLAROO STRIKE. (20 April 1874). ''[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]]'' (Sydney, NSW : 1850-1875), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60986910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN AT MOONTA. (28 April 1874). ''[[Launceston Examiner]]'' (Tas. : 1842-1899), p. 3. Retrieved 16 April 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52892684&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Meeting===
The notice for the first meeting read:&lt;ref name="rhb"&gt;Kearns, R.H.B, 1982.Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p154.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of Broken Hill Women are very anxious to do something towards supporting the men now out on strike and a meeting for women only will be held at the Masonic Hotel tonight, at 7:30. The president will be the chair. Mr T.C. Tait, the proprietor of the Masonic Hotel, has kindly given the use of his new hall, erected at the site of the hotel, for the use of the women's brigade. All matrons and maids who are in sympathy with the union are requested to attend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conditions==
According to Unbroken Spirit, 'Poor living conditions and negligent managerial policy on the mines at Broken Hill fed into a strong union presence from the very early days'.&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" &gt;Unions and Politics, Unbroken Spirit, Australian Women's Archives Project, 2009, http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhib/bh/unionspol.html&lt;/ref&gt; Women and children found life in the mining town harsh, yet fought alongside the miners in favour of the union goals despite the hardship prolonged strikes caused to family welfare.&lt;ref name="bhs" /&gt;

According to Carroll (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, B. 1986 Built on Silver: a history of Broken Hill South, Hill of Content Publishing Company, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-85572-1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blainey (1968)&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. 1968. The Rise of Broken Hill, Macmillan of Australia, Victoria, p61.&lt;/ref&gt; there was particular concern in the town regarding [[lead poisoning]] from the mine dust. Due to a long delay in developing the technical process for extracting value from the low-lying ores that were mined at Broken Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;ft high hills of toxic tailings were created about the mines and left without processing until the opening of the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[BHP Steelworks]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Christopher. 1999, A Future More Prosperous: The History of Newcastle Steelworks 1912-1999, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Newcastle, pp42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

===1889===

Broken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers.

By the time of the arrival of BHP directors from Melbourne on 13 November, the Women's Brigade had set up as 'sentinels'&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt; in order to catch any non-union labour, including shift bosses who were 'tarred and whitewashed' the following day while the 2500 miners met to negotiate the dispute with the directors.&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE.

A small number of men were injured by the Women's Brigade on 14 November. As a result of this [[Richard Sleath]] on behalf of the union distanced himself from their actions while mentioning the resolve of the women who had a week's worth of provisions and that they intended to remain on picket for the week. An appeal was made for the miners to use their influence with the women to calm their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;THE BROKEN HILL STRIKE. (14 November 1889).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The brigade now numbers 400 members, many of whom took part in the famous sweeping affair at the [[Moonta]] and [[Wallaroo]] mines 15 years ago. Two hundred women spent the night in the mines and two of them have been locked up for trespassing.&lt;ref name="advertiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1892===

The Women's Brigade was very active in using direct action methods against the imported contract labour during the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]].&lt;ref name="Unbroken Spirit: Women in Broken Hill - Unions &amp; Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R.J. 1988. The Richest Lode:Broken Hill 1883-1988, Hale &amp; Iremonger Pty Limited, Sydney, p241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloodworth (1996), there were daily mass rallies and the Barrier United Females' Strike Protest Committee was formed in the initial weeks. The 500-strong Brigade passed a resolution to join the 24 August union demonstration but this was later abandoned in favour of a women's rally on the 25th.&lt;ref name="bloodworth"&gt;Bloodworth, S. (1996) The Rebel Women of Broken Hill in ''Militant Spirits'', La Trobe University, Melbourne. retrieved at http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/rebelwomen/militant.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent suffragette, [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]] publicly supported the women of Broken Hill claiming 'that the women of Broken Hill are the first great body of working women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring injustice that ''the present constitution will not allow them a voice in framing the laws''...' and that this rendered the [[1892 Broken Hill miners' strike]] 'more profoundly interesting' than any before.&lt;ref name="bloodworth" /&gt;

===1919-1920===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The womenfolk that evening at least got some of their own back, for wherever a 'cop' was observed during the march, he either received a 'back-hander' from a woman on passing or was spat upon. This happened not once, but hundreds of times during that memorable tramp through the city's streets. And, under the circumstances, show to me the workingman that did not, and does not, applaud such acts, and I will show you a creature who lives but to creep and to cringe, and knows but little of the history of his class, or the damnable actions of its historic enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, G in Kearns, R.H.B, 1982. Broken Hill, A Pictorial History, Broken Hill Historical Society, Broken Hill, NSW, p160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
