The '''animal tithe''' ({{lang-he-n|מַעְשַׂר בְּהֵמָה}}, "Ma'sar&lt;!--NOT "Ma'asar"; – apostrophe for “עְ”. The ע is silent – it has a Shva, not a Patach. See for example מַעְשַׂר בָּקָר וָצֹאן (2 Chronicles Chapter 31 דִּבְרֵי הַיָּמִים ב)--&gt; Behemah")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seadict.com/en/he/cattle%20tithe Seadict.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Mitzvah|commandment]] in the [[Torah]] requiring the sanctifying a [[tithe]] of [[kosher]] grazing animals (cattle, sheep, and goats) to God, to be sacrificed as a ''[[Korban]]'' at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

The tithe of animals was not redeemable; and if one animal was exchanged for another both became sanctified. The method of levying the tithe of animals is indicated: they were counted singly; and every tenth one that passed under the rod became the tithe animal ([[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Lv|27:32-33|HE}}).&lt;ref name="JewEnc"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=TITHE|author1=J. M. Sel.|author2=W. B. M. Sel.|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14408-tithe|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rabbis inferred from [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Dt|14:22|HE}} that each tithe was to be taken of every year's produce separately, whether of crops, of cattle, or of anything else subject to tithing (''[[Sifre]]'', Deut. 105; ''[[Terumot]]'' i. 5;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:משנה תרומות א ה|משנה תרומות א ה]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]]'' 8a,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ראש השנה ח א|ראש השנה ח א]] (in Hebrew/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]])&lt;/ref&gt; 12b&lt;ref&gt;[[s:he:ראש השנה יב ב|ראש השנה יב ב]] (in Hebrew/Aramaic)&lt;/ref&gt;). Also they fixed a particular day to mark the beginning of the year for tithing. The new year's day for the tithing of animals ([[Rosh Hashanah LaBehema|Rosh Hashanah L'Ma'sar Behemah]]) is the first of [[Elul]] according to [[Rabbi Meir]], or the first of [[Tishrei]] according to [[Eleazar ben Shammua|Rabbi Eleazar]] and [[Simeon bar Yochai|Rabbi Simeon]] (''Rosh Hashanah'' [[s:Mishnah/Seder Moed/Tractate Rosh Hashanah/Chapter 1/1|i. 1]]).&lt;ref name="JewEnc"/&gt;

The [[Chazal|Sages]] ordained that animals should not be tithed in the present era when the Temple is not standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1062899/jewish/Perek-6.htm|title=Mishneh Torah, Sefer Korbanot: Bechorot, Perek 6, Halacha 2|author=Maimonides|authorlink=Maimonides|access-date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''baseline''', as defined by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], is the line along the coast from which the seaward limits of a state's [[territorial sea]] and certain other [[Ocean|maritime]] zones of [[jurisdiction]] are measured, such as a state's [[exclusive economic zone]]. Normally, a sea baseline follows the [[mean low water spring|low-water line]] of a coastal state. When the coast is deeply indented, has fringing islands or is highly unstable, ''straight'' baselines may be used.

==Measurement of baseline==
[[File:Baselines chile.png|thumb|right|250px|Chilean Baseline]]
The following methods are used to measure a baseline under [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] 1982.

===Normal baseline===
Except where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Article 5 (UNCLOS 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reefs===
In the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing reefs,  the  baseline  for  measuring  the  breadth  of  the territorial  sea  is  the seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate symbol on charts officially recognized by the coastal State.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Article 6 (UNCLOS 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight baselines===
# In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
# Where  because  of  the  presence  of  a  delta  and  other  natural conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may be selected  along  the  furthest  seaward  extent  of  the  low-water  line  and, notwithstanding  subsequent  regression  of  the  low-water  line,  the  straight baselines  shall  remain  effective  until  changed  by  the  coastal  State  in accordance with this Convention.
# The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.
# Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from [[low-tide elevation]]s, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them or except in instances where the drawing of baselines  to  and  from  such  elevations  has received  general  international recognition.
# Where  the  method  of  straight  baselines  is  applicable  under paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic  interests  peculiar  to  the  region  concerned,  the  reality  and  the importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage.
# The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from the high seas or an exclusive economic zone.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Article 7 (UNCLOS 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contra proferentem''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "against [the] offeror"),&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]]|edition=9th|editor-last1=Garner|editor-first1=Bryan A.|editor-link1=Bryan A. Garner |first=Henry C. |last=Black |authorlink=Henry Campbell Black |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |year=2009 |type=Print. |isbn=0-314-19949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "interpretation against the draftsman", is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] of [[contract]]ual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or [[contractual term|term]] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording.&lt;ref name="r2d206"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Law Institute|title=Restatement (Second) of Contracts|year=1981|publisher=American Law Institute Publishers|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|volume=2|chapter=The Scope of Contractual Obligations|at=§ 206|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal [[bargaining power]], but is applicable to other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with [[insurance contract]]s and [[bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can.

Additionally, the rule reflects the court's inherent dislike of [[Standard form contract|standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts]] also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual [[consumer]]s, residential leases, etc.). The [[court]] perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, [[legal system]]s apply the doctrine of ''contra proferentem''; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party upon whom the contract was foisted.  Some courts when seeking a particular result will use ''contra proferentem'' to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and go so far as to interpret [[Contractual Term|terms]] of the contract in favor of the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} although this application is disfavored.

''Contra proferentem'' also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the [[contract]]. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position to, for example, avoid contractual forfeiture. This is a longstanding principle: see, for example, [[California Civil Code]] §1654 (“In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist"), which was enacted in 1872. Numerous other states have also codified the rule.

The principle has also been codified in international instruments such as the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles and the [[Principles of European Contract Law]].

'''Credit counseling''' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as '''Debt counselling''') is commonly a process that is used to help individual [[debtor]]s with [[debt settlement]] through education, [[Personal budget|budgeting]] and the use of a variety of tools with the goal to reduce and ultimately eliminate debt.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{cite web|last1=FTC (Federal Trade Commission)|title=For People on Debt Management Plans: A Must-Do List|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0045-debt-management-plans.pdf|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission (United States Government)|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit counseling is most often done by ''Credit counseling agencies'' that are empowered by contract to act on behalf of the debtor to negotiate with creditors to resolve debt that is beyond a debtor's ability to pay. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge at no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. Regulations on credit counseling and Credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; In the United States, individuals filing [[Chapter 13 bankruptcy]] are required to receive counseling.

==Overview==
In the United States, the [[National Foundation for Credit Counseling]] was established in 1951. The modern practice known as ‘‘credit counseling’’ was initiated by creditor banks and credit card companies during the mid-1960s to address the growing volume of personal bankruptcies.&lt;ref name=Subcommittee&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[United States Senate]]|title="Profiteering in a Non-Profit Industry: Abusive Practices in Credit Counseling" a report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs United States Senate.|url=https://active.nfcc.org/newsroom/presskit/files/PSI_Excerpts.pdf|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=April 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of [[home loans]], [[credit card debt]] and [[car finance|car loans]].&lt;ref name=Inc.&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albert-Deitch|first1=Cameron|title=Hey Big Spenders, Where the Biggest Debtors in America Call Home (Interactive)|url=http://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/state-by-state-consumer-debt-interactive.html|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Inc.|agency=Interactive by debtconsolidation.com|date=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit counseling includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay. In addition to education, a popular credit counseling option is the ‘‘[[Debt management plan]]’’ (‘‘DMP’’, known in the United Kingdom as the [[Individual voluntary arrangement]] or "IVA"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer’s unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer’s monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then ‘‘consolidated’’ into a single payment.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt;

Credit counselors can sometimes negotiate [[debt relief]], where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven. Another option is [[Debt consolidation]], in which one new loan replaces multiple [[unsecured credit]] debts. The [[Debt-snowball method]] is a budgeting approach that addresses debt systematically.

==Criticism==
Global criticism of credit counseling comes primarily from [[Predatory lending|predatory]] practices that take advantage of debtors that are already struggling.&lt;ref name=NYBar /&gt; These practices include failing to meet required standards, charging unlawful or unreasonable fees, failing to provide affordable solutions for consumers, and neglecting to make customers aware of free debt services available elsewhere.&lt;ref name=UKDebt /&gt;

==Regulations by country==
===United States===
In the United States, Credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]], the nation’s consumer protection agency, which can [[Lawsuit|sue]] companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services.&lt;ref name=FTC /&gt; Different states may regulate DMPs individually and [[State attorney general|Attorneys General]] are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud.&lt;ref name=NYBar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Civil Court Committee, Consumer Affairs COmmittee|first1=([[New York State Bar Association]])|title=Profiteering from Financial Distress: An Examination of the Debt Settlement Industry|url=http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/DebtSettlementWhitePaperCivilCtConsumerAffairsReportFINAL5.11.12.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two professional associations represent Credit counselors: the [[National Foundation for Credit Counseling]] and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Find a Good Credit Counseling Service|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/finance/good_credit_counselor.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct.&lt;ref name=UKDebt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Judith|title=UK debt management company Harrington Brooks to pay compensation|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0a2643dc-86bb-11e4-8a51-00144feabdc0|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=FT.com Financials|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Elsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non-regulation of Credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In [[Sweden]], guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the [[Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees|Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO)]] and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In [[Ireland]], the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions|Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)]] provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In [[Latvia]], a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees.&lt;ref name=Eurofound&gt;{{cite web|last1=DuBois|first1=Hans|title=Household debt advisory services in the European Union|url=http://eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_files/pubdocs/2011/89/en/1/EF1189EN.pdf|publisher=[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions|EUROFOUND]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Debt|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt.html|website=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; advises Canadians to do their research and find a trustworthy organization and a qualified counsellor. They suggest making sure an agency is in good standing with a provincial or national association. They recommend looking carefully at the agency's advertising to see if it sounds too good to be true. Claims or misrepresentations to look out for can include repaying only a fraction of your debt, quickly fixing your credit score, or claiming to be part of a government program. They also suggest consumers inquire about an agency's services, costs, and counsellor qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt/debt-help.html|title=Getting help from a credit counsellor|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCAC has also warns Canadians to be careful of companies offering to help them pay off their debt or repair their credit. Things to watch out for include guarantees to solve debt problems and using high interest loans to pay off debt. Some of these companies also claim that they can file a consumer proposal on behalf of a consumer. However, the FCAC points out that only a qualified licensed insolvency trustee can help someone with a consumer proposal or bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/debt/debt-help/alert-debt-credit-repair.html|title=Consumer Alert: What you need to know when getting help to pay off debt or repair your credit|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[National Credit Regulator]] (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The Act) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The NCR is also tasked with the registration of credit providers, credit bureau and debt counsellors; and with the enforcement of compliance with the Act. Debt Counselling was introduced and enforced in 2007. This enabled over-indebted consumers to seek relief in accordance to the National Credit Act.

[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Justinian I]], writer of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', which mentions a Roman process similar to the cy-pres doctrine]]
{{details|topic=this doctrine in different jurisdictions|Cy-pres doctrine}}
{{English trust law}}
The '''cy-pres doctrine''' in English law is an element of [[English trusts law|trusts law]] dealing with [[Charitable trusts in English law|charitable trusts]]. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the [[High Court of Justice]] or [[Charity Commission]] can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the [[trustee]]s (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the [[Norman French]] ''cy près comme possible'' (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in [[Roman law]], both in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' and later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] law.

Trusts where the doctrine is applicable are divided into two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, since there is no question of allowing the [[settlor]]'s next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a [[Resulting trusts in English law|resulting trust]]. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.

==Definition and origin==
The cy-près doctrine is the idea that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes as close as possible to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the [[trustee]]s, either to the [[High Court of Justice]] or the [[Charity Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007)p.240&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the [[Norman French]] ''cy près comme possible'' (as close as possible),&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2007) p.187&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the [[testator]]'s original goals.&lt;ref&gt;Garton (2007) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence suggests that the doctrine descends from [[Roman law]]. The ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' mentions a process that redirected money collected to celebrate a person's life in some way that violated law to a purpose within the law. It also gives a similar justification: "[I]t would be unjust that the amount which [the testator] has destined to that end should revert to the heirs. Therefore, let an investigation be made to ascertain how the trust may be employed so that the memory of the deceased may be preserved in some other and lawful manner." The [[Byzantine Empire]] used a system similar to cy-près when dealing with ''piae causae'', charitable corporations, whereby if the corporation fell its possessions were to be transferred to the Papal treasury and spent on a purpose as close as possible to that of the original corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Garton (2007) p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Prior to the [[Charities Act 1960]], situations where the cy-pres doctrine applied were limited to cases where the trust's purpose was either impossible or impracticable.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2007 p.241"&gt;Edwards (2007) p.241&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960 Act, however, provides in Section 13(1) (now part of the [[Charities Act 1993]]) that cy-près can apply where the original purposes have: {{quote|(a) been as far as may be fulfilled; or cannot be carried out, or not according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift; &lt;br&gt; (b) or where the original purposes provide a use for part only of the property available by virtue of the gift; &lt;br&gt; (c) where the property available by virtue of the gift and other property applicable for similar purposes can be more effectively used in conjunction, and to that end can suitably, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, be made applicable to common purposes; &lt;br&gt; (d) or where the original purposes were laid down by reference to an area which then was but has ceased to be a unit for some other purpose, or by reference to a class of persons or to an area which has for any reason since ceased to be suitable, regard being had to the spirit of the gift, or to be practical in administering the gift; &lt;br&gt; (e) or where the original purposes, in whole or in part, have since they were laid down been adequately provided for by other means; or ceased, as being useless or harmful to the community or for other reasons, to be in law charitable; or ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regarding being had to the spirit of the gift.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2007 p.241"/&gt;}}
This definition was amended by the [[Charities Act 2006]] to replace "the spirit of the gift" with "the appropriate considerations," which are defined as "(on the one hand) the spirit of the gift concerned, and (on the other) the social and economic circumstances prevailing at the time of the proposed alteration of the original purposes".&lt;ref name=ed242&gt;Edwards (2007) p.242&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of extremely small charitable trusts (where the charity has an income of less than £5,000 and holds no land) the trustees may agree by a two-thirds majority to transfer the property to another charity, without involving the High Court or Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.249&lt;/ref&gt; This is contained in Sections 74-5 of the 1993 Act. Once the decision is reached, public notice must be given, and the Commission informed.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.250&lt;/ref&gt; Cy-près powers are now enacted in the [[Charities Act 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/part/6/enacted C2.6 Charities Act 2011], accessed 27 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent failure===
The cy-près doctrine applies to two types of situations: subsequent failures and initial failures. Subsequent failures are where money has already been applied to a charitable purpose, and that purpose has failed. It does not allow the next of kin of the original donor to recover any money, as said in ''[[Re Wright]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[1954] 2 All ER 98&lt;/ref&gt; "Once money has been effectually dedicated to charity, whether in pursuance of a general or a particular [[donor intent|charitable intent]], the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are forever excluded". The courts instead simply determine whether or not the reason for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.&lt;ref name=ed242/&gt;

===Initial failure===
Cases of initial failure are where, rather than an established charitable trust failing, a gift has failed at the moment of its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as it is a matter of deciding "has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be applied cy-près or must it go on resulting trust to the settlor's estate"?&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding if a gift has failed, attention is first turned to the wording of the [[trust instrument]]. The terms of such documents are taken literally; if a particular organisation or purpose is given, the settlor's intention is considered to be no wider or narrower than this. A different approach is used when dealing with cases like ''[[Re Faraker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1912] 2 Ch 488&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with a situation where the charity named in the gift had been amalgamated with others. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that the amalgamated charities were entitled to the gift, since the charity named effectively continued as part of the amalgamated one. [[George Farwell (judge)|Farwell LJ]] wrote that, "In all these cases one has to consider not so much the means to the end as the charitable end which is in view, and so long as the charitable end is well established the means are only machinery, and no alteration of the machinery can destroy the charitable trust for the benefit of which the machinery is provided."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Re Finger]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1971] 3 All ER 1050&lt;/ref&gt; Goff J made a distinction between gifts to incorporated bodies and gifts to unincorporated bodies. When a gift is to an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, as a gift to that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in ''[[Re Vernon's Will Trust]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1971] 3 All ER 1061&lt;/ref&gt; "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

Once it has been decided that the gift has failed, the courts consider whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.246&lt;/ref&gt; external evidence is admissible to override any ''[[prima facie]]'' interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in ''[[Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1966] 1 All ER 919&lt;/ref&gt; and charitable intention can be found in cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in ''[[Re Harwood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1936] Ch 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (2007) p.247-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the '''decretalists''' of the thirteenth century formed a school of interpretation that emphasised the [[decretals]], those letters issued by the [[Popes]] ruling on matters of church discipline (''epistolae decretales''), in preference to the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' (1141), which their rivals, the [[decretists]], favoured.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Rhidian Jones, ''The Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England: A Handbook'' (T&amp;T Clark, 2000), 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The decretalists were early compilers of the papal decretals, and their work, such as that of [[Simon of Bisignano]] (''c''. 1177), was used by the dominant decretist school.&lt;ref name=NCE&gt;"Decretalist", ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (Gale, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The decretalist practice can be divided into three periods. The first (''c''. 1160–1200) is characterised by the collection of decretals; the second (''c''. 1200–1234) by the organisation of the collections and the first signs of decretal exegesis; and the final (1234–1348) by extensive exegesis and analysis.&lt;ref name=NCE/&gt; Important early decretalists include [[Bernard of Pavia]], who wrote the ''Summa Decretalium'', the ''Summa de Matrimonio'' and the ''Brevarium Extravagantium'', and [[Henry of Susa]], whose ''Summa Copiosa'' melded canon law with [[Roman law]] and was influential into modern times.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22322">'''Dishonest assistance''', or knowing assistance, is a type of third party liability under [[English trust law]]. It is usually seen as one of two liabilities established in ''[[Barnes v Addy]],''&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt; the other one being [[knowing receipt]]. To be liable for dishonest assistance, there must be a breach of [[trust (law)|trust]] or [[fiduciary duty]] by someone other than the defendant, the defendant must have helped that person in the breach, and the defendant must have a dishonest state of mind. The liability itself is well established, but the mental element of dishonesty is subject to considerable controversy which sprang from the [[House of Lords]] case ''[[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2002] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2002/12.html UKHL 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Clist assistance}}
It is a common belief that dishonest or knowing assistance originates from Lord Selbourne's judgment in ''[[Barnes v Addy]]'':&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt;

{{quote|[S]trangers are not to be made constructive trustees merely because they act as the agents of trustees in transactions, … unless those agents received and become chargeable with some part of the trust property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustees.}}

As can be seen, the judgment laid down two heads of liability: one based on receipt of trust property ([[knowing receipt]]) and the other on assisting with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design (knowing assistance).

Lord Selbourne's statement has been heavily criticized, particularly on the requirement that the defaulting fiduciary / trustee has to be dishonest or fraudulent. A commentator noted that ''Fyler v Fyler''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Fyler v Fyler|link=|reporter=ER|year=1841|num=463|volume=49|firstpage=216|parallelcite=3 Beav 550|date=1 March 1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''AG v The Corporation of Leicester'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Attorney-General v The Corporation of Leicester|link=|reporter=ER|year=1844|num=270|volume=49|firstpage=1031|parallelcite=7 Beav 176|date=17 February 1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; two decisions on knowing assistance in the 1840s which predated ''Barnes v Addy'', did not mention the moral quality of the breach induced or assisted at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harpum | first=Charles |editor-first=Peter| editor-last=Birks |title=The Frontiers of Liability Volume 1 |publisher=OUP |year=1994 |pages=9–13 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Basis of Equitable Liability |isbn=978-0-19-825902-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another debate was regarding the type of knowledge that would suffice to impose liability. Peter Gibson J in ''[[Baden v Société Générale pour Favoriser le Développment du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA|Baden v Société Générale]]'' identified 5 categories of knowledge which was subject to much debate and led the courts into "tortuous convolutions".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan]]'', per [[Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==

===Secondary===
The prevalent view is that liability for dishonest assistance is secondary. Therefore, the liability of the assistant is premised on that of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee and he/she will be jointly and severally liable with the fiduciary / trustee whom he/she assisted. However, Charles Mitchell recognized possible difficulties with this categorization: firstly, secondary liability means that the dishonest assistant will be liable for the disgorgement gains of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee, while the fiduciary / trustee will not be liable for secret profits of the dishonest assistant; secondly, the assessment of exemplary damages against the dishonest assistant will be based on that of the fiduciary / trustee which can be undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;S Elliot and C Mitchell, 'Remedies for Dishonest Assistance' (2004) 67 MLR 16&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also views that liability for dishonest assistance should be primary. However, such views have yet to receive judicial endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;P Ridge, 'Justifying the Remedies for Dishonest Assistance' (2008) 124 LQR 445-468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructive trusteeship===
Dishonest assistants have been frequently described by courts as [[constructive trust]]ees. However, such classification is not without difficulty: dishonest assistance is often imposed even if there is no obviously identifiable property subject to the trust; also, in many cases of dishonest assistance property has reached the hands of innocent third parties who may not be under any obligation to restore it.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;AJ Oakley, ''Parker and Mellows: The Modern Law of Trusts'' (9th edn Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-421-94590-6}}, 408-409&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have sought to explain this on the basis that there is a type of [[constructive trust]] which can arise even if there is no identifiable trust property.&lt;ref&gt;DJ Hayton, OR Marshall and JA Nathan ''Hayton &amp; Marshall Commentary &amp; Cases on the Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies'' (9th edn 1991) {{ISBN|978-0-420-48240-2}}, 440-441&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prevalent view is that dishonest assistance is a personal liability that does not result in an imposition of constructive trust.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; This view has the support of [[Lord Millett]] who remarked in ''[[Dubai Aluminium Co v Salaam]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[2002] UKHL 48&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Equity gives relief against fraud by making any person sufficiently implicated in the fraud accountable in equity. In such a case he is traditionally (and I have suggested unfortunately) described as a 'constructive trustee' and is said to be 'liable to account as a constructive trustee'. But he is not in fact a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to account as if he were. He never claims to assume the position of trustee on behalf of others, and he may be liable without ever receiving or handling the trust property... In this second class of case the expressions 'constructive trust' and 'constructive trustee' create a trap... The expressions are nothing more than a formula for equitable relief'... I think we should now discard the words 'accountable as constructive trustee' in this context and substitute the words 'accountable in equity'.}}

==Elements==

===Breach of trust===
The trustee or fiduciary of the claimant must be liable for a breach of trust or fiduciary duty. It is sufficient if the trust in question is a resulting trust&lt;ref&gt;''[[Twinsectra v Yardley]]'' [2002] UKHL 12&lt;/ref&gt; or constructive trust.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Competitive Insurance Company v Davies Investments]]'' [1975] 1 WLR 1240&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previously, it was thought that the dishonest assistant would not be liable unless the defaulting trustee was also dishonest or fraudulent,&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt; but ''[[Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan]]'' confirmed that there is no such requirement in English law. However, the requirement of dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee is still part of the law in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=consul&gt;''[[Consul Development v DPC Estates Pty Ltd]]'' [1975] HCA 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=farah&gt;''[[Farah Constructions Pty v Say-Dee Pty Ltd]]'' [2004] NSWSC 800&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a breach of trust should be required at all has been queried by a commentator, since no breach is required for the analogous tort of interference with contractual relations and if the fiduciary reasonably relies on the probity and competence of the dishonest assistant, the claimant would be left with no remedy.&lt;ref&gt;S Gardner 'Knowing Assistance and Knowing Receipt: Taking Stock' (1996) 112 LQR 56,58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assistance by defendant===
This element is a question of fact as to whether the defendant has been accessory to the misfeasance or breach of trust in question.

===Dishonesty===

====The test====
[[File:Royal Brunei Airlines 767.JPG|thumb|left|In ''[[Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan]]'', Royal Brunei Airlines appointed Borneo Leisure Travel (‘BLT’) to act in Sabah and Sarawak as its general travel agent. The arrangement constituted BLT a trustee for the airline of the money it received from the sale of passenger and cargo transportation. The money received by BLT on behalf of the airline was paid into BLT’s ordinary current account. Any balance in its current account in excess of a stated amount was transferred at times to a fixed deposit account of Mr. Tan, who was BLT's managing director and principal shareholder. BLT was required to pay the airline within 30 days, but at times from 1988 onwards, it was in arrears. In August 1992, the airline terminated the agreement and subsequently claimed against Mr. Tan in respect of the unpaid money.]]

Historically in England, liability would be imposed on persons who assisted in a breach of trust or fiduciary duty "with knowledge".&lt;ref name=barnes&gt;''[[Barnes v Addy]]'' (1874) 9 Ch App 214&lt;/ref&gt; Hence its previous name of "knowing assistance". It should be noted that knowledge is still the cornerstone of the liability in [[Australia]]&lt;ref name=consul/&gt;&lt;ref name=farah/&gt; and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gold v Rosenberg]]'' [1997] 3 SCR 767&lt;/ref&gt; The modern English  terminology emerged in ''[[Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1995] 2 AC 378&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] rejected knowledge as an element of the liability and replaced it with a requirement for dishonesty. After opting for the imposition of fault-based liability, [[Lord Nicholls]] said,

{{Cquote|Drawing the threads together, their Lordships' overall conclusion is that dishonesty is a necessary ingredient of accessory liability. It is also a sufficient ingredient. A liability in equity to make good resulting loss attaches to a person who dishonestly procures or assists in a breach of trust or fiduciary obligation. It is not necessary that, in addition, the trustee or fiduciary was acting dishonestly...'Knowingly' is better avoided as a defining ingredient of the principle...}}

His Lordship went on to articulate a test for dishonesty, which is generally perceived to be an objective test with some subjective characteristics: 

{{Cquote|Whatever may be the position in some criminal or other contexts (see, for instance, ''[[R v Ghosh]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1982] QB 1053&lt;/ref&gt;), in the context of the accessory liability principle acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity, which is synonymous, means simply not acting as an honest person would in the circumstances.  This is an objective standard.  At first sight this may seem surprising.  Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence.  Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated.  Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct.  Carelessness is not dishonesty.  Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety.  However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances.  The standard of what constitutes honest conduct is not subjective.  Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual. If a person knowingly appropriates another’s property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothing wrong in such behaviour.}}

Hence, the conduct of the defendant is to be assessed according to an objective standard of dishonesty in light of the actual knowledge of the defendant. When undertaking such exercise, the court will also have regard to personal attributes of the defendant, such as his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted as he did. His Lordship then gave a few examples of dishonesty, such as deception, knowingly taking the property of others, participation in a transaction in light of knowledge that it involves a misapplication of trust assets, willful blindness etc.

The issue was later reconsidered in ''[[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley]]'' in the [[House of Lords]], which unfortunately returned a different answer. The majority in that case held that [[Lord Nicholls]] in ''Royal Brunei'' meant to say that, for a person to be held liable as an accessory to a breach of trust, he had to have acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and have been himself aware that by those standards he was acting dishonestly. This became known as the "combined test", namely a standard which requires both subjective and objective states of mind. [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]]'s reason for adopting the combined test is that a finding by a judge that a defendant has been dishonest is a grave finding, and it is particularly grave against a professional man.  Therefore, in his view, a higher level of blameworthiness is required to impose liability in dishonest assistance.

[[Lord Millett]] delivered a dissenting judgment, maintaining that ''Royal Brunei'' decided that the test of dishonesty is objective, although account must be taken of subjective considerations such as the defendant’s experience and intelligence and his actual state of knowledge at the relevant time.  But it is not necessary that he should actually have appreciated that he was acting dishonestly; it is sufficient that he was.  The question is whether an honest person would appreciate that what he was doing was wrong or improper, not whether the defendant himself actually appreciated this. His Lordship gave 3 reasons for this:
#Consciousness of wrongdoing is an aspect of ''[[mens rea]]'' and an appropriate condition of criminal liability: it is not an appropriate condition of civil liability.
#The objective test is in accordance with ''[[Barnes v Addy]]'' and the traditional doctrine.
#The claim for “knowing assistance” is the equitable counterpart of the [[economic torts]].  These are intentional torts; negligence is not sufficient and dishonesty is not necessary.  Liability depends on knowledge.  A requirement of subjective dishonesty introduces an unnecessary and unjustified distinction between the elements of the equitable claim and those of the tort of wrongful interference with the performance of a contract.

What [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]] said in ''Twinsectra'' has now been reinterpreted and restated by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in ''[[Barlow Clowes International v Eurotrust International]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[2006] 1 WLR 1476&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, [[Lord Hoffmann]] reaffirmed the objective test, i.e. the one maintained by [[Lord Millett]] in ''Twinsectra'', as the correct test for dishonesty. His Lordship interpreted [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]]'s reference to 'what he knows would offend normally acceptable standards of honest conduct' as meaning only that his knowledge of the transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct. His Lordship said that it is not necessary for the defendant to have reflections what those normally acceptable standards of honest conduct were. 

Subsequently, the lower English courts have adopted the test laid down in ''Barlow Clowes'', although theoretically it is not open to them to refuse to follow the House of Lords decision in ''Twinsectra''. In ''[[Abou-Rahmah v Abacha]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2005] EWHC 2662; [2006] 1 All ER 247&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]], [[Mary Arden (judge)|Arden LJ]] endorsed ''Barlow Clowes'' as representing the current English law for 4 reasons:
#''Barlow Clowes'' did not require a departure from ''Twinsectra'', but merely give guidance as to the proper interpretation to be given to ''Twinsectra'' as a matter of English law.
#''Barlow Clowes'' drew no distinction between the law of [[Isle of Man]] and English law
#Members of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] in ''Barlow Clowes'' were all members of the House of Lords, and included 2 members of the majority from ''Twinsectra''. The House of Lords is unlikely to come to a different view as to the proper interpretation of ''Twinsectra''.
#There are no overriding reasons why in the context of civil liability (as opposed to criminal liability) the law should take account of the defendant’s subjective views of the morality of his actions.
However, the other two judges, [[Malcolm Pill|Pill LJ]] and [[Bernard Rix|Rix LJ]], refused to get drawn into the controversy as it was unnecessary to decide on the proper test for dishonesty to dispose of the appeal. In fact, some commentators have suggested that Pill LJ seems to support the combined test in ''Twinsectra'', although he did not make it explicit.&lt;ref&gt;K Nikunj, 'Dishonest Assistance: The Latest Perspective From the Court of Appeal' (2007) 22(6) Journal of Banking Law and Regulation 305-317&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[AG of Zambia v Meer Care &amp; Desai]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2007] EWHC 952&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith J]] at the [[Chancery Division]] opined that the question of objective/subjective test is an over elaboration and endorsed the test set out in ''Royal Brunei'', which he regards as another way of posing the jury question "was the defendant dishonest". He disagreed with Lord Hutton's view in Twinsectra that Lord Millett was articulating a purely objective test. He also regarded Lord Hutton's justification for the combined test, that dishonesty is a grave finding against professionals, as erroneous since it is no less grave for a non professional to be accused of dishonesty and there had been plenty of dishonest professionals.

The test in ''Royal Brunei'' and ''Barlow Clowes'' has been accepted as the law in [[New Zealand]] in the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal]] case ''[[US International Marketing Ltd v National Bank of NZ Ltd]]''. However, one of the three judges (Tipping J) applied a reasonable person test as opposed to the honest person test in determining the question of dishonesty.

====What knowledge constitutes dishonesty====
In ''[[Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 4 All ER 385&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Twinsectra v Yardley]]'', Lord Millett remarked that it is not necessary that the dishonest assistant should be aware of the identity of the victim or nature of the breach and knowledge that the money is not at the free disposal of the assisted person suffices to impose liability. Similarly, in ''Barlow Clowes'', Lord Hoffmann said it is unnecessary for the dishonest assistant to know of the existence of breach or the facts; it is enough if he /she knows or suspects he is assisting in misappropriation of money without knowing money is held on trust.

What level of suspicion suffice to trigger the liability continues to trouble the courts. In ''Abou-Rahmah'', Arden LJ opined that the dishonest assistant is not dishonest if he only has general suspicions about impropriety as opposed to particular suspicions regarding specific transactions. However, Rix LJ thought otherwise and said that general suspicion is enough to trigger the liability.

==Relationship with knowing receipt==
Traditionally, dishonest assistance and [[knowing receipt]] are seen as two distinct heads of liability: one is fault based, while the other is receipt based. However, there has been academic discussion as to whether they can be grouped together. Charles Mitchell proposes that if we adopt Peter Birk’s view regarding knowing receipt (that knowing receipt can be based on unjust enrichment as well as fault), there is a strong case for treating liability for dishonest assistance and fault-based knowing receipt as aspects of a single equitable wrong of interfering with another’s equitable rights – a wrong he called “equitable conversion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell | first=Charles |editor-first=Peter| editor-last=Birks |title=Breach of Trust |publisher=Hart Publishing |year=2002 |pages=209–211 |chapter=Chapter 6: Assistance |isbn=978-1-84113-174-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Lord Nicholls]] has proposed extrajudicially that dishonesty is one of the bases for the liability for knowing receipt and that dishonest receipt can be grouped with dishonest assistance into dishonest participation in breach of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lord Nicholls | first= |editor-first=WR| editor-last=Cornish |title=Restitution Past, Present and Future |publisher=Hart Publishing |date=1 July 1998 |pages=231 |chapter=Knowing Receipt: The Need for a New Landmark |isbn=978-1-901362-42-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! Date of delivery !! Reference !! Type of case !! Wording of conclusion
|-
| 1971-06-08  || Case 78/70 (Deutsche Grammophon) || PR || 1. It is in conflict with the provisions prescribing the free movement of products within the common market for a manufacturer of sound recordings to exercise the exclusive right to distribute the protected articles, conferred upon him by the legislation of a member state, in such a way as to prohibit the sale in that state of products placed on the market by him or with his consent in another Member State solely because such distribution did not occur within the territory of the first Member State.

2. (a) a manufacturer of sound recordings who holds an exclusive right of distribution under national legislation does not occupy a dominant position within the meaning of article 86 of the Treaty merely by exercising that right. The position is different when having regard to the circumstances of the case he has the power to impede the maintenance of effective competition over a considerable part of the relevant market. (b) the difference between the controlled price and the price of the product reimported from another Member State does not necessarily suffice to disclose an abuse of a dominant position; it may, however, if unjustified by any objective criteria and if it is particularly market, be a determining factor in such abuse.
|-
| 1980-03-18  || Case 62/79 (Coditel I) || PR || The provisions of the Treaty relating to the freedom to provide services do not preclude an assignee of the performing right in a cinematographic film in a Member State from relying upon his right to prohibit the exhibition of that film in that state, without his authority, by means of cable diffusion if the film so exhibited is picked up and transmitted after being broadcast in another Member State by a third party with the consent of the original owner of the right.
|-
| 1981-01-20  || Case 55+57/80 (Musik-Vertrieb Membran) || PR || Articles 30 and 36 of the Treaty must be interpreted as precluding the application of national legislation under which a copyright management society empowered to exercise the copyrights of composers of musical works reproduced on gramophone records or other sound recordings in another member state is permitted to invoke those rights where those sound recordings are distributed on the national market after having been put into circulation in that other Member State by or with the consent of the owners of those copyrights, to claim the payment of a fee equal to the royalties ordinarily paid for marketing on the national market less the lower royalties paid in the Member State of manufacture.
|-
| 1981-01-22  || Case 58/80 (Dansk Supermarked v. Imerco) || PR || 1. Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted to mean that the judicial authorities of a Member State may not prohibit, on the basis of a copyright or of a trademark, the marketing on the territory of that State of a product to which one of those rights applies if that product has been lawfully marketed on the territory of another Member State by the proprietor of such rights or with his consent.

2. Article 30 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as meaning: That the importation into a Member State of goods lawfully marketed in another Member State cannot as such be classified as an improper or unfair commercial practice, without prejudice however to the possible application of legislation of the State of importation against such practices on the ground of the circumstances or methods of offering such goods for sale as distinct from the actual fact of importation; and That an agreement between individuals intended to prohibit the importation of such goods may not be relied upon or taken into consideration to classify the marketing of such goods as an improper or unfair commercial practice.
|-
| 1982-10-06  || Case 262/81 (Coditel II) || PR || A contract whereby the owner of the copyright for a film grants an exclusive right to exhibit that film for a specific period in the territory of a Member State is not, as such, subject to the prohibitions contained in Article 85 of the Treaty. It is, however, where appropriate, for the national court to ascertain whether, in a given case, the manner in which the exclusive right conferred by that contract is exercised is subject to a situation in the economic or legal sphere the object or effect of which is to prevent or restrict the distribution of films or to distort competition on the cinematographic market, regard being had to the specific characteristics of that market.
|-
| 1988-05-17  || Case 158/86 (Warner Brothers) || PR || Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty do not prohibit the application of national legislation which gives an author the right to make the hiring-out of video-cassettes subject to his permission, when the video-cassettes in question have already been put into circulation with his consent in another Member State whose legislation enables the author to control the initial sale, without giving him the right to prohibit hiring-out.
|-
| 1989-01-24  || Case C-341/87 (Patricia) || PR || Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as not precluding the application of a Member State's legislation which allows a producer of sound recordings in that Member State to rely on the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute certain musical works of which he is the owner to prohibit the sale, in the territory of that Member State, of sound recordings of the same musical works when those recordings are imported from another Member State in which they were lawfully marketed without the consent of the aforesaid owner or his licensee and in which the producer of those recordings had enjoyed protection which has in the mean time expired.
|-
| 1989-07-13  || Case 395/87 (Tournier) || PR || (1) Articles 30 and 59 of the Treaty must be interpreted as not preventing the application of national legislation which treats as an infringement of copyright the public performance of a protected musical work by means of sound recordings without payment of royalties, where royalties have already been paid to the author, for the reproduction of the work, in another Member State.

(2) Article 85 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as prohibiting any concerted practice by national copyright-management societies of the Member States having as its object or effect the refusal by each society to grant direct access to its repertoire to users established in another Member State. It is for the national courts to determine whether any concerted action by such management societies has in fact taken place.

(3) The refusal by a national society for the management of copyright in musical works to grant the users of recorded music access only to the foreign repertoire represented by it does not have the object or effect of restricting competition in the common market unless access to a part of the protected repertoire could entirely safeguard the interests of the authors, composers and publishers of music without thereby increasing the costs of managing contracts and monitoring the use of protected musical works.

(4) Article 86 of the Treaty must be interpreted as meaning that a national copyright-management society holding a dominant position in a substantial part of the Common Market imposes unfair trading conditions where the royalties which it charges to discothèques are appreciably higher than those charged in other Member States, the rates being compared on a consistent basis. That would not be the case if the copyright-management society in question were able to justify such a difference by reference to objective and relevant dissimilarities between copyright management in the Member State concerned and copyright management in the other Member States.
|-
| 1993-10-20  || Case C-92+326/92 (Phil Collins) || PR ||  1. Copyright and related rights fall within the scope of application of the Treaty, within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article7; the general principle of non-discrimination laid down by that article is, therefore, applicable to them.

2. The first paragraph of Article7 of the Treaty must be interpreted as precluding the legislation of a Member State from denying to authors and per-formers from other Member States, and those claiming under them, the right, accorded by that legislation to the nationals of that State, to prohibit the marketing in its national territory of a phonogram manufactured without their consent, where the performance was given outside its national territory.

3. The first paragraph of Article 7 of the Treaty must be interpreted as meaning that the principle of non-discrimination which it lays down may be directly relied upon before a national court by an author or performer from another Member State, or by those claiming under them, to claim the benefits of protection reserved to national authors and performers.

Where a question relating to the interpretation of the First Council Directive (89/104/EEC) of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks is raised in proceedings in one of the Benelux Member States concerning the interpretation of the Uniform Benelux Law on Trade Marks, a court against whose decisions there is no remedy under national law, as is the case with both the Benelux Court and the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden, must make a reference to the Court of Justice under the third paragraph of Article 177 of the EC Treaty. However, that obligation loses its purpose and is thus emptied of its substance when the question raised is substantially the same as a question which has already been the subject of a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings.

2. On a proper interpretation of Articles 5 and 7 of Directive 89/104, when trade-marked goods have been put on the Community market by the proprietor of the trade mark or with his consent, a reseller, besides being free to resell those goods, is also free to make use of the trade mark to bring to the public's attention the further commercialisation of those goods.

3. The proprietor of a trade mark may not rely on Article 7(2) of Directive 89/104 to oppose the use of the trade mark, by a reseller who habitually markets articles of the same kind, but not necessarily of the same quality, as the trade-marked goods, in ways customary in the reseller's sector of trade, for the purpose of bringing to the public's attention the further commercialisation of those goods, unless it is established that, given the specific circumstances of the case, the use of the trade mark for this purpose seriously damages the reputation of the trade mark.

4. On a proper interpretation of Articles 30 and 36 of the EC Treaty, the proprietor of a trade mark or holder of copyright may not oppose their use by a reseller who habitually markets articles of the same kind, but not necessarily of the same quality, as the protected goods, in ways customary in the reseller's sector of trade, for the purpose of bringing to the public's attention the further commercialisation of those goods, unless it is established that, having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, the use of those goods for that purpose seriously damages their reputation.

The concept of equitable remuneration in Article 8(2) of [[Rental Directive|Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property]] must be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States and applied by each Member State; it is for each Member State to determine, in its own territory, the most appropriate criteria for assuring, within the limits imposed by Community law and Directive 92/100 in particular, adherence to that Community concept.
2. Article 8(2) of Directive 92/100 does not preclude a model for calculating what constitutes equitable remuneration for performing artists and phonogram producers that operates by reference to variable and fixed factors, such as the number of hours of phonograms broadcast, the viewing and listening densities achieved by the radio and television broadcasters represented by the broadcast organisation, the tariffs fixed by agreement in the field of performance rights and broadcast rights in respect of musical works protected by copyright, the tariffs set by the public broadcast organisations in the Member States bordering on the Member State concerned, and the amounts paid by commercial stations, provided that that model is such as to enable a proper balance to be achieved between the interests of performing artists and producers in obtaining remuneration for the broadcast of a particular phonogram, and the interests of third parties in being able to broadcast the phonogram on terms that are reasonable, and that it does not contravene any principle of Community law.

For the purposes of examining whether the refusal by an undertaking in a dominant position to grant a licence for a brick structure protected by an intellectual property right which it owns is abusive, the degree of participation by users in the development of that structure and the outlay, particularly in terms of cost, on the part of potential users to purchase studies on regional sales of pharmaceutical products presented on the basis of an alternative structure are factors which must be taken into consideration to determine whether the protected structure is indispensable to the marketing of studies of that kind.

2. The refusal by an undertaking which holds a dominant position and owns an intellectual property right in a brick structure indispensable to the presentation of regional sales data on pharmaceutical products in a Member State to grant a licence to use that structure to another undertaking which also wishes to provide such data in the same Member State, constitutes an abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Article 82 EC where the following conditions are fulfilled:

– the undertaking which requested the licence intends to offer, on the market for the supply of the data in question, new products or services not offered by the owner of the intellectual property right and for which there is a potential consumer demand;

– the refusal is not justified by objective considerations;

– the refusal is such as to reserve to the owner of the intellectual property right the market for the supply of data on sales of pharmaceutical products in the Member State concerned by eliminating all competition on that market.

A fixture list for a football league such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings constitutes a database within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 96/9. The expression 'investment in … the obtaining … of the contents' of a database in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9 must be understood to refer to the resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them in the database. It does not cover the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database.

The expression 'investment in … the obtaining … of the contents' of a database in Article 7(1) of [[Database Directive|Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases]] must be understood to refer to the resources used to seek out existing independent materials and collect them in the database. It does not cover the resources used for the creation of materials which make up the contents of a database.

The expression 'investment in … the … verification … of the contents' of a database in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9 must be understood to refer to the resources used, with a view to ensuring the reliability of the information contained in that database, to monitor the accuracy of the materials collected when the database was created and during its operation. The resources used for verification during the stage of creation of materials which are subsequently collected in a database do not fall within that definition.

The resources used to draw up a list of horses in a race and to carry out checks in that connection do not constitute investment in the obtaining and verification of the contents of the database in which that list appears.

2. The terms 'extraction' and 're-utilisation' as defined in Article 7 of Directive 96/9 must be interpreted as referring to any unauthorised act of appropriation and distribution to the public of the whole or a part of the contents of a database. Those terms do not imply direct access to the database concerned.

The fact that the contents of a database were made accessible to the public by its maker or with his consent does not affect the right of the maker to prevent acts of extraction and/or re-utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents of a database.

3. The expression 'substantial part, evaluated … quantitatively, of the contents of [a] database' in Article 7 of Directive 96/9 refers to the volume of data extracted from the database and/or re-used and must be assessed in relation to the total volume of the contents of the database.

The expression 'substantial part, evaluated qualitatively … of the contents of [a] database' refers to the scale of the investment in the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents of the subject of the act of extraction and/or re-utilisation, regardless of whether that subject represents a quantitatively substantial part of the general contents of the protected database.

Any part which does not fulfil the definition of a substantial part, evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, falls within the definition of an insubstantial part of the contents of a database.

4. The prohibition laid down by Article 7(5) of Directive 96/9 refers to unauthorised acts of extraction or re-utilisation the cumulative effect of which is to reconstitute and/or make available to the public, without the authorisation of the maker of the database, the whole or a substantial part of the contents of that database and thereby seriously prejudice the investment by the maker.

2. Article 8(2) of [[Rental Directive|Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property]] must be interpreted as meaning that, for determination of the equitable remuneration mentioned in that provision, the broadcasting company is not entitled unilaterally to deduct from the amount of the royalty for phonogram use payable in the Member State in which it is established the amount of the royalty paid or claimed in the Member State in whose territory the terrestrial transmitter broadcasting to the first State is located.

| 2009-03-05  || Case C-545/07 (EOOD v. Lakorda) || PR || 1. The delimitation of the concepts of 'permanent transfer' and 'temporary transfer' in Article 7 of [[Database Directive|Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases]] is based on the criterion of the length of time during which materials extracted from a protected database are stored in a medium other than that database. The time at which there is an extraction, within the meaning of Article 7, from a protected database, accessible electronically, is when the materials which are the subject of the act of transfer are stored in a medium other than that database. The concept of extraction is independent of the objective pursued by the perpetrator of the act at issue, of any modifications he may make to the contents of the materials thus transferred, and of any differences in the structural organisation of the databases concerned.

The fact that the physical and technical characteristics present in the contents of a protected database made by a particular person also appear in the contents of a database made by another person may be interpreted as evidence of extraction within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 96/9, unless that coincidence can be explained by factors other than a transfer between the two databases concerned. The fact that materials obtained by the maker of a database from sources not accessible to the public also appear in a database made by another person is not sufficient, in itself, to prove the existence of such extraction but can constitute circumstantial evidence thereof.

The nature of the computer program used to manage two electronic databases is not a factor in assessing the existence of extraction within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 96/9.

2. Article 7 of Directive 96/9 must be interpreted as meaning that, where there is a body of materials composed of separate modules, the volume of the materials allegedly extracted and/or re-used from one of those modules must, to assess whether there has been extraction and/or re-utilisation of a substantial part, evaluated quantitatively, of the contents of a database within the meaning of that article, be compared with the total contents of that module, if the latter constitutes, in itself, a database which fulfils the conditions for protection by the sui generis right. Otherwise, and in so far as the body of materials constitutes a database protected by that right, the comparison must be made between the volume of the materials allegedly extracted and/or re-used from the various modules of that database and its total contents.

The fact that the materials allegedly extracted and/or re‑used from a database protected by the sui generis right were obtained by the maker of that database from sources not accessible to the public may, according to the amount of human, technical and/or financial resources deployed by the maker to collect the materials at issue from those sources, affect the classification of those materials as a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively, of the contents of the database concerned, within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 96/9.

The fact that part of the materials contained in a database are official and accessible to the public does not relieve the national court of an obligation, in assessing whether there has been extraction and/or re‑utilisation of a substantial part of the contents of that database, to verify whether the materials allegedly extracted and/or re-used from that database constitute a substantial part, evaluated quantitatively, of its contents or, as the case may be, whether they constitute a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively, of the database inasmuch as they represent, in terms of the obtaining, verification and presentation thereof, a substantial human, technical or financial investment.

An act occurring during a data capture process, which consists of storing an extract of a protected work comprising 11 words and printing out that extract, is such as to come within the concept of reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]], if the elements thus reproduced are the expression of the intellectual creation of their author; it is for the national court to make this determination.

2. The act of printing out an extract of 11 words, during a data capture process such as that at issue in the main proceedings, does not fulfil the condition of being transient in nature as required by Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 and, therefore, that process cannot be carried out without the consent of the relevant rightholders.

That being so, it is for the referring court, for the purposes of applying the national provision transposing Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/84, to take due account of all the relevant rules for the resolution of conflicts of laws relating to the transfer on succession of the resale right.

| 2010-10-21  || Case C-467/08 (Padawan) || PR || 1. The concept of 'fair compensation', within the meaning of Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]], is an autonomous concept of European Union law which must be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States that have introduced a private copying exception, irrespective of the power conferred on the Member States to determine, within the limits imposed by European Union law in particular by that directive, the form, detailed arrangements for financing and collection, and the level of that fair compensation.

2. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the 'fair balance' between the persons concerned means that fair compensation must be calculated on the basis of the criterion of the harm caused to authors of protected works by the introduction of the private copying exception. It is consistent with the requirements of that 'fair balance' to provide that persons who have digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who on that basis, in law or in fact, make that equipment available to private users or provide them with copying services are the persons liable to finance the fair compensation, inasmuch as they are able to pass on to private users the actual burden of financing it.

3. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that a link is necessary between the application of the levy intended to finance fair compensation with respect to digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and the deemed use of them for the purposes of private copying. Consequently, the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy, in particular with respect to digital reproduction equipment, devices and media not made available to private users and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying, is incompatible with Directive 2001/29.

However, it is open to the Member States to establish a private copying levy chargeable to the persons who make reproduction equipment, devices and media available to that final user, since they are able to pass on the amount of that levy in the price paid by the final user for that service.

2. Directive 2001/29, in particular Article 5(2)(b) and (5) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that it is for the Member State which has introduced a system of private copying levies chargeable to the manufacturer or importer of media for reproduction of protected works, and on the territory of which the harm caused to authors by the use for private purposes of their work by purchasers who reside there occurs, to ensure that those authors actually receive the fair compensation intended to compensate them for that harm. In that regard, the mere fact that the commercial seller of reproduction equipment, devices and media is established in a Member State other than that in which the purchasers reside has no bearing on that obligation to achieve a certain result. It is for the national court, where it is impossible to ensure recovery of the fair compensation from the purchasers, to interpret national law to allow recovery of that compensation from the person responsible for payment who is acting on a commercial basis.

'Illicit device' within the meaning of Article 2(e) of [[Directive on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access|Directive 98/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 1998 on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access]] must be interpreted as not covering foreign decoding devices (devices which give access to the satellite broadcasting services of a broadcaster, are manufactured and marketed with that broadcaster's authorisation, but are used, in disregard of its will, outside the geographical area for which they have been issued), foreign decoding devices procured or enabled by the provision of a false name and address or foreign decoding devices which have been used in breach of a contractual limitation permitting their use only for private purposes.

2. Article 3(2) of Directive 98/84 does not preclude national legislation which prevents the use of foreign decoding devices, including those procured or enabled by the provision of a false name and address or those used in breach of a contractual limitation permitting their use only for private purposes, since such legislation does not fall within the field coordinated by that directive.

3. On a proper construction of Article 56 TFEU:

– that article precludes legislation of a Member State which makes it unlawful to import into and sell and use in that State foreign decoding devices which give access to an encrypted satellite broadcasting service from another Member State that includes subject-matter protected by the legislation of that first State;

– this conclusion is affected neither by the fact that the foreign decoding device has been procured or enabled by the giving of a false identity and a false address, with the intention of circumventing the territorial restriction in question, nor by the fact that it is used for commercial purposes although it was restricted to private use.

4. The clauses of an exclusive licence agreement concluded between a holder of intellectual property rights and a broadcaster constitute a restriction on competition prohibited by Article 101 TFEU where they oblige the broadcaster not to supply decoding devices enabling access to that right holder’s protected subject-matter with a view to their use outside the territory covered by that licence agreement.

5. Article 2(a) of  [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] must be interpreted as meaning that the reproduction right extends to transient fragments of the works within the memory of a satellite decoder and on a television screen, provided that those fragments contain elements which are the expression of the authors' own intellectual creation, and the unit composed of the fragments reproduced simultaneously must be examined to determine whether it contains such elements.

6. Acts of reproduction such as those at issue in Case C-403/08, which are performed within the memory of a satellite decoder and on a television screen, fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 and may therefore be carried out without the authorisation of the copyright holders concerned.

7. 'Communication to the public' within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as covering transmission of the broadcast works, via a television screen and speakers, to the customers present in a public house.

It is for the referring court to assess, in the light of all the elements of the case, whether there is a risk of irreconcilable judgments if those actions were determined separately.

Since it has been determined that the portrait photograph in question is a work, its protection is not inferior to that enjoyed by any other work, including other photographic works.

However, it is conceivable that a newspaper publisher might, in specific cases, contribute to the fulfilment of such an objective by publishing a photograph of a person for whom a search has been launched. It should be required that such initiative is taken, first, within the framework of a decision or action taken by the competent national authorities to ensure public security and, second, by agreement and in co-ordination with those authorities, to avoid the risk of interfering with the measures taken by them, without, however, a specific, current and express appeal, on the part of the security authorities, for publication of a photograph for the purposes of an investigation being necessary.

4. Article 5(3)(d) of Directive 2001/29, read in the light of Article 5(5) of that directive, must be interpreted as not precluding its application where a press report quoting a work or other protected subject-matter is not a literary work protected by copyright.

5. Article 5(3)(d) of Directive 2001/29, read in the light of Article 5(5) of that directive, must be interpreted as meaning that its application is subject to the obligation to indicate the source, including the name of the author or performer, of the work or other protected subject-matter quoted. However, if, in applying Article 5(3)(e) of Directive 2001/29, that name was not indicated, that obligation must be regarded as having been fulfilled if the source alone is indicated.

– fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, notwithstanding the fact that they initiate and terminate that process and involve human intervention;

– fulfil the condition that those acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely to enable the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter;

Consequently, those provisions must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which allocates those exploitation rights by operation of law exclusively to the producer of the work in question.

2. European Union law must be interpreted as allowing the Member States the option of laying down a presumption of transfer, in favour of the producer of a cinematographic work, of rights to exploit the cinematographic work such as those at issue in the main proceedings (satellite broadcasting right, reproduction right and any other right of communication to the public through the making available to the public), provided that such a presumption is not an irrebuttable one precluding the principal director of that work from agreeing otherwise.

As regards whether that party may be regarded as acting 'under the responsibility' of the broadcasting organisation, it is essential that, vis-à-vis other persons, among others the authors who may be harmed by an unlawful recording of their works, the broadcasting organisation is required to pay compensation for any adverse effects of the acts and omissions of the third party, such as a legally independent external television production company, connected with the recording in question, as if the broadcasting organisation had itself carried out those acts and made those omissions.

As the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations]], adopted at Rome on 26 October 1961, does not form part of the legal order of the European Union it is not applicable there; however, it has indirect effects within the European Union.

2. A hotel operator which provides in guest bedrooms televisions and/or radios to which it distributes a broadcast signal is obliged to pay equitable remuneration under Article 8(2) of Directive 2006/115 for the broadcast of a phonogram, in addition to that paid by the broadcaster.

3. A hotel operator which provides in guest bedrooms, not televisions and/or radios to which it distributes a broadcast signal, but other apparatus and phonograms in physical or digital form which may be played on or heard from such apparatus, is a 'user' making a 'communication to the public' of a phonogram within the meaning of Article 8(2) of Directive 2006/115/EC. It is therefore obliged to pay 'equitable remuneration' under that provision for the transmission of those phonograms.

4. Article 10(1)(a) of Directive 2006/115, which provides for a limitation to the right to equitable remuneration provided for by Article 8(2) of that directive in the case of 'private use', does not allow Member States to exempt a hotel operator which makes a 'communication to the public' of a phonogram, within the meaning of Article 8(2) of that directive, from the obligation to pay such remuneration.

2. Article 5(3) of Directive 91/250 must be interpreted as meaning that a person who has obtained a copy of a computer program under a licence is entitled, without the authorisation of the owner of the copyright, to observe, study or test the functioning of that program so as to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program, in the case where that person carries out acts covered by that licence and acts of loading and running necessary for the use of the computer program, and on condition that that person does not infringe the exclusive rights of the owner of the copyright in that program.

2. Articles 4(2) and 5(1) of Directive 2009/24 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of the resale of a user licence entailing the resale of a copy of a computer program downloaded from the copyright holder's website, that licence having originally been granted by that rightholder to the first acquirer for an unlimited period in return for payment of a fee intended to enable the rightholder to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the economic value of that copy of his work, the second acquirer of the licence, as well as any subsequent acquirer of it, will be able to rely on the exhaustion of the distribution right under Article 4(2) of that directive, and hence be regarded as lawful acquirers of a copy of a computer program within the meaning of Article 5(1) of that directive and benefit from the right of reproduction provided for in that provision.

The fact that those searches and/or that provision of print-outs are carried out in consideration for remuneration provided for by law and not determined, directly or indirectly, by the entity concerned, is not such as to alter the legal classification of that activity. In addition, when such a public authority prohibits any other use of the data thus collected and made available to the public, by relying upon the sui generis protection granted to it as maker of the database pursuant to Article 7 of [[Database Directive|Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases]], or upon any other intellectual property right, it also does not exercise an economic activity and is not therefore to be regarded, in the course of that activity, as an undertaking, within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU.

| 2013-06-27  || Case C-457-460/11 (VG Wort) || PR || 1. With regard to the period from 22 June 2001, the date on which [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] entered into force, to 22 December 2002, the date by which that directive was to have been transposed into national law, acts of using protected works or other subject-matter are not affected by that directive.

2. In the context of an exception or limitation provided for by Article 5(2) or (3) of Directive 2001/29, an act by which a rightholder may have authorised the reproduction of his protected work or other subject-matter has no bearing on the fair compensation owed, whether it is provided for on a compulsory or an optional basis under the relevant provision of that directive.

3. The possibility of applying technological measures under Article 6 of Directive 2001/29 cannot render inapplicable the condition relating to fair compensation provided for by Article 5(2)(b) of that directive.

4. The concept of 'reproductions effected by the use of any kind of photographic technique or by some other process having similar effects' within the meaning of Article 5(2)(a) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as including reproductions effected using a printer and a personal computer, where the two are linked together. In this case, it is open to the Member States to put in place a system in which the fair compensation is paid by the persons in possession of a device contributing, in a non-autonomous manner, to the single process of reproduction of the protected work or other subject-matter on the given medium, in so far as those persons have the possibility of passing on the cost of the levy to their customers, provided that the overall amount of the fair compensation owed as recompense for the harm suffered by the author at the end of that single process must not be substantially different from the amount fixed for a reproduction obtained by means of a single device.

Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in its territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision, where, having regard to the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by that directive, which it is for the national court to verify, practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levies paid excessively difficult.

2. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy to be borne by persons who first place recording media suitable for reproduction on the market in the territory of the Member State concerned for commercial purposes and for consideration, that provision does not preclude the establishment by that Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of such media where they are marketed to natural persons, where the practical difficulties of determining whether the purpose of the use of the media in question is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and provided that the presumption established does not result in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in that provision.

3. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision or the private copying levy intended to finance that compensation cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levy is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify.

4. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.

– provides the end user with a search form which essentially offers the same range of functionality as the search form on the database site;

– ‘translates’ queries from end users into the search engine for the database site ‘in real time’, so that all the information on that database is searched through; and

– presents the results to the end user using the format of its website, grouping duplications together into a single block item but in an order that reflects criteria comparable to those used by the search engine of the database site concerned for presenting results.

It is for the national court to determine whether other measures or measures which are not installed in consoles could cause less interference with the activities of third parties or limitations to those activities, while still providing comparable protection of the rightholder's rights. Accordingly, it is relevant to take account, inter alia, of the relative costs of different types of technological measures, of technological and practical aspects of their implementation, and of a comparison of the effectiveness of those different types of technological measures as regards the protection of the rightholder's rights, that effectiveness however not having to be absolute. That court must also examine the purpose of devices, products or components, which are capable of circumventing those technological measures. In that regard, the evidence of use which third parties actually make of them will, in the light of the circumstances at issue, be particularly relevant. The national court may, in particular, examine how often those devices, products or components are in fact used in disregard of copyright and how often they are used for purposes which do not infringe copyright.

2. Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from giving wider protection to copyright holders by laying down that the concept of communication to the public includes a wider range of activities than those referred to in that provision.

Article 3(1) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which excludes the right of authors to authorise or prohibit the communication of their works, by a spa establishment which is a business, through the intentional distribution of a signal by means of television or radio sets in the bedrooms of the establishment's patients. Article 5(2)(e), (3)(b) and (5) of that directive is not such as to affect that interpretation.

2. Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it cannot be relied on by a copyright collecting society in a dispute between individuals for the purpose of setting aside national legislation contrary to that provision. However, the national court hearing such a case is required to interpret that legislation, so far as possible, in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive to achieve an outcome consistent with the objective pursued by the directive.

3. Article 16 of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market, and Articles 56 TFEU and 102 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which reserves the exercise of collective management of copyright in respect of certain protected works in the territory of the Member State concerned to a single copyright collecting society and thereby prevents users of such works, such as the spa establishment in the main proceedings, from benefiting from the services provided by another collecting society established in another Member State.

However, Article 102 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that the imposition by that copyright collecting society of fees for its services which are appreciably higher than those charged in other Member States (a comparison of the fee levels having been made on a consistent basis) or the imposition of a price which is excessive in relation to the economic value of the service provided are indicative of an abuse of a dominant position.

Article 8(3) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] must be interpreted as meaning that a person who makes protected subject-matter available to the public on a website without the agreement of the rightholder, for the purpose of Article 3(2) of that directive, is using the services of the internet service provider of the persons accessing that subject-matter, which must be regarded as an intermediary within the meaning of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29.

2. The fundamental rights recognised by EU law must be interpreted as not precluding a court injunction prohibiting an internet service provider from allowing its customers access to a website placing protected subject-matter online without the agreement of the rightholders when that injunction does not specify the measures which that access provider must take and when that access provider can avoid incurring coercive penalties for breach of that injunction by showing that it has taken all reasonable measures, provided that (i) the measures taken do not unnecessarily deprive internet users of the possibility of lawfully accessing the information available and (ii) that those measures have the effect of preventing unauthorised access to the protected subject-matter or, at least, of making it difficult to achieve and of seriously discouraging internet users who are using the services of the addressee of that injunction from accessing the subject-matter that has been made available to them in breach of the intellectual property right, that being a matter for the national authorities and courts to establish.

2. [[Enforcement Directive|Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights]] must be interpreted as not applying to proceedings, such as those in the main proceedings, in which those liable for payment of the fair compensation bring an action before the referring court for a ruling against the body responsible for collecting that remuneration and distributing it to copyright holders, which defends that action.

Article 5(3)(k) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]], must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of 'parody' appearing in that provision is an autonomous concept of EU law.

2. Article 5(3)(k) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the essential characteristics of parody, are, first, to evoke an existing work, while being noticeably different from it, and secondly, to constitute an expression of humour or mockery. The concept of 'parody', within the meaning of that provision, is not subject to the conditions that the parody should display an original character of its own, other than that of displaying noticeable differences with respect to the original parodied work; that it could reasonably be attributed to a person other than the author of the original work itself; that it should relate to the original work itself or mention the source of the parodied work.

However, the application, in a particular case, of the exception for parody, within the meaning of Article 5(3)(k) of Directive 2001/29, must strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, the interests and rights of persons referred to in Articles 2 and 3 of that directive, and, on the other, the freedom of expression of the user of a protected work who is relying on the exception for parody, within the meaning of Article 5(3)(k).

It is for the national court to determine, in the light of all the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, whether the application of the exception for parody, within the meaning of Article 5(3)(k) of Directive 2001/29, on the assumption that the drawing at issue fulfils the essential requirements of parody, preserves that fair balance.

2. Article 5(3)(n) of Directive 2001/29, read in conjunction with Article 5(2)(c) of that directive, must be interpreted to mean that it does not preclude Member States from granting to publicly accessible libraries covered by those provisions the right to digitise the works contained in their collections, if such act of reproduction is necessary for the purpose of making those works available to users, by means of dedicated terminals, within those establishments.

3.

Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] does not preclude national legislation which provides that fair compensation is to be paid, in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right for copies made for private use, in respect of multifunctional media such as mobile telephone memory cards, irrespective of whether the main function of such media is to make such copies, provided that one of the functions of the media, be it merely an ancillary function, enables the operator to use them for that purpose. However, the question whether the function is a main or an ancillary one and the relative importance of the medium's capacity to make copies are liable to affect the amount of fair compensation payable. In so far as the prejudice to the rightholder may be regarded as minimal, the making available of such a function need not give rise to an obligation to pay fair compensation.

2. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 does not preclude national legislation which makes the supply of media that may be used for copying for private use, such as mobile telephone memory cards, subject to the levy intended to finance fair compensation payable in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right for copies for private use, but does not make the supply of components whose main purpose is to store copies for private use, such as the internal memories of MP3 players, subject to that levy, provided that those different categories of media and components are not comparable or the different treatment they receive is justified, which is a matter for the national court to determine.

3. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which requires payment of the levy intended to finance fair compensation, in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right for copies for private use, by producers and importers who sell mobile telephone memory cards to business customers and are aware that those cards will be sold on by those customers but do not know whether the final purchasers of the cards will be individuals or business customers, on condition that: – the introduction of such a system is justified by practical difficulties; – the persons responsible for payment are exempt from the levy if they can establish that they have supplied the mobile telephone memory cards to persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to copying for private use, it being understood that the exemption cannot be restricted to the supply of business customers registered with the organisation responsible for administering the levy; – the system provides for a right to reimbursement of that levy which is effective and does not make it excessively difficult to repay the levy and only the final purchaser of such a memory card may obtain reimbursement by submitting an appropriate application to that organisation.

4. Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, read in the light of recital 35 in the preamble to that directive, must be interpreted as permitting the Member States to provide, in certain cases covered by the exception to the reproduction right for copies for private use, for an exemption from the requirement under that exception to pay fair compensation, provided that the prejudice caused to rightholders in such cases is minimal. It is within the discretion of the Member States to set the threshold for such prejudice, it being understood that that threshold must, inter alia, be applied in a manner consistent with the principle of equal treatment.

5. Directive 2001/29 is to be interpreted as meaning that, where a Member State has decided, pursuant to Article 5(2) of that directive, to exclude, from the material scope of that provision, any right for rightholders to authorise reproduction of their works for private use, any authorisation given by a rightholder for the use of files containing his works can have no bearing on the fair compensation payable in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right for reproductions made in accordance with Article 5(2)(b) of that directive with the aid of such files and cannot, of itself, give rise to an obligation on the part of the user of the files concerned to pay remuneration of any kind to the rightholder.

6. The implementation of technological measures under Article 6 of Directive 2001/29 for devices used to reproduce protected works, such as DVDs, CDs, MP3 players and computers, can have no effect on the requirement to pay fair compensation in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right in respect of reproductions made for private use by means of such devices. However, the implementation of such measures may have an effect on the actual level of such compensation.

7. Directive 2001/29 precludes national legislation which provides for fair compensation, in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right, in respect of reproductions made using unlawful sources, namely from protected works which are made available to the public without the rightholder’s consent.

8. Directive 2001/29 does not preclude national legislation which provides for fair compensation, in accordance with the exception to the reproduction right, in respect of reproductions of protected works made by a natural person by or with the aid of a device which belongs to a third party.

| 2015-11-12  || Case C-572/13 (Hewlett-Packard Belgium) || PR || 1.      Article 5(2)(a) and Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]] must be interpreted as meaning that, with regard to the phrase ‘fair compensation’ contained in those provisions, it is necessary to draw a distinction according to whether the reproduction on paper or a similar medium effected by the use of any kind of photographic technique or by some other process having similar effects is carried out by any user or by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial.

2.      Article 5(2)(a) and Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29]] preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which authorises the Member State in question to allocate a part of the fair compensation payable to rightholders to the publishers of works created by authors, those publishers being under no obligation to ensure that the authors benefit, even indirectly, from some of the compensation of which they have been deprived.

3.      Article 5(2)(a) and Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29]] preclude, in principle, national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which introduces an undifferentiated system for recovering fair compensation which also covers the copying of sheet music, and preclude such legislation which introduces an undifferentiated system for recovering fair compensation which also covers counterfeit reproductions made from unlawful sources.

4.      Article 5(2)(a) and Article 5(2)(b) of [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29]] preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which introduces a system that combines, in order to finance the fair compensation payable to rightholders, two forms of remuneration, namely, first, lump-sum remuneration paid prior to the reproduction operation by the manufacturer, importer or intra-Community acquirer of devices enabling protected works to be copied, at the time when such devices are put into circulation on national territory, and, second, proportional remuneration paid after that reproduction operation and determined solely by means of a unit price multiplied by the number of copies produced, which is payable by the natural or legal persons who make those copies, in so far as:

–        the lump-sum remuneration paid in advance is calculated solely by reference to the speed at which the device concerned is capable of producing copies;

–        the proportional remuneration recovered after the fact varies according to whether or not the person liable for payment has cooperated in the recovery of that remuneration;

–        the combined system, taken as a whole, does not include mechanisms, in particular for reimbursement, which allow the complementary application of the criterion of actual harm suffered and the criterion of harm established as a lump sum in respect of different categories of users.

|-
| 2016-09-15  || Case C-484/14 (McFadden) || PR || 1.      Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’), read in conjunction with Article 2(a) of that directive and with Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information society services, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 July 1998, must be interpreted as meaning that a service such as that at issue in the main proceedings, provided by a communication network operator and consisting in making that network available to the general public free of charge constitutes an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31 where the activity is performed by the service provider in question for the purposes of advertising the goods sold or services supplied by that service provider.

2.      Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order for the service referred to in that article, consisting in providing access to a communication network, to be considered to have been provided, that access must not go beyond the boundaries of a technical, automatic and passive process for the transmission of the required information, there being no further conditions to be satisfied.

3.      Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31 must be interpreted as meaning that the condition laid down in Article 14(1)(b) of that directive does not apply mutatis mutandis to Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31.

4.      Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31, read in conjunction with Article 2(b) of that directive, must be interpreted as meaning that there are no conditions, other than the one mentioned in that provision, to which a service provider supplying access to a communication network is subject.

5.      Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31 must be interpreted as meaning that a person harmed by the infringement of its rights over a work is precluded from claiming compensation from an access provider on the ground that the connection to that network was used by a third party to infringe its rights and the reimbursement of the costs of giving formal notice or court costs incurred in relation to its claim for compensation. However, that article must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude such a person from claiming injunctive relief against the continuation of that infringement and the payment of the costs of giving formal notice and court costs from a communication network access provider whose services were used in that infringement where such claims are made for the purposes of obtaining, or follow the grant of injunctive relief by a national authority or court to prevent that service provider from allowing the infringement to continue.

6.      Having regard to the requirements deriving from the protection of fundamental rights and to the rules laid down in Directives 2001/29 and 2004/48, Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31, read in conjunction with Article 12(3) of that directive, must be interpreted as, in principle, not precluding the grant of an injunction such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires, on pain of payment of a fine, a provider of access to a communication network allowing the public to connect to the internet to prevent third parties from making a particular copyright-protected work or parts thereof available to the general public from an online (peer-to-peer) exchange platform via an internet connection, where that provider may choose which technical measures to take in order to comply with the injunction even if such a choice is limited to a single measure consisting in password-protecting the internet connection, provided that those users are required to reveal their identity in order to obtain the required password and may not therefore act anonymously, a matter which it is for the referring court to ascertain.

The '''Electronic System for Travel Authorization''' ('''ESTA''') is an automated system that determines the eligibility of visitors to travel to the [[United States]] under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/application.html?execution=e1s1|title=Home - Official ESTA Application Website, U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=esta.cbp.dhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESTA was mandated by the [[Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007]] for travelers from VWP countries arriving in the U.S. by air or sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ53/PLAW-110publ53.pdf|title=IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorization via ESTA does not determine whether a traveler is admissible to the United States. [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) officers determine admissibility upon travelers’ arrival. The ESTA application collects biographic information and answers to VWP eligibility questions. ESTA applications may be submitted at any time prior to travel, though it is recommended that travelers apply as soon as they begin preparing travel plans or prior to purchasing airline tickets.

ESTA is not needed when arriving by land from Canada or Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1094/kw/esta/related/1|title=Who must apply for ESTA|work=US Customs and Border Protection|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers (including babies) without an ESTA may be denied check in, although it might be possible to get one while at the departure airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/WebHelp/ESTA_Screen-Level_Online_Help_1.htm#TA7|title=Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Online Help|work=US Customs and Border Protection|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Check-in staff is unlikely to do this. It might be done by a travel agent or by oneself using a smartphone or an internet café.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began charging a fee of US $14 per ESTA application.

== History ==
Passengers were able to sign up in August 2008, and the travel authorization became mandatory from January 12, 2009. Once pre-screened, passengers may reuse the ESTA approval for two years, although they may still need to complete the I-94W paper form for land entry.&lt;ref name=I94W&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/i-94-instructions |title=Arrival/Departure Forms: I-94 and I-94W |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESTA adds a requirement for pre-authorization to the existing Visa Waiver Program.

Since January 20, 2010, airlines have been forced (through fines) to require ESTA at check in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/showarticle.asp?id=101402&amp;nav=13 |title=Electronic System for Travel Authorization Compliance Now Required &amp;#124;ETB News Australia |publisher=Etravelblackboard.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before September 8, 2010, ESTA was available for free from the official government websites. Since then, the [[Travel Promotion Act of 2009|Travel Promotion Act]] introduced a charge of $14. This is made up of $10 which goes to the Corporation for Travel Promotion and a $4 fee levied by the CBP for administration costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/national/08062010_2.xml |title=DHS, CBP Announce Interim Final Rule For ESTA Fee |date=August 6, 2010 |work=CPB.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015092651/http://cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/national/08062010_2.xml |archivedate=October 15, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Ambassador to the United States [[John Bruton]] argued that it is illogical to think tourist numbers will go up if they are charged to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3466&amp;Itemid=58 |title=Travel Promotion Act of 2009 could have unintended consequences |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625221119/http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3466&amp;Itemid=58 |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The charge has also been described by critics in the European Parliament as little more than a way to fund advertisements for United States tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visabureau.com/america/news/27-09-2010/european-parliament-criticizes-esta-fee-to-fund-travel-promotion.aspx |title=European Parliament criticizes ESTA fee to fund travel promotion |publisher=Visabureau.com |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors may stay for 90 days in the United States which also includes the time spent in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Bermuda]], or the islands in the [[Caribbean]] if the arrival was through the United States. The ESTA is only required if arriving by air or cruise ship. It is not required if arriving on a ferry between [[British Columbia]] ([[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, BC|Victoria]]) and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]. If a passenger is arriving by land ESTA is not required.

ESTA holders who are dual citizens of [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]] and [[Syria]] had their ESTAs revoked in January 2016, and will be required to apply for a regular tourist visa at a [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|US foreign mission]]. ESTA holders who have traveled to [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] or [[Yemen]] on or after 1 March 2011 will not have their ESTAs revoked, but will be refused entry if their travel is discovered by the CBP on arrival unless they qualify for a waiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/01/21/united-states-begins-implementation-changes-visa-waiver-program|title=United States Begins Implementation of Changes to the Visa Waiver Program|date=January 21, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/02/18/dhs-announces-further-travel-restrictions-visa-waiver-program|title=DHS Announces Further Travel Restrictions for the Visa Waiver Program|date=February 18, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the 27 EU member states agreed in their [[Bratislava Declaration]] and Roadmap on September 16, 2016, to set up an analogous [[EU Travel Information and Authorisation System]] (ETIAS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-3367_en.htm European Commission - Press release] October 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applying for ESTA ==
[[File:Electronic System for Travel Authorization terminal Brussels airport.jpg|thumb|right|An ESTA terminal at Brussels airport]]
The U.S. Government recommends that travellers go online to submit an authorization request at least three days (72 hours) before travelling to the United States.&lt;ref name="CBP Press Release"&gt;[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/archives/2008_news_releases/june_2008/06032008.xml CBP Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310111739/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/archives/2008_news_releases/june_2008/06032008.xml |date=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a requirement, and about 99% of applications are approved in 5 seconds. However, if a traveller is not eligible for visa-free travel, he or she will need to apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, which is a substantially lengthier process that may require an interview with a U.S. Consular officer. As a result, opponents claim the new rules will delay last-minute business travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransnational.travel/news.php?cid=VWP-ESTA-DHS.Sep-08.04|title=Group Hotel Rates &amp; Exclusive Discounts at Cheap Hotels|website=www.thetransnational.travel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each travel authorization under ESTA can be valid for up to two years.  However, a Visa Waiver Program traveler must obtain a new ESTA authorization if he or she is issued a new passport, or changes his or her name, gender or country of citizenship. In addition, a traveler must obtain a new ESTA authorization if any answer to the ESTA application eligibility questions changes.&lt;ref&gt;'Travelling to the US Without a Visa,' http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Entry under the Visa Waiver Program is only valid for a combined maximum stay in the USA and its surrounding countries of ninety days. Admission period cannot be extended under the program.  If a longer stay is intended, a visa is required.&lt;ref name="90days"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canberra.usembassy.gov/visa_waiver_prog.html |title=Visa Waiver Program – Embassy of the United States Canberra, Australia |work=[[United States Foreign Service]] |accessdate=February 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302015254/http://canberra.usembassy.gov/visa_waiver_prog.html |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESTA does not guarantee entry to the United States.  [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) officers make final determination of admissibility (entry) to the United States and may cancel/deny ESTA at any time during travel.

== Third-party websites ==

Some websites offer to complete ESTA applications for a fee, often many times more than the required $14 fee charged by the US Government. Access and application through the official U.S. Government website are available to any passengers/visitors to the U.S. who qualify under the ESTA program. Prevention of such "ESTA fee scams" was made more difficult when the mandatory US Government fee was imposed, as previous public education efforts focused on getting out the message that ESTA applications were free of charge and anybody requesting payment was an unauthorized third-party.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraud Strikes U.S. Travel Authorization Agency|url=https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/fraud-strikes-travel-authorization-agency|website=McAfee Labs|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if one of the third-party websites is used, passengers themselves still have to complete the same form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usembassy.org.uk/americanservices/?p=519 |title=Beware of ESTA Scams |work=US Embassy in London |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114740/http://www.usembassy.org.uk/americanservices/?p=519 |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised that third-party sites could be used for [[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], or the distribution of [[malware]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Advertisements for paid services appeared at the top of [[Google]] searches for many years, until Google took steps to prevent this in most cases in late 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46316655 |title=Google finally cleans up its Esta ads after eight years|website=BBC News |date=  |author=23 November 2018 |accessdate= 23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A.

Please do not delete this code --&gt;

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O. (2000) Técnicas Difusas en la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental. Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Granada&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using a software tool (TDEIA).&lt;ref&gt;ARAI Research Group, Granada, Spain. [http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ "Environmental Impact Assessment at University of Granada."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025165732/http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ |date=2014-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D. Paul |last2=Emond|title=Environmental Impact Assessment|editor=John Swaigen|series=Environmental Rights in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1981 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D. P.|title=Environmental Assessment Law in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Emond‑Montgomery Ltd.|year=1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice La Forest addressed his concerns about the implications of Bill C-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases.{{harv|La Forest|1973|178-80}}&lt;ref name="LaForest1973"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Forest, |first=Gérard V.|title=Water Law in Canada|location=Ottawa|publisher=Information Canada|year=1973 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2013, Official Opposition Environment critic [[Megan Leslie]] issued a statement claiming that the federal government's recent changes to "fish habitat protection, the [[Navigable Waters Protection Act]] and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act", along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research, "will be disastrous, not only for the environment, but also for Canadians’ health and economic prosperity."&lt;ref name="NDP22apr2013"&gt;{{cite news|date=22 April 2013|title=Statement by Official Opposition Environment critic Megan Leslie on Earth Day|url=https://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|publisher=NDP|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621121734/http://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|archivedate=21 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2012, Leslie argued that with the changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act that came into effect 6 July 2012, "seismic testing, dams, wind farms and power plants" no longer required any federal environmental assessment. She also claimed that because the CEAA 2012—which she claimed was rushed through Parliament—dismantled the CEAA 1995, the Oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment.&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012"&gt;{{cite parl|date=26 September 2012|title=Question period|location=Ottawa, ON|author=Megan Leslie|url=http://openparliament.ca/debates/2012/9/26/megan-leslie-1/|publisher=Open Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Peter Kent (Minister of the Environment) explained that the CEAA 2012 "provides for the Government of Canada and the Environmental Assessment Agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country." The 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under CEAA 1995 became the "responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt; Anne Minh-Thu Quach, MP for Beauharnois—Salaberry, QC, argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting Canadians about the "colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments." She claimed that the federal government is entering into "limited consultations, by invitation only, months after the damage was done."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt;

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 [[Aarhus Convention]], and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment] from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907140138/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ |date=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

=== India ===
The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014734/http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MCL LLC|title=Evaluation of impact on surroundings|url=http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|website=MCL LLC|publisher=Eric Firado|accessdate=1 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043929/http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J. Peyton |year=2012 |title=Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User's Guide to Best Professional Practices |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439808825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application shall be achieved by the willing of counties authorities. / Aphro10

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thissen and Agusdinata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thissen |first1=WIH |last2=Agusdinata |first2=DB |year=2008 |title=Handling deep uncertainties in impact assessment|url= |journal=In proceedings of the 28th annual conference of the IAIA May 5–9, 2008, Perth, Australia. |publisher=IAIA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

The '''European Civil Service''' is a generic term applied to all staff serving the [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]] and [[Agencies of the European Union|agencies]] of the [[European Union]] (EU). Although recruitment is sometimes done jointly, each institution is responsible for its own internal structures and hierarchies.

==Principles of public service==
The rules, principles, standards and working conditions of the European civil service are set out in the ''Staff Regulations''.&lt;ref name="StaffRegs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A01962R0031-20140701|title=EUR-Lex - 01962R0031-20140701 - EN - EUR-Lex|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Ombudsman]] has summarised the following five principles of public service which apply to all staff of the EU institutions:&lt;ref name="Ombudsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/resources/publicserviceprinciples.faces|title=Public service principles for the EU civil service|first=European|last=Ombudsman|date=|website=www.ombudsman.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission's civil service is headed by a [[Secretary-General of the European Commission|Secretary General]], currently [[Martin Selmayr]] who succeeded Alexander Italianer in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Florian|title=Martin Selmayr secures Commission top job|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/martin-selmayr-secures-commission-top-job/|website=POLITICO|publisher=Politico|accessdate=10 March 2018|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures published by the Commission, 24,428 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in their 2016 budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/pressreleases/2016/howmanypeopleworkfortheeu.html|title=How many people work for the EU?|last=Huggins|first=Christopher|date=2016-06-03|website=News and Events|publisher=Keele University|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, 9066 "external staff" were employed; these are largely people employed on time-limited contracts (called "contractual agents" in the jargon), staff seconded from national administrations (called "Detached National Experts"), or [[Traineeship scheme of the European Commission|trainees]] (called "stagiaires"). The single largest DG is the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], with 2261 staff.&lt;ref name="staff figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Service: Staff figures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular terminology===
European civil servants are sometimes referred to in the anglophone press as "[[Eurocrat]]s" (a term coined by [[Richard Mayne (journalist)|Richard Mayne]], a journalist and personal assistant to the first Commission president, [[Walter Hallstein]]).&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/dec/21/richard-mayne-obituary|title=Richard Mayne obituary|date=22 December 2009|work=The Guardian|page=30|accessdate=22 December 2009 | location=London | first=Gillian | last=Tindall}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-ranking officials are sometimes referred to as "European [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission|last=Eppink|first=Derk-Jan|publisher=Lannoo|year=2007|isbn=978-9020970227|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

These terms are sometimes erroneously used by the anglophone press, usually as a derogatory slur, to describe [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]], or [[European Commissioner|European Commissioners]]. MEPs are directly elected representatives, whilst the European Commissioners, despite often being confused as civil servants, are politicians holding public office and accountable to the European Parliament. Much like [[government ministers]] at the national level, they instruct the policy direction of the civil service.

===Nationality===
There are staff from all member states, with the largest group being [[Belgium|Belgian]] (17.8% – 4,193), with [[France|French]] and [[Italy|Italian]] servants following with about 2,500 (10%).&lt;ref name="staff figures"/&gt;

Most administration is based in the [[Brussels|Belgian capital]],&lt;ref name="staff figures"/&gt; Often, those states under-represented in the service tend to have more of their nationals in the higher ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualifications===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The qualifications needed to enter the European civil service depend on whether the job is a specialist one and the grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/europeanunionofficial.aspx|title=Entry requirements|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Job profiles European Union official|publisher=UK Government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the entry qualifications for the European civil service is that the candidate speak at least two of the official European languages, one of which must be English, French or German. Candidates whose mother tongue is English, French or German must pass the competition for entry in one of the other two official languages.

Prior to their first promotion, officials must demonstrate competence in a third EU official language.

A candidate also needs to have a first degree in any discipline. The services have traditionally hired candidates with degrees in Law, Economics, or Audit; competition is tougher for graduates of all other disciplines, although the procedure for the open competitions, known as "Concours", is now under review.

===Grades===
Staff are divided into a set of grades: from AD 5, the most junior administrator grade, to AD 16, which is a director-general (AD = administrator). Alongside the AD category is AST (assistant). It is now possible for civil servants to be promoted from AST to AD grade, not previously possible (see below); however in practice the grades remain entrenched.&lt;ref name="Eppink, 2007, p.37"&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; While promotion is in theory according to merit, many management posts are now taken by officials 'parachuted in' from member states. Moreover, staff reforms introduced in 2004 have severely reduced the possibilities for career progression and have created divisions within the service, with pre-2004 entrants enjoying greater pay and privileges. According to the Commission's own internal statistics, even though new officials possess an average of eight years work experience, it would take an average of over 40 years to climb from AD 5 to AD 16.

Prior to this new system, introduced in the 2000s (decade), civil servants were traditionally divided into four categories. "A" was policy making (what is now AD), "B' was implementing, "C" was secretarial and "D" was drivers and messengers (B, C and D are now all part of the AST category). There were various grades in each category. The major ranks used to be in the form of A8 (new appointment without prior work experience) to A1 (director-general).&lt;ref name="Eppink, 2007, p.37"/&gt;

===Salary and allowances===
{{Citation needed span|date=January 2016|text=EU civil and other servants work 40 hours a week, though they are theoretically available 24/7. }} They receive a minimum of 24 days of leave a year (maximum of 30), {{Citation needed span|date=January 2016|text=with additional leave entitlements on grounds of age, grade but no longer distance from home country (this is now a flat-rate 2.5 days for all)}}.

The lowest grades receive between €1.618,83 gross (FG 1 step 1)&lt;ref name="salary FG1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/toc100_en.pdf Chapter 7, page II-30, Staff Regulation],&lt;/ref&gt; each month, while the highest grades (AD 15–16 – i.e. Directors General at the end of their career) receives between €14,822.86 and €16,094.79 a month. This salary is taxed by the EU, rather than at the national level. Taxation varies between 8% and 45% depending on individual circumstances. This is paid into the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]].&lt;ref name="salary"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:124:0001:0118:EN:PDF COUNCIL REGULATION (EC, EURATOM) No 723/2004], Annex I, Amendment 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings are augmented by allowances, such as allowances for those living outside their own country, those who are the principal earner in their household, those with children in full-time education, and those who are moving home in order to take up a position or leaving the service.
Earnings are also lowered by various additional taxes (i.e. "[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/thinktank/index.php/Special_levy Special Levy]" alias 'crisis levy' introduced in 1973 and increasing regularly every year) and indexes (for EU staff working out-side Brussels).

For a contribution of 2% basic salary, employees are provided with health insurance which covers a maximum of 85% of expenses (100% for serious injury).&lt;ref name="salary"/&gt; Employees have the right to a parental leave of six months per person and child during which they obtain an allowance and have (as of January 2014) the possibility of an extension by further 6 months with a smaller allowance.&lt;ref name="staff-reg-changes-2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/edz/pdf/swd/2013/swd-2013-0452-en.pdf|title=Summary document on changes relating to Staff Regulations review. Measures included in the compromise text agreed by COREPER on 28 June 2013 and voted in plenary session of the European Parliament on 2 July 2013. Ref. Ares(2013)2583641 – 05/07/2013|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 November 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation needed span|date=January 2016|text=Salaries were considerably reduced for new entrants from 1 May 2004 onwards as a result of a significant number of reforms effected by Commissioner Neil Kinnock. Staff undertaking the same work may receive very different salaries, depending on their date of recruitment. Careers are also sharply affected, with new staff tending to constitute a 'second division' of workers with limited managerial prospects. 
As a consequence of these changes, the institutions recruit with difficulty staff from certain countries like UK, Luxembourg, Denmark as wages are the same or lower than in the home country. For example, a Director General's salary is below what a senior executive with similar responsibilities could expect to be earning at the end of their career in the UK and in some countries (like Luxembourg) the lowest wages (FG I – FG II) are even under the legal [[minimum salary]] in the respective country, which raise the question about legality of such terms of employment.}}

In January 2010, The European Commission took the EU member states to court over the Member States' refusal to honour a long-standing formula under which wages for the staff of the European institutions are indexed to the salaries of national civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anz.com/edna/dictionary.asp?action=content&amp;content=wage_indexation|title=Glossary of terms - ANZ|author=|date=|website=www.anz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula led to a salary adjustment of 3.7% but the Council, representing the member states, was only willing to grant a pay rise of 1.85%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/pa/eu-civil-servant-pay-row-goes-court/article-188646&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the Council to set the pay rise to 1.85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/pa/eu-officials-win-pay-rise-battle-news-499987|title=EU officials win pay rise battle with member states|date=26 November 2010|publisher=EuroActiv|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the ECJ judges who would decide in this case would be themselves to benefit from any salary increase agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/6942443/EU-mounts-challenge-to-MEP-pay-rise-cuts.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Bruno | last=Waterfield | title=EU mounts challenge to MEP pay rise cuts | date=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be noted that the index is published and applied one year and half later, and this delay cause the quarrels like in the 2010 (full crisis) where should be applied the adaptation related to the increases of wages of the national civil servants from 2007–8; while in 2011 the index was already negative (as the national wages has been lowered).

===Pensions===
Employees contribute about 11.3% of their basic salary to a pension scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:348:0009:0009:EN:PDF COUNCIL REGULATION (EU, EURATOM) No 1295/2009 of 22 December 2009 adjusting with effect from 1 July 2009 the rate of contribution to the pension scheme of officials and other servants of the European Union]&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme does not constitute a separate, ring-fenced pension fund; rather, pension payments are made from the general administrative budget of the Commission.

Pensions are paid as a percentage of the final basic salary, with a ceiling of 70%, at an accrual rate of 1.8% per year of service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/job/official/index_en.htm|title=Permanent officials|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with a higher accrual rate of 1.9% per year of service for those who entered service between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2013, and 2% per year of service for those who entered service before 1 May 2004&lt;ref name="staff-reg-changes-2013"/&gt;). The pensionable age is 66 years for staff entering service as of 1 January 2014, is between 63 and 65 years for those who entered service before 1 January 2014 but not earlier than 1 May 2004, and is between 60 and 65 years for those who entered service before 1 May 2004.&lt;ref name="staff-reg-changes-2013"/&gt; Early retirement is possible as of 58 years but a pension reduction coefficient of 3.5% is applied for each year before the pensionable age, except that for staff in place on 1 January 2014 the pension reduction coefficient is 1.75 for years not worked above the age of 60.&lt;ref name="staff-reg-changes-2013"/&gt;

Before 1 January 2014, the pensionable age had been 63 years for those who entered service on 1 May 2004 or later, and between 60 and 63 years for those who entered service before 1 May 2004. Early retirement was possible as of 55 years, albeit with a reduction of the pension due to the pension reduction coefficient of 3.5% per year before the pensionable age, except that a small percentage of officials could retire early without that pension reduction if it was in the interest of the service.&lt;ref name="pensions_en_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/human-resources/pensions_en.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325101012/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/human-resources/pensions_en.htm|title=Retirement pension and early retirement: Frequently asked questions|publisher=European Commission|date=6 January 2012|archive-date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate the changes implemented as of 2014, transitional pension rules were put in place for staff in place on 1 January 2014, which included setting the pensionable age for staff between 55 and 60 years of age on 1 January 2014 to lie between 60 and 61 years. Transition measures applied also to early retirement: Staff already aged 54 years or older on 1 January 2014 could still retire, with application of the pension reduction coefficient, in 2014 or 2015 at the age of 56 years or in 2016 at the age of 57 years.&lt;ref name="staff-reg-changes-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Irene Souka|url=http://www.u4unity.eu/document2/SR_HR20130712.pdf#page=12|title=Review of the Staff Regulations|date=July 2013|format=PDF|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1 May 2004, the pensionable age had been 60 years, and when this age was raised in 2004, this was accompanied by transition measures so that it remained unchangedly at 60 for officials aged 50 or more as well as for officials who had already completed 20 years of service or more on 1 May 2004, and it varied from 60 years and 2 months to 62 years and 8 months for officials aged 30 to 49 on 1 May 2004.&lt;ref name="pensions_en_2012"/&gt;

===Recruitment===
Recruitment is on the basis of competitions organised centrally by EPSO ([[European Personnel Selection Office]]) on the basis of qualifications and of the need for staff.

==Organisational culture==
During the 1980s, the Commission was primarily dominated by French, German and Italian cultural influences, including a strictly hierarchical organisation. Commissioners and Directors-General were referred to by their title (in French) with greater prestige for those of higher ranks. As one former servant, [[Derk Jan Eppink]] has put it, even after new staff had passed the tough entrance exams: "Those at the top counted for everything. Those at the bottom counted for nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this was the [[Chief of staff|chef de cabinet]] of [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]], [[Pascal Lamy]], who was particularly notable for his immense influence over other civil servants. He became known as the ''Beast of the [[Berlaymont building|Berlaymont]]'', the ''[[Gendarmerie|Gendarme]]'' and the ''[[Exocet]]'' due to his habit of ordering civil servants, even [[Directorate-General|Directors-General]] (head of departments) "precisely what to do – or else." He was seen as ruling Delors's office with a "rod of iron", with no-one able to bypass or manipulate him and those who tried being "banished to one of the less pleasant European postings".&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.22–3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the enlargement of the EU, and therefore the arrival of staff from the many newer Member States, there has been a change in the culture of the civil service. New civil servants from northern and eastern states brought in new influences while the Commission's focus has shifted more to "participation" and "consultation". A more egalitarian culture took over, with Commissioners no longer having a "status equivalent to a sun God" and, with this new populism, the first women were appointed to the Commission in the 1990s and the service gained its first female secretary general in 2006 ([[Catherine Day]]). In stark contrast to the 1980s, it is not uncommon to see men without ties and children playing football in the corridors.&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.34–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
It has been alleged that, for want of a common administrative culture, European Civil Servants are held together by a "common mission" which gives DGs a particularly enthusiastic attitude to the production of draft legislation regardless of the intentions of the Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; They are also notably bound by their common procedures, in the absence of a common administrative culture, which are best known by the [[Secretariat-General of the European Commission|Secretariat-General]], thus considered a prestigious office, just below the [[Cabinet (European Commission)|President's cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some criticism that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in [[wikt:turf war|turf war]]s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other, as is the case in national administrations. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner unless the Commissioner learns to assert control over his/her staff.&lt;ref name="LEM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Amies|first=Nick|title = Former EU Mandarin Spills the Beans on Commission Intrigue|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2007-09-21|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2790009,00.html|accessdate=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Releases"&gt;{{cite web|last =Mahony|first=Honor|title=EU carefully manages PR through 1000s of press releases|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007-10-17|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24971|accessdate=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DGs work closely with the [[Cabinet (European Commission)|Commissioner's cabinet]]. While the DG has responsibility for preparation of work and documents, the cabinet has responsibility for giving the Commissioner political guidance. However, in practice both seek a share of each other's work.&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that some DGs try to influence decision making by providing Commissioners with briefing documents as late and large as possible, ensuring that the Commissioner has no time to do anything but accept the version of facts presented by the DG. In doing this the DG is competing with the cabinet, which acts as a "[[bodyguard]]" for the Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Eppink, 2007, p.107-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational structure==

{{further|Directorate-General}}
The Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs or ''the services''), each headed by a director-general, and various other services. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External Relations or Translation and is under the responsibility of a [[European Commissioner]]. DGs prepare proposals for their Commissioners which can then be put forward for voting in the college of Commissioners.&lt;ref name="Europa Institutions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions of the EU: The European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623104055/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|archivedate=2007-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the Commission's DGs cover similar policy areas to the [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] in national governments, European Civil Servants have not necessarily been trained, or worked, in a national civil service before employment in the EU. On entry, they do not therefore share a common administrative culture.

===List of Directorates-General===
The Directorates-General are divided into four groups: Policy DGs, External relations DGs, General Service DGs and Internal Service DGs. Internally, the DGs are referred to by their [[abbreviation]]s; provided below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">The '''''Federal Appendix''''' is a [[case law]] [[reporter (law)|reporter]] published by [[West Publishing]].  It publishes [[judicial opinion]]s of the [[United States courts of appeals]] that have not been expressly selected or designated for publication.  Such "[[Non-publication|unpublished]]" cases are ostensibly without value as [[precedent]].  However, the Supreme Court made a change to the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] in 2006.  Now, Rule 32.1 says that federal circuit courts are not allowed to prohibit the citation of unpublished opinions issued on or after January 1, 2007.

Opinions of all the [[United States courts of appeals]] are included in the ''Federal Appendix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/Reporters/Federal-Appendix-National-Reporter-System/p/100000796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is the explanation from West's site, but why does this matter?  is it because of the cost in procuring them by other means?--&gt;  "Published" opinions of the U.S. courts of appeals are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]''.

The ''Federal Appendix'' organizes court opinions within each volume by the date of the decision, and includes the full text of the court's opinion.  West editors add headnotes that summarize key principles of law in the cases, and Key Numbers that classify the decisions by topic within the [[West American Digest System]].

However, unpublished opinions tend to be extremely concise and cryptic (especially when written by judges who are on record as disliking Rule 32.1), which limits their usefulness as precedent.  They often avoid a full explanation of the facts and law (as is traditionally found in full-length appellate opinions) by reciting that such things are already known to the parties, which makes it difficult for anyone unfamiliar with the entire file for that particular case to discern the exact contours of the court's holdings in the opinion.

Over 700 hardbound volumes of the ''Federal Appendix'' have been issued since it began publication in 2001.  Westlaw abbreviates citations to the Federal Appendix as '''Fed. Appx.''' The Bluebook calls for citations to the Federal Appendix to be abbreviated as '''F. App'x'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.legalbluebook.com/T-1-1|title=The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation|last=|first=|publisher=Harvard Law Review Association|others=Mary Miles Prince (Coordinating Editor)|year=2015|isbn=9780692400197|editor=Columbia Law Review Ass’n et al.|edition=20th|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=233|chapter=Table T1.1 Federal Judicial and Legislative Materials|oclc=986547050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate within the legal community about the desirability of designating certain judicial opinions as without precedential value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gant|first1=Scott E.|title=Missing the Forest for a Tree: Unpublished Opinions and New Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1|journal=Boston College Law Review|date=2006|volume=47|page=705|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol47/iss4/2|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Four Freedoms Monument''''' was commissioned by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] following his articulation of the "[[Four Freedoms]]" in his 1941 [[State of the Union Address]]. This was yet before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]  and the participation of the United States in [[World War II]]. Roosevelt felt that, through the medium of the arts, a far greater number of people could be inspired to appreciate the concept of the Four Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/133035|title= Four Freedoms Monument - Madison, Florida
|publisher =  floridamemory |accessdate= October 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Roosevelt, the four fundamental freedoms are:
* [[Freedom of speech|Freedom of speech and expression]]
* [[Freedom of worship]]
* [[Freedom from want]]
* [[Freedom from fear]]

The statue was created by [[sculptor]] [[Walter Russell]] later that year, and was dedicated in 1943 before a crowd of 60,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. It was dedicated to [[Colin P. Kelly]], one of the first recognized American heroes of [[World War II]]. On June 14, 1944, the monument was re-dedicated in Kelly's hometown of [[Madison, Florida]], with a speech by Governor [[Spessard Holland]].

The Four Freedoms monument in [[Evansville, Indiana]] was designed by Evansville architect Rupert Condict. It consists of  four 24-foot tall, ionic Indiana limestone columns, each with the inscription on it of one of the four freedoms. Surrounding these central columns are 50 uniformly shaped blocks representing the 50 states of the United States. Each block represents a state and shows its state seal and its date it became a state. The monument was dedicated in 1976 in commemoration of the [[United States Bicentennial]].

The Four Freedoms Monument of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] is located in the [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]] neighborhood. It consists of a single column, with one of the four freedoms printed on each side.  On top of the column is a sculpture of two hands holding a globe of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''General Order Number 38''' was issued by [[United States|American]] [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] general [[Ambrose Burnside]] on April 13, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]] while Burnside commanded the [[Department of the Ohio]]. Among other issues, the order attempted to make it illegal to criticize the war within that Department:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Henry Porter|title=Ohio Politics During the Civil War Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0npDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA159|year=1911|publisher=Columbia UP|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That hereafter all persons found within our lines who commit acts for the benefit of the enemies of our country, will be tried as spies or traitors, and, if convicted, will suffer death. This order includes the following classes of persons:

...

The habit of declaring sympathies for the enemy will no longer be tolerated in the department. Persons committing such offences will be at once arrested, with a view to being tried as above stated, or sent beyond our lines into the lines of their friends.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any kind of opposition to the war &amp;mdash; such as that expressed by the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] peace movement &amp;mdash; was considered sympathy to the enemy, and the order was immediately used as justification to arrest Ohio Representative Vallandigham, a prominent leader in the movement (in fact, he was arrested for criticizing the order itself) and to try him in a military court.

Burnside’s order inspired a political campaign song that mentioned [[Clement Vallandigham]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O, brothers, don't forget the time&lt;br /&gt;When Burnside was our fate,&lt;br /&gt;And laws were superseded&lt;br /&gt;By order 38.&lt;br /&gt;Then like a free-born western man,&lt;br /&gt;Our Val spoke bold and true,&lt;br /&gt;O, when he’s chosen governor&lt;br /&gt;What will poor Burnside do.&lt;br /&gt;Wont he skedaddle,&lt;br /&gt;As he’s well used to do.&lt;ref&gt;p. 177, Porter, George Henry. Ohio Politics During the Civil War Period. NY, NY, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37988">After the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], multiple [[Overview of gun laws by nation|gun laws]] were proposed in the United States at the federal and state levels. The shooting renewed debate about [[gun control]]. The debates focused on requiring [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|background checks]] on all firearm sales (called universal background checks), and on passing new and expanded [[assault weapon]] and [[high-capacity magazine ban]]s.

==Background==
On December 14, 2012, twenty children and seven adults were killed at [[Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in [[Newtown, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Barron121215/&gt; It was the deadliest primary or secondary [[school shooting]],&lt;ref name=Effron121214/&gt; the third-deadliest [[mass shooting]] by a single person,&lt;ref name=Candiotti-Ford121216/&gt; and one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=CNNLib131026/&gt;

==Initial response==
{{Main|Reactions to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting}}
Within hours of the shooting, a [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]] user started a petition asking the [[White House]] to "immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress,"&lt;ref name=Bruce121214/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wing121217/&gt; and the gun control advocacy group the [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] reported that an avalanche of donations caused its website to crash.&lt;ref name=New121214/&gt; That afternoon, President [[Barack Obama]] made a televised statement offering condolences on behalf of the nation to Connecticut governor, [[Dannel Malloy]] and saying, "we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."&lt;ref name=ObamaStmt121214/&gt; Speaking at a December 16 memorial service in Newtown, Obama said he would "use whatever power this office holds" to prevent similar tragedies.&lt;ref name=Landler-Baker121217/&gt; By December 17, the White House petition had more than 150,000 signatures,&lt;ref name=Wing121217/&gt; and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions.&lt;ref name=Levy121221/&gt;

A ''[[USA Today]]''/[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll conducted days after the shooting showed "mixed results" regarding public opinion on firearm laws.&lt;ref name=Madhani121226/&gt; While public support for strengthening gun laws rose 15 percent compared to a similar poll in 2011, there had been "little change in attitudes about some longstanding proposals, including the outlawing of assault rifles." A law requiring background checks for all gun-show sales was favored by 92 percent of Americans and a law banning the sale and possession of [[high-capacity magazine]]s (defined by the poll as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds) was supported by 62 percent of Americans. A record-high 74 percent opposed a ban on handguns and 51 percent opposed banning assault weapons.&lt;ref name=Saad121227/&gt;

==White House actions==
On December 19, 2012, President  Obama announced the formation of an inter-agency gun-violence task force headed by Vice President [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref name=ABCNews121219/&gt; The task force held 22 meetings and collected ideas from 229 organizations.&lt;ref name=Rucker-Wallsten130119/&gt;

The [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and congressional Republicans said that violent video games were a large part of the problem, but those did not end up on the final list of recommendations.&lt;ref name=Rucker-Wallsten130119/&gt; After meeting with Biden, the NRA issued a statement saying that it was "disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]."&lt;ref name=Madhani130110/&gt;
 
On January 16, 2013, President Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts: closing background check loopholes; banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; making schools safer; and increasing access to mental health services.&lt;ref name=WHNow-site/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHNow-full/&gt;{{rp|2}} The plan included 23 executive actions, signed immediately by the president, and 12 proposals for Congress.&lt;ref name=MacAskill-Pilkington/&gt;

The executive actions signed by President Obama were:&lt;ref name=NYT-WHProposal130116/&gt;
* Issuing a presidential memorandum to require federal agencies to make relevant data available to the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS).
* Addressing unnecessary legal barriers, particularly relating to the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), that may prevent states from making information available to NICS.
* Improving incentives for states to share information with NICS.
* Directing the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] to review categories of individuals prohibited from having a gun to make sure dangerous people are not slipping through the cracks.
* Proposing a rule making to give law enforcement authorities the ability to run a full background check on an individual before returning a seized gun.
* Publishing a letter from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) to federally licensed gun dealers providing guidance on how to run background checks for private sellers.
* Starting a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign.
* Reviewing safety standards for gun [[Trigger lock#Locks|locks]] and [[gun safe]]s ([[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]]).
* Issuing a presidential memorandum to require federal law enforcement to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations.
* Releasing a report analyzing information on lost and stolen guns and making it widely available to law enforcement authorities.
* Nominating an ATF director.
* Providing law enforcement authorities, first responders and school officials with proper training for armed attacks situations.
* Maximizing enforcement efforts to prevent [[gun violence]] and prosecute gun crime.
* Issuing a presidential memorandum directing the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to research gun violence.
* Directing the attorney general to issue a report on the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies and challenging the private sector to develop innovative technologies.
* Clarify that the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes.
* Releasing a letter to health care providers clarifying that no federal law prohibits them from reporting threats of violence to law enforcement authorities.
* Providing incentives for schools to hire school resource officers.
* Developing model emergency response plans for schools, houses of worship, and institutions of higher education.
* Releasing a letter to state health officials clarifying the scope of mental health services that [[Medicaid]] plans must cover.
* Finalizing regulations clarifying essential health benefits and parity requirements within insurance exchanges.
* Committing to finalizing [[Mental Health Parity Act|mental health parity]] regulations.
* Starting a national dialogue on mental health led by Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, and Arne Duncan, the secretary of education.

The White House's proposed congressional actions were these:&lt;ref name=NYT-WHProposal130116/&gt;
* Requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales, including those by private sellers that currently are exempt.
* Reinstating and strengthening the federal [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994 (AWB 1994) that expired in 2004.
* Limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.
* Banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than members of the military and law enforcement.
* Increasing criminal penalties for [[Straw purchase|"straw purchasers"]] who pass the required background check to buy a gun on behalf of someone else.
* Acting on a $4 billion administration proposal to help keep 15,000 police officers on the street.
* Confirming President Obama's nominee for director of the (ATF).
* Eliminating a restriction that requires the ATF to allow the importation of weapons that are more than 50 years old.
* Financing programs to train more police officers, first responders and school officials on how to respond to active armed attacks.
* Provide additional $20 million to help expand the system that tracks violent deaths across the nation from 18 states to 50 states.
* Providing $30 million in grants to states to help schools develop emergency response plans.
* Providing financing to expand mental health programs for young people.

The proposals were opposed by the NRA and the [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]] (NSSF),&lt;ref name=Horwitz130116/&gt; and opposition was expected by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] legislators.&lt;ref name=MacAskill-Pilkington/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ130116/&gt;

==Advocacy groups actions==
On December 21, 2012 - between the formation of Biden's task force and the announcement of Obama's proposals - [[Wayne LaPierre]], executive vice president of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown. LaPierre said that [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990|gun-free school zones]] attract killers, and that "the media demonize lawful gun owners, amplify their cries for more laws, and fill the national media with misinformation and dishonest thinking that only delay meaningful action." He said, "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," and that debating legislation that won't work would be a waste of time. He called on Congress "to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation" so that every school in America would be safe when pupils returned to school in January 2013.  LaPierre announced that the NRA would develop a National Model School Shield Program for every American school that wants it.&lt;ref name=LaPierre121221/&gt;

After LaPierre's press conference, the Brady Campaign asked for donations to support its gun control advocacy and asked NRA members "who believe like we do, that we are better than this" to join its campaign.&lt;ref name=ConnorIsikoff/&gt; On January 8, 2013, former Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]], who was shot and injured in a [[2011 Tucson shooting|2011 shooting in Tucson]], launched [[Americans for Responsible Solutions]] to raise money for gun control efforts to counter the influence of powerful pro-gun groups such as the NRA.&lt;ref name=BBC130108/&gt;

==Congressional action==

===Proposed assault weapons ban===
{{Main|Assault Weapons Ban of 2013}}
On January 24, 2013, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and 24 Democratic cosponsors introduced {{USBill|113|S.|150}}, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013).&lt;ref name=CSPAN130124/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freedman130124/&gt; It was similar to the expired 1994 federal ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to be considered an [[assault weapon]], rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban.&lt;ref name=Kucinich130124/&gt; Gun-control advocates said the stricter test would make the weapons less appealing to gun enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=Freedman130124/&gt; In addition, it would have banned: 
*the sale, transfer, importation or manufacture of about 150 named firearms; 
*firearms with "[[Stock (firearms)|thumbhole stock]]s" and "[[bullet button]]s"; 
*the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines; 
*and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices (defined as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds).&lt;ref name=Kucinich130124/&gt;
It would have grandfathered in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempted 2,258 specific firearms "used for hunting or sporting purposes," of which only 33 were semiautomatic centerfire rifles.&lt;ref name=Kucinich130124/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chebium130124/&gt;

Feinstein wanted the grandfathered firearms registered under the [[National Firearms Act]], which currently registers [[machinegun]]s, [[Suppressor|silencer]]s and [[short barreled shotgun]]s.&lt;ref name=Summary121226/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1iYl0coIOY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-span.org/video/?310086-1/senators-feinstein-blumenthal-react-nra&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2013, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] approved the bill, though it was not expected to clear the full Senate or the [[United States House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref name=Steinhauer130314/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxNews130314/&gt; Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] decided to leave the proposed ban out of the broader gun control bill, saying that it was unlikely to win 40 votes in the 100-member chamber and that it would jeopardize more widely supported proposals.&lt;ref name=Simon130417/&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren130417/&gt; On the morning of April 17, 2013, the bill failed on a vote of 40 to 60. It was supported by Democrat Reid and Republican Senator [[Mark Kirk]], but 15 Democrats, one [[Independent (politician)|independent]], and all the Republicans except Kirk voted against the ban.&lt;ref name=Simon130417/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vote 101 - Rejects Feinstein Proposal to Reinstate Assault Weapons Ban|url=https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/113/senate/1/101|website=ProPublica|publisher=Pro Publica Inc.|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed universal background checks===
The Manchin-Toomey Amendment was a bi-partisan piece of legislation sponsored by [[Joe Manchin]], a Democrat, and Republican Sen.

==State actions==
{{See also|Gun laws in the United States by state|Assault weapons legislation in the United States#State assault weapon bans|l2=State assault weapon bans}}
{{As of|2013|4|3|df=us}}, only five states had passed stricter gun control laws, while ten states had passed laws that weakened restrictions on firearms.&lt;ref name=Hartmann130403/&gt;

===Connecticut===

In the early morning hours of April 4, 2013, the [[Connecticut General Assembly]] passed new restrictions to the state's existing assault weapons ban. Governor [[Dannel Malloy]] signed them into law later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 4, 2013 |title=Connecticut Governor Signs Gun Measures |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/nyregion/connecticut-lawmakers-pass-gun-limits.html |newspaper=New York Times |location= |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law  banned the sale or purchase of [[High-capacity magazine#Capacity|magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition]] like those used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and required universal background checks for all firearm purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Brady |first2=Britanny |date=April 4, 2013 |title=Connecticut governor signs sweeping gun measure |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/04/us/connecticut-gun-law-overhaul/ |newspaper= |location= |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun owners challenged the law, but federal judge [[Alfred Covello]] upheld the law, ruling it constitutional and writing, "While the act burdens the plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights, it is substantially related to the important governmental interest of public safety and crime control." Gun owners said they would appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pazniokas |first=Mark |date=January 30, 2014 |title=Federal judge upholds Sandy Hook gun law |url=http://ctmirror.org/federal-judge-upholds-sandy-hook-gun-law/ |newspaper=Connecticut Mirror |location= |publisher=Connecticut News Project |accessdate=April 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' reported that Connecticut had processed about 50,000 assault weapons certificates, but that anywhere from 50,000 to 350,000 remained unregistered. "And that means," wrote the ''Courant's'' Dan Haar, "as of Jan. 1, Connecticut has very likely created tens of thousands of newly minted criminals — perhaps 100,000 people, almost certainly at least 20,000 — who have broken no other laws."&lt;ref name=Haar140210/&gt; [[Frank Miniter]] wrote in an April 2014 ''[[Forbes]]'' [[op-ed]] "that more than 300,000 Connecticut residents decided not to register their 'assault weapons,' moved them out of state, or sold them."&lt;ref name=Miniter140413/&gt;

===New York===

In January 2013, New York became the first U.S. state to act after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act passed in the state Senate 43-18 on January 15 and cleared the [[New York State Assembly]] after about five hours of debate on Tuesday, January 16. It was signed by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] one hour later. The act expanded the definition of assault weapons banned in New York, created a state database for pistol permits, reduced the maximum number of rounds legally allowed in magazines to seven from ten, and required universal background checks on all gun sales.&lt;ref name=Seiler130116/&gt;

A dozen Republican conference members voted for the measure, but its Senate Republican leader did not attend the signing ceremony.&lt;ref name=Seiler130116/&gt; The NRA called the assembly's actions "a secretive end run around the legislative and democratic process ... with no committee hearings and no public input," and said the law was "draconian."&lt;ref name=Seiler130116/&gt;

In a related move, the state comptroller announced that the state's pension fund would freeze its investments in publicly traded firearm manufacturers. The fund's holdings in [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] had been sold in December, after the Connecticut shootings.&lt;ref name=Seiler130116/&gt;

Provisions of the SAFE Act have been challenged. On December 31, 2013, a federal court judge struck down the act's limit of seven rounds in magazines capable of holding 10, but upheld its expanded ban on assault weapons.&lt;ref name=Spector131231/&gt; As of April 2014 that decision was under appeal, and another challenge, that the bill was improperly fast-tracked, was dismissed by a trial-level judge. The plaintiff said that he will take that decision to the [[New York Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name=Klepper140416/&gt;

Non-compliance with this new law has been reported in New York. [[Frank Miniter]] wrote in an April 2014 ''[[Forbes]]'' [[op-ed]] that one million residents own "assault weapons" and "high-capacity magazines" (which he says are political terms). He wrote that many had decided to practice civil disobedience and not register their weapons, a class A misdemeanor with a potential sentence of one year in prison.&lt;ref name=Miniter140413/&gt; ''USA Today'' reported that some owners threatened not to register their weapons, and that some chose to bypass registration by modifying or selling them before the April 15 deadline. State police say they cannot report how many people have registered. By law, they must keep their database of assault weapon owners private.&lt;ref name=Campbell140413/&gt;

===Maryland===

Late on April 4, 2013, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed Governor [[Martin O'Malley]]'s gun control bill, the Firearm Safety Act of 2013. It bans the purchase of 45 types of assault weapons and limits gun magazines to 10 rounds. It requires handgun licensing and fingerprinting for new gun owners, and bans those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from buying a gun.&lt;ref name=Jackson130405/&gt;

The '''International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972''' ('''COLREGs''') are published by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and set out, among other things, the "rules of the road" or navigation rules to be followed by ships and other vessels at sea to prevent collisions between two or more vessels.&lt;ref name="imo"&gt;[http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=257&amp;doc_id=649 ''Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGs)''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014023731/http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=257&amp;doc_id=649 |date=14 October 2009 }}, from the IMO (The International Maritime Organisation).

Retrieved 6 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; COLREGs can also refer to the specific political line that divides [[Inland waterways of the United States|inland waterways]], which are subject to their own navigation rules, and coastal waterways which are subject to international navigation rules. The COLREGs are derived from a [[multilateral treaty]] called the '''Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea'''.

Although rules for navigating vessels inland may differ, the international rules specify that they should be as closely in line with the international rules as possible. In most of [[continental Europe]], the [[Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure]] (CEVNI, or the European Code for Navigation on Inland Waters) apply. In the United States, the rules for vessels navigating inland are published alongside the international rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=navRulesContent ''Navigation Rules''], from the U.S. Coast Guard. Retrieved 16 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]], which govern the conduct of [[yacht racing|yacht]] and [[dinghy racing]] under the sanction of national sailing authorities which are members of the [[International Sailing Federation]] (ISAF), are based on the COLREGs, but differ in some important matters such as overtaking and [[right of way (shipping)|right of way]] close to turning marks in competitive sailing.

==History==
Prior to the development of a single set of international rules and practices, there existed separate practices and various conventions and informal procedures in different parts of the world, as advanced by various maritime nations. As a result, there were inconsistencies and even contradictions that gave rise to unintended collisions. Vessel navigation lights for operating in darkness as well as navigation marks also were not standardised, giving rise to dangerous confusion and ambiguity between vessels at risk of colliding.

With the advent of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, conventions for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions for power-driven vessel navigation. Sailing vessels are limited as to their manoeuvrability in that they cannot sail directly into the wind and cannot be readily navigated in the absence of wind. On the other hand, steamships can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and can be manoeuvred irrespective of the presence or absence of wind.

In 1840 in London, the [[Trinity House]] drew up a set of regulations which were enacted by Parliament in 1846. The Trinity House rules were included in the [[Steam Navigation Act 1846]], and the Admiralty regulations regarding lights for steam ships were included in this statute in 1848. In 1849 Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels on US&amp;nbsp;waters. In the UK in 1858 coloured sidelights were recommended for sailing vessels and fog signals were required to be given, by steam vessels on the ships whistle and by sailing vessels on the [[fog horn]] or bell, while a separate but similar action was also taken in the United States.

In 1850, English maritime Law was being adopted in the United States.&lt;ref name="US Maritime Law 1850"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/51/557/case.html |title=St. John v. Paine, 51 U.S. 557 |journal=[[United States Reports]] |volume=51 |page=557 |date=December 1850 |quote=Among the nautical rules applicable to the navigation of sailing vessels are the following, viz.: A vessel that has the wind free or sailing before or with the wind must get out of the way of the vessel that is close-hauled, or sailing by or against it and the vessel on the starboard tack has a right to keep her course, and the one on the larboard tack must give way or be answerable for the consequences. So when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the wind free and consequently the power of readily controlling their movements, the vessel on the larboard tack must give way and each pass to the right. The same rule governs vessels sailing on the wind and approaching each other when it is doubtful which is to windward. But if the vessel on the larboard tack is so far to windward that if both persist in their course, the other will strike her on the lee side abaft the beam or near the stern, in that case the vessel on the starboard tack should give way, as she can do so with greater facility and less loss of time and distance than the other. Again, when vessels are crossing each other in opposite directions and there is the least doubt of their going clear, the vessel on the starboard tack should persevere in her course, while that on the larboard tack should bear up, or keep away before the wind. ... ''no one can look through the reports in admiralty in England without being struck with the steadiness and rigor with which these general nautical rules have been enforced in cases of collision, under the advice of the Trinity Masters of that court, or fail to be impressed with the justice and propriety of such application and the salutary results flowing from it.'' [emphasis added]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1850, courts in the England and the United States adopted [[common law]] pertaining to reasonable speed within the [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead]].&lt;ref name="common law"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32437121385120;view=1up;seq=575 |title=The Europa |journal=English Reports in Law and Equity |volume=2 |pages=557–564 |date=June 11, 1850 |author1=Great Britain.

Stebbins, 51 U.S. 586 |journal=[[United States Reports]] |volume=51 |page=586 |date=December 1850 |quote=...it may be a matter of convenience that steam vessels should proceed with great rapidity, but the law will not justify them in proceeding with such rapidity if the property and lives of other persons are thereby endangered. ... It is a mistake to suppose that a rigorous enforcement of the necessity of adopting precautionary measures by the persons in charge of steamboats to avoid damage to sailing vessels on our rivers and internal waters will have the effect to produce carelessness and neglect on the part of the persons in charge of the latter. The vast speed and power of the former, and consequent serious damage to the latter in case of a collision, will always be found a sufficient admonition to care and vigilance on their part. A collision usually results in the destruction of the sailing vessel, and not unfrequently in the loss of the lives of persons on board.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863 a new set of rules drawn up by the British [[Board of Trade]], in consultation with the French government, came into force. By 1864 the regulations (or Articles) had been adopted by more than thirty maritime countries, including Germany and the United States (passed by the United States Congress as ''Rules to prevent Collisions at Sea.'' An act fixing certain rules and regulations for preventing collisions on the water. 29 April 1864, ch. 69.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. ''Statutes at Large, 1789–1875''. http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwsllink.html&lt;/ref&gt; and signed into law by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]).

In 1867, [[Thomas Gray (Surveyor)|Thomas Gray]], assistant secretary to the Maritime Department of the Board of Trade, wrote ''The Rule of the Road'', a pamphlet that became famous for its well-known [[mnemonic]] verses.

In 1878, the United States codified its common law rules for preventing collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=rs&amp;page=815 |title=Revised Statutes (1878), Title XLVIII (48), Chapter 5: Navigation, Section 4233, rules for preventing collisions |publisher=[[Congress of the United States]] |date=1878 |quote=Rule twenty-one. Every steam-vessel, when approaching another vessel, so as to involve risk of collision, shall slacken her speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse: and every steam-vessel shall, when in a fog, go at a moderate speed... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, the 1863 Articles were supplemented with whistle signals and in 1884 a new set of international regulations was implemented.

In 1889 the United States convened the first international maritime conference in Washington, D.C. The resulting rules were adopted in 1890 and effected in 1897. Some minor changes were made during the 1910 [[Brussels]] Maritime Conference and some rule changes were proposed, but never ratified, at the 1929 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea&amp;nbsp;(S.O.L.A.S.) With the recommendation that the direction of a turn be referenced by the rudder instead of the helm or tiller being informally agreed by all maritime nations in 1935.

The 1948 S.O.L.A.S. International Conference made several recommendations, including the recognition of [[radar]] these were eventually ratified in 1952 and became effective in 1954. Further recommendations were made by a S.O.L.A.S. Conference in London in 1960 which became effective in 1965

The ''International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea'' were adopted as a [[treaty|convention]] of the International Maritime Organization on 20 October 1972 and entered into force on 15 July 1977. They were designed to update and replace the Collision Regulations of 1960, particularly with regard to [[Traffic Separation Scheme]]s&amp;nbsp;(TSS) following the first of these, introduced in the [[Strait of Dover]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="imo"/&gt; As of June 2013, the convention has been ratified by 155 states representing 98.7% of the tonnage of the world's merchant fleets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130827232026/http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/Status%20-%202013.pdf Ratification status of IMO Conventions].&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been amended several times since their first adoption. In 1981 Rule&amp;nbsp;10 was amended with regard to dredging or surveying in traffic separation schemes. In 1987 amendments were made to several rules, including rule&amp;nbsp;1(e) for vessels of special construction; rule&amp;nbsp;3(h), vessels constrained by her draught and Rule&amp;nbsp;10(c), crossing traffic lanes. In 1989 Rule&amp;nbsp;10 was altered to stop unnecessary use of the inshore traffic zones associated with TSS. In 1993 amendments were made concerning the positioning of lights on vessels. In 2001 new rules were added relating to [[ground effect vehicle|wing-in-ground-effect]] (WIG) craft and in 2007 the text of Annex&amp;nbsp;IV (Distress signals) was rewritten.&lt;ref name="imo"/&gt;

Rather, there can be a "give way" (burdened) vessel and a "stand on" (privileged) vessel, or there may be two give way vessels with no stand on vessel. A stand on vessel does not have an absolute right of way over any give way vessel, for if there is a risk of collision, a stand on vessel may still be obliged (under Rule 2 and Rule 17) to give way so as to avoid it, if doing so will be effective and is practicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepia.com/media/73226/Colregs-Rule-02-Responsibility.PDF|title=COLREGS Rule 2 - Responsibility|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepia.com/media/73256/Colregs-Rule-17-Action-by-Stand-On-Vessel.PDF|title=COLREGS Rule 17 - Action by Stand-On Vessel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two power-driven vessels approaching each other head-to-head, are ''both'' deemed to be "give way" and both are required to alter course so as to avoid colliding with the other.

===Part A – General===
; 1. Application
:(a) These rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.
:(b) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for [[roadstead]]s, [[harbour]]s, rivers, lakes, or inland waterways connected with the [[International waters|high seas]] and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.
:(c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rule made by the government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorised elsewhere under these Rules
:(d) Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.
:(e) Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of any special construction or purpose cannot comply with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.
; 2. Responsibility
:(a) Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case
:(b) In construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger
[Rule 2 is sometimes referred to as the "General Prudential" rule and provides for non-conformance with stated rules to prevent a collision, because what is paramount is to avoid or minimise the damaging effects of a collision, as opposed to blindly following the rules to the letter. The overall intent is to minimise actual collision taking place rather than rule compliance in and of itself, per&amp;nbsp;se.]
; 3. General Definitions
For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires:
:(a) The word "vessel" includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, [[Ground effect vehicle|wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle]], and [[seaplane]]s, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.
:(b) The term "power-driven vessel" means any vessel propelled by machinery.
:(c) The term "sailing vessel" means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.
:(d) The term "vessel engaged in fishing" means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict manoeuvrability, but does not include a vessel fishing with [[Trolling (fishing)|trolling]] lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manoeuvrability.
:(e) The word "seaplane" includes any aircraft designed to manoeuvre on the water.
:(f) The term "vessel not under command" means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.
:(g) The term "vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre" means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. The term "vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre" shall include but not be limited to:
:*(i) a vessel engaged in laying, servicing, or picking up a navigation mark, [[submarine cable]] or pipeline;
:*(ii) a vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations;
:*(iii) a vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway;
:*(iv) a vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft;
:*(v) a vessel engaged in mine clearance operations;
:*(vi) a vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.
:(h) The term "vessel constrained by her draught" means a power-driven vessel which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following.
:(i) The word "underway" means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.
:(j) The words "length" and "breadth" of a vessel mean her [[length overall]] and greatest breadth.
:(k) Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.
:(l) The term "restricted visibility" means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms, or other similar causes.
:(m) The term "Wing-In-Ground (WIG) craft" means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by using surface-effect action.

===Part B – Steering and sailing===

====Section I (Conduct of vessel in any condition of visibility)====
; 4. Application
: The rules apply in any condition of visibility (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;in sight or in restricted visibility).
; 5. Look-out
: Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.
; 6. Safe speed
: Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.
In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

(a) By all vessels:
:* (i) the state of visibility;
:* (ii) the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;
:* (iii) the maneuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;
:* (iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;
:* (v) the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;
:* (vi) the draught in relation to the available depth of water.
(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:
:* (i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;
:* (ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;
:* (iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference;
:* (iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;
:* (v) the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar;
:* (vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.
; 7. Risk of collision
: Vessels must use all available means to determine the risk of a [[Ship collision|collision]], including the use of radar (if available) to get early warning of the risk of collision by radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects. (e.g. ARPA, AIS).
: If the distance of any vessel is reducing and [[proportional navigation|her compass bearing is not changing much]] or it is a large vessel or towing vessel at close distance, or if there is any doubt, then a risk of collision shall be deemed to exist.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}
; 8. Action to avoid collision
: Actions taken to avoid collision should be:
:* positive
:* obvious
:* made in good time
; 9. Narrow channels
:* A vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]].
:* Small vessels or sailing vessels must not impede (larger) vessels which can navigate only within a narrow channel.
:* Ships must not cross a channel if to do so would impede another vessel which can navigate only within that channel.
; 10. [[Traffic Separation Scheme]]s
: Ships must cross traffic lanes steering a course "as nearly as practicable" at right angles to the direction of traffic. This reduces confusion and enables that vessel to cross the lane as quickly as possible.
:Vessel entering a traffic separation scheme should do it at an angle as small as practicable.
: A traffic separation scheme does not relieve any vessel from complying with other rules.

==== Section II (Conduct of vessels in sight of one another) ====
; 11. Application
: The following rules 11–18 applies to vessels in sight of one another. (Section&amp;nbsp;III has specific requirements for restricted visibility)
; 12. Sailing vessels
: Two sailing vessels approaching one another must give-way as follows:
:* '''[[Port (nautical)|Port]] gives way to [[starboard]].''' When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind to port must give way;
:* '''[[Windward]] gives way to [[leeward]].''' When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is windward must give way to the vessel which is leeward;
:* '''Unsure port gives way.''' If a vessel, with the wind on the port side, sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or the starboard side, they must give way.
: For the purposes of this rule, the wind is considered to be coming from the side opposite the mainsail boom, or if the vessel is square rigged, opposite the largest fore-and-aft rigged sail, regardless of which side the true or apparent wind is on.
; 13. Overtaking
: Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules ...   ... an overtaking vessel must keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. "Overtaking" means approaching another vessel at more than 22.5&amp;nbsp;degrees abaft&lt;ref&gt;''Abaft the beam'' is a [[Glossary of nautical terms|nautical term]] denoting a relative bearing greater than 90&amp;nbsp;degrees from the [[Bow (ship)|bow]].&lt;/ref&gt; her beam, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;so that at night, the overtaking vessel would see only the stern light and neither of the sidelights of the vessel being overtaken.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}   Note that the opening words of this rule make clear that this rule overrides all other rules.
; 14. Head-on situations
: When two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard so that they pass on the port side of the other. "Head-on" means seeing the other vessel ahead or nearly ahead so that by night her masthead lights are actually or nearly lined up and/or seeing both her sidelights, or by day seeing a similar aspect of her.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}  "If you see three lights ahead, starboard wheel and show your red."
[[File:Regla 15.png|right|thumb]]
; 15. Crossing situations
: When two power-driven vessels are crossing, the vessel which has the other on the starboard side must give way and avoid crossing ahead of her.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}} The saying is "If to starboard red appear, 'tis your duty to keep clear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handling a Motor Boat|url=http://www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=P19080101.2.10.2|website=Papers Past|publisher=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=30 October 2010|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...Act as judgement says is proper: port or starboard, back or stop her."
; 16. The give-way vessel
: The give-way vessel must take early and substantial action to keep well clear.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}
; 17. The stand-on vessel
: The stand-on vessel shall maintain her course and speed, but she may take action to avoid collision if it becomes clear that the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action, or when so close that collision can no longer be avoided by the actions of the give-way vessel alone. In a crossing situation, the stand-on vessel should avoid turning to port even if the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action. These options for the stand-on vessel do not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligations under the rules.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}
; 18. Responsibilities between vessels
: Except in narrow channels, traffic separation schemes, and when overtaking (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;rules 9, 10, and 13)
:* A '''power-driven vessel''' must give way to:
:** a vessel not under command;
:** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre (this may include vessels towing one another);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colregs.info/the-collisions-regulations/part-a-general/rule-3-general-definitions/ |title=Rule 3 : General Definitions |website=Colregs for the Yachties |author= |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110721192843/http://www.colregs.info/the-collisions-regulations/part-a-general/rule-3-general-definitions/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:** a vessel engaged in fishing;
:** a sailing vessel.
:* A '''sailing vessel''' must give way to:
:** a vessel not under command;
:** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;
:** a vessel engaged in fishing.
:* A '''vessel engaged in fishing''' when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of:
:** a vessel not under command;
:** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.
:* Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre shall, if possible, not impede the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her [[Draft (hull)|draft]], exhibiting the signals in Rule&amp;nbsp;28.
:* A vessel constrained by her draft shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

====Section III (Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility)====
; 19. Conduct of vessel in restricted visibility
:(a) Rule 19 applies to vessels (not in sight of one another) in or near restricted visibility.
:(b) All ships shall proceed at a safe speed for the condition of visibility (see Rule 6). A power-driven vessel shall have her engine(s) on stand-by for immediate maneuver.
:(c) All ships shall comply with Section&amp;nbsp;I of this Part e.g.,&amp;nbsp;Rules 5 (lookout), 6 (safe speed), 7 (risk of collision), 8 (action to avoid collisions), 9 (narrow channels), and 10 (TSS) with due regard for the visibility conditions.
:(d) If another vessel is detected by radar alone, and a close-quarters or collision risk is suspected, a vessel should take early and substantial action to avoid the other, but:
: (i) avoid any turn to port for a vessel detected forward of the beam, except for a vessel being overtaken,
: (ii) avoid any change of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]].
: When the [[fog]] signal of another vessel is heard, apparently forward of the beam, a vessel should reduce speed to the minimum at which she can maintain her course, or if necessary stop, and navigate with extreme caution until there is no risk of collision.&lt;ref name="full_text_COLREGS"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

; 23. Lights displayed by power-driven vessels underway
:* A power-driven vessel underway must display:
:** a masthead light forward;
:** If over {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} length, then also a second masthead light aft and higher than the forward one; except that a vessel of less than 50 metres in length shall not be obliged to exhibit such light but may do so;

:* A power-driven vessel of less than {{convert|12|m|ft|1}} may display only an all-round white light and sidelights. However, in the case of a skiff a wooden clinker rowing boat which falls into this category only needs to be capable of showing a white light.
:* A power-driven vessel of less than {{convert|7|m|ft|1}} whose maximum speed does not exceed {{convert|7|kn|km/h mph|0}} must be capable of showing a white light
; 24. Lights for vessels towing and pushing
:* A power driven vessel when towing must show

:** a sternlight;
:** a towing light vertically above the sternlight;
:* if a pushing vessel and the vessel it is pushing are rigidly connected, they count together as a power driven vessel and must show the light prescribed by Rule 23.
:* If the pushing vessel and vessel being pushed are ''not'' rigidly connected, they must instead show:
:** two masthead lights on top of each other, instead of the masthead(s) prescribed in Rule 23;
:** sidelights;
:** a sternlight on the pushing vessel only.
:* Power driven vessels larger than {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} which are towing or pushing and are not part of a composite unit must also show:
:** a second masthead abaft of and higher than the forward one (vessels smaller than 50 metres may also show this light).
:* Vessels being towed that are not inconspicuous or partly submerged must show:
:** sidelights;
:** a sternlight;
:** a diamond shape if the tow is longer than {{convert|200|m|ft|0}}.
:* Any number of vessels being towed or pushed together shall be lit as one vessel, and
:** a vessel being pushed ahead must show sidelights at its forward end if it is not part of a composite unit;
:** a vessel being towed alongside must show a sternlight and sidelights at its forward end.
:* A vessel being towed that is inconspicuous or partly submerged must show:
:** if it is narrower than {{convert|25|m|ft|0}}, one all-round white light near the forward end (except if it is a dracone) and one near the after end;
:** if it is wider than {{convert|25|m|ft|0}}, then also two all round white lights at the extremities of its breadth;
:** if it is longer than {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}, then in a series of such all round white lights spaced no further than {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} apart;
:** a diamond shape near the end of the last vessel, and, if the tow is longer than {{convert|200|m|ft|0}}, another diamond shape as far forward as possible.
:** If for any reason it is not possible to light the vessel according to these rules, all possible measures must be taken to light the vessel and indicate its presence.
:** If the towing vessel is not normally engaged in towing operations and it is impractical to light it correctly, it is not obliged to show these lights if it is towing a vessel in distress or in need of assistance. All possible measures must be taken to show that it is towing; in particular the towline should be illuminated.

'''KickassTorrents''' (commonly abbreviated '''KAT''') was a website that provided a [[web directory|directory]] for [[torrent file]]s and [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]] to facilitate [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] using the [[BitTorrent]] protocol. It was founded in 2008 and by November 2014, KAT became the most visited BitTorrent directory in the world, overtaking [[The Pirate Bay]], according to the site's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/global;3|title=Alexa Top 500 Global Sites|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAT went offline on 20 July 2016 when the domain was seized by the U.S. government. The site's [[proxy servers]] were shut down by its staff at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/20/12243592/kickass-torrents-artem-vaulin-founder-arrested-domains-seized|title=KickassTorrents domains seized after alleged owner is arrested in Poland|accessdate=21 July 2016|date=20 July 2016|author=Nick Statt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, former KAT staff members revived the KAT community by creating a website with its predecessor's features and appearance.&lt;ref name="Revive" /&gt;

==Blocking and censorship==
KickassTorrents says that it complies with the [[DMCA]] and it removes infringing torrents reported by content owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kickass.to/dmca/|title=KAT DMCA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225023020/http://kickass.to/dmca/|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KAT was initially launched in November 2008 at the [[domain name]] kickasstorrents.com.

On 21 April 2011, KickassTorrents moved to the [[Philippines]] domain name kat.ph after a series of domain name seizures by the [[United States Department of Justice]] against [[Demonoid]] and [[Torrentz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ernesto |url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-moves-to-kat-ph-110422/ |title=KickassTorrents Moves to Kat.ph |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site later moved to several different domains, which the operators plan to do every six months, including ka.tt, kickass.to, kickass.so, kickasstorrents.im and kat.cr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-moves-to-isle-of-man-domain-name-150423|title=KickassTorrents Moves to Isle of Man Domain Name|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=23 April 2015|date=23 April 2015|author=Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2013, [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) in the [[United Kingdom]] were ordered by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London to block access to KickassTorrents, along with two other torrent sites. Judge [[Richard Arnold (judge)|Richard Arnold]] ruled that the site's design contributed to [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/28/online-piracy-isps-block-access |title=Online piracy: ISPs ordered to block access to three file-sharing websites|work=The Guardian |accessdate=1 March 2013|location=London|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bailii_2013"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=EMI Records Limited, Infectious Limited, Liberation Music Pty Limited, Polydor Limited, Simco Limited, Sony Music Entertainment UK Limited, Universal Music Operations Limited, Virgin Records Limited, Warner Music UK Limited, Weainternational Inc v British Sky Broadcasting Limited, British Telecommunications Plc, Everything Everywhere Limited, TalktalkTelecom Group Plc, Telefónica UK Limited, Virgin Media Limited|court= EWHC |division=Ch |year=2013 |num=379 |date=28 February 2013|courtname=auto |juris=England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2013, the domain name was changed to [[Tonga]] domain name kickass.to as a part of the site's regular domain change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kickass.to/blog/post/36016/ |title=Moving to Kickass.To&amp;nbsp;— Blog&amp;nbsp;— KickassTorrents |publisher=Kickass.to |accessdate=15 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314220809/http://kickass.to/blog/post/36016/ |archivedate=14 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2013, KAT was delisted from [[Google Search|Google]] at the [[MPAA#Anti-piracy efforts|request of the MPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-kicks-kickasstorrents-off-google-with-precision-takedown-130623/ |title=MPAA Kicks KickassTorrents Off Google With ‘Precision’ Takedown|publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=24 June 2013|date=23 June 2013|author=Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2013, KAT was blocked by [[Belgium|Belgian]] ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Belgische providers blokkeren meer torrentsites | url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/90965/belgische-providers-blokkeren-meer-torrentsites.html | language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, several [[Ireland|Irish]] ISPs started blocking KAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/irish-internet-providers-roll-out-kickasstorrents-blockade-140119/ |title=Irish Internet Providers Roll Out KickassTorrents Blockade |date=19 January 2014 |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, [[Twitter]] started blocking links to KAT, however by the end of February 2014, KAT was unblocked on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/twitter-blocks-kickass-links-says-theyre-unsafe-140221/ |title=Twitter Blocks Kickass.to Links, Says They're Unsafe |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=25 February 2014|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, KAT was blocked in [[Malaysia]] by the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] for violating copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnymalaysia.net/kickass-to-has-been-officially-blocked-in-malaysia/|title=Kickass.to has been officially blocked in Malaysia|date=25 June 2014|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the site moved to the [[Somalia]] domain name kickass.so. Reports stated that it was moved as a result of site's regular domain change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/KickassTorrent-Moves-Domain-to-Somalia-465257.shtml|title=KickassTorrent Moves Domain to Somalia|publisher=Softpedia News|accessdate=21 July 2016|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-moves-kickass-so-domain-name-141117/|title=KickassTorrents Moves to Kickass.so Domain Name|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=21 July 2016|date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2015, kickass.so was listed as "banned" on [[Whois]], causing the site to go offline. Later that day, the site reverted to its former domain name kickass.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-taken-domain-name-seizure-150209/|title=Kickass Torrents taken down by domain name seizure|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date = 9 February 2015|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2015, it was found that messages mentioning "kickass.to" were blocked on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] chat, but "kickass.so" and other popular torrent websites were not blocked, only flagged as "potentially malicious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/steam-censors-kickass-mentions-chat-client-150214/|title=Steam Censors Kickass.to Mentions in Chat Client|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date = 14 February 2015|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2015, the site moved to the [[Isle of Man]] based domain name kickasstorrents.im&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-moves-to-isle-of-man-domain-name-150423/|title = KickassTorrents Moves to Isle of Man Domain Name|date=23 April 2015|accessdate = 7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was quickly taken down later that day and on 24 April it was moved to the [[Costa Rica]] based domain name kat.cr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=KickassTorrents is moving to kat.cr domain

 |archivedate= 6 June 2015
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2015, the kat.cr address had been removed from [[Google Search]]'s results. After the removal, the top Google search result for KAT in many locations pointed to a fake KAT site that prompted visitors to download [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-disappears-from-google-after-penalty-150718/|title=KickassTorrents Disappears From Google After Penalty|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=20 July 2015|date=18 July 2015|author=Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[Portugal]] bypassed its courts by making a voluntary agreement between ISPs, rightsholders and the Ministry of Culture to block access to KAT and most of the other popular BitTorrent websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Portugal Blocks Popular Torrent and Streaming Sites| publisher=TorrentFreak|url = https://torrentfreak.com/portugal-blocks-popular-torrent-and-streaming-sites-151026/|accessdate = 21 July 2016|date=26 October 2015|author=Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, [[Google Chrome]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] blocked access to KAT because of security concerns with some of the ads pointing to malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-blocked-again-over-harmful-programs-151021/|title=KickassTorrents Blocked Again Over "Harmful Programs"|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=21 July 2016|author=Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox blocked KAT due to [[phishing]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chrome and Firefox Block KickassTorrents as "Phishing" Site|url=https://torrentfreak.com/chrome-and-firefox-block-kickasstorrents-as-phishing-site-160412/|accessdate=12 April 2016|work=TorrentFreak|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both blocks were later removed after KAT dealt with the concerns.

In June 2016, KAT added an official [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network .onion address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-enters-the-dark-web-adds-official-tor-address-160607/|title=KickassTorrents enters the dark webs, adds official Tor address|publisher=Torrentfreak|date=7 June 2016|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main domains of the site went up for sale in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetechverse.com/kickasstorrents-domain-sale/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810014110/https://www.thetechverse.com/kickasstorrents-domain-sale/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 August 2016|title=KickassTorrents Domain for Sale at just $230|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossbytes.com/kickasstorrents-main-domains-kat-cr-kickass-cr-sale/|title=KickassTorrents Domain Goes Up For Sale For A Minimum Bid of $230|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest of the alleged owner==
[[File:KickassTorrents Domain seizure.jpg|thumb|Notice displayed on KickassTorrents sites after its seizure.]]
On 20 July 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice]] announced that it had seized the KAT.cr domain and had identified its alleged owner. Artem Vaulin ({{Lang-uk|Артем Ваулін}}), a 30-year-old [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] man known online as "tirm", was detained in Poland after being charged with a four-count U.S. criminal indictment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/20/kickass-torrents-targeted-doj-feds-say-website-dis/|title=Kickass Torrents targeted by DOJ, feds say website distributed $1 billion in copyrighted works|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=20 July 2016|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining domains were taken offline voluntarily after the KAT.cr domain name was seized.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-kat-feds"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/feds-seize-kickasstorrents-domains-charge-owner-160720/|title=Feds Seize KickassTorrents Domains, Arrest Owner|work=[[TorrentFreak]]|last=Van der Sar|first=Ernesto|date=20 July 2016|access-date=21 July 2016|quote=At the time of writing the main domain name Kat.cr has trouble loading, but various proxies still appear to work.

Vaulin was arrested after investigators cross-referenced an [[IP address]] he used for an [[iTunes]] transaction with an IP address used to log into KAT's [[Facebook]] page. The [[FBI]] also posed as an advertiser and obtained details of a bank account associated with the site.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-kat-feds"/&gt; The investigation was led by special agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, who also tracked down [[Ross Ulbricht]], the operator of the online black market [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-21/how-the-us-government-brought-down-kickass-torrents/7649862|title=Kickass Torrents: How did the US Government bring down the file-sharing site?|work=news.com.au|last=Ockenden|first=Will|date=22 July 2016|access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal complaint, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] by [[Homeland Security Investigations]], said that it was in possession of full copies of KAT's hard drives, including its [[Message transfer agent|email server]]. The investigation suggested that KAT made over $12 million per year in advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/can-kickasstorrents-make-a-comeback-160721/|title=Can KickassTorrents Make a Comeback?|work=TorrentFreak|date=21 July 2016|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] followed the complaint with a full [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] of Vaulin and two other defendants, Ievgen Kutsenko and Oleksandr Radostin; while Vaulin was still being held in Polish prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-indicts-three-alleged-kickasstorrents-operators160825/ |title=U.S. Government Indicts Three Alleged KickassTorrents Operators|last=Van der Sar|first=Ernesto |work=TorrentFreak|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaulin has both a Polish and US legal representation [[Ira P.

==Revival==
In mid-December 2016, some of the former KAT staff and moderators launched a website with a similar appearance as the original under the domain katcr.co.&lt;ref name="Revive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kickasstorrents-brought-back-to-life-by-original-staffers-161216/|title=KickassTorrents Brought Back to Life by Original Staffers (Updated) - TorrentFreak|date=16 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Margot Betti Frank, named after maternal aunt Bettina Holländer (1898–1914), was born in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, to Jewish parents, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, [[Otto Frank]] and [[Edith Frank|Edith Frank-Holländer]], and also her younger sister  [[Anne Frank]], during the early years of her life.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

She attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] on January 30, 1933 to the position of [[chancellor]] in [[Germany]] brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of [[anti-semitism]], the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Edith Frank-Holländer and her daughters moved in with her mother in [[Aachen]] in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in [[Amsterdam]]. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address in Amsterdam South, and achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 [[Military history of the Netherlands during World War II|German invasion of the Netherlands]] demanded her removal to a Jewish [[lyceum]]. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools, and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at least her mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

While Anne inherited her father's ambivalence towards the [[Torah]], Margot followed her mother's example and became involved in Amsterdam's Jewish community. She took [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] classes, attended [[synagogue]], and in 1941 joined a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Zionism|Zionist]] club for young people who wanted to immigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to found a Jewish state, where, according to Anne, she wished to become a [[midwife]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family at her father's office building.{{Clarification needed|date=February 2018}} They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944.&lt;ref name=critical_edition&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Barnouw|editor2-first=Gerrold|editor2-last=Van Der Stroom|title=The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-50847-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MargotFrankStolpersteinAachen 8224.jpg|thumb|Stolperstein for Margot Frank at the Pastorplatz in Aachen, Germany]]

==Arrest and death==
Along with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch [[Westerbork concentration camp]]. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942, and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with [[Fritz Pfeffer]] and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] on October 30, where both contracted [[typhus]] in the winter of 1944.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Margot Frank died sometime in February 1945 at the age of 19 due to [[typhus]]. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. [[Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper]] and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the [[Netherlands]] and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both his daughters had died.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Otto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by [[Miep Gies]], which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her diary) but Margot's diary was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margot Frank|publisher=Anne Frank Stichting|url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/All-people/Margot-Frank/|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel ''[[The Silent Sister]]'' by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi. Letters written by both Frank sisters to American pen pals were published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traces.org/anne.html|title=Anne Frank and her Iowa Penpal|publisher=|access-date=2014-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209053251/http://traces.org/anne.html|archive-date=2013-12-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddy Elias]] (1925-2015) was Anne's first cousin and last surviving close relative.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''''Microsoft Corp v Commission''''' (2007) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62004TJ0201 T-201/04] is a case brought by the [[European Commission]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) against [[Microsoft]] for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to [[competition law]]). It started as a complaint from [[Sun Microsystems]] over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of [[Microsoft Windows]] without [[Windows Media Player]]. The European Commission especially focused on the interoperability issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leconcurrentialiste.com/2014/02/10/the-microsoft-case-by-the-numbers-comparison-between-u-s-and-e-u/|title=The Microsoft case by the numbers: comparison between U.S. and E.U.|author=|date=10 February 2014|website=leconcurrentialiste.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In 1993, [[Novell]] claimed that Microsoft was blocking its competitors out of the market through anti-competitive practices. The complaint centered on the license practices at the time which required royalties from each computer sold by a supplier of Microsoft's operating system, whether or not the unit actually contained the Windows operating system. Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1023_3-204317.html | title=Microsoft investigated in Europe | first=Lamia | last=Abu-Haidar | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | date=1997-10-16 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Sun Microsystems]] raised a complaint about the lack of disclosure of some of the interfaces to Windows NT. The case widened when the EU examined how [[streaming media]] technologies were integrated with Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001_3-941090.html | title=EU looks to wrap up Microsoft probe | publisher=CNET News.com| first=Declan | last=McCullagh | authorlink=Declan McCullagh | date=2002-07-01 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment ==
Citing ongoing abuse by Microsoft, the EU reached a preliminary decision in the case in 2003 and ordered the company to offer both a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and the information necessary for competing networking software to interact fully with Windows desktops and servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5060463.html | title=EU closes in on Microsoft penalty | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2003-08-06 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, the EU ordered Microsoft to pay [[Euro|€]]497 million ([[United States Dollar|$]]794 million or [[Pound sterling|£]]381 million), the largest fine ever handed out by the EU at the time, in addition to the previous penalties, which included 120 days to divulge the server information and 90 days to produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007D0053:EN:NOT Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft)| date=2007-06-02].

The next month Microsoft released a paper containing scathing commentary on the ruling including: "The commission is seeking to make new law that will have an adverse impact on intellectual property rights and the ability of dominant firms to innovate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5197390.html | title=Microsoft commentary slams EU ruling | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2004-04-21 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1014_3-5255715.html | title=Microsoft pays EU in full | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Matt | last=Hines | date=2004-07-02 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Neelie Kroes]] was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition; one of her first tasks was to oversee the fining brought onto Microsoft. Kroes has stated she believes [[open standards]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] are preferable to anything [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2544|title=Linux and Open Source - ZDNet|author=|date=|website=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The Commission must do its part.....It must not rely on one vendor, it must not accept closed standards, and it must refuse to become [[Vendor lock-in|locked into a particular technology]] – jeopardizing maintenance of full control over the information in its possession}}

==Significance==
Microsoft has a compliant version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player available under the negotiated name "[[Windows XP]] N".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5960750.html | title=Still 'no demand' for media-player-free Windows | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Ingrid | last=Marson | date=2005-11-18 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the server information requirement, Microsoft released the [[source code]], but not the specifications, to [[Windows Server 2003]] Service Pack 1 (SP1) to members of its Work Group Server Protocol Program (WSPP) on the day of the original deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://open.itworld.com/4914/060125ms_ups_ante/page_1.html |title=Microsoft ups the ante with the E.C. |publisher=ITworld.com |first=Neil |last=Macehiter |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630061120/http://open.itworld.com/4914/060125ms_ups_ante/page_1.html |archivedate=30 June 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also appealed the case, and the EU had a week-long hearing over it. [[Neelie Kroes]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/No-alternative-to-Microsoft-fine/2008-1014_3-6093104.html | title='No alternative' to Microsoft fine | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Dawn | last=Kawamoto | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Microsoft has claimed that its obligations in the decision are not clear, or that the obligations have changed. I cannot accept this characterization--Microsoft's obligations are clearly outlined in the 2004 decision and have remained constant since then.
Indeed, the monitoring trustee appointed in October 2005, from a shortlist put forward by Microsoft, believes that the decision clearly outlines what Microsoft is required to do. I must say that I find it difficult to imagine that a company like Microsoft does not understand the principles of how to document protocols in order to achieve interoperability.}}

Microsoft stated in June 2006 that it had begun to provide the EU with the requested information, but according to the [[BBC]] the EU stated that it was too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5120536.stm | title=Brussels poised to fine Microsoft | publisher=BBC | date=2006-06-27 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2006, the EU fined Microsoft for an additional €280.5 million (US$448.58 million), €1.5 million (US$2.39 million) per day from 16 December 2005 to 20 June 2006. The EU threatened to increase the fine to €3 million ($4.81 million) per day on 31 July 2006 if Microsoft did not comply by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeropaid.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-38334.html |title=EU fines Microsoft $357.3 million for defiance |publisher=Reuters |first=David |last=Lawsky |author2=Zawadzki, Sabina |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2006-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309135557/http://www.zeropaid.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-38334.html |archivedate=9 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2007, Microsoft lost their appeal against the European Commission's case.  The €497 million fine was upheld, as were the requirements regarding server interoperability information and bundling of Media Player.  In addition, Microsoft has to pay 80% of the legal costs of the Commission, while the Commission has to pay 20% of the legal costs by Microsoft. However, the appeal court rejected the Commission ruling that an independent monitoring trustee should have unlimited access to internal company organization in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6998272.stm Microsoft loses anti-trust appeal].

Microsoft announced that it will demand 0.4% of the revenue (rather than 5.95%) in patent-licensing royalties, only from commercial vendors of interoperable software and promised not to seek patent royalties from individual open source developers. The interoperability information alone is available for a one-time fee of €10,000 (US$15,992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63623,eu-forces-microsoft-to-cage-open-source-patent-dogs.aspx EU forces Microsoft to cage open source patent dogs]. itNews, 24 October 2007.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024201321/http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63623%2Ceu-forces-microsoft-to-cage-open-source-patent-dogs.aspx |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 2008, the EU fined Microsoft an additional €899 million (US$1.44 billion) for failure to comply with the March 2004 antitrust decision. This represented the largest penalty ever imposed in 50 years of EU competition policy until 2009, when the European Commission fined Intel €1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) for anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/137467-european-commission-gives-intel-record-fine-for-antitrust-violation|title=European Commission Gives Intel Record Fine for Antitrust Violation|first=|last=TechCrunch|date=13 May 2009|website=seekingalpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latest decision follows a prior €280.5 million fine for non-compliance, covering the period from 21 June 2006 until 21 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May 2008, Microsoft lodged an appeal in the European [[General Court (European Union)|Court of First Instance]] seeking to overturn the €899 million fine, officially stating that it intended to use the action as a "constructive effort to seek clarity from the court".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9084578&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top Update: Microsoft to appeal $1.3B EU fine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525142524/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9084578&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top |date=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2008 Annual Report Microsoft stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asay |first=Matt |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10005379-16.html |title=Microsoft's annual report: Open-source mental block &amp;#124; The Open Road |publisher=CNET News |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. The Commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.}}

On 27 June 2012, the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] upheld the fine, but reduced it from €899 million to €860 million.  The difference was due to a "miscalculation" by the European Commission.  The commission's decision to fine Microsoft was not challenged by the court, saying the company had blocked fair access to its markets.&lt;ref name=upheld&gt;{{cite news|title=In European Court, a Small Victory for Microsoft|author=James Kanter|date=27 June 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/global/in-european-court-a-small-victory-for-microsoft.html?_r=1|accessdate=28 June 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.U. competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, has said that such fines may not be effective in preventing anti-competitive behavior and that the commission now preferred to seek settlements that restrict businesses' plans instead.  As such, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Microsoft decision "a decision that could mark the end of an era in antitrust law in which regulators used big fines to bring technology giants to heel."&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;

A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company was "disappointed with the court’s ruling" and felt the company had "resolved [the commissions'] competition law concerns" in 2009, making the fine unnecessary.&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;  He declined to say whether Microsoft would file an appeal or not. Almunia called the ruling a vindication of the crackdown on Microsoft and warned "The judgment confirms that the imposition of such penalty payments remains an important tool at the commission’s disposal."&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;  He also claimed that the commission's actions against Microsoft had allowed "a range of innovative products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day" to reach the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft loses EU antitrust fine appeal|author=Charles Arthur|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/27/microsoft-loses-eu-antitrust-fine-appeal?newsfeed=true|accessdate=28 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fines will not be distributed to the companies that lost income due to Microsoft practices.  The money paid in fines to the European Court goes back into the EU budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/institutions_en.html|title=Competition policy and EU institutions - European Commission|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minerals and Mining Law''' of 1986 (PNDCL 153), as amended by the Minerals and Mining (Amendment) Act of 1994 (Act 475) and the minerals and mining bill of 2005 (law No. 703), regulates [[mining]] in [[Ghana]]. Under the Minerals and Mining Law, [[mining companies]] must pay [[Royalty payment|royalties]]; companies may also pay [[Corporate tax|corporate taxes]] at standard rates. Companies are exempt from [[custom duties]] on accessories, equipment, machinery, and plants used for mining operations, but must pay local [[Property tax|property taxes]] on their immovable properties.  The 1986 mining law had been instrumental in attracting more than $5 billion in foreign investment to the [[Mining industry of Ghana|Ghanaian mining industry]] between 1986 and 2002. The 1994 amendments reduced the 45% general mining corporate tax rate to 35%, which is the same as that imposed on other industries.

On December 15, 2005, the [[Parliament of Ghana|Ghanaian Parliament]] passed into law a new minerals and mining bill. Some of the provisions under the new Minerals and Mining Law, law No. 703, included access to mineral rights on a first-come, first-considered basis; a specific timeframe within which all applications are expected to be granted; the right for applicants to demand written reasons from the Minister if an application is rejected; the [[Government of Ghana|Government’s]] right to acquire land or authorize its occupation and use if the land is required for mining purposes; the establishment of a [[Cadastre|cadastral]] system for the administration of [[mineral rights]]; a provision establishing the range of royalty rates, which is not to be less than 3% or exceed 6% of total mining revenues; the Government’s right to obtain a 10% free-carried interest in mining leases; and the establishment of the period of duration of a mining lease, which is not to exceed 30 years and which may be renewed once for a period not to exceed an additional 30 years.

"'''Mission to Prey'''" is the title of an episode of the RTÉ programme ''[[Prime Time (Irish TV programme)|Prime Time]] Investigates'' broadcast in May 2011. It falsely accused an Irish catholic priest in Kenya of having fathered a child by engaging in [[child sexual abuse]]. It was described as "one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made" in the history of RTÉ broadcasting.

==The broadcast==
In January 2011 reporter [[Aoife Kavanagh]] and producer Mark Lappin, on a research trip to Kenya, believed they had found evidence of a sexual scandal involving [[Kevin Reynolds (priest)|Fr. Kevin Reynolds]], an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic]] priest. Their sources accused Fr. Kevin Reynolds of raping a teenage girl and fathering her child in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/aoife-kavanagh-journalist-who-made-the-headlines-2942507.html|title=Aoife Kavanagh: Journalist who made the headlines|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reporters_broadcasts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1119/1224307823957.html|title=Reporter's broadcasts in wake of libel finding 'unfair'|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_republic_government_probes_rte_libel_case&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15850770|title=Taoiseach cites 'grievous drop' in RTÉ standards over Fr Reynolds libel case|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (alleged) mother of the child verified these allegations. After a second research trip by the two, the executive producer of Prime Time Investigates, the editor of current affairs, and the Managing Director of News all agreed to broadcast the programme. A later investigation identified their actions as "groupthink" - all members of the team responsible for the broadcast believed that Father Reynolds was guilty. The RTÉ legal department also vetted the program and, despite misgivings, agreed with broadcasting the programme. An offer by Father Reynolds to carry out a paternity test was ignored by the RTÉ team.&lt;ref name="betty"/&gt;

The programme caused uproar across Ireland when the truth was later revealed.  As a result of the broadcast, Fr. Reynolds was removed from his home and from his parish ministry and his reputation was destroyed. It subsequently emerged that the allegations were baseless and that RTÉ had therefore defamed Fr. Kevin Reynolds. [[Director-General of RTÉ]] [[Noel Curran]] admitted the broadcasting of "Mission to Prey" was "one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made" in RTÉ's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1123/1224308004000.html?via=mr|title=RTÉ shelves investigative series and concedes 'grave mistake'|first=Paul|last=Cullen|author2=McGreevy, Ronan|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
''Prime Times Investigates'' was initially suspended as a result of the scandal and it was later announced that the program would be terminated and replaced with a different investigative program. The fact that such damaging material could be aired on the national television network without adequate prior fact-checking caused a political scandal in Ireland, and the Irish government ordered a government inquiry into the matter (one of four separate investigations into the broadcast).&lt;ref name=bbc_republic_government_probes_rte_libel_case/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themediareport.com/nov2011/rte-ireland-fr-kevin-reynolds-falsely-accused.htm Irish TV Network Defames Innocent Priest, Issues Apology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120012444/http://www.themediareport.com/nov2011/rte-ireland-fr-kevin-reynolds-falsely-accused.htm |date=20 November 2011 }}, ''The Media Report'', November 2011, accessed 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ's managing director of news Ed Mulhall and current affairs editor Ken O'Shea were replaced by Cillian de Paor and [[Steve Carson]] respectively. Ed Mulhall retired, while O'Shea and others connected with the program were later assigned to other duties in RTÉ.&lt;ref name=miriams_husband_reins/&gt; In November 2011, the head of the Irish Missionary Union had said Kavanagh's continuing presence on ''Morning Ireland'' after being found guilty of defaming Fr. Kevin Reynolds was "unfair and unjust" and a demonstration of "double standards" in the media.&lt;ref name=reporters_broadcasts/&gt; However, Kavanagh waited the six months until the formal investigation report was published and resigned on the day that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's report was issued in May 2012.&lt;ref name="betty"&gt;{{cite book | title=Inside RTÉ | publisher=New Island | author=Purcell, Betty | year=2014 | location=Dublin | pages=250–252 | isbn=978-1-84840-320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Minister [[Alan Shatter]] initially supported "Mission to Prey" after it was broadcast in May 2011, and released a public statement of praise after it was aired, which he later retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shatter-in-uturn-on-his-rash-support-for-prime-time-2946451.html|title=Shatter in U-turn on his 'rash' support for Prime Time|first=Michael|last=Brennan|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of RTÉ's defamation of Fr. Kevin Reynolds, the family of a deceased Christian Brother, accused by RTÉ in the same ''Mission to Prey'' programme of having abused children, asked that his name also be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1124/reynoldsk.html|title=Family wants RTÉ to prove abuse allegation|work=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/rte-told-produce-evidence-of-abuse-2946450.html|title=RTÉ told: produce evidence of abuse.

==RTÉ apology controversy==
RTÉ refused to accept DNA evidence that Fr Reynolds was innocent and he was forced to take action. After the High Court found that the accusations were baseless and defamatory RTÉ were forced into apologizing to Fr Reynolds and paying substantial damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mission-to-prey-the-baseless-accusation-that-set-off-a-bomb-26839389.html|title='Mission to Prey' -- the baseless accusation that set off a bomb|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=6 September 2013|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1006/apology.html|title=Apology - Fr Kevin Reynolds|work=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/1118/media-3115837.html |title=(Audio) Morning Ireland: RTÉ apology to Fr Kevin Reynolds |work=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=19 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a "public backlash" over the standard of the televised apology. Among the most outspoken critics of RTÉ's botched apology was Fr. Sean McDonagh of the [[Association of Catholic Priests]]. RTÉ staff also expressed their ire during a showdown with [[Noel Curran]]. RTÉ rebroadcast the apology to Fr. Kevin Reynolds after the ''Nine O'Clock News'' on 25 November 2011 which it described as "in response to concerns expressed by viewers".&lt;ref name=miriams_husband_reins&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/miriams-husband-takes-reins-of-current-affairs-2946516.html|title=Miriam's husband takes reins of current affairs|first=Mark|last=Hilliard|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ staff, including [[Mike Murphy (broadcaster)|Mike Murphy]], [[John Bowman (broadcaster)|John Bowman]] and [[Sean O'Rourke]], publicly criticised the serious libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/rte-stars-slam-shameful-libel-as-chiefs-step-aside-2945263.html|title=RTÉ stars slam 'shameful' libel as chiefs step aside|first=Geraldine|last=Gittens|work=Evening Herald|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act''' ('''NCVIA''') of 1986 (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]] as part of a larger health bill on Nov 14, 1986, in the [[United States]], to reduce the potential financial liability of [[vaccine]] makers due to [[vaccine injury]] claims.&lt;ref name="nytimes1986"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/15/us/reagan-signs-bill-on-drug-exports-and-payment-for-vaccine-injuries.html |title=Reagan Signs Bill On Drug Exports And Payment For Vaccine Injuries |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-11-15 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective [[arbitration]] for vaccine injury claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US Legal, Inc. |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/n/national-childhood-vaccine-injury-act-ncvia/ |title=National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act [NCVIA&amp;#93; Law and Legal Definition |website=Definitions.uslegal.com |publisher=USLegal, Inc |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the NCVIA, the [[National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program]] (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] and [[special master]]s.&lt;ref name="nytimes1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI_42_6_Hall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet |authorlink1=Harriet Hall |title=Diving into the VAERS Dumpster: Fake News about Vaccine Injuries |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=28-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1970s and 1980s, a controversy erupted related to the question of whether the whole-cell [[pertussis]] component caused permanent brain injury in rare cases, called pertussis vaccine [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;{{cite news|title = Junk Science in the Courtroom|author = Huber, Peter|journal = Forbes|date = July 8, 1991|page = 68|url = http://www.overlawyered.com/articles/huber/junksci.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Historical Perspective on Pertussis and Use of Vaccines to Prevent It: 100 years of pertussis (the cough of 100 days) | last = Cherry | first = James D. | date = March 2007 | journal = [[Microbe Magazine]] | url = http://forms.asm.org/microbe/index.asp?bid=48816 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110623084415/http://forms.asm.org/microbe/index.asp?bid=48816 | archivedate = 2011-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' called the connection a "myth" and "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherry JD | title = 'Pertussis vaccine encephalopathy': it is time to recognize it as the myth that it is | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 12 | pages = 1679–80 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2308206 | doi = 10.1001/jama.263.12.1679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before that point, criticism of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal reports]] of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements.&lt;ref name="Geier_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geier D, Geier M | title = The true story of pertussis vaccination: a sordid legacy? | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–84 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12211972 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/57.3.249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gangarosa_1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gangarosa EJ, Galazka AM, Wolfe CR, Phillips LM, Gangarosa RE, Miller E, Chen RT | title = Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9099 | pages = 356–61 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9652634 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)04334-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, low profit margins and an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Huber" /&gt; By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining [[liability insurance]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/us/shortage-of-whooping-cough-vaccine-is-seen.html |title=Shortage Of Whooping Cough Vaccine Is Seen |publisher=The New York Times |date=1984-12-14 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one company was still manufacturing pertussis vaccine in the US by the end of 1985.&lt;ref name="nytimes1984"/&gt; In 1986, to correct the situation, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal [[no-fault insurance|no-fault]] system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines.&lt;ref name="Smith_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith MH | title = National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–9 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3399300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McAllister-Grum_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McAllister-Grum, Kyle | title = Pigments and Vaccines: Evaluating the Constitutionality of Targeting Melanin Groups for Mandatory Vaccination | journal = Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 217–47 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28910223 | doi = 10.1080/01947648.2017.1303288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCVIA provisions==
===Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System===
   
The NCVIA also mandates that all health care providers must report certain [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse events]] following vaccination to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS).

The NCVIA also established a committee from the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) to review the existing literature on vaccine adverse events  occurring after [[immunization]], regardless of whether there was a direct link between events.

===National Vaccine Program Office===

As a result of the NCVIA, the [[National Vaccine Program Office]] (NVPO) was established within the DHHS.  The NVPO is responsible for coordinating immunization-related activities between all DHHS agencies, including the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA).

===Vaccine Information Statements===
   
The NCVIA requires that all health care providers who administer vaccines against [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[polio]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[hepatitis B]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]] type b and [[varicella]] must provide a [[Vaccine Information Statement]] (VIS) to the vaccine recipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose.

A VIS must be given with every vaccination, including each dose in a multi-dose series.  Each VIS contains a brief description of the disease, as well as the [[risk]]s and [[Cost-benefit analysis|benefit]]s of the vaccine.  Each VIS is developed by the CDC and distributed to state and local health departments as well as individual providers.

'''The Offences at Sea Act 1799''' (39 Geo 3 c 37) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. It is still in force. It extended the jurisdiction of British courts to crimes committed by British subjects on the [[high seas]]. It does not apply to foreign citizens. (However crimes committed by foreigners in British [[territorial waters]], or on board British ships on the high seas, can be prosecuted in British courts.) Jurisdiction over [[piracy]] on the high seas already existed before 1799, whether committed by British subjects or not.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

This Act appears to determine the sentence for [[Piracy#International law|piracy ''iure gentium'']] in cases where section 2 of the [[Piracy Act 1837]] does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]. 1999. Para 25 - 46 at p 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
===Preamble===
The preamble was repealed by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/schedule/3/part/I Part I] of Schedule 3 to the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

===Section 1===
This section now reads:

{{cquote|All and every offence and offences which after the passing of this Act shall be committed upon the high seas, out of the body of any county of this realm, shall be and they are hereby declared to be offences . . . liable to the same punishments respectively, as if they had been committed upon the shore . . .}}

The words "of the same nature respectively, and to be" and the words from "and shall be inquired of" onwards were repealed by Part I of Schedule 3 to the Criminal Law Act 1967.

===Section 2===
This section was repealed by Part I of Schedule 3 to the Criminal Law Act 1967.

'''Platformism''' is a tendency (or organized [[school of thought]]) within the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement. It stresses the need for tightly organized anarchist organizations that are able to influence working class and peasant movements.

"Platformist" groups reject the model of [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[vanguardism]]. They instead aim to "make anarchist ideas the leading ideas within the [[class struggle]]".&lt;ref name="WSM"&gt;Workers Solidarity Movement, 2012, [http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/once/join.html "Why You Should Join the Workers Solidarity Movement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103053447/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/once/join.html# |date=2017-01-03 }}. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to platformists, the four main principles by which an anarchist organisation should operate, are ideological unity, tactical unity, [[Collective action|collective responsibility]] and [[federalism]].

==Overview==
In general, platformist groups aim to win the widest possible influence for anarchist ideas and methods in the working class and peasantry&amp;mdash;like [[especifismo]] groups, platformists orient towards the working class, rather than to the [[far-left]]. This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups; and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as well as "views that dismiss activity in the unions" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo statement"&gt;Anarkismo, 2012, [http://www.anarkismo.net/about_us "About Us"]. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "platformist" derives from the 1926 ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=''Dielo Truda'' group |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/newplatform/organizational.htm |accessdate=5 January 2012 |year=2006 |publisher=Nestor Makhno Archive |location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was published by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, in their journal ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' ("Workers' Cause" in Russian). The group, which consisted of exiled [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchist]] veterans of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] (notably [[Nestor Makhno]] who played a leading role in the anarchist revolution in Ukraine of 1918&amp;ndash;1921),  based the ''Platform'' on their experiences of the revolution and the eventual victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] outside Ukraine. The document drew praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide and sparked a major debate within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"&gt;Schmidt, M. and [[Lucien van der Walt|van der Walt, L.]] 2009. [[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)]]. Edinburgh: [[AK Press]]. pp. 252-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Today platformism is an important current in international anarchism. Around thirty platformist and especifista organisations are linked together in the Anarkismo.net project, including groups from Africa, Latin America, North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo statement" /&gt; At least in terms of the number of affiliated organisations (if not in actual membership in some countries),&lt;ref&gt;"In reply to the Platform, supporters of the "synthesis" counter by pointing to the fact that "Platformist" groups are usually very small, far smaller than "synthesis" federations (for example, compare the size of the French Anarchist Federation with, say, the Irish Workers Solidarity Movement or the French-language Alternative Libertaire)"[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in] [[An Anarchist FAQ]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Anarkismo network is larger than other anarchist international bodies, like the [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist]]&lt;ref&gt;"Most national sections of the International Anarchist Federation (IFA) are good examples of successful federations which are heavily influenced by "synthesis" ideas (such as the French and Italian federations)." [http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in] [[An Anarchist FAQ]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International of Anarchist Federations]] and the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[International Workers' Association]]. However, it is not a formal "international" and has no intention of competing with these other formations.

==Organisational ideas==
The ''Platform'' describes four key organisational features which distinguish platformism:
* Tactical unity — "A common tactical line in the movement is of decisive importance for the existence of the organisation and the whole movement: it avoids the disastrous effect of several tactics opposing each other; it concentrates the forces of the movement; and gives them a common direction leading to a fixed objective".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical unity — "Theory represents the force which directs the activity of persons and organisations along a defined path towards a determined goal. Naturally it should be common to all the persons and organisations adhering to the General Union. All activity by the General Union, both overall and in its details, should be in perfect concord with the theoretical principles professed by the union".&lt;ref&gt;From section on theoretical unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collective Responsibility — "The practice of acting on one's personal responsibility should be decisively condemned and rejected in the ranks of the anarchist movement. The areas of revolutionary life, social and political, are above all profoundly collective by nature. Social revolutionary activity in these areas cannot be based on the personal responsibility of individual militants".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Collective responsibility in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Federalism — "Against centralism, anarchism has always professed and defended the principle of federalism, which reconciles the independence and initiative of individuals and the organisation with service to the common cause".&lt;ref&gt;All sourced from the [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm From section Federalism within the Organizational Section of the original document]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Platform'' argues that "[w]e have vital need of an organisation which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement". In short, unity meant unity of ideas and actions as opposed to unity on the basis of the anarchist label.

==Publication history==
The ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)'' was written in 1926 by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, a group of exiled Russian and Ukrainian [[anarchists in France]] who published the ''Dielo Truda'' journal. The pamphlet is an analysis of basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society and recommendations as to how an anarchist organisation should be structured.

==Antecedents of the ''Platform''==
The authors of the ''Platform'' insisted that its basic ideas were not new, but had a long anarchist pedigree. Platformism is not therefore a revision away from classical anarchism, or a new approach, but a "restatement" of existing positions.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"/&gt;

They cited [[Peter Kropotkin]] arguing that "the formation of an anarchist organisation in Russia, far from being prejudicial to the common revolutionary task, on the contrary it is desirable and useful to the very greatest degree" and argued that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "aspirations concerning organisations, as well as his activity" in the [[First International]], "give us every right to view him as an active partisan of just such an organisation". Indeed, "practically all active anarchist militants fought against all dispersed activity, and desired an anarchist movement welded by unity of ends and means".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/introduction.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems caused by poor translations==
The ''Platform'' used to be known in English as the ''Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'', a result of its having been translated from the French edition popularized in the early 1970s. In his book ''Facing the Enemy: A history of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968'' (p.&amp;nbsp;131), [[Alexandre Skirda]] attributes much of the controversy about the ''Platform'' to the original 1926 French translation made by its opponent [[Voline]]. Later translations to French have corrected some of the mistranslations and the latest English translation, made directly from the Russian original, reflects this.

==Other terms==
Some platformist organisations today are unhappy with the designation, often preferring to use descriptions such as "anarchist communist", "social anarchist", "libertarian communist/socialist" or even [[especifist]]. Most agree that the 1926 ''Platform'' was sorely lacking in certain areas and point out that it was a draft document, never intended to be adopted in its original form. The Italian [[Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (FdCA), for example, do not insist on the principle of "tactical unity", which according to them is impossible to achieve over a large area, preferring instead "tactical homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/organization/tesi.htm FdCA positions and theoretical documents], retrieved 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarian socialism |Philosophies}}
Today there are organisations inspired by the ''Platform'' in many countries, including:

*The [[Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zabalaza.net/|title=(no title)|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ZACF) in [[South Africa]] 
*The [[Revolutionary Confederation of Anarcho-syndicalists by the name of. N.I. Makhno]] (RKAS), which is an international anarcho-syndicalist, platformist confederation with sections and individual members in Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Germany, Latvia, Bulgaria and Israel

Organisations inspired by the ''Platform'' were also among the founders of the now-defunct [[International Libertarian Solidarity]] network and its successor, the Anarkismo network, which is run collaboratively by roughly 30 platformist and especifista organisations around the world.

==Criticisms==
The ''Platform'' attracted strong criticism from some sectors on the anarchist movement of the time, including some of the most influential anarchists such as [[Voline]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Camillo Berneri]], [[Max Nettlau]], and [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Gregori Maximoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3#secj34|title=Why do many anarchists oppose the "Platform"?|publisher=[[An Anarchist FAQ]]|accessdate=Aug 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212653/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3#secj34|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "synthesist" alternative==
As an alternative to platformism [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]] proposed [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist anarchist]] federations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/15329|title=Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they envisioned to form under the principles of [[anarchism without adjectives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of the ''Platform's'' stress on tight political and organisational unity, the "synthesist" approach argued for a far looser organization that would maximise numbers i.e. a [[big tent]] approach. Platformists view such organisations as weak despite their numbers as the lack of common views means an inability to undertake common actions&amp;mdash;defeating the purpose of a common organisation.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"/&gt;

==Malatesta's shift to "agreement" with collective responsibility==
While such criticisms indicated a direct rejection of the ''Platform's'' proposals, others seem to have arisen from misunderstandings.

Notably, Malatesta initially believed that the ''Platform'' was "typically authoritarian" and "far from helping to bring about the victory of anarchist communism, to which they aspire, could only falsify the anarchist spirit and lead to consequences that go against their intentions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/platform/malatesta_project.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980416051823/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/platform/malatesta_project.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 April 1998|title=A Project of Anarchist Organisation|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after further correspondence with Makhno—and after seeing a platformist group in formation—Malatesta concluded that he was actually in agreement with the positions of the ''Platform'', but had been confused by the language they had used: &lt;blockquote&gt;But all this is perhaps only a question of words.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In my reply to Makhno I already said: "It may be that, by the term collective responsibility, you mean the agreement and solidarity that must exist among the members of an association. And if that is so, your expression would, in my opinion, amount to an improper use of language, and therefore, being only a question of words, we would be closer to understanding each other."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And now, reading what the comrades of the 18e say, I find myself more or less in agreement with their way of conceiving the anarchist organisation (being very far from the authoritarian spirit which the "Platform" seemed to reveal) and I confirm my belief that behind the linguistic differences really lie identical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, On Collective Responsibility, http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/mal_rep3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13813">In [[Roman law]], contracts could be divided between those ''in re'', those that were [[consensual contracts in Roman law|consensual]], and those that were [[innominate contracts in Roman law]]. Although [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] only identifies a single type of contract ''in re'', it is commonly thought that there were four, as [[Justinian]] identifies: ''mutuum'' (loan for consumption), ''commodatum'' (loan for use), ''depositum'' (deposit) and ''pignus'' (pledge).

Each varied about the expected standards of care, transfer of ownership, and other practicalities stemming from the purpose of each. They all involved the delivery or a physical thing, which is a defining characteristic. They were generally supplemented by the ''stipulatio'' and inominate contract, which allowed additional provisions such as interests to be added to contracts ''in re'' making them more suitable for commercial applications.

==General features==
[[Justinian]] identifies four types of real contract – contracts ''in re'' (in a thing) – ''mutuum'', ''commodatum'', ''depositum'' and ''pignus''. Common to all four was an agreement, and the delivery of a ''res corporalis''.&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt; They are in contrast to [[consensual contracts in Roman law|consensual]] and [[inominate contracts in Roman law|inominate contracts]].&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt; Real contracts were of limited significance, although they are featured prominently in the works of jurists. If a ''stipulatio'' had to be created to cover any interest, then it could be used to cover the other elements of the transaction as well.&lt;ref name="nicholas169"/&gt;

[[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], however, only mentions one type of contract ''in re'': ''mutuum''. The others certainly existed in Gaius' time.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; The other three can be distinguished insofar as they are different from traditional concepts of debt from which real contracts developed, are bilateral, do not transfer ownership, are ''bona fide'' and [[praetor]]ian in nature. Gaius can therefore be seen as writing at a developing time in the law, although why the others are not mentioned at all in the ''Institutes of Gaius'' is not known.&lt;ref name="nicholas168169"/&gt;

==''Mutuum''==
A ''[[mutuum]]'' was a loan for consumption.&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt; It was the oldest contract ''in re'', growing in importance after 326&amp;nbsp;BC when the [[lex Poetalia]] was passed.&lt;ref name="borkowski298"/&gt; It could be used by people without the right of ''commercium'' – a package of rights to participate in the ''[[ius civile]]'' and to undertake remedies.&lt;ref name="borkowski102298"/&gt; It involved the delivery of certain types of [[fungible]] goods, such as money, food, and drink. Ownership was transferred, as was possession.&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt; In a strict sense then, because ownership passed, it should not be considered a loan.&lt;ref name="borkowski297"/&gt; The ''mutuum'' obliged the borrower not to return the thing itself, because its use would involve consumption, but a similar thing in quantity, quality and size.&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt;&lt;ref name="borkowski298"/&gt;

The lender had a ''condictio'' action for the value of the thing if a similar thing was not returned as described.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; It was ''stricti iuris'' ("strict law") – the lender could not claim interest.&lt;ref name="nicholas167"/&gt; Despite this, it became the standard arrangement for moneylenders in the [[Roman republic]]. Interest would instead have to be given in a ''[[stipulatio]]'', an additional contract.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; Rates of interest were heavily regulated by the state. As a ''mutuum'' did not place on the borrower any specific date on which to return the equivalent thing, this would also be given in a ''stipulatio'' if required. In the later law, the ''stipulatio'' replaced ''mutuum'' completely.&lt;ref name="borkowski298"/&gt;

The borrower was bound to return the equivalent thing. As owner, he bore liability for loss, theft, or damage; they were irrelevant to his liability for the thing.&lt;ref name="nicholas169"/&gt; Two exceptions were made, where repayment would be dependent on the success of the operation: the financing of a cargo ship, and the sponsorship of a professional athlete. Neither was liable if they did not succeed; the risk was born by the lender.&lt;ref name="borkowski298299"/&gt; ''Mutuum'' was unilateral and did not place the lender under any obligations or duties.&lt;ref name="borkowski299"/&gt;

==''Commodatum''==
A ''[[commodatum]]'' was a loan for use. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, and was also gratuitous (no interest could be charged). If interest was included, the agreement was instead either one of hire or an innominate contract.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; It was assumed to be for a "reasonable time" if this was not specified at the time of the agreement. Land could be the subject of a ''commodatum'' during the Classical period and later, though this was doubted before that. Perishables could not be loaned for use, unless they were to be used for display purposes only, or a small number of other exceptions. The lender under a ''commodatum'' did not have to be owner, since ownership was not transferred.&lt;ref name="borkowski299"/&gt;

A borrower was held (in most juristic texts) to a standard of ''culpa levis in abstracto'' – the borrower was liable if his or her conduct fell short of the ''diligentia'' (care) of a ''bonus paterfamilias'' – a good, respected, head of the family.&lt;ref name="nicholas170"/&gt; Some commentators consider the relevant standard to have instead been that of a ''diligentissimus paterfamilias'' ("most careful head-of-family"), a higher standard.&lt;ref name="borkowski300"/&gt; This may have developed from an earlier standard of ''custodia''. ''Custodia'' was a form of strict liability, where the only situation when the borrower would not be liable would be actions of a "greater force" (''vis maior'') such a theft with force, or what is called in the modern English law and [[act of God]].&lt;ref name="nicholas171"/&gt; If the borrower was liable, then he had an action available against the thief (the ''[[furtum|actio furti]]'') or damager under the [[Lex Aquilia]]. Where the borrower was liable, Justinian at least gave the lender the choice of whether to sue the borrower ''in personam'' in breach of contract, or the thief or damager.&lt;ref name="borkowski300"/&gt; The borrower was also liable for ''furtum'' if he misused the thing he had borrowed. If the borrowed thing had undisclosed defects which caused damage of which the lender was aware, then the lender would be liable under [[delict]].&lt;ref name="borkowski300"/&gt; The appropriate action for breach of contract was the ''actio commodati''. If the lender owed the borrower money relating to another contract or sale, then he could keep the borrowed thing and offset the cost against the debt He could also bring the ''actio commodati contraria'' if his expenses exceeded the value of the property borrowed.&lt;ref name="borkowski301"/&gt;

==''Depositum''==
A ''[[depositum]]'' was a [[deposit account|deposit]] for safekeeping. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, and was also gratuitous.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; Land could not be the subject of a deposit. If interest was included, then the deposit became a contract of hire. Since ownership did not pass, a thief could deposit. The depositee could not benefit from the deposit in any way.&lt;ref name="borkowski301"/&gt; If the depositee used the thing, then this was considered theft by ''[[furtum usus]]''.&lt;ref name="borkowski302"/&gt;

It appears that the depositee was held to ''culpa lata'' standard. This meant that the depositee was liable if found to have been grossly negligent: careless to the extent that bad faith could almost be assumed. ''Culpa lata'' was therefore similar to ''dolus'' ("fraud").&lt;ref name="nicholas170"/&gt; Indeed, some commentators consider ''dolus'' to be the appropriate standard.&lt;ref name="borkowski301"/&gt; The parties could agree to vary the level of care expected of the depositee. A depositee was expected to return the thing on demand. Reasonable "[[wear and tear]]" was acceptable. The depositee was also bound to hand over any accretions of the thing, such as any young born to a deposited animal.&lt;ref name="borkowski302"/&gt; The depositor was liable for any damage caused by the deposited thing, and the cost of transportation if the place that the things was to be returned differed from that where it was borrowed. The ''actio depositi'' was available to the depositor to seek return of his goods, with double damages awarded if the damage had been made in an emergency, such as during fire or riot. It resulted in ''[[infamia]]'' if the depositee was held liable.&lt;ref name="borkowski302"/&gt; The depositee had the ''actio depositi contraria'' if expenses were paid. Originally, it seems that the expenses could be set against the value of the thing in the ''actio depositi'', but, if so, this ability came to an end in the time of Justinian.&lt;ref name="borkowski302"/&gt;

There were two special types of deposit. The first was the ''depositum irregulare'' of fungibles, normally money. In contrast to a usual deposit, ownership did pass, granting more rights to the depositee to protect the property. It had to be returned on request, and the transferee could derive no benefit from it.&lt;ref name="borkowski302303"/&gt; The second was ''sequestrio'', whereby a thing whose ownerhsip was disputed was deposited with a third party, bound to return it to the successful party in a ''vindicatio'' or similar action. Because possession passed, both parties were prevented from [[usucapio|usucapting]] until the disagreement was settled. It could be used in relation to land or movables.&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt;

==''Pignus''==
A ''pignus'' ("pledge") was a form of real security which transferred possession but not ownership.&lt;ref name="nicholas168"/&gt; It often formed part of a mortgage or similar transaction.&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt;

It developed later than the similar ''fiducia'', where ownership was transferred as well as possession. Accordingly, the thing could be sold by the owner and deducted from the debt without recourse to the pledgor, and whilst it was owned by pledgee the pledgor had no right of use. It also required a formal conveyance.&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt; This is in contrast to the ''pignus'', which could be carried out by ''[[traditio]]''. ''Fiducia'' remained popular with lenders who enjoyed increased security, whereas a ''pignus'' was more useful to the pledger. ''Fiducia'' lasted until the late [[Roman empire|empire]], but was increasingly eclipsed by ''pignus''.&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt;

The pledgee, if he was in physical control of the object (as was usually the case) was required to safeguard the thing.&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt; Like the borrower, a pledgee was held to the ''culpa levis in abstracto'' standard; again, this may have developed from ''custodia''.&lt;ref name="nicholas170171"/&gt; The pledgor was liable for damage done by his thing deposited, if he acted without the care of a ''bonus paterfamilias''. If the pledgee fell short of the expected standard, the contract was terminated immediately. The pledgee could claim for expenses incurred in maintaining the thing (such as an animal or slave).&lt;ref name="borkowski303"/&gt; The pledgee had to set any profits derived from the thing against the outstanding debt. The pledge was repaid when the debt was settled, along with any accretions.&lt;ref name="borkowski303304"/&gt; The pledgor had no action without repayment. The pledgee did not have ownership, and therefore could not sell or destroy the thing, which was restrictive. A [[right of sale]] was typically agreed between the parties, to come into effect after a set time. So common was this that it was often considered implied. The amount would be deducted from the debt, interest and expenses added, and this could then be sued for under whichever contract had formed the debt.&lt;ref name="borkowski304"/&gt;

'''Red Heart''' was a joint venture between the [[Seven Network]] and [[Granada Television|Granada PLC]] between c. 1999 and 2001. It brought together all of its [[Australia]]n parents' TV production resources, except those used for Seven's news and soaps.

One theory states that Granada was looking to buy Seven's core, through it eventually owning 100% of Red Heart. Red Heart may have also eventually controlled Seven's news and soaps. This was a time when "content is king" was a popular idea.

Australia's [[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]] disallows foreign entities owning more than 15% of any TV station licence holder, but owning a company that provides a station with 100% of its content for 99% of its income is fine. ([[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest]] found another way around the law to own a majority stake of [[Network Ten]]).

However, Granada decided to pull out of Red Heart when it realised it could make more money selling Australian programs to other Australian broadcasters than it would just supplying Seven. It has been rare to see Australian-made Granada programs on the screen.

The '''Rio Grande Compact''' is an [[interstate compact]] signed in 1938 in the [[United States]] between the states of [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]], and approved by the [[United States Congress]], to equitably apportion the waters of the [[Rio Grande]] Basin.

==Passage==
The treaty was ratified by Colorado's legislature on February 21, 1939, then by Texas and New Mexico's legislatures on March 1. It was finally adopted on December 19, 1939 after passing through Congress (as Public Act No. 96, 76) and being signed into law on May 31, 1939.

The act was amended at the thirteenth Annual Meeting, on February 25, 1952.

==Summary==
Colorado committed to deliver a certain amount of water to the New Mexico state line, based on water runoff as measured at four index stations located in the area of the Rio Grande's headwaters. The compact provides for an indexed schedule of required water deliveries from Colorado, based on gauged stream flows, and, under certain circumstances, a system of debits and credits in water deliveries that also permits water storage with the combined capacity of Elephant Butte and Caballo Reservoirs.

The compact also sets a minimum quality standard, as in the event that Colorado was to construct water projects later for the purpose of delivering water into the Rio Grande from the Closed Basin,  the state would not be credited with the water delivered unless the sodium ions in the water do not exceed 45% of the total positive ions when the total dissolved solids in the water exceeds 350ppm.

==Results==
Between 1939-1966, Colorado virtually ignored the compact. The result was that by 1966, due to Colorado's non-compliance with the Compact, Colorado owed New Mexico one-million acre feet (1.2&amp;nbsp;km³) of water, and New Mexico owed Texas {{convert|500,000|acre.ft|m3}}. New Mexico and Texas collectively sued Colorado to try to force compliance, and between 1966–1967, the case progressed and was eventually heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

In 1985, after several affluent years of water flow from the Rio Grande, the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs reached capacity, having received more water than they could hold. The terms of the Compact state that once the Elephant Butte reservoir is filled, New Mexico and Colorado are immediately released from any water debt they have accrued. Colorado's debt to New Mexico at the time, {{convert|500,000|acre.ft|m3}} of water, was immediately cleared, settling the balance between the two states, but leaving New Mexico in an unfortunate position in its debt to Texas.

In 1996, when the reservoir was again close to capacity, the New Mexico water districts below Elephant Butte authorized water from the reservoir to be pulled out and dumped in the New Mexico desert, to prevent the reservoir from spilling, and again clearing Colorado's water debt.

The stress now is on New Mexico to meet its obligations to Texas. During dryer years, New Mexico will be short about {{convert|80,000|acre.ft|m3}} in its obligations, partially due to partial evaporation of the reservoir water before New Mexico can absorb it.

==Compliance==
The Rio Grande Compact Commission, located in [[El Paso, Texas]], administers the Rio Grande Compact. An employee of the [[USGS]] New Mexico Water Science Center serves as Secretary to the Compact. The principal duty of the Secretary is to compile streamflow and storage data used in the annual accounting computations performed by the Commission’s Engineer Advisers.  The Secretary also compiles provisional streamflow and storage data on a monthly basis that are distributed to interested parties, and compiles and publishes an annual data report for the Commission.

The [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] is [[Texas]]' representation to the Commission.

==Environmental issues==
During a 1999 [[United States House of Representatives]] investigation of inter-state water pacts, Bennett W. Raley offered testimony revealing that efforts to comply with the demands of the Compact could be threatening a critical habitat for the [[Minnow|Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]].[http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/106cong/fullcomm/99jul24/raley.htm]

The '''Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments''' or '''Roerich Pact''' is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].

[[File:N Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nicholas Roerich]].]]

Russian painter and philosopher [[Nicholas Roerich]] (1874–1947)&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Brenner]], "Nicholas Roerich. Idealist and Visionary", ''[[Foreign Affairs Journal]]'', April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of "Peace of Civilizations". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of [[International Conference of American States|American states]] in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in [[St. Petersburg]]. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to [[Paris]] to take lessons from [[Fernand Cormon]], the well known tutor of [[Van Gogh]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married [[Helena Roerich|Helena Shaposhnikova]], who later developed the [[Agni Yoga]] philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian [[Tsar Nicolas II]] himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the [[October Revolution]] and [[Finnish Civil War]], the family travelled across several [[Scandinavia]]n countries to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and eventually left for [[North America]] in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: "[[Cor Ardens]]" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corardens.com/|title=Scripture Speaks - Savoring the deep meaning of the Word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy, revealing the fundamental mysteries of our faith.|website=Corardens.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Master Institute of United Arts" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich biographical outline|website=Roerich.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Roerich Museum]] was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in [[Manhattan]], at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&amp;id=5885 Nobel Prize Committee archives 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;.


After leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the [[Kullu Valley]] from which their estate looked towards the [[Himalayas]]. Here they established the [[Urusvati Institute]] which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.

== Origins of the Roerich Pact ==
An idea about the protection of [[cultural monuments]] was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint-Petersburg province]], Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Izborsk]] and [[Pskov]]. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited [[Uglich]], [[Kalyazin]], [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Tver]]. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Summarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article "Along the old times" (1903): "Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it".

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's [[Russian Archeological Society|Russian Archeologist Society]] about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the [[Russian-Japan war]] (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments.  In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article "Silent Pogroms" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of [[St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl]]: "Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...".

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the [[Imperial Russian army]], as well as the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster "Enemy of Mankind" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture "Glow" expressing a protest against [[World War I]].

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II]] and Great Prince [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas Nikolayevich]] containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with [[Georgi Shklyaver|G.G. Shklyaver]] (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of [[international law]] and political sciences at [[Paris University]] prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the [[Banner of Peace]]. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== The Roerich Pact ==
In 1929 Roerich in collaboration with [[Paris University]] professor G.G. Shklyaver  (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the [[Red Cross]] for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at [[League of Nations]] and also by the Committee of the [[Pan-American Union]]. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth [[UNESCO]] General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the [[international law]], especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Pax Cultura emblem.]]
[[File:Pax-roerix-50.jpg|thumb|200px|right|50 years of the Roerich Pact]]

"''Pax Cultura''" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]n nations, agreeing that "historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the ''Banner of Peace'', bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, "The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=pact ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention of 1954]]. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== The Roerich Pact importance for the 21st century ==
The Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state [[budget]] annually spent on culture, art and
education, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.

Important in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.

Nicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], "Beauty will save the World!" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian [[Renaissance]], and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.

Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the [[rule of law]] and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Barenboim P., Sidiqi N. ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75th Anniversary of the Roerich Pact'']. М., Letny Sad; Grid Belgium, 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Law article in the West's Encyclopedia of American Law&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of [[Rule According to Higher Law]] ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.

According to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Op.cit. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis R. Elbinger, "The Unifying Power of Art", in Foreign Service Journal, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov|A.A. Leonov]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician [[Dmitry Likhachov|D.S. Likhachev]]. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article "Pain of the Planet" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: "The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity".

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of [[Universal Day of Culture|World Day of Culture]]. N. Roerich wrote:
"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…"

The '''Sackler Library''' holds a large portion of the [[Classics|classical]], [[art history|art historical]], and [[Archaeology|archaeological]] works belonging to the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]].

== History ==
The Library was completed in 2001 and opened on 24 September of that year, replacing the former library of the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

Designed by architects Robert Adam with Paul Hanvey of [[ADAM Architecture]], it is a distinctive building, as the central block is circular. It is appropriate to its [[Classics|Classical]] purpose, as one of the outer walls is decorated by a mock-Classical frieze; also, its creators say that the entrance is based upon the [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], first excavated by [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], the man who designed the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamarchitecture.com/public_buildings/Sackler-Library.htm Robert Adam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729010645/http://www.adamarchitecture.com/public_buildings/Sackler-Library.htm |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
Its holdings incorporate the collections of four older [[library|libraries]], namely the Ashmolean library, the Classics Lending Library, the Eastern Art Library, and the History of Art Library. Major subject areas are:

* Western European Art since c. AD 1000
* [[History of Art]]
* Classical and Byzantine art and archaeology
* [[Papyrology]] and Greco-Roman Egypt
* [[Near East]]ern [[archaeology]] and [[cuneiform]] languages

A '''double referendum''' on a [[Constitution of Samoa|new constitution]] and [[independence referendum|independence]] took place in [[Western Samoa]] on 10 May 1961. A Constitutional Convention of [[Fa'amatai|Matai]] and associated groups had drawn up a proposed constitution. It reflected the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary democracy, but restricted both standing and voting in elections to the Matai.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp; Hartmann, C (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II'', p780 {{ISBN|0-19-924959-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendums were supervised by the [[United Nations]], and with both approved, the country gained independence on 1 January the following year.

}}
The '''Seabed Arms Control Treaty''' (or '''Seabed Treaty''', formally the '''Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil thereof''') is a multilateral agreement between the United States, [[Soviet Union]] (now Russia), United Kingdom, and 91 other countries&lt;ref name=unoda/&gt; banning the emplacement of [[nuclear weapons]] or "[[weapons of mass destruction]]" on the ocean floor beyond a 12-mile (22.2&amp;nbsp;km) coastal zone. It allows signatories to observe all [[seabed]] "activities" of any other signatory beyond the 12-mile zone to ensure compliance.

Like the [[Antarctic Treaty]], the [[Outer Space Treaty]], and the [[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]] treaties, the Seabed Arms Control Treaty sought to prevent the introduction of international conflict and nuclear weapons into an area hitherto free of them. Reaching agreement on the seabed, however, involved problems not met in framing the other two agreements.

==History==
In the 1960s, advances in the technology of [[oceanography]] and greatly increased interest in the vast and virtually untapped resources of the ocean floor led to concern that the absence of clearly established rules of law might lead to strife. And there were concurrent fears that nations might use the seabed as a new environment for military installations, including those capable of launching nuclear weapons.

In keeping with a proposal submitted to the [[UN Secretary-General|U.N. Secretary General]] by Ambassador Pardo of [[Malta]] in August 1967, the [[U.N. General Assembly]], on 18 December 1967, established an ad hoc committee to study ways of reserving the seabed for peaceful purposes, with the objective of ensuring "that the exploration and use of the seabed and the ocean floor should be conducted in accordance with the principles and purposes of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and for the benefit of all mankind." The Committee was given permanent status the following year. At the same time, seabed-related military and arms control issues were referred to the [[Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament]] (ENDC) and its successor, the [[Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (CCD). In a message of 18 March 1969, President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] said the American delegation to the ENDC should seek discussion of the factors necessary for an international agreement prohibiting the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor and pointed out that an agreement of this kind would, like the Antarctic and Outer Space treaties, "prevent an arms race before it has a chance to start."

==Status==

===List of parties===
The Seabed Arms Control Treaty was opened for signature in Washington, London, and Moscow on 11 February 1971. It entered into force 18 May 1972, when the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and more than 22 nations had deposited instruments of ratification.  As of October 2018, 94 current states are parties to the treaty, while another 21 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.&lt;ref name=unoda/&gt;

Multiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location.  This location is noted by: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington.

===State with limited recognition, abiding by treaty===
The [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by {{numrec|ROC||UN member states}}, deposited their instruments of ratification of the treaty prior to the United State's decision to [[Sino-American relations|switch their recognition]] of the [[One-China policy|sole legitimate government of China]] from the Republic of China (ROC) to the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1971.  When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the ROC's ratification as "illegal".  The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that they still consider them to be "bound by its obligations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/a/sea_bed/china/acc/washington|title=China: Accession to Sea-Bed Treaty

'''South African labour law''' regulates the relationship between employers, employees and trade unions in the [[Republic of South Africa]].

== History ==
{{main|History of South African labour law}}
The [[Native Labour Regulations Act 1911]] prohibited strikes by trade unions, introduced wage ceilings and a pass system for moving around jobs. Over 70,000 Chinese labourers were brought in, and used by landowners to undercut the wages of other workers. Among white workers, there was significant unrest, and major strikes took place in 1907, 1913, 1914 and 1922

For a period of sixteen years, from 1979 to 1995, several critical developments occurred in the field of labour law in South Africa, beginning with a radical change in the first of these years, when a significant Commission of Enquiry was held, resulting in the establishment of an Industrial Court, which was given extensive powers to mould, change, shape and develop the law. Prior to 1995, most labour relations were based on contracts. In 1995, much of the law developed by the Commission and the Industrial Court was put together in the [[Labour Relations Act 1995]] (LRA). Since then, most labour law has been based on statute.

Prior to 1995, an employee could be dismissed in terms of the contract of employment, which could permit any reason for dismissal. Since 1995, an employee may be dismissed only for misconduct, operational reasons and incapacity. The Labour Relations Act 1995 is a pivotal piece of legislation, as it recognises the need for fast and easy access to justice in labour disputes. The Industrial Court had the status of a High Court, and therefore was not accessible to all labourers.

1995 also saw the introduction of the [[Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration]] (CCMA) which is an administrative [[tribunal]]. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration endeavours first and foremost to conciliate between the parties. If it is unsuccessful in this, the matter moves on to arbitration. The entire process is very informal, and at no charge, and is therefore very accessible to labourers, who often use it: About 300 new cases are brought before the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration daily. In addition to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, 1995 saw the introduction of bargaining councils, which allow for communication across the industry. A bargaining council is organised collectively and voluntarily, and must be registered. In order to be registered, an alternative-dispute-resolution mechanism, similar to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, must be put in place.

The Labour Relations Act 1995 also regulated the issue of fairness, not only in termination but during employment, too. In 1998, however, most of the law on unfair labour practices was removed from the Labour Relations Act 1995 and put into the Employment Equity Act (EEA). The EEA also deals with issues such as fairness regarding a worker's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status or disability, as well as the issue of affirmative action.

The [[Basic Conditions of Employment Act]] (BCEA), the [[Health and Safety Acts]] and the [[Skills Development Act]], must be read with the EEA. The Skills Development Act provides that a small percentage of a labourer's salary must be contributed to the Department of Labour, enabling certain workshops to be run which are designed to develop skills.

== Constitution ==
Chapter 2 of the Constitution contains several provisions of relevance to employment and labour law:

* the right to equality
* protection of dignity
* protection against servitude, forced labour and discrimination
* the right to pursue a livelihood and
* protection for children against exploitative labour practices and work that is hazardous to their well-being.

It is important to interpret all labour legislation in light of the Constitution.

Section 23 of the Constitution deals specifically with labour relations, providing that everyone has the right to fair labour practices,&lt;ref name="s 231"&gt;s 23(1).&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically the right

* to form and join a trade union;
* to participate in the activities and programmes of a trade union; and
* to strike

Every employer, meanwhile, has the right

* to form and join an employers’ organisation; and
* to participate in the activities and programmes of an employers’ organisation.

Every trade union and every employers’ organisation has the right

* to determine its own administration, programmes and activities
* to organise and
* to form and join a federation

Finally, every trade union, employers’ organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining.

Section 23(1) is an unusual provision—only South Africa and Malawi expressly protect the right to fair labour practices&amp;nbsp;— as it is so broad and overarching. An exact definition of fair labour practices is impossible, since this is a dynamic field of the law, rooted in socioeconomic rights. Section 23(1) refers to "everyone," encompassing far more than merely employees and workers; it also includes would-be workers, employers and juristic persons.

Section 23 is not entirely universal, however, as soldiers are excluded from its ambit insofar as they may not strike at a time of war.

The Labour Relations Act was promulgated as the "national legislation" referred to in subsections 23(5) and 23(6), which provide respectively that "national legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining," and that "national legislation may recognise union security arrangements contained in collective agreements." Both subsections stipulate that, to the extent that such legislation may limit one of the rights in section 23, the limitation must comply with section 36(1), the limitations clause of the Constitution.

The current [[Basic Conditions of Employment Act]] is also designed to give effect to the right to fair labour practices. Both Acts are bolstered by the EEA, which replicates the equality clause in the Constitution in its totality, adding that one may not discriminate on the basis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status.

The general guarantee of fair labour practices has far-reaching effects on the civil courts’ approach to the interpretation of the rights of parties to employment contracts.

All courts are enjoined, when applying and developing the common law, to have due regard to the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights. This calls for a reconsideration of some of the assumptions underlying the common-law contract of employment, in particular the employer’s power of command and unfettered rights in respect of promotion and dismissal.

Furthermore, the labour courts’ judgments on such contentious issues as the dismissal of striking workers are subject to review by the Constitutional Court, so long as the applicants have exhausted the procedures available to them under the labour legislation.

In ''[[NUMSA v Bader Bop]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2003 (24) ILJ 305 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; the Constitutional Court overturned a decision of the Labour Appeal Court which restrictively interpreted the Labour Relations Act 1995. The court recognised the necessity of collective bargaining and bargaining councils which facilitate the establishment of trade unions. The court held that minority unions may not strike in support of demands for organisational rights reserved in the Act for majority unions.

In ''[[NEHAWU v University of Cape Town]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2003 (24) ILJ 95 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; the Constitutional Court overturned another decision of the Labour Appeal Court which restrictively interpreted the Labour Relations Act 1995. It had been argued that the term "everyone" did not include a university or a company, but the court held otherwise. Furthermore, the court ruled that, under the original section 197 of the Labour Relations Act 1995, contracts of employment transferred automatically when businesses were transferred, irrespective of the wishes of the employers.

''[[SANDU v Minister of Defence (1999)|SANDU v Minister of Defence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1999) 20 ILJ 2265 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; another Constitutional Court, case Judge O’Reagan dealt with the concept of a "worker," and held that, although the Labour Relations Act 1995 does not apply to South African National Defense Force (SANDF) members, they are still "workers" in terms of the Constitution, which protects the rights of every person in South Africa.

== Employment contract ==

=== Parties ===

==== Identification ====

The first question to be asked, when seeking to resolve any labour law problem, is whether the parties are indeed "employees" and "employers" within the meaning of the applicable statute or the common law.

This has long been a difficult task in South Africa, as it is not always immediately apparent whether the parties have entered into the ''[[locatio conductio operarum]]'' (contract of employment) or merely the ''[[locatio conductio operis]]'' (contract of work).

Distinguishing between these two kinds of contracts is critically important, as different legal consequences flow from the various forms of contract. Most important is that South African labour legislation applies only in respect of employees, who are entitled to social security benefits and have access to the statutory mechanisms if they wish to seek remedies for violations of their employment rights. Similarly, only employers are bound by the labour statutes, and are vicariously liable for the delicts of their employees.

==== Common law ====

The first source to be examined, when seeking to determine whether parties to a work relationship are employers and employees, is the contract into which they have entered.

A contract of employment comes into existence when the parties conclude an agreement that conforms to the requirements of the ''[[locatio conductio operarum]]''. The contract of employment is traditionally defined as "a contract between two persons, the master (employer) and the servant (employee), for the letting and hiring of the latter's services for reward, the master being able to supervise and control the servant’s work."

This, however, begs the question of how much supervision or control is required to distinguish between employees and independent contractors.

Reported judgments have indicated that the task of distinguishing employees and employers from parties to other contractual relationships entailing the provision of work, or the rendering of services, is not a matter of definition; classification of such contracts is a "matter of substance, not merely of form."

The true nature of the contract, therefore, is determined from the relationship between the parties, not merely the label the parties have given their contract.

==== Statutes ====

Statutory definitions do not resolve the problem. "Employee" is defined

* in section 213 of the Labour Relations Act 1995 as
** "any person excluding an independent contractor, who works for another person or for the State, and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration; and
** "any other person who in any manner assists in carrying on or conducting the business of an employer;"
* in section 1 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in exactly the same words; but
* in section 1 of the EEA as "any person other than an independent contractor who
** "works for another person or for the State and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration; and
** "in any manner assists in carrying on or conducting the business of an employer."

The difference between the Labour Relations Act 1995 and the EEA is that the Labour Relations Act 1995 excludes independent contractors only in section 213(a), while the EEA excludes independent contractors in both subsections. It is safe, however, to assume that even from the second part of the definition of an "employee," as it appears in the Labour Relations Act 1995 or the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, independent contractors are implicitly excluded.

At the core of subsection (a) of both definitions lies a reference to the contract of employment: one person working for another in exchange for some form of remuneration.

The basic idea behind subsection (b) of both definitions is that employees are those people who place their capacity to work at the disposal of others. This is the essence of employment.

The case of ''[[Liberty Life Association of Africa v Niselow]]'' reiterates the law set out above and the interpretation of the definition of "employee."

==== Courts ====

Labour legislation does not define "contract of service" or the concept of "work" at all.

This means that it is necessary to look outside the legislation to determine the meaning of these terms, in order to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor.

The courts have formulated a number of tests for drawing the distinction.

===== Control test =====

The control test focuses on the element of "control" exercised by the employer over the employee.

The power to control has traditionally been regarded as the hallmark of the employment contract. With the advent of highly skilled employees who are given free rein in performing their duties, the courts no longer insist on ''de facto'' control, as once they did, but recognise that a ''right'' to control is sufficient.

The courts initially applied the requirement of a right to control rather strictly, as in ''[[R v AMCA Services]]'', where the presiding officer spoke of "a right to control, not only the end to be achieved by the other’s labour and the general lines to be followed, but the detailed manner in which the work is to be performed."

It is now clear, however, that the courts have in mind, a right to control only in principle. The employer not choosing to exercise that right does not render the contract something other than one of employment.

The application of the control test in isolation is entirely inadequate, as certain employees have a wide discretion as to how to perform their work. Such discretion does not alone render them independent contractors.

The ultimate difference between an employee and an independent contractor is that the principal has no legal right to prescribe the manner in which the independent contractor brings about the desired result, but may prescribe methods by which the employee works. In ''[[Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society v MacDonald]]'', the court held that the employee was subject to the control of the employer in the sense that the latter had the right to prescribe not only what work had to be done, but also the manner in which that work had to be done. The independent contractor, on the other hand, could be directed only as to what work must be done, not ''how'' it was to be done.

In any event, to define a contract in terms of one of its characteristics is tautological.

===== Organisation test =====

The organisation test was developed in French law and adopted by South African law in ''R v AMCA Services and Another''. It is based upon the assumption that whether or not one is an employee does not rest on submission to orders; it depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.

In other words, one looks at the extent to which a person (the worker) is integrated into the organisation of the other person (the employer), or whether the person is performing work inside the organisation of another.

The work of an independent contractor, although done for the business, is not integrated into it; it is only accessory to it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[SABC v McKenzie]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person is incorporated into or related sufficiently to the organisation, that person will be regarded as an employee or a worker even though the employer might exercise little actual control over him.

One of the problems with this test is that it is not always possible to measure the extent of integration, or to determine what degree of integration is sufficient for someone to qualify as an employee.

The test was rejected by the Appellate Division in ''[[S v AMCA Services]]'' on the basis of it being too vague.

===== Multiple or dominant-impression test =====

The deficiencies of the control and organisation tests led the courts to approach the question in the same way that they approach so many other problems: The relationship is viewed as a whole; a conclusion is drawn from the entire picture.

In ''[[Ongevallekommissaris v Onderlinge Versekeringsgenootskap AV-BOB]]'', although the court did not spell out exactly what may be included in the general picture, guidance may be derived from the English case of ''[[Ready Mixed Concrete v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance]]'', in which the presiding officer set out three possible components:

# The servant agrees that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work and skill in the performance of some service for his master.
# He agrees, expressly or impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subject to the other’s control in a sufficient degree to make that other master.
# The other provisions of the contract are consistent with its being a contract of service.

When courts examine the "other provisions of the contract," they will consider all relevant aspects of the relationship. These include:

* the form of the contract;
* the right to supervision (in other words, whether the employer has the right to supervise the person);
* the extent to which the worker depends on the employer in the performance of his duties;
* whether the employee is not allowed to work for another;&lt;ref&gt;Normally, someone who is an employee in terms of an employment contract is not allowed to work for anyone else.&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether the worker is required to devote a specific amount of time to his work;
* whether the worker is obliged to perform his duties personally;&lt;ref&gt;Usually someone working for another in terms of an employment contract is obliged to render the services personally. In the case of the independent contractor, it does not really matter who does the work, as long as the job gets done.&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether the worker is paid according to a fixed rate or by commission;
* whether the worker provides his own tools and equipment; and
* whether the employer has the right to discipline, suspend and dismiss the worker.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of these rights would normally indicate control, this in turn indicating an employment contract.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisive difference between the control test and the dominant-impression test is that, in the latter, the existence or absence of control is only one of the factors to be taken into account.

In ''[[Smit v Workmen's Compensation Commissioner]]'', the court had to decide whether Smit, who had been employed as an "agent" for an insurance company, was an employee or not. He had been

* remunerated on a commission-basis;
* forbidden to perform certain acts (such as pledging the company’s credit) without written authority;
* forbidden from working for another company at the same time, but was not required to work full-time and could do other work at different times;
* given the use of a company motor-car, but had to pay out of his own pocket for fuel and servicing;
* working closely with a manager, but there was a total absence of any right of supervision and control of Smit by the insurance company; and
* able to obtain assistance from others in performing his duties.

The dominant-impression test was followed in this case, and Smit was held to not be an employee of the insurance company.

In ''[[Medical Association of SA v Minister of Health]]'', several district surgeons challenged the decision of the provincial MEC for Health for the Free State to terminate their contracts summarily as part of the restructuring of the district health service. The multiple or dominant impression test was followed, and the court used the factors discussed in ''Smit'' to assist it in obtaining the dominant impression that part-time district surgeons were in fact employees of the State.

The court held that the dominant-impression tests entails that one should have regard to all those considerations or ''indica'' which would contribute towards a determination of whether the contract is one of service or of work, and react to the impression one gets upon a consideration of all such ''indica''. The Labour Court based its decision on the following factors:

* The doctors rendered "personal services."
* The doctors were expected to be "at the beck and call" of the employer 24 hours a day, and to give preference to official duties over those in their private practices.
* The employer was obliged to pay a "contractual salary" to the doctors even in the absence of any actual work being performed, as long as the doctors made themselves available to do the work.
* Even though the doctors were professionals, the provincial administration did have some control over the way in which services were rendered.

The test has been subjected to severe criticism. Etienne Mureinik has said that it test

&lt;blockquote&gt;offers no guidance in answering the (legal) question whether the facts are of such a nature that the individual may be held to be servant within the meaning of the common law in difficult (penumbral) cases. Indeed, it is no test at all. To say that an employment contract is a contract which looks like one of employment sheds no light whatsoever on the legal nature of the relationship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism is based on the idea that it is not helpful to say a particular relationship exists because it looks like it does.

===== Productive capacity test =====

In other decisions, the courts appear to have resorted to what may be described as the "productive capacity" test.

This test was formulated in Martin Brassey’s article "The Nature of Employment" in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The independent contractor “sells the job” whereas the employee “sells his hands” [... E]mployment is a relationship in which one person is obliged, by contract or otherwise, to place his or her capacity to work at the disposal of another [... A]n employee is to be distinguished from an independent contractor, who undertakes to deliver, not his or her capacity to produce, but the product of that capacity, the completed work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Differences between employees and independent contractors =====

In ''[[SA Broadcasting Corporation v McKenzie]]'', the Labour Appeal Court summarised the main differences between the contract of employment proper and what is called the "contract of work" (''locatio conductio operis''):

* In the first, the object is the rendering of personal services between employer and employee; in the second, the object is the production of a certain specified service or the production of a certain specified result.
* The employee renders the service at the behest of the employer; the independent contractor is not obliged to perform his work personally, unless otherwise agreed.
* The employer may decide whether it wishes to have employee render service; the independent contractor is bound to perform specified work or produce a specified result within a specified or reasonable time.
* The employee is obliged to obey lawful, reasonable instructions regarding work to be done, and the manner in which it is to be done; the independent contractor is not obliged to obey instructions regarding the manner in which a task is to be performed.
* A contract of employment proper is terminated by the death of the employee; the contract of work is not terminated by the death of the contractor.
* A contract of employment terminates on completion of the agreed period; the contract of work terminates on completion of the specified work, or on production of the specified result.

===== Labour Relations Act 1995 s 200A =====

There is very little work that cannot be outsourced. Outsourcing is generally not supported by trade unions, who represent employees. If work is outsourced, the worker is an independent contractor. Political pressure was placed on government to move away from outsourcing and more towards employment.

In 2002, accordingly, a new presumption was added to the Labour Relations Act 1995, providing guidelines on when it has to be ascertained whether or not someone is an employee. This presumption was introduced as a part of significant amendments to the Labour Relations Act 1995 and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Section 83A of the BCEA contains a provision similar to section 200A of the LRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of this rebuttable presumption is that, if one or more of the list of factors is present, the person is presumed to be an employee unless and until the contrary is proven. Many of the factors and issues discussed by the courts in the cases above resurface again: The presumption is thus created

* if the manner in which the person works is subject to the control or direction of another person;
* if the person’s hours of work are subject to the control or direction of another person;
* if, in the case of a person who works for an organisation, the person forms part of that organisation;
* if the person has worked for that other person for an average of at least forty hours per month over the last three months;
* if the person is economically dependent on the person for whom he works or renders services;
* if the person is provided with tools of trade or work equipment by the other person; and
* if the person only works for or renders services to one person.

The legislative provision has been taken by some to be merely a restatement or summary of the principles laid down by the courts with the passing of time.

Although this presumption is useful in determining whether a person is an employee or not, as it is closely linked to the principles and approaches developed by the courts, the Labour Court held, in ''[[Catlin v CCMA]]'', that section 200A does not do away with the principle that the true nature of the relationship between the parties must be gathered from the contract between them. Section 200A is not the starting point, therefore; the court held that it is necessary to consider the provisions of the contract before applying the presumptions.

==== Essentials ====
The common-law concept of employment sets the scene for the interpretation of the Labour Relations Act 1995.

The contract of employment is the foundation of the relationship between an employee and his employer. It links the two parties in an employment relationship, irrespective of the form the contract takes.

The existence of an employment relationship is the starting point for the application of all labour law rules. Without an employment relationship between the parties, the rules of labour law do not apply.

The origin of South Africa's modern contract of employment lie in Roman law, where a distinction was made between the two types of contracts discussed above: ''locatio conductio operis'' and ''locatio conductio operarum''.

In terms of the common law, one does not have to have a written contract; therefore, not having the contract in written form is not a fatal flaw, as the contract can be verbal. There are, however, a number of statutes which require specific contracts of employment to be in writing. Section 29 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, for example, states that the employer must supply the employee with certain written particulars concerning specific things, like hours worked and remuneration.

Like any contract, the ''locatio conductio operarum'' commences when the parties have agreed to its essential terms, unless both parties have agreed to suspend its operation for a particular period. If the contract's operation is suspended, the employer is obliged to allow the employee to commence work on the specified date. Failure to do so, without good cause, constitutes a breach of contract at common law and a dismissal under the Labour Relations Act 1995. It is important, therefore, to determine what the essentials of the contract of employment are.

Stripped to its essence, the contract of employment today may be defined as an agreement between two parties, in terms of which one party (the employee) works for another (the employer) in exchange for remuneration. Although this definition appears to be simple, it contains a number of important principles, aspects and implications. When they are taken into account below, the definition of the employment contract may be expanded as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contract of employment is a voluntary [[South African labour law#Agreement|agreement]] between two legal personae (the parties) in terms of which one party (the employee) places his or her [[South African labour law#Work|personal services]] or labour potential at the disposal of the other party (the employer) for an indefinite or determined period [[South African labour law#Reciprocity|in exchange]] for some form of fixed or ascertainable [[South African labour law#Remuneration|remuneration]], which may include money and/or payments in kind. This entitles the employer to define the employee’s duties and to control the manner in which the employee discharges them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Agreement =====
Firstly, it must be noted that the employment contract is based on agreement; the parties must enter into it voluntarily. This idea finds expression in section 13 of the Constitution, which provides that "no one may be subjected to slavery, servitude or forced labour," and section 48 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which states that "all forced labour is prohibited."

Another implication of the fact that the employment contract is based on agreement is that it is a contract, and therefore must comply with the requirements of our law for a valid contract. If it does not comply with these requirements, it will not be regarded as binding and enforceable.

Consensus between the parties means that both must have a serious intention to create mutual rights and duties to which they will be legally bound. They must have each been fully aware of the nature of the duties, and that the other had this intention.

At common law, the parties are not required to observe any formalities. There is no requirement that the contract be in writing, but certain employment contracts are required by statute to be in writing, like those of merchant seamen and learners under the Skills Development Act. In addition, those of apprentices and candidate attorneys must also be registered with the appropriate authorities. Lastly, where parties wish to alter provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, this must be done in writing.

===== Work =====
Secondly, one of the pivotal concepts in the initial definition is that of work. Generally, to work means to place one’s labour potential at the disposal and under the control of another. This means that, when we work, we offer our services to another person, and agree that the other person will be able to tell us what to do, when to do it, how to do it and where to do it.

To place your labour potential at the disposal of another means to offer your ability to perform certain tasks to another person, and to offer, at the same time to follow that person’s instructions.

===== Remuneration =====
Remuneration normally takes the form of payment of money, or the provision of another benefit. (According to the common law, payment may be made in kind.)

Payment may be made monthly, weekly, daily or even in irregular cash payments. The common law does not prescribe what form payment must take.

The Labour Relations Act 1995 contains a statutory definition of remuneration in section 213: "any payment in money or in kind, or both in money and in kind, made or owing to any person in return for that person working for any other person, including the State."

The contract may state that remuneration is the "normal going rate for a specific type of work," or state a specific amount or merely "minimum wage."

The common law does not indicate minimum wages; these are usually set by collective-bargaining councils and are industry specific.

===== Reciprocity =====
The contract of employment is a reciprocal contract. This means that one promise is made in exchange for another, and one obligation is incurred in exchange for the other. The employee works in exchange for remuneration; the employer remunerates the employee in exchange for the employee offering to place his labour potential at the disposal and under the control of the employer.

===== Summary =====
To summarise, the essential elements of the employment contract are as follows:

* It is a voluntary agreement.
* There are two legal personae.
* The employee agrees to perform certain specified or implied duties for the employer.
* There is an indefinite or specified period.
* The employer agrees to pay a fixed or ascertainable remuneration to the employee.
* The employer gains a (qualified) right to command the employee as to the manner in which he carries out his duties.

==== Duties ====
An employment relationship commences only when the parties conclude a contract of service. Prior to this, neither party has any rights against the other; they are merely a prospective employee and a prospective employer.

There are, however, two statutory exceptions to the principle that employers have no obligations to applicants for employment:

# The EEA prohibits direct or indirect unfair discrimination against an employee or applicant for employment on the basis of race, colour, gender, sex, religion, political opinion, ethnic or social origin, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, family responsibility, marital status or any other arbitrary ground.
# The Labour Relations Act 1995 and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act protect both employees and persons seeking employment against discrimination for exercising rights conferred by the Acts.&lt;ref&gt;LRA s5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Employer =====
In addition to the three principle duties of the employer, discussed below, employers are further obliged to accord employees their rights in terms of the applicable contracts of service, collective agreements and legislation, as well as to adhere to certain statutory duties imposed in the interests of employees.

====== Receipt into service ======
The employer’s obligation to receive the employee into service is the corollary of the employee’s duty to enter and remain in service.

The duty to receive employees into service does not mean that employers must necessarily provide employees with work to keep them busy, although this general rule is subject to some exceptions: where, for example, remuneration is based on the volume of work done, as in the case of piece-workers or salespersons working on commission, or where the failure to allow the employee to work degrades his status. A duty to provide work may also arise where the employer has contracted to train the employee in a particular profession or trade, as in the case of article clerks and apprentices.

The common law permits the suspension of an employee, suspected of some form of grave misconduct, while the matter is being investigated, but the employee is entitled to his remuneration during the period of suspension.

Employers may deny their employees access to the workplace, or otherwise prevent them from working, in the course of collective bargaining. This is known as a "lock out," and is the employer’s equivalent of the employees’ strike. If a lock out is lawful—if, that is, it complies with the Labour Relations Act 1995—the employer is relieved of its obligation to pay the locked-out employees their wages.

Since the contract of employment is personal, one employer cannot compel an employee to work for another if the first employer has no work for him, unless the first employer's business is transferred as a going concern.

====== Payment ======
This duty is so fundamental to the employment contract that the courts will assume, where there has been no agreement on remuneration, either that the contract is not a contract of employment, or else that the parties impliedly intended the payment of a reasonable sum according to the custom and practice of the industry and locality.

The duty to pay, and the commensurate right to remuneration, arises not from the actual performance of work, but from the tendering of service.

It has become a widespread practice for employers to make up remuneration "packages" for their higher-paid employees in a tax-effective way, by substituting various benefits (like housing and car allowances) for the cash component of the salary.

The periodicity of payment depends on the parties’ agreement or on custom.

An employer may not unilaterally deduct any amount from the remuneration to which an employee is entitled.

If the contract is terminated summarily for good cause, the employer must pay the employee for services rendered to the day of the dismissal. The same principle applies when the employee deserts mid-term before the end of a fixed-term contract or without proper notice.

====== Safe and healthy working conditions ======
Under the common law, employers are obliged to provide their employees with reasonably safe and healthy working conditions.

The scope of this duty extends to providing proper machinery and equipment, properly trained and competent supervisory staff, and a safe system of working.

If the employer fails to meet with this obligation, affected employees are not in breach of contract if they refuse to work until the dangerous situation is corrected.

Under the common law, employees had to rely on delict if the employer did not ensure that the working conditions were safe and healthy, but this was viewed to be imprecise, and the Legislature intervened. The situation is now governed by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which implements strict liability on the employer, and states how much must be paid to the employee if accidents occur.

====== Remedies ======
If the breach is material, the employee may claim damages. Provided it is a material breach, the employee may also cancel the contract of employment.

The employee may also claim specific performance. This was seldom granted in the past but is now considered an option.

Finally, the employee may refuse to work, withholding labour until the contract is performed.

===== Employee =====

====== Entering and remaining in service ======
The main obligation of the employee under the contract is to place his personal services at the disposal of his employer.

The tender of service is a prerequisite to and the corollary of the employee’s right to claim payment of wages: "no work, no pay." The reverse also applies: "no pay, no work," so that employees who have not been paid may legitimately refuse to work without breaching their contracts.

If a number of workers engage in a concerted cessation of work for the purpose of obtaining some concession from their employer, they are deemed to be on strike. Under the common law, striking workers need not be paid. The common law also allowed employers summarily to dismiss striking employees, but this has since been changed by the Labour Relations Act 1995.

Subject to the right to take such paid leave as has been agreed upon or conferred by statute, once employees have entered service, they remain obliged to render service until the contract of employment ends.

If the employee fails to render service (by desertion, absenteeism, abscondment, unpunctuality, etc.), the employer is entitled to deduct from the employee’s wage an amount proportional to the absence.

====== Reasonable efficiency ======
Employees are deemed by law to guarantee impliedly that they are capable of performing the tasks they agree to perform, and that they will carry them out with reasonable efficiency.

Where an employer seeks assurances about employees’ competence before taking them into service, the employees are bound by any representations they may make, whether those professions of competence are made by the employees themselves, or in testimonials of which they are aware.

The standard of competence employers are entitled to expect of their employees depends on the capacities in which the employees are engaged and the status and seniority accorded them.

The test for the standard of competence is that of persons comparable with the employees in question, having regard to training, experience and any special claims the employee might have made regarding his competence.

Where an employee has warranted that he possesses a particular degree of skill, he must satisfy that representation.

====== Furthering employer’s business interests ======
Employees are obliged to devote their energies and skills to furthering their employer’s business interests. They must devote all their normal working hours to the employer’s business; they may not, without the employer’s permission, simultaneously work for another employer during the hours they are contractually obliged to devote to their employer’s needs.

These duties arise because the relationship between the parties is of a fiduciary nature: Employees may not place themselves in positions where their own interests conflict with those of their employers and may not, by exercising their powers of agency, acquire interests or benefits without the knowledge of their employers.

The interests of Employees must be ''bona fide'': They may not work for another employer if its business interests are in conflict with those of the principle employer.

In the absence of a contrary provision in the contract, there is nothing to preclude employees from holding two compatible jobs, provided the second is not conducted during the working hours they are obliged to devote to the first job. Contractual provisions limiting employees’ moonlighting activities are, however, permissible.

In addition, employees may not compete with their employer’s business for their own account.

====== Respect and obedience ======
Respect and obedience are regarded as an implied duty of every employee. Absence of the former renders the interpersonal relationship between employer and employee intolerable; denial of the latter undermines the employer’s right to decide how its employees will work.

The courts require all employees to show a reasonable degree of respect and courtesy to their employers, and to obey their employers’ reasonable and lawful instructions.

Respect, being a disposition, is a quality that is difficult to define with precision. It is not to be equated with deference in a manner compatible with the subordinate position in which the employee by definition stands ''vis-à-vis'' the employer.

Mere failure on occasion to greet the employer or superiors will not place employees in breach of their obligation to show respect. Disrespect must be gross if it is to justify termination of the employment relationship, or so frequent as to suggest that the employee has repudiated the employer's lawful authority, or that it has rendered the continuation of the employment relationship "intolerable."

Each case must be considered on its own merits to establish whether these inferences may be drawn.

Unless insolence is particularly gross, the proper sanction is a written warning in the first instance.

The employee’s duty of obedience applies only to work-related orders and generally during working hours and to those orders which are lawful and reasonable.

Employees are also entitled to disobey instructions that would subject them to personal dangers not normally connected with the performance of their duties.

An order is unlawful if it requires the employee to perform an illegal act or to do something that falls outside the scope of the contractual relationship.

====== Refraining from misconduct generally ======
Any misconduct that renders the continuation of the employment relationship intolerable or unworkable, or undermines trust and confidence between employer and employee, is regarded as sufficient to justify dismissal, provided it is serious enough to offset the importance which the courts otherwise attach to the work security of employees. Examples of misconduct are insubordination, theft, fraud.

With regard to misconduct committed before the formation of the conduct (like the commission of a serious crime), the general principle is that there is no duty on prospective employees to disclose prejudicial information from their past to their future employers unless they are specifically asked to do so.

A duty may arise, however, where the non-disclosure is material and amounts to fraud. Whether or not an employee may be dismissed for non-disclosure depends on whether or not the employment relationship can reasonably be sustained after the discovery of the past misdeed.

====== Remedies ======
The employer may only dismiss the employee summarily for misconduct, incapacity or operational requirements. If damages are incurred as a result of a breach of one of these duties, the employer may claim compensation.

== Basic employment rights ==
The Basic Conditions of Employment Act is aimed at low-income earners: those who earn less than R193,805 ''per annum''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.werksmans.com/keep-informed/our-publications/case-summaries/labour-law/increase-to-bcea-minimum-threshold-effective-as-at-1-july-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

No matter what the contract itself says, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is applicable as the minimum standard that must be achieved.

The Labour Relations Act 1995 deals with strikes and unions and the like; the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is a fall back option for those vulnerable workers who are not able to unionize due to various reasons, such as the kind of work they do. Domestic and farm workers are pertinent examples in the South African context.

The purpose of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is to advance economic development by providing basic conditions of employment.

The Basic Conditions of Employment Act also contains the definition of an employee, so that issue, discussed above, is relevant here, too. The Minister is empowered to extend the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to non-employees in specific circumstances. Even, therefore, if a domestic worker is not considered an employee in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Minister may extend the provisions to her for her own protection.

=== Minimum Wage ===

The employer has no discretion to pay less than the minimum wage. As noted above, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act provides the minimum standard to be achieved; employers must, at the very least, abide by the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.

Minimum wages are the result of bargaining councils in most circumstances, but some professions have no bargaining councils. Their minimum wage is therefore regulated by the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.

=== Hours ===

A maximum of 45 hours per week is allowed to be worked. These stipulations (regarding hours) are not applicable on the following persons:
* a person that earns more than R205 433.30 per year; or
* a person in a senior management position; or
* Sales personnel, employees are required to travel in the performing of their duties, and people that can determine their own work hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commercial law|last=Nagel|first=CJ|publisher=Lexis nexis|year=2016|isbn=9780409123968|location=Pretoria|pages=652–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overtime ====

Overtime is permitted on the basis of a voluntary agreement.

Payment for overtime is 1½ times the normal wage.

==== Sundays ====

Payment for working on a Sunday is twice the normal wage if the employee is not expected in terms of his/her contract to work on Sundays, however if the employee is expected to work on Sundays in terms of his or her contract, the employee shall receive 1.5 times the normal wage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Public holiday ====
A worker is entitled to double pay only if it is stipulated in the employee's contract that he/ she is expected to work on public holidays.

==== Meal intervals ====

An employee is entitled to one hour off for every 5 hours of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Weekly rest periods ====

An employee is entitled to 36 consecutive hours off. Issues such as night work, holidays and public holidays are also covered.

==== Sick leave ====

An employee is entitled to 6 weeks off over a three-year period, it is often interpreted as one day for 26 days of work.

==== Maternity leave ====

An employee is entitled to four months off in total, the leave must start at least 4 weeks prior to the expected birth date, and end at least 6 weeks after the expected date of birth. It does not, however, stipulate that this is paid leave. In terms of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, when a woman is on maternity leave, she is entitled to Unemployment Insurance Fund benefits for half the time spent away. Usually the employer will pay the other half, but this is not required in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.

==== Family-responsibility leave ====

If the employee has been working for more than four months, he is entitled to 3 days family-responsibility leave, as in the case where there has been a death in his family.

==== Remuneration ====

Employers must keep records of the hours worked and remuneration awarded for each employee for at least three years.

Employees are to be paid in South African currency at the place of work (unless this is altered in the contract).

Employers may not deduct money from employees unless prior consent in writing is obtained.

Regarding severance pay, in cases of retrenchments or dismissals for operational reasons, employees are entitled to one week’s pay for every year worked.

==== Variations ====

The Basic Conditions of Employment Act is the very minimum standard required by employers. Employers may award more, but never less, than what is stipulated.

If an employer gives more than the minimum, he may be locked into always giving more, as he must then abide by the required annual increases, which are based on a percentage of the current pay.

An employer may vary the provisions in the contract by

* individual agreement; or
* collective agreement on an industry-wide basis.

== Unfair labour practices ==
In the past, the concept of "unfair labour practice" was broadly defined. The Industrial Court (a specialist tribunal that exercised jurisdiction over alleged unfair labour practices) took several innovative approaches. The court formulated a set of rules to govern unfair dismissals. These rules are now contained in Chapter VIII of the Labour Relations Act 1995 and in the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 8 of the LRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The employment relationship has three stages:

* the beginning, when the employee is an applicant for employment;
* the middle, which continues as long as the relationship continues; and
* the end, which may take the form of dismissal, resignation or retirement.

Unfair conduct by the employer at the beginning of the relationship normally takes the form of [[South African labour law#Unfair discrimination|unfair discrimination]]. Unfair conduct by the employer at the end of the relationship normally takes the form of unfair [[South African labour law#dismissal|dismissal]]. Unfair conduct by the employer during the subsistence of the relationship will take the form of unfair labour practice.

Section 186(2) of the Labour Relations Act 1995 defines an "unfair labour practice" as "an unfair act or omission that arises between an employer and an employee," and involves

* unfair conduct by the employer relating to the promotion, demotion, probation or training of an employee, or relating to the provision of benefits to an employee;
* the unfair suspension of an employee, or any other unfair disciplinary action short of dismissal;
* a failure or refusal by an employer to reinstate or re-employ a former employee in terms of any agreement; and
* an occupational detriment, other than dismissal, in contravention of the Protected Disclosures Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 26 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; on account of the employee's having made a protected disclosure defined in that Act.

=== Scope of protection ===

The first part of section 186(2) speaks of an unfair labour practice as any unfair act or omission that arises between an employer and an employee. Only persons who are already in employment, therefore, enjoy protection against unfair labour practices; only persons, that is, who fall within the definition of "employee."

This concept may also cover ex-employees, if an employer refuses or fails to re-employ a former employee in terms of an agreement, for example.

=== Exhaustive list ===

Due to the use of the word "involving," the courts have held that the list of unfair labour practices, contained in section 186(2), is exhaustive. Therefore the definition of "unfair labour practice" in the current Labour Relations Act is considerably narrower than that of its predecessor, the Labour relations Act of 1956. This is because concepts such as unfair discrimination have been removed from its ambit and included in the EEA.

The fact that the list is exhaustive raises three issues, as the Constitution expressly affords everyone the right to fair labour practices:&lt;ref name="s 231"/&gt;

# whether the limitation of the constitutional right is justifiable, which according to the general consensus it is;
# the actual interpretation of this definition; and
# the freedom of employees to rely directly on the Constitution, as opposed to the current Labour Relations Act.

With regard to the interpretation of this definition, the general principle is that legislation that limits constitutional rights must be interpreted in such a way as to minimise the limitation. The definition must be interpreted so as to give the maximum possible protection.

With regard to the freedom to rely directly on the Constitution, employees may rely directly on the Constitution to challenge practices not covered by the Labour Relations Act 1995, like transfers. This issue, however, remains to be developed by the courts.

=== Promotion and demotion ===

==== Basic principles ====

Many cases have been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the courts in this regard. From these cases, three main issues arise:

# the meaning of "promotion" and "demotion;"
# the unfairness of the employer's conduct; and
# remedies.

===== Meaning =====

Employers commonly use one of two systems to promote employees:

# level progression, whereby employees are evaluated on a regular basis and progress to a higher level within the parameters of the job in question; and
# the application-for-vacancies system, whereby vacancies are advertised, and both current employees and external applicants are invited to apply for posts.

The second system is problematic. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the courts have held that it is not promotion at all, as the employee is nothing other than a job applicant.

Firstly, in order to constitute a dispute concerning promotion or demotion, the aggrieved individual must be an employee of the employer to which he wishes to take action.

Secondly, one must compare the current job held by the employee with the job applied for.

Factors which are taken into account include any difference in remuneration levels, fringe benefits, status, levels of responsibility or authority or power, and the level of job security.

In ''[[Mashegoane v University of the North]]'', the dispute was whether the university’s refusal to appoint a lecturer to the position of Dean of a faculty involved a promotion. The legislation governing the university provided that Deans were appointed by the Senate acting on the recommendation of the Faculty Board. The university argued

* that the position of the Dean was not applied for; and
* that it was not a promotion; but
* that it was a nomination.

Once the court established that the applicant was a current employee, it found that his salary would have remained the same, but that he would have received a Dean's allowance and would have had a car at his disposal; these were the only benefits. His status would have been considerably elevated. He would have had more responsibilities, authority and powers. In light of this, the appointment amounted to a promotion.

In ''[[Nawa v Department of Trade and Industry]]'', however, the court held that there was no promotion because there was no intention to change the existing terms and conditions of employment, even though there was an intention to change the way in which work was done.

Generally the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and other institutions are quick to assume that there was indeed a promotion or demotion.

Disputes concerning Promotion and Demotion generally involve employees being denied a higher-level post within the structure of the employer's organization or being stripped of status or benefits.

===== Unfairness =====

Generally, unfairness implies a failure to meet an objective standard, and includes arbitrary, capricious or inconsistent conduct, regardless of whether it is intentional or negligent.

Mere unhappiness on the part of the employee is not unfair.

With regard to substantive fairness, it may be difficult to justify the choice of a particular candidate in precise terms. An employer is at liberty to take into account subjective factors, such as performance at an interview, when considering an appointment or promotion. The employer must still provide reasons, however.

With regard to procedural fairness, the employer must follow its own procedures: If there is a practice of advertising the posts, it may not, without good reason, depart from that policy. An employee may challenge the composition and competency of a selection panel.

Examples of unfairness include bias, nepotism and erroneous exclusion of an employee from a shortlist due to a mistake by the employer or selection committee.

===== Remedies =====

The relief must be determined on terms deemed reasonable by the Commissioner.

Relief may be in the form of a declaratory order, protective promotion, remitting the matter back to the employer for reconsideration, and reinstatement to a previous position (in the case of demotion).

==== Probation ====
Guidelines may be gathered from the rules which govern the obligations of the employer before a fair decision to dismiss on the grounds of poor performance is reached, and also from the Code of Good Practice: Dismissals.

In this context, unfair conduct may include the failure to inform the employee properly about required performance standards, and the failure by an employer to afford the employee reasonable guidance, evaluation, training, counselling and instruction.

==== Provision of benefits ====
An employer may commit an unfair labour practice through unfair conduct relating to the provision of benefits.

This provision, contained in section 186(2)(a) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, does not appear to be problematic, but it has been beset by considerable uncertainties regarding the interpretation of "benefits."

Early decisions of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration attached a wide meaning to the term "benefits."

The problem is complicated by section 65(1)(c) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, which provides that employees may not strike over issues that may be referred to arbitration in terms of the Labour Relations Act 1995. A dispute over "benefits" may be referred to arbitration. If "benefits" is given a wide meaning, and is taken to include remuneration, this would mean that employees may not strike over wages and salaries.

There are two approaches to resolving the problem of interpretation:

# focus on the meaning of the word "benefit," and try define it; or
# focus on the nature of the dispute itself, bearing in mind the distinction between disputes over rights and disputes over interests.&lt;ref&gt;Wages would be a dispute over interests, and excluded from the ambit of the term "benefits."&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the courts take a narrow approach to interpretation. They apply a combination of the two approaches above. It has been held that the term "benefits" in the definition of an unfair labour practice includes only benefits ''ex contractu'' and ''ex lege'': benefits that already exist in terms of a contract or law.

There is growing support for the notion that unfair labour practices should include not only disputes of right, but also disputes where there is an expectation of a right.

==== Training ====
This prohibition has had little effect in practice. In view, however, of the obligations placed on employers in terms of the EEA and Skills Development Act, it may become more important in the future.

Generally employees may challenge the denial of training where such training is a prerequisite for advancement in the workplace.

==== Unfair suspensions ====
There are two types of suspension:

* preventative suspension, where disciplinary charges are being investigated against an employee, and the employer wants to suspend the employee pending the outcome of the disciplinary enquiry; and
* punitive suspension, where suspension is imposed as a disciplinary measure short of dismissal after the disciplinary hearing has been held.

In the context of section 186(2)(b), one must consider whether both types of suspension are covered, and what the requirements for a fair suspension are.

Initially the view was taken that only punitive suspensions fell within the scope of the "unfair labour practice," but this view was rejected by the Labour Court.

The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration follows the Labour Court's view and assumes jurisdiction over both punitive and preventative suspensions.

The practice of preventative suspension is not in itself unfair so long as there is substantive and procedural fairness when the employer takes this decision.

Substantive fairness in this context refers to the reason for the suspension. The employer must have a reason for believing that the suspension is necessary. This could be, for example, where the seriousness of the misconduct creates rumours and suspicion, necessitating a suspension of the employee in order for work to carry on smoothly, or where the employer has reason to fear that the employee in question may interfere with the investigation or the witnesses. It may also be that the employer fears another recurrence of the misconduct, or that the seniority and authority of the employee in question has a bearing on the matter.

Procedural fairness does not necessarily mean that the employee must be given a hearing before the suspension. At least, though, that the employer must inform him of the suspension, the reasons for it, and the conditions of the suspension.

As a general rule, the employer must continue remunerating the employee during the course of the suspension. If he were to cease remuneration, this would constitute a breach of contract.

Suspension without pay is generally only possible if the employee consents, or if this is provided by legislation or the contract of employment itself.

If the suspension is grossly unfair, the employee may seek reinstatement as a remedy.

Where the unfairness is less serious, the employee may seek an alteration of the conditions of the suspension or require that the employer hold a disciplinary hearing within a specified time.

==== Other disciplinary action short of dismissal ====
Other disciplinary actions, like warnings, suspensions with or without pay, demotions and transfers, must also meet the requirement of fairness. The employer must be able to show that the warning, demotion or other disciplinary action was fair and appropriate in the circumstances.

==== Failure or refusal to reinstate ====
Section 186(2)(c) of the Labour Relations Act 1995 protects employees against a "failure or refusal of an employer to reinstate or re-employ a former employee in terms of any agreement."

The wording is almost exactly the same as that in section 186(d), which deals with dismissal. Unlike section 186(2)(d), however, section 186(2)(c) does not deal with termination of employment; nor does it state that there must be an offer of re-employment to some employees and no offer in respect of others. Furthermore, section 186(2)(d) does not refer to an agreement; section 186(2)(c) does.

==== Protected disclosures ====
Any occupational detriment an employee may suffer due to the making of a protected disclosure is an unfair labour practice.

"Occupational detriment" and "protected disclosure" are defined in the Protected Disclosures Act.

"Occupational detriment" includes, ''inter alia'', being subjected to disciplinary action; dismissed, suspended, demoted, harassed or intimidated; transferred against one's will, refused transfer or promotion, etc.

Once it is established that the employee has suffered an "occupational detriment," it must be proved that the detriment was due to a protected disclosure. This means that there must be a protected disclosure, and that there must be causality between the disclosure and the detriment.

As far as causality is concerned, the Labour Relations Act 1995 requires that the detriment must be "on account of" the protected disclosure.

"Disclosure" is defined as "any disclosure of information regarding any conduct of an employer, or an employee of that employer, made by any employee who has reason to believe that the information concerned shows or tends to show one or more of the following:

* "that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed or is likely to be committed;
* "that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which that person is subject;
* "that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur;
* "that the health or safety of an individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered;
* "that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged;
* "unfair discrimination as contemplated in the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act [...]; or
* "that any matter referred to [above] has been, is being or is likely to be deliberately concealed."

Generally, such disclosures become protected when they are made to certain persons and offices under certain conditions:

* it was made in good faith;
* the employee reasonably believes that it is substantially true; and
* it was not made for personal gain.

Furthermore, the employee must have reason to believe

* that, if disclosure is made to the employer, he will suffer an occupational detriment;
* that the information was previously disclosed, and no action was taken by the employer; or
* that the matter is exceptionally serious.

Not every disclosure made by an employee will be protected. Only gradually are the courts beginning to consider the nature of a protected disclosure and the protection to be afforded to employees.

In ''[[Grieve v Denel]]'', the employee was busy preparing a report for the employer’s board of directors relating to allegations of wrongdoing by a manager. The employee found himself charged with misconduct, suspended and told to attend a disciplinary enquiry. He approached the Labour Court for an interdict to stop the employer’s taking disciplinary action. The court held that the disclosures the employee intended to make were in good faith, and that, if the allegations were true, they could indicate possible criminal conduct. The disclosures were held to fall within the ambit of protection. The employer was ordered not to proceed with the pending disciplinary action.

In ''[[CWU v Mobile Telephone Networks]]'', the Labour Court held that an employee’s accusation of fraud by management did not constitute a protected disclosure; it was merely the employee’s opinion and was not supported by any facts.

==== Resolution of disputes ====
The procedure for resolving unfair-labour-practice disputes is similar to the dispute resolution for unfair dismissals.

First, the dispute must be referred to a bargaining council (or the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration if there is no bargaining council) for conciliation.

If conciliation does not succeed, the matter may be referred to arbitration.

Unlike unfair dismissal disputes, unfair-labour-practice disputes are required, by section 191 of the Labour Relations Act 1995, to be referred within ninety days of the relevant act or omission, or ninety days from the date on which the employee became aware of the act or occurrence.

In terms of section 193(4) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, an arbitrator has the power to determine any unfair labour practice dispute on "reasonable terms," which may include ordering reinstatement, re-employment or compensation (of up to twelve months' pay).

The onus is on the employee to prove all the elements of the alleged unfair labour practice in question.

== Discrimination law ==
Seen generally, there are three mechanisms designed to protect the individual employee:

# protection against unfair dismissal;
# protection against unfair labour practices; and
# the setting of minimum conditions of employment in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.

The fourth mechanism of protection is protection against unfair discrimination.

The Labour Relations Act 1995 was the first piece of legislation to deal with discrimination in the workplace.

The EEA also contains detailed provisions to counteract and eliminate discrimination in the workplace.

The Constitution, with its right to equality,&lt;ref&gt;s 9.&lt;/ref&gt; provides an important constitutional context for employment equity. A consideration of this constitutional provision indicates that the elimination of discrimination has two bases:

* formal equality, or equality in treatment; and
* substantive equality, enshrined in the adoption of positive measures to empower previously disadvantaged groups in South African society; also known as "affirmative action."

Section 6 of the EEA contains the main thrust of the Act's prohibition against unfair discrimination. It provides that

&lt;blockquote&gt;no person may unfairly discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an employee, in any employment policy or practice, on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, family responsibility, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, HIV status, conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language and birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not unfair discrimination

* to take affirmative action measures consistent with the purpose of the Act; or
* to distinguish, exclude or prefer any person on the basis of an inherent requirement of a job.&lt;ref&gt;s 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harassment of an employee is a form of unfair discrimination, and is prohibited on any of the above grounds.&lt;ref name="s 63"&gt;s 6(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the EEA places a positive duty on every employer to take steps to promote equal opportunity in the workplace by eliminating unfair discrimination in any employment policy or practice.&lt;ref&gt;s 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain circumstances there may be a duty on the employer to take reasonable measures to accommodate certain groups of employees.

In this regard, the Code of Good Practice: Key Aspects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Employment, together with the Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities, provides guidelines on how HIV/AIDS and disability should be dealt with and accommodated in the workplace.

This is the only legislative provision that mentions human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Its inclusion makes section 6 of the EEA even wider than section 9 of the Constitution.

Section 6 protects only an "employee," but it does not speak only of an employer; it provides that "no person" may discriminate. This is broader, and may include, ''inter alia'', an independent pension fund or an independent medical aid scheme, or even a fellow employee.

In this regard, if an employee lodges a complaint of discrimination against another employee, and the employer does not consult in an attempt to eliminate the discrimination, the employer may be held liable.

The difference between discrimination and differentiation must always be kept in mind, as not all differentiations amount to discrimination. There may be a fair differentiation between employees on the basis, for example, of educational qualifications or experience or seniority.

Generally, differentiation will amount to discrimination if it is based on an unacceptable reason. Even if the discrimination suffered is not listed in section 6(1) of the EEA, it would amount to discrimination if, objectively, it is based on attributes and characteristics which have the potential to impair the fundamental human dignity of persons as human beings, or to affect them adversely in a comparably serious manner.

Once the employee has proven that there has been a differentiation, the EEA and Constitution provide that it is presumed to have been unfair discrimination. The employer then bears the onus of proving the differentiation to be fair.

Discrimination may be direct or indirect:

* It is direct when it is clearly and expressly based on one or more of the grounds listed in section 6 of the EEA.
* It is indirect when, although not express, discrimination occurs as a result of it, as when an employer imposes a gender-neutral criterion, such as height or weight, as a condition for employment, and this criterion indirectly has a disproportionate effect on women.

=== Harassment ===

The EEA provides that harassment amounts to "a form of unfair discrimination," and as such is prohibited.&lt;ref name="s 63"/&gt; The most prevalent forms of harassment encountered in the workplace are

* sexual harassment;
* racial harassment;
* sexual-orientation harassment; and
* religious harassment.

Of these, sexual harassment is by far the most common.

==== Sexual harassment ====

The [[Code of Good Practice on Handling of Sexual Harassment Cases]] lists three types of conduct which could constitute [[sexual harassment]]:

# physical conduct ranging from touching to sexual assault and rape, and including a strip-search by or in the presence of the opposite sex;
# verbal conduct, including innuendoes, suggestions and hints, sexual advances, comments with sexual overtones, sex-related jokes or insults, graphic comments about a person's body (made to that person or in her presence), enquiries about a person's sex life, and even whistling at a person or a group of persons; and
# non-verbal conduct, including gestures, indecent exposure or the display of sexually explicit pictures or objects.

Another way to define sexual harassment is to consider the effect of the harassment. Three types of harassment may be so identified:

# ''quid pro quo'' harassment, which occurs when a person is forced into surrendering to sexual advances against her will, for fear of losing a job-related benefit;
# sexual favouritism, which occurs where a person in authority rewards only those who respond to his sexual advances; and
# [[hostile work environment]] harassment, which occurs when an abusive working environment is created.

The questions remain: From whose perspective does one analyse the conduct to see if it amounts to sexual harassment? What test does one apply? Does one look to the way in which the victim experienced the situation (a subjective test), or does one try to be more objective?

* A subjective test would rely exclusively on the perceptions of the victim. An obvious criticism of such a test is that some victims may be over-sensitive, and therefore cast the net too wide.
* A purely objective test, on the other hand, may be too narrow. The "reasonable man" test (which is, in terms of the common law, the generally applied "objective" test) implies reliance on male-dominated values.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* The "reasonable victim" test seeks to establish a compromise. It takes into account the experiences of the victim, the surrounding circumstances, and the question of fault on the part of the perpetrator.

Decided cases are inconsistent on which test should be used.

The Code of Good Practice states that sexual harassment is "unwanted conduct of a sexual nature." This implies a subjective test. It goes on to say, however, that sexual attention will only become sexual harassment

* if the behaviour is persistent;
* if the recipient has makes it clear that the conduct is considered offensive; or
* if the perpetrator should know that the behaviour is regarded as unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Item 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code thus adopts a mixture of the subjective and the objective test.

===== Employer liability =====

The EEA states that the employer may be held liable if he was made aware of the conduct but did nothing, or did not do everything that could be expected of a reasonable employer.&lt;ref&gt;s 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Code provides that, as a first step in expressing concern about and commitment to dealing with the problem of sexual harassment, employers should issue a policy statement, stipulating the following:

* All employees, job applicants and other persons who have dealings with the business have the right to be treated with dignity.
* Sexual harassment in the workplace will not be permitted or condoned.
* Persons who have been or are being subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace have the right to lodge a grievance about it. Appropriate action will be taken by the employer.&lt;ref name="Item 6"&gt;Item 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code recommends that management be given a positive duty to implement the policy, and to take disciplinary action against employees who do not comply with it. A policy on sexual harassment should explain the procedure to be followed by employees who are victims of sexual harassment. The policy should also state the following:

* Allegations of sexual harassment will be dealt with seriously, expeditiously, sensitively and confidentially.
* Employees will be protected against victimisation and retaliation for lodging grievances, as well as from false accusations.&lt;ref name="Item 6"/&gt;

Finally, the Code recommends that policy statements on sexual harassment be communicated effectively to all employees.&lt;ref name="Item 6"/&gt;

===== Other remedies =====

The employee who resigns due to sexual harassment may argue that this was a constructive dismissal, which would provide grounds for finding an automatically unfair dismissal.

A victim of harassment may institute a civil claim, based on delict, against the perpetrator; she may also institute a claim against the employer, based on the common-law principles of vicarious liability.

==== Medical testing ====
The EEA prohibits medical testing of an employee, unless

* legislation requires or permits such testing; or
* the testing is justifiable.&lt;ref&gt;s 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing may be justifiable in the light of

* the medical facts;
* the employment conditions;
* social policy;
* the fair distribution of employee benefits; or
* the inherent requirements of a job.

Job applicants are also protected from medical testing.&lt;ref&gt;s 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEA prohibits "psychological and other similar assessments" of employees, unless such an assessment

* has been scientifically shown to be valid and reliable;
* is applied fairly to all employees; and
* is not biased against any employee or group of employees.&lt;ref&gt;s 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== HIV/AIDS =====
The EEA lists HIV status as one of the grounds on which an employee may not be discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;s 6(1).&lt;/ref&gt; South African Airways, for example, formerly had a policy of not employing HIV-positive employees as cabin attendants, partly because it believed that HIV-positive people could not have vaccinations,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} a requirement for international travel, and were at risk of infection, which might be transmitted to others.

In ''[[Hoffman v South African Airways]]'', the court found that people living with HIV constitute a minority, to which society has responded with intense prejudice, stigmatization and marginalization. Society's response has forced many of them not to reveal their HIV status, for fear of such prejudice, and has thus deprived them of the help they would otherwise have received. This stigmatization the court considered an assault on their dignity.

The EEA is designed to counteract

* the need which employers may feel to test their employees for HIV/AIDS; and
* the concomitant risk of prejudice to employees who do test positive.&lt;ref name="s 72"&gt;s 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such testing is prohibited unless it is held to be justifiable by the Labour Court, which may impose various conditions on such testing, including

* the provision of counselling;
* the maintenance of confidentiality;
* a limitation on the period of HIV-testing; and
* a limitation on the category of jobs or employees in respect of which such testing is authorized.

Employers may make HIV testing available to employees as part of a "wellness" program, provided that it takes place confidentially and on the basis of informed consent. Authorisation from the Labour Court is not required for such testing.

The EEA does not forbid anonymous testing undertaken for epidemiological purposes, or to establish the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among the workforce.&lt;ref name="s 72"/&gt;

In ''[[Joy Mining Machinery v NUMSA]]'', the court held that the following considerations should be taken into account in determining whether or not HIV testing is justifiable:

* the prohibition on unfair discrimination;
* the need for such testing;
* the purpose of such testing;
* the medical facts;
* the employment conditions;
* social policy;
* the fair distribution of employee benefits;
* the inherent requirements of the job; and
* the category or categories of jobs or employees concerned.

The court will also want to be informed about the following, which do not go to the question of justifiability, but which are also relevant to arriving at a proper decision:

* the attitude of the employees;
* the financing of the test;
* the preparations for the test;
* pre-test counseling;
* the nature of the proposed test and procedure; and
* post-test counseling.

There is also a [[Code of Good Practice on Key Aspects of HIV/AIDS and Employment]], which provides guidelines to employers and employees on how to deal with HIV/AIDS in general.

With regard to HIV/AIDS and disability, the Code states that an employee who has become too ill to work may be dismissed on grounds of incapacity. A mental or physical impairment will constitute a disability only if it is "substantially limiting" in respect of entry into, or advancement in, employment.

==== Disputes about discrimination ====
A dispute about unfair discrimination must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation within six months of the alleged discriminatory act or omission.

Disputes of this nature may not be referred to a bargaining council.

In referring the dispute to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, the referring party must indicate that it has made a reasonable attempt to resolve the dispute, depending on the circumstances.

If conciliation fails, the matter may be referred to the Labour Court, unless the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for arbitration.

The Labour Court may make any appropriate order that is "just and equitable" in the circumstances, including compensation, damages, and orders directing the employer to take preventative steps.

Again, once the employee proves that there was discrimination, the onus shifts to the employer to prove that the discrimination was fair.

==== Affirmative Action ====
Alongside the prohibition against unfair discrimination, affirmative action is the second cornerstone of the EEA.

According to section 2(b) of the EEA, the goal of affirmative action is to ensure the equitable representation of certain groups in all occupational categories and levels in the workplace.

"Equitable representation" is not defined in the EEA, but section 42 states that it may be determined by a consideration of

* the demographic profile of the economically active population, nationally and regionally;
* the pool of suitably qualified people in the designated groups from which the employer may reasonably be expected to promote or appoint employees; and
* the economic and financial factors relevant to the sector in which the employer operates.

Affirmative action is, by its very nature, a temporary measure. Once the goal of equality in the workplace has been achieved, the reason for the measure will fall away.

A potential beneficiary of affirmative action must meet two requirements:

# He must be "suitably qualified."
# He must be from a designated group.&lt;ref&gt;s 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, in this regard, four key definitions in the EEA:

# "Designated groups" are black people, women and people with disabilities.
# "Black people" include Africans, Colored people and Indians.
# "People with disabilities" are those who have a long-term physical or mental impairment which substantially limits their prospects of entry into (or advancement in) employment.
# A "suitably qualified person" is one who may be qualified for a job as a result of any of his formal qualifications, prior learning, relevant experience, or his capacity to acquire, within a reasonable time, the ability to do the job.

Employees from one of the designated groups may approach the Labour Court, citing unfair discrimination, to enforce a lack of affirmative action. The Labour Court has held, however, that there is no ''individual'' right to affirmative action, which is collective in nature.

===== Designated employers =====
The prohibition of unfair discrimination applies to all employers, regardless of their size, but the affirmative-action provisions of the EEA apply only to "designated employers."

A "designated employer" is defined as follows:

* an employer who employs fifty or more employees; or
* an employer who employs fewer than fifty employees but whose annual turnover in any given year exceeds a certain level,&lt;ref&gt;See EEA, Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt; like an employer in agriculture with a total annual turnover of R2,000,000;
* municipalities;
* organs of state; or
* an employer appointed as a designated employer in terms of a collective agreement.

Employers that do not fall within the ambit of this definition may still voluntarily indicate that they intend to comply with the Act.

===== Employment-equity plans =====
The employment-equity plan is the centrepiece of the procedure for implementing affirmative action in the workplace.

A designated employer has to consult with the workforce on

* the conduct of an analysis of its employment policies, practices and procedures, as well as the working environment;&lt;ref name="s 19"&gt;s 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the preparation and implementation of an employment-equity plan, which will achieve reasonable progress towards employment equity in the workforce;&lt;ref&gt;s 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* the submission of reports to the Department of Labour.&lt;ref&gt;EEA, s 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis described above must also contain a profile of the employer's workforce.&lt;ref name="s 19"/&gt; Using this profile, the employer must determine the degree of under-representation of people from designated groups in the various categories and levels.

The employment-equity plan must include

* annual objectives;
* the affirmative-action measures that have to be implemented;
* annual timetables for the achievement of goals;
* the duration of the plan; and
* internal procedures to resolve disputes about the interpretation or implementation of the plan.

If there is an under-representation of people from designated groups, the plan must also outline

* the numerical goals to be achieved;
* the timetable within which these goals have to be achieved; and
* the strategies to achieve such goals.

A copy of the plan must be made available to employees. The designated employer must assign one or more senior manager the responsibility and authority and means to monitor and implement the plan.

Designated employers must submit reports to the Department of Labour:

* If fewer than 150 employees are employed, the report must be made every two years.
* If more than 150 employees are employed, the report must be made every year.&lt;ref&gt;s 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designated employers are required to submit a statement to the Employment Conditions Commission about the remuneration and benefits received by employees in each occupational category and level. If this statement reflects disproportionate income differentials, the employer must take steps progressively to reduce such differentials.&lt;ref name="s 27"&gt;s 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Enforcement =====
The EEA provides for four ways in which compliance with its affirmative-action provisions may be ensured:

# self-regulation;
# administrative procedures;
# court action; and
# state contracts.

====== Self-regulation ======
Employment equity plans must include dispute-resolution procedures. Employers and employees must use these procedures first.

====== Administrative procedures ======
A labour inspector, with reasonable grounds for believing that an employer is not complying with the EEA, may try to obtain a written undertaking from the employer that he will comply. If he refuses, the inspector may issue a compliance order, to which the employer may object within 21 days.

====== Court action ======
The Labour Court has the power

* to make a compliance order an order of court;
* to direct the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to conduct an investigation to assist the court;
* to order compliance with any provision of the EEA;
* to hear appeals against compliance orders imposed by the Director-General; and
* to impose fines on employers if they fail to comply with the EEA.&lt;ref&gt;s 50(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

====== State contracts ======
Designated employers who wish to enter into commercial contracts with organs of state must comply with the EEA. They must attach to their offer either

* a certificate of compliance issued by the Minister of Labour; or
* a statement that they do comply.

If these requirements are not met, the organ of state may reject the offer; it may even constitute grounds for the cancellation of a contract that has already been concluded.&lt;ref&gt;s 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job security ==

=== Common law ===

The common law afforded the employee virtually no protection against unfair dismissal. Before the Labour Relations Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 66 of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; (LRA), as long as the employer gave the required period of notice, dismissal or probation was acceptable. The common law focused only on the lawfulness of the employment contract itself; the reason for the dismissal was irrelevant. The employer was not required to give the employee an explanation for the termination; nor was there any requirement that the dismissal be fair.

This had the effect of increasing the bargaining power of the employer, who could, essentially, do as he pleased, because of his more powerful position. The employer could threaten to dismiss the employee if the latter refused to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment. The reason for this, it has been contended, is that, prior to 1980, this area of law was based on the incorrect assumption that there existed equal bargaining power between employer and employee.

=== International Labour Organization ===

South Africa has since subscribed to international labour standards, in the form of [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) instruments like the [[Termination of Employment Convention, 1982]], which provides that an employer must have a fair reason to terminate the employment contract, and that the reason for dismissal must fall into one of three broad categories:

# the misconduct of the employee;
# the employee's incapacity or inability to do the work; and
# the employer's operational requirements.

Misconduct relates to the behaviour of the worker, usually involving some fault on his part, like insubordination, assault, theft, dishonesty, frequent late-coming or intimidation of co-workers.

Capacity relates to the worker's ability to do his job. It includes incompetence or incapability for medical reasons (ill health or injury). It is viewed as a no-fault dismissal.

Operational requirements relate not to the employee, but rather to the business enterprise of the employer. If an employee is dismissed on this ground, his is a no-fault dismissal. The most common form that this category takes is dismissal based on the economic needs of the business, or on the employer's need to restructure the organisation.

The Convention states further that employers must notify employees or their representatives that dismissal is contemplated, and must provide relevant information to them. The employer is obliged to consult regarding measures to minimise the number of dismissals, and also to mitigate the adverse effects of dismissal.

=== Labour Relations Act ===

Unfair dismissal is now governed by the Labour Relations Act. Some have argued that the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Others have argued that a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Labour Relations Act provides for the right not to be unfairly dismissed or subjected to unfair labour practices.&lt;ref&gt;s 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unfair dismissal ====

Only employees have the right not to be unfairly dismissed; non-employees enjoy no such protection. The Labour Relations Act's approach to unfair dismissal may be summarised in the following three questions:

# Is the worker an employee? (Only employees may be dismissed, and only employees enjoy the protection of the Labour Relations Act.)
# Has there been a dismissal? (To answer this question, one must look to section 186(1) of the Labour Relations Act.)
# Is the dismissal substantively or procedurally unfair? (In this regard, the ''reason'' for the dismissal will be a decisive factor.)

The employee has the onus to establish that there has in fact been a dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;s 192(1).&lt;/ref&gt; If this is discharged, the onus shifts to the employer, who prove the fairness of the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;s 192(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dismissal" is the termination of the employment relationship by the employer, with or without notice.&lt;ref&gt;s 186(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; It can also entail

* that the employee reasonably expected the employer to renew a fixed-term contract of employment on the same or similar terms, but the employer offered to renew it on less favourable terms, or did not renew it at all;&lt;ref name="s 1861b"&gt;s 186(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; or
* that the employer refused to allow the employee to resume work after she took maternity leave in terms of any law or collective agreement, or in terms of her contract of employment.&lt;ref name="s 1861c"&gt;s 186(1)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

An employer who has dismissed a number of employees for the same or similar reasons, but who now offers to re-employ one or more of them, while refusing to re-employ another, will have dismissed the latter.&lt;ref&gt;s 186(1)(d).&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory definition also recognises as constituting dismissal certain circumstances in which the ''employee'' terminates the employment relationship. This is known as constructive dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;s 186(1)(e)-(f).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where, for example, an employee terminates a contract of employment, with or without notice, because the employer has made continued employment intolerable for him, he will have been constructively dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;186(1)(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee may also be regarded as having been constructively dismissed if he terminates a contract of employment, with or without notice, because his new employer, after a transfer of the business as a going concern,&lt;ref&gt;See LRA, ss 197, 197A.&lt;/ref&gt; provided him with conditions or circumstances at work which are substantially less favourable than those provided by his former employer.&lt;ref&gt;s 186(1)(f).&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Termination of the employment contract =====

Section 186(1)(a) of the Labour Relations Act refers to the standard form of dismissal. Either the employee is given notice of the termination, or his contract of employment is terminated by way of summary termination. Note, again, that only "employees" may be dismissed.

The requisite period of notice may be expressly stated in the contract itself, in terms of a statute such as the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 75 of 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; or even in terms of a collective agreement. In terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,

* one week's notice is required in the first six months of employment;
* two weeks' notice if the employee has been employed for more than six months but less than a year; and
* four weeks' notice if he has been employed for more than a year.

Summary termination by the employer may be justified if the employee has committed a serious or fundamental breach of a material term of the contract.

In ''[[CSIR v Fijen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;1996 (2) SA 1 (SCA).&lt;/ref&gt; an employee and his employer had quarrelled during negotiations, with the employee declaring their relationship "finished," and the employer interpreting this as a resignation. The employee subsequently denied having resigned; what he meant, he argued, was that the working relationship had become intolerable. The court held that, in the absence of a clear and unambiguous intention to quit, there could not have been a proper resignation. The employer, therefore, was mistaken in its interpretation of his words.

There were indications, in ''[[Ouwehand v Hout Bay Fishing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(2004) 25 ILJ 731 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; that the employee would be retrenched. Representations were made to him that he should find other work. He stopped going to work, therefore, on the assumption that he had been dismissed. The court, however, held that he had resigned, because the onus is on the employee to show that he has been dismissed. The employee in this case did not discharge that onus.

When dismissal may be effected is a question of some practical importance. It relates to the question regarding the commencement of employment: Does it commence when the contract is concluded, or rather when the employee starts working? The difficulty is that there may be a significant lapse of time between these two events.

The Labour Court held, in ''[[Whitehead v Woolworths]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] JOL 5162 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; that, to qualify as an employee, it was insufficient for the employee to prove that a contract of employment had been concluded. The conclusion of the contract merely gives rise to contractual claims; it does not confer the status of an employee or employer on the parties for the purposes of the Labour Relations Act. "In terms of the definition," Waglay AJ found,

&lt;blockquote&gt;a person is only an employee when such person actually works for another person. The employee must therefore have rendered a service to another which services are not that [''sic''] of an independent contractor. In addition to working for another the employee must also "receive" or be "entitled to receive" remuneration. The remuneration referred to must correspondingly mean remuneration for work done or tendered to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Para 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two subsequent decisions of the Labour Court, in ''[[Jack v Director-General, Department of Environmental Affairs]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] JOL 10347 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Wyeth SA v Manqele]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2003] JOL 11136 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; have taken a different approach.

The rights and remedies of a job applicant were considered in ''Jack'', where the employer breached the contract by not allowing the party to commence work on the agreed date. The Labour Court, having examined the question of whether or not there was an employment relationship between the parties, decided that, once the parties have reached agreement on all the essential terms of the contract, it will be binding and enforceable.

In ''Wyeth'', employer and employee had concluded a written contract on 15 March providing that the employee would commence work on 1 April. Before work commenced, the employer informed the employee that it was no longer prepared to employ him. The Labour Court held that the term "employee" in the Labour Relations Act encompasses a person who has concluded a contract to work, and that such person would also enjoy protection against unfair dismissal. This is in line with a purposive interpretation of the definition of "employee."

The employment relationship is wider than the employment contract. While the contract of employment is the foundation of the relationship, the relationship may begin before the employee commences working, and may endure for some time after the contract has been terminated. It ought also to be noted that, although abscondment by the employee constitutes a breach of contract, this by itself does not necessarily bring the contract to an end. Only when the employer ''accepts'' the employee's repudiation of the contract may it be said that there has been a dismissal.

In some cases, an employment relationship is terminated by neither the employer nor the employee, but by operation of law. This occurs, for example, when an employee's residence or work permit expires, and is sometimes called "automatic dismissal."

===== Failure to renew fixed-term contract =====

The employee must have a "reasonable" expectation that the [[fixed-term contract]] will be renewed.&lt;ref name="s 1861b"/&gt; He bears the onus of proving that the expectation of continued or permanent employment is reasonable. The test is objective, inquiring into whether or not a reasonable person would anticipate renewal in such circumstances.

In addition, the employer must have created the impression that such an expectation was justified. The following are among the ways in which the employer or his representative may create such an impression:

* by past renewals of fixed term contracts;
* by making representations to the employee that the contract will be renewed; and
* by assuring the employee that the contract will be renewed.

There must, then, be some form of "prior promise or past practice." An offer on less favourable terms is also subject to the reasonable-expectation test.

In ''[[SA Rugby v CCMA]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2006] 1 BLLR 27 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; the coach of the team indicated to certain players that he had "plans for them." When it came to choosing the side, however, certain of those players were not even sent to training, and therefore were ineligible for the renewal of their contracts. It was held that the coach's representations to the players were such that they had a reasonable expectation of renewal.

What about the reasonable expectation of a permanent position? In ''[[Dierks v Unisa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] JOL 4515 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; the employee had been employed by means of a series of fixed-term contracts. He argued that he had been unfairly retrenched, and that he was entitled to a permanent position. It is important to draw a distinction between the employee's two expectations:

# that the fixed-term contract would be renewed on the same or similar terms; and
# that he would have permanent employment.

The court held that section 186(1)(b) relates to the first expectation only, but the Labour Court later found, in ''[[McInnes v Technikon Natal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2000] JOL 6389 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; that its decision in ''Dierks'' had been incorrect. It took the view that the focus should be on the nature of the expectation, and whether or not in the circumstances the expectation was reasonable. ''In casu'', the employee genuinely believed that she would be doing the same work as before, the only difference being that her appointment would in future be permanent. In this case, the "similar terms" referred to included the reasonable expectation of permanent employment on similar terms.

The uncertainty continued with ''[[Auf Der Heyde v University of Cape Town]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2000] JOL 7041 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; where the Labour Court accepted that the approach in ''Dierks'' was correct, and that section 186(1)(b) did not include a reasonable expectation of permanent employment. This case, however, went on appeal, where the judge found it unnecessary in the circumstances to decide the issue.

===== Dismissal for reasons relating to pregnancy =====

The Basic Conditions of Employment Act provides for four months' maternity leave, but does not require that it be paid. It is possible, however, for an employee to make a claim in terms of the Unemployment Insurance (UIF) Act.&lt;ref&gt;Act 63 of 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual or collective agreements may provide for paid maternity leave.

An important concession in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is that no employee may be expected to work for the first six weeks after the birth of her baby, but a midwife or medical practitioner may certify that she is fit to work if the employee wishes to do so. An employer's refusal to allow an employee to return to work after she has been on maternity leave (paid or unpaid) will now fall within the ambit of "dismissal" for the purposes of the Labour Relations Act.&lt;ref name="s 1861c"/&gt; If an employee does not return to work within the period permitted, this will probably be viewed as abscondment, in which case the normal sanctions will apply.

===== Selective re-employment =====

In a sense, in cases of selective re-employment,&lt;ref&gt;LRA, s 186(1)(d).&lt;/ref&gt; the employment relationship continues even after the employment contract itself has been terminated. Three elements are essential:

# There must have been a dismissal.
# The employees concerned must have been dismissed for the same or similar reasons.
# The employer must subsequently have offered to re-employ one or more of the previously dismissed employees, while refusing to re-employ one or more of the others.

===== Constructive dismissal =====

The essential feature of a constructive dismissal&lt;ref name="s 1861e"&gt;s 186(1)(e).&lt;/ref&gt; is that the employee terminates the employment contract. His resignation is not entirely voluntary, however, as it is brought about or necessitated by the actions or omissions of the employer. These actions must be "intolerable."&lt;ref name="s 1861e"/&gt; The employee, in resigning, indicates that he would have carried on work indefinitely had not the intolerable situation been created.

In considering whether or not there has in fact been a constructive dismissal, the courts will ask the following questions:

* Did the employee intend to bring an end to the employment relationship? Here one must look to the factual context. If the employee signs a resignation letter, such intention is almost certainly present. If the employee would have resigned anyway, even without the intolerable circumstances, he may not claim that those circumstances were the decisive factor. The time frame, too, is important: If the employee only resigns some months after an isolated incident, his case is less credible than if he had done so immediately. He is not automatically discredited, however; the situation must be viewed as a whole. Any subsequent conduct, where the accumulative effect is intolerable, must also be considered.
* Was the working relationship so objectively intolerable that it was no longer possible for the employee to work there? This must be viewed in light of the objective reasonable-person test. "Intolerable" conduct is conduct beyond the norm. To curse and swear in a particular environment may be completely acceptable, for example, and therefore not in itself intolerable. Misrepresentations made by an employer are considered intolerable, as is withholding an employee's salary or claiming deductions without prior written consent; so, too, is the making of threats, and abuse or violent behaviour, on the part of the employer. Furthermore, if an employee is denied the use of a company car, when such is required for the job, and the contract provides for one, this will also count as intolerable. On the other hand, a mere request by the employer to keep costs low is not intolerable; nor is the absence of immediate employment opportunities, or displeasure the employer's management style.
* Did the employer create the intolerable situation? The intolerable situation must be linked to the conduct of the employer.
* Is the situation likely to endure for a longer period of time? This depends on the circumstances of the case.
* Was termination the only option available to the employee? It must be the only reasonable option, and the employee must first have tried other possible dispute-resolution options: lodging a grievance, for example, and then giving the employer the chance to respond.

===== Transfer of employment contracts =====

This is a relatively new form of statutory dismissal, added in terms of the 2002 amendment to the LRA. If a business is transferred, the employees must be transferred with it, and employed on the same or similar terms and conditions. Failure on the part of the new employer to do so constitutes dismissal.

=== Automatically unfair dismissal ===
This area of the law is highly problematic. The LRA states that certain dismissals are automatically unfair; there is no argument as to their fairness. The compensation payable to an employee who has been dismissed for reasons that constitute automatic unfairness is up to 24 months' salary, depending on the circumstances. For a normal, merely unfair dismissal, the compensation is up to twelve months' salary.

==== Section 187 of the LRA ====
Section 187 of the LRA lists the reasons for which an employee may not be dismissed under any circumstances. Such dismissals are "automatically unfair." Once it is proved that the employee has been dismissed for any of these reasons, the employer may not raise any defence save those provided for in the Act. Victims of automatically unfair dismissals will invariably be reinstated unless they choose compensation instead.

Section 187(1)(d) is of particular importance. It designates as automatically unfair dismissals in response to the employee's taking action, or indicating an intention to take any action, against the employer by exercising any right conferred by the LRA, or by participating in any proceedings in terms of the LRA. Dismissal for any conduct regarding membership of a trade union, or for exercising the rights conferred by the labour legislation, is automatically unfair.

The rights referred to are found in section 5 of the LRA. They include lawful trade-union participation, non-compliance with an unlawful order and disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;s 5(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[CEPPWAWU &amp; another v Glass &amp; Aluminium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2000 CC [2002] JOL 9552 (LAC).&lt;/ref&gt; hostility from the employer in the workplace led to a constructive dismissal. The hostility was very closely related to the employee's work as shop steward. The court held that the employer had made the employee's life unbearable due to the fact that he was a shop steward; the dismissal was therefore automatically unfair. The court noted that victims of automatically unfair dismissal will invariably be reinstated unless they choose compensation instead.

==== What constitutes an automatically unfair dismissal? ====
This is a factual dispute. Whether the facts give rise to an automatically unfair dismissal, or merely an unfair dismissal, depends on the circumstances of each case.

==== Dismissals contrary to Section 5 ====
Section 5 confers on employees a right to freedom of association and the right to belong to workplace forums. No employee may be dismissed for exercising these freedoms in any way: for example,

* by participating in the formation of a union;
* by joining a union;
* by participating in a union's lawful activities or in the election of its officials; or
* by standing for election for such a position.

Section 5 further prohibits prejudicing employees for failing or refusing to do anything that an employer may not lawfully require of him.

No dismissal is permitted for the disclosure of information which the employee is lawfully entitled or required to communicate to other persons, or for exercising any right or participating in any proceedings in terms of the LRA. The mere fact that employees are exercising a right under the LRA does not mean, however, that they are immunised against disciplinary action for misconduct committed outside the scope of their duties.

==== Strike dismissals ====
The LRA distinguishes between protected and unprotected strikes. The dismissal of an employee for participating in a protected strike is automatically unfair. Participants in protected strikes, however, may be dismissed for misconduct (assault, for example, or intimidation) during the course of the strike.

In cases where it is difficult to distinguish between a dismissal for striking and a dismissal for (by way of example) misconduct, the "true" and "proximate" cause of the dismissal must be identified.

Section 65(5) provides that participation in a strike which does not comply with the provisions of the LRA is misconduct. It "may constitute a fair reason for dismissal," but there are specific procedures to follow.

==== Dismissal to compel employee to accept demand in mutual-interest dispute ====
In terms of section 187(1)(c), employers may not threaten employees with disciplinary action if they do not comply with a demand: a salary decrease, for example. The Labour Court has considered situations in which employees are threatened with dismissal for refusing to accept unilateral amendments of their terms and conditions of employment by their employers. In this regard,

* the first issue is whether or not an employer has a right to dismiss employees who are not prepared to agree to changes to their terms and conditions of employment; and, if so,
* the second issue is the nature of the relationship between that right and the employees' right not to be dismissed for the purpose of being compelled to agree to a demand in respect of a matter of mutual interest.

Employers may lock out employees (provided that they follow the proper procedure) as a bargaining strategy. A lock-out does not constitute dismissal, as the employees are still employed by the employer.

The difficulty is that an employer may argue that he has the right to dismiss, for operational reasons, those employees who do not accept such a demand. It can be factually difficult in such cases to determine what was the true reason for the dismissal.

Section 187(1)(c) does not prevent employers from dismissing employees who refuse to accept a demand if the effect of that dismissal is to save other workers from retrenchment. Nor does this form of automatically unfair dismissal preclude an employer from dismissing a grossly insubordinate employee.

In ''[[Afrox Limited v SACWU &amp; Others]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1997] 4 BLLR 375 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; the company had a distribution system that resulted in its drivers working in excess of the overtime permitted by law. It decided to introduce a system of staggered shifts to overcome the problem. The employees, refusing to work under the new system, went on strike. They were subsequently dismissed for "operational reasons", as the deliveries from the branch that had been striking were outsourced. The employees contended that the real reason why they were fired was because they were on strike. The court held that, although the strike accelerated the dismissal, the workers did not comply with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act when they went on strike; therefore, regardless of the strike, the dismissal on operational reasons was upheld as fair.

In ''[[Fry's Metal v NUMSA]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2003] 2 BLLR 140 (LAC).&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that the dismissal of employees who refuse to accept a demand does not infringe section 187(c) if the employer intends to get rid of the workers permanently. In this case, the dismissal was not in an attempt to force compliance; it had gone so far as to constitute operational reasons.

In ''[[CWIU v Algorax (Pty) Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2003 11 BLLR 1081 (LAC).&lt;/ref&gt; Algorax had not formally declared a lock-out. The court held, therefore, that the employer had infringed section 187(1)(c), because it offered to reinstate the employees after dismissing them. Had Algorax formally declared the lock-out, it would seem that it could have kept the employees out for as long as it did without having to compensate them for unfair dismissal.

==== Insubordination ====
In retrenchment cases, it is difficult to decide when an employer is entitled to dismiss for insubordination when employees refuse to comply with instructions. One must distinguish between refusal to work and refusal to do work in the specific way required by the employer. A computer technician refusing to fix computers is refusing to work, but an employee refusing to use a particular computer programme is refusing to do work in a specific way.

If the employees are contractually obliged to perform the work demanded of them, and the employer's instructions are reasonable, the employees' refusal amounts to insubordination. It is not unfair to dismiss employees for refusing to comply with their employers' instructions to perform the work required by their contracts.

What if the employee refuses to carry out an order not in accordance with the contract, but with how the employer runs his business?  This will depend on the facts: If the instructions are reasonable, such refusal could amount to insubordination.

In ''[[Kroukam v SA Airlink]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2005] 12 ILJ 2153 (LAC).&lt;/ref&gt; Kroukam was an airline pilot who doubled as a shop steward. He was dismissed after deposing to an affidavit for the purposes of an urgent application by his union to have the company's senior manager committed for contempt of court. He was charged with a number of offences, including gross insubordination. The company claimed that he had divulged the content of an off-the-record discussion in his affidavit, and also that he had refused to submit to a health test required of pilots. The Labour Court ruled that this was not an automatically unfair dismissal. On appeal, however, the court held unanimously that the main or dominant reason for Kroukam's dismissal was his involvement in litigation against the company. The court held, accordingly, that such a dismissal was indeed automatically unfair.

==== Pregnancy dismissals ====
Section 187(1)(e) is one of a number of statutory provisions aimed at protecting women in employment. Prior to these types of provisions, a woman who left work to have a baby was largely at the mercy of her employer. Under the common law, her absence could be treated as a reason for termination of the contract.

Now, according to the EEA and the LRA, dismissal is unlawful if it is for any reason regarding pregnancy or discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. The employee has no duty to inform her employer that she is pregnant; the employer has no right to ask and demand an answer. Accordingly, a woman may not now be dismissed in any circumstances merely because she is pregnant.

Section 187(1)(e) also renders impermissible the dismissal of a woman on maternity leave (now up to four months under the new Basic Conditions of Employment Act).

Nothing precludes an employer from dismissing a pregnant employee for operational requirements, provided that the court can be persuaded that there was indeed a valid economic or related reason.

In ''Whitehead v Woolworths'', the court held that an employer may have regard to economic considerations, including the woman's availability to perform her services, when considering whether to employ a pregnant applicant.

Section 187(1)(e) embraces any reason "related to her pregnancy." It therefore includes reasonable absences for medical attention and changes in the woman's physical configuration, which may dispose certain employers to fire employees engaged in certain types of work.

If the main reason for the dismissal is the employee's pregnancy, the employer may not rely on an ancillary reason like the employee's alleged deceit in not disclosing her condition. Conversely, a pregnant woman may not rely on her pregnancy as a defence against conduct that constitutes a disciplinary offence.

Mashava, in ''[[Mashava v Cuzen &amp; Woods Attorneys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(2000) 21 ILJ 402 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; was admitted as a candidate attorney at the firm. At the time of her employment, she was pregnant. She did not disclose this. The firm accordingly dismissed her, but the court held that this was automatically unfair. The employer could not rely on her deceit regarding her condition as a reason for dismissal.

===== Fair dismissal =====
Fair dismissals are composed of two golden threads: substantive fairness and procedural fairness. Both must be present in order for the dismissal to be fair and in accordance with the labour legislation. Employees may be dismissed fairly only for misconduct, incapacity and operational reasons.&lt;ref&gt;LRA s 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these has its own procedure, which must be followed.

Any person considering whether or not the reason for dismissal is fair, or whether or not the dismissal was effected in accordance with a fair procedure, must take into account any relevant code of good practice issued in terms of the Act.

=== Discipline and dismissal for misconduct ===
Dismissal is the most severe penalty that an employer may impose against an employee guilty of misconduct. In determining whether or not dismissal is appropriate in the circumstances of a case, the employer may have to weigh up a number of factors to come to a decision.

==== Origin of employer’s right to discipline ====
Generally, the employer has the right to maintain and enforce discipline in the workplace. This right has its origin in common law as an implied term in the contract of employment. It is also inextricably linked to the employee’s duty to obey all lawful and reasonable instructions, and is linked to the employer’s right to give instructions. Today the employer’s right to discipline is regulated to a certain degree by the LRA and the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal, annexed to the LRA as Schedule 8 (the Code).

==== Discipline and common law ====
Under the common law, the employer may summarily dismiss the employee if the latter’s misconduct is serious, or dismiss the employee merely by giving the required notice. Occasionally, the employer may prefer to impose a less severe penalty, but the employer’s action in imposing a penalty may not amount to a breach of contract. Suspension without pay or demotion, or ordering forfeiture of an agreed bonus or part of the wages, would constitute a breach of contract. The employer may, however, suspend the employee on full pay and give warnings.

The effectiveness of these penalties was questionable. Suspension on full pay, for example, was found to have little deterrent effect. In practice, the employer’s superior bargaining power, and his right to dismiss merely by giving notice, meant that the employer could "convince" the employee to agree to a penalty which would otherwise have amounted to a breach of contract.

==== The Code and employer’s right to discipline ====
The Code of Good Practice recognizes the employer’s common-law right to discipline employees by requiring, in item 3(1), that "all employers should adopt disciplinary rules which establish the standard of conduct required of employees."

If an agreed disciplinary code exists in the workplace, item 1(2) of the Code stipulates that disciplinary action against employees must comply with the disciplinary code and procedure.

If, however, the disciplinary code was unilaterally introduced by the employer, or if no such code exists, regard must be had to the Code’s provisions. The employer’s own code must be measured against the provisions of the Code; in the absence of an employer code, the Code will constitute the minimum guidelines for discipline.

==== Form and content of disciplinary codes of conduct ====

===== Form =====
The Code accepts that the form of the employer’s disciplinary rules will vary according to the size and nature of the business, but these rules must be clear and made available to employees so that there is certainty as to what the employer expects from them and as to what sort of behavior will not be tolerated.

A disciplinary code may take the form of a collective agreement between the employer and a trade union or unions; it may be a policy unilaterally imposed by the employer; or it may be incorporated into the terms and conditions of employment.

Very often a recognition agreement, in terms of which the employer recognizes one or more trade unions as the collective bargaining agent of a certain category of employees, will include, as an annexure, an agreed disciplinary code and procedure. In this way, a disciplinary code and procedure obtains the status of a collective agreement.

===== Content =====
The Code accepts that the content of a disciplinary code will vary according to the size and nature of the employer’s business. Some rules of conduct may be so well established and well known that it is unnecessary for the employer to communicate them to the employees. An employee who breaches such a rule cannot argue that the rule does not appear in the written disciplinary code. A rule will be so well established that it need not be communicated if the employees know that a particular act or omission will not be tolerated if the employer has always in the past disciplined employees who committed the particular act or omission.

Rules may also be considered to be well established by virtue of common-law contract principles, like a breach of the duty to act in good faith. Examples of acts and omissions that are held to constitute such a breach include

* theft;
* assaulting the employer, a superior or co-employees;
* insubordination;
* failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order;
* drunkenness, if it affects the employee’s work or is persistent or results in prejudice;
* absence without leave or repeated absence;
* misappropriation of company property;
* timekeeping or clock-card offences; and
* unfair competition with the employer.

Employer disciplinary codes usually contain the disciplinary sanctions for each type of disciplinary infraction and the procedure to be followed.

In some cases, the industrial court has drawn a distinction between theft and petty pilfering, and has required that, to justify dismissal, the offence at issue should disclose a "thieving propensity" on the part of the employee. In Anglo American Farms Boschendal Restaurant v Komjwayo, however, this distinction was rejected. The court held that the true test was whether or not the employee’s action had the effect of rendering the relationship of employer and employee intolerable. Although it has been somewhat more lenient in some cases, the CCMA has generally followed a strict approach in cases of theft and other forms of dishonesty.

Due to South Africa’s apartheid past, racist abuse is viewed in a particularly serious light. In Lebowa Platinum Mines v Hill, an employee was dismissed for calling another employee a "bobbejaan" (baboon). The court held the dismissal to be justified because the court found that the term had a racist connotation.

==== Corrective or progressive discipline ====
In terms of the common law, the employer may either condone the misconduct or elect to act against the employee. If the misconduct is of a sufficiently serious nature, the employer may decide to cancel the contract of employment and dismiss the employee.

Dismissal is only one of a number of penalties that the employer may impose against the guilty employee.  Examples of other penalties are

* suspension without pay;
* verbal and written warnings;
* demotion; and
* transfer.

The Code emphasizes the concept of corrective or progressive discipline. Item 3(2) requires that the employer try to correct employees’ behavior through a system of graduated disciplinary measures such as counselling and warnings. Formal disciplinary procedures do not have to be invoked every time  a rule is broken. Informal advice and correction is the best way to deal with minor violations of work discipline.

Warnings may be graded according to degrees of severity, as with a verbal warning for a first offence, then a first written warning, then a final written warning or suspension without pay or demotion, and finally dismissal, which is reserved for repeated offences or serious misconduct. Item 3(4) gives a list of examples of serious misconduct that may result in a disciplinary enquiry and possible dismissal for a first occurrence. The list includes

* gross dishonesty;
* wilful damage to company property;
* wilful endangering of the safety of others;
* physical assault on the employer, a fellow employee, client or customer; and
* gross insubordination.

==== Substantive fairness of dismissal for misconduct ====
As stated before, section 188(1) of the LRA requires that, if misconduct is the reason for dismissal, it must be with fair reason. Item 7 of the Code provides some guidelines as to when misconduct will constitute a fair reason for dismissal. The following must be considered:

* whether or not the employee contravened a rule or standard regulating conduct in, or of relevance to, the work-place; and,
* if a rule or standard was contravened, whether or not
** the rule was a valid or reasonable rule or standard;
** the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the rule or standard;
** the rule or standard has been consistently applied by the employer; and
** dismissal was an appropriate sanction for the contravention of the rule or standard.

The guidelines in item 7 for a substantively fair dismissal are not hard and fast rules. The employer’s non-compliance with a particular guideline will not necessarily make the dismissal unfair. The question of whether or not non-compliance with a particular guideline is permissible depends on the circumstances.

==== Contravention of rule by employee ====
There are two issues to be considered under this heading. In the first instance, it must be determined whether or not the rule existed; in the second, if the rule existed, it must be determined whether or not the employee contravened it.

===== Did the rule exist? =====
The formulation of disciplinary rules is the responsibility of the employer. The most important source of these rules is a written disciplinary code or rules of conduct. If such a written code or set of rules exists, it must be examined to determine whether the rule which the employee is accused of having contravened is contained in that code. If the disciplinary code does not contain the rule under consideration, this may be an important indicator that such a rule does not exist in the particular workplace.

If the particular rule which the employee is accused of having contravened is not included in the written code, this does not necessarily mean that the employee’s dismissal is unfair.

The particular rule may be contained in

* the employee’s written contract of employment;
* a policy or personnel manual; or
* notices placed on the notice boards in the workplace

Legislation such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act may also regulate the conduct of employees. Sections 14 and 15 impose a number of duties on employees, such as

* the duty to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and of other persons who may be affected by their acts and omissions;
* the duty to carry out any lawful order and obey the health and safety rules and procedures laid down by the employer;
* the duty to report that an unsafe or unhealthy situation exists; and
* the duty to report that they have been involved in any incident which may affect their health or which has caused an injury to them.

Another important source for rules is the common law, which includes, for example, the duty to act in good faith.

Item 7(a) of the Code provides that one may also consider whether the employee contravened a rule regulating conduct "in, or of relevance to the workplace." The provision is broad enough to entitle the employer to proceed against the employee who has contravened a rule after working hours, or even outside the premises of the employer. The circumstances that this is possible are limited, however, to those situations where the misconduct in some way affects or is otherwise relevant to the employer’s business.

===== Was there a contravention of the rule? =====
Once it has been established that the rule exists, the next issue to be addressed is whether or not the employee has contravened it. This is an issue which must be determined on the facts. If, for example, the employee is charged with unauthorised possession of company property, this must be proven in the circumstances.

Section 192(2) of the LRA states that it is the employer who must prove that the dismissal was fair; therefore the employer must prove that the employee has contravened the rule. Neither the LRA nor the Code stipulates the standard by which the employer must prove the employee’s contravention of the rule, but it is submitted that the employer must prove the contravention on a balance of probabilities.

The LRA and the Code also do not stipulate on what facts the employer may rely to prove the contravention. The Industrial Court has given conflicting opinions on whether the employer is restricted to relying on those facts which are available at the time of the enquiry, or whether he may also rely on facts which came to light after the dismissal. It is submitted that the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration will probably adopt the second approach.

===== Validity and Reasonableness of the Rule =====
Once it is clear that the rule existed and the employee actually contravened it, attention must be focused on the rule itself.  The first aspect which must be determined is whether the rule is valid or reasonable. This is a factual question. Generally a rule will be valid or reasonable if it is lawful and can be justified with reference to the needs and circumstances of the business. Factors which may determine whether or not a rule is justified include the following:

* the nature of the employer’s business (for example, a brewery prohibiting the use of alcohol by employers); and
* the circumstances in which the business operates (for example, the type of work which an employee does).

An important indicator of the validity or reasonableness of a rule is its inclusion in a disciplinary code that is contained in a collective agreement between the employer and a trade union. Unlike the rule the employer unilaterally enforces, this rule is the product of collective bargaining.

The reasonableness of a rule may be affected by the employer’s preparedness in the past to enforce it. If it has not been enforced in the past, it may be an indication that the employer does not regard the rule as reasonable. The employer’s failure to enforce a rule does not make that rule permanently invalid, however. It may regain its validity if the employer clearly and unequivocally informs the employees that the rule will be enforced in the future.

The fundamental issue is that the employer cannot act against the employee if the latter is unaware that the employer now regards a breach of the rule as serious.

===== Employee’s knowledge of rule =====
The employee must have known, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the rule. The rationale for this is that the employee should only be penalised for actions or omissions which the employee knew (at the time) were unacceptable. It is implied that the employee must also have known that a transgression of this rule may lead to dismissal.

Knowledge of the rule may be achieved through

* its inclusion in a written disciplinary code;
* meetings with workers;
* written briefs;
* notices on notice boars; or
* induction programs for new employees.

Certain forms of misconduct may be so well known in the workplace that notification is unnecessary. This would be the case with theft assault, intimidation, insolence and insubordination.

===== Consistent application of rule =====
An employer must, as far as possible, treat employees in the same way if they have committed the same or similar offences. The employer must be consistent, in other words, in meting out discipline.

Two types of inconsistency may be distinguished:

* historical inconsistency, where the employer has in the past not proceeded against an employee for contravening the rule; and
* contemporaneous inconsistency, where employees who breach the same rule contemporaneously, or at roughly the same time, are not all disciplined, or not all in the same way, or to the same extent.

Inconsistency will not always be unfair. The employer can justify inconsistency through factors such as the employees’ different circumstances: length of service, for example, or disciplinary records and personal circumstances.

In SA Commercial Catering &amp; Allied Workers Union v Bonus Building, the court held that, if a distinction is drawn between different employees, this distinction must be properly motivated; otherwise it will give rise to a perception of bias.

The court in City of Cape Town v Mashitho &amp; Others found that, if an employer intends to discipline employees for misconduct which he has not disciplined them for in the past, the proper course is to make it known that such discipline will now be effected and the reasons for this change.

==== Dismissal as Appropriate Sanction ====
Whether or not dismissal will be an appropriate sanction is a factual question. Item 3(5)-(6) of the Code lists factors to be taken into consideration. The employer should consider, in addition to the gravity of the misconduct, such factors as the employee’s circumstances (including length of service, previous disciplinary record and personal circumstances), the nature of the job and the circumstances of the infringement itself. The employer should apply the penalty of dismissal consistently with the way in which it has been applied to the same and other employees in the past, and consistently as between two or more employees who participate in the misconduct under consideration. All these factors must be considered and weighed up together to decide whether dismissal is justified or whether a less severe sanction would be more appropriate.

It has been submitted that, even if the commissioner does not consider dismissal to be the appropriate sanction after considering all these factors, the penalty of dismissal will stand if the commissioner or judge is satisfied that a reasonable employer could also have decided to dismiss under the circumstances.

In the case of Sidumo and Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd and Others [2007] 12 BLLR 1097 (CC), however, a security guard at a mine was not abiding by the search procedures he was obliged to employ for the workers at the mine. There was video footage available as proof that he was not adequately searching the workers. The security guard was dismissed on the suspicion that he could be fraternising with the workers in order to steal from the mines. The CCMA having held that this sanction was too harsh, the case was appealed to the Labour Court and then to Labour Appeal Court. When the case reached the SCA, the court held that employers have a discretion to dismiss. If the employer acts reasonably, his decision must be upheld.

On appeal to the Constitutional Court, it was held that the commissioner who hears the appeal must decide afresh if the decision was fair or unfair; therefore, it is not appropriate to look to the reasonable employer. The SCA approach, therefore, was found to be wrong. The test is what the reasonable commissioner would have done in those circumstances. The court, then, is not bound by the choice made by the reasonable employer. The "reasonable employer" test is no longer used.

===== Gravity of misconduct =====
The more serious the misconduct, the greater the likelihood that dismissal is the appropriate penalty. The seriousness of the misconduct depends on a number of considerations:

* the nature of the offence;
* the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;
* the nature of the work performed by the employee;
* the nature and size of the employer’s workforce;
* the position the employer occupies in the marketplace and its profile in the market;
* the nature of the work and services rendered by the employee;
* the relationship between the employee and the victim; and
* the effect of the misconduct on the workforce as a whole.

===== Circumstances of infringement =====
A serious offence does not automatically warrant the employee’s dismissal. It is not a "knee-jerk response" to all serious offences. There may be circumstances which have a tempering effect, not on the seriousness of the offence as such, but on the severity of the penalty: for example,

* in the case of theft, if the object which has been stolen is of such trifling value that dismissal may be too harsh a penalty;
* in the case of assault, if the employee was provoked or acted in self-defense; and,
* in the case of refusing to obey a superior’s orders, if the instructions were unreasonable or illegal.

===== The Nature of the Employee’s Job =====
In the case of a brewery, the employer will be justified in taking a strict disciplinary approach regarding intoxication and the use of alcohol during working hours. A less strict approach to intoxication may be expected from an employer whose employees do not deal directly with the public or who do not work with dangerous machinery. This, however, does not mean that such an employer may never dismiss employees for intoxication; it only means that a greater measure of progressive discipline will be expected from such an employer.

===== Employee’s circumstances =====
These include the employee’s length of service, status within the undertaking, previous disciplinary record and personal circumstances.

Years of service generally count in the employees favor. It must be noted, however, that the employer often puts a great deal of trust in an employee with long service; therefore, it could count against the employee if he breaches this trust after many years of service.

The employer will also expect a higher degree of responsible behavior from a supervisor or manager than from an ordinary worker.

If there is a previous warning on the employee’s personnel file, stating that he will be dismissed if the same offence is committed in future, dismissal may be fair if this occurs. A warning does not remain valid indefinitely. The employer and trade union may agree on the period for which a warning will remain valid, or the employer’s code may stipulate this. In the absence of such agreement or stipulation, the default position is that the warning remains valid for six months, unless the infraction is particularly serious, in which case it may remain valid for the duration of the employee’s service.

Other personal circumstances which may be important include the employee’s age, marital status and number of dependents.

===== Other employees dismissed for same offence =====
The employer must, as far as possible, treat employees the same if they have breached the same rule or rules which are similar: There must be consistency when meting out discipline.

==== Procedural fairness of dismissal for misconduct ====
Section 188(1)(b) of the LRA requires that a dismissal for misconduct must be effected in accordance with a fair procedure, which entails a fair disciplinary enquiry. The LRA does not regulate a fair disciplinary enquiry. The employer’s disciplinary code and procedure usually prescribes the procedure to be followed and the manner in which the hearing should be conducted. The Code provides a number of guidelines for a fair enquiry in item 4: This is not a substitute for a disciplinary procedure but merely a template by which the fairness of a dismissal must be judged.

Normally, the employer should conduct an investigation to determine whether there are grounds for dismissal. This does not need to be a formal enquiry. The employer should notify the employee of the allegations, using a form and language that the employee can reasonably understand. The employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response to the allegations. The employee should also be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to prepare the response, and to the assistance of a trade union representative or fellow employee. After the enquiry, the employer should communicate the decision taken, and preferably furnish the employee with written notification of that decision.

Discipline against a trade union representative, or against an employee who is an office-bearer or official of a trade union, should not be instituted without first informing and consulting the trade union. If the employee is dismissed, the employee should be given the reason for dismissal and reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a council with jurisdiction or to the commission, or to any dispute resolution procedures established in terms of a collective agreement.

In exceptional circumstances, if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply with these guidelines, the employer may dispense with pre-dismissal procedures.

===== Elements of procedural fairness =====

====== Investigation ======
The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether or not there are grounds for dismissal. The investigation need not be a formal enquiry.

====== Notice of charge and investigation ======
The employer must notify the employee of the allegations against him. The employer must use a form and language that the employee can reasonably understand. Usually the charge will be in writing and in the language which is commonly used in the workplace. Notice of the charge and of the disciplinary enquiry is usually given simultaneously and in the same document

====== Reasonable time to prepare response ======
The question of what is a "reasonable time" is a factual one. The nature and complexity of the charges will certainly be relevant in ascertaining whether the employee has had sufficient time. Whether the employee had assistance in preparing a response will also be relevant.

====== Employee entitled to state case in response ======
This is the core of procedural fairness in the context of dismissal for misconduct. The employee may dispute the facts on which the charges are based, or may plead guilty to the charges but argue that dismissal is not the appropriate sanction.

====== Employee entitled to assistance ======
The employee is entitled to the assistance of a trade union representative or a fellow employee during the enquiry. "Trade union representative" is defined in section 213 of the LRA as a member of a trade union who is elected to represent employees in a workplace (commonly called a shop steward). "Fellow employee" includes a colleague, supervisor or even a director of the company for which the employee is working, provided that the director is also an employee.

The purpose of assistance is

* to assist with the presentation of the response to the charge; and
* to ensure that the procedure which is followed during the enquiry is fair.

Item 4(1) does not provide for assistance by a legal practitioner, such as an advocate or attorney, but some disciplinary codes provide for legal representation under certain circumstances.

====== Decision ======
The decision as to whether or not an employee is guilty of the alleged misconduct, and as to the sanction, is usually the responsibility of the chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry. Some disciplinary codes, however, provide that the chairperson may only may a recommendation to senior management. The latter must then take the final decision, which could differ from the chairperson’s recommendation.

An important question arises: Can senior management overturn the decision of a chairperson or order a second enquiry into whether or not the latter is empowered by the code not merely to make a recommendation but actually to decide the issue?

The court has indicated that this would be possible, subject to certain limitations, and that whether or not a second disciplinary enquiry may be opened depends on whether or not it would be fair to do so in the circumstances.

The court has also stipulated two cautionary remarks:

# The second enquiry must be permitted in terms of the employer’s disciplinary code.
# It would probably not be considered fair to hold more than one enquiry, save in "exceptional circumstances."

The important yardstick is that of fairness.

====== Communicating decision ======
Item 4(1) of the Code requires that the employer communicate the decision taken, preferably in writing. Both the verdict and the penalty must be communicated.

====== Employee to be informed of reason for dismissal ======
Item 4(3) of the Code requires that, if the penalty is dismissal, the employee must be given the reason for it, and must be reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a bargaining council with jurisdiction, or to the CCMA or any dispute resolution procedure established in terms of a collective agreement.

====== Appeal ======
Item 4 of the Code does not make a provision for an appeal to a higher level of management against the outcome of a disciplinary enquiry. If the employee is dissatisfied, he must implement the dispute-settling procedures provided by the LRA. If, however, the disciplinary code in the workplace makes provision for such an appeal, the employee will be entitled to appeal in accordance with the code.

Traditionally an appeal entails a re-hearing of the entire matter, including all the evidence presented, and a fresh consideration of the appropriate sanction.

====== Dispensing with pre-dismissal procedures ======
Item 4(4) stipulates that the employer may dispense with a disciplinary enquiry in exceptional circumstances if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply with this requirement. Two broad categories of exceptional circumstances are

# crisis-zone situations (violent strikes in the mining industry, for example); and
# where the employee waives his or her right to a hearing (provided that the employee has full knowledge of his legal right thereto).

Waiver of the right may also be assumed if

* the employee’s conduct is of such a nature that the employer cannot be expected to hold an enquiry;
* the employee refuses to attend the enquiry; or
* the employee fails to attend the enquiry because of a decision on the employee’s part not to attend. Non-attendance due to illness does not constitute a waiver of this right.

=== Dismissal for incapacity ===
Incapacity is one of the internationally recognized grounds for a fair dismissal, provided that a fair reason exists for the dismissal and that a fair procedure has been followed.

Section 188 of the LRA refers only to "incapacity." It does not distinguish between poor work performance and ill health or injury. This distinction is, however, drawn in the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal (the Code). Different sets of guidelines are provided for each: Item 11 deals with ill health or injury; item 9 deals with poor work performance. According to the former Prime Minister, "It will probably take a long time for the mods to find this."

While culpability or fault on the part of the employee is the essence of dismissal for misconduct, a dismissal for incapacity is a no-fault dismissal. Incapacity means that, unrelated to any intentional or negligent conduct or performance by the employee, the employee is not able to meet the standard of performance required by the employer. The employee is not capable of doing the work.

This ground of dismissal ties in with the common law duty of the employee to perform competently and without negligence. The difference between incapacity and misconduct in this regard is that

* misconduct occurs where the employee breaches this duty intentionally or negligently; whereas
* incapacity occurs where there is no intention or negligence on the part of the employee, but rather a supervening impossibility of performance.

==== Poor work performance ====
A dismissal for poor [[work performance]] implies that there must be an objective standard of performance against which the employee can be measured, before the employee may be dismissed for failing to meet that standard. It is generally accepted that the setting of performance standards is within the employer’s prerogative.

There are various ways in which an employer may establish performance standards and appraise an employee’s ability to do the job to the satisfaction of the employer. At the outset of the relationship the employer may decide to put the employee on a period of probation. The Code distinguishes between employees who are dismissed during the probationary period and those who are dismissed after probation.

Item 9 of the Code provides, as guidelines in cases of dismissal arising from poor work performance, that any person, in determining whether or not a dismissal for poor work performance is unfair, should consider

* whether or not the employee failed to meet a performance standard; and,
* if the employee did not meet a required performance standard, whether or not
** the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the required performance standard;
** the employee was given a fair opportunity to meet the required performance standard; and
** dismissal was an appropriate sanction for the contravention of the rule or standard.

==== Employees on probation ====
Item 8(1) of the Code sets out the basic principles in respect of probationary employees:

* An employer may require a newly hired employee to serve a period of probation before the appointment of the employee is confirmed.
* The purpose of probation is to give the employer an opportunity to evaluate the employee’s performance before confirming the appointment.
* Probation should not be used for purposes not contemplated by this Code to deprive employees of the status of permanent employment. The practice of dismissing employees who complete their probation periods, and replacing them with newly hired employees, is not consistent with the purpose of probation and constitutes an unfair labour practice.
* The period of probation should be determined in advance. It should be of reasonable duration.  The length of the probationary period should be determined with reference to the nature of the job and the time it takes to determine the employee’s suitability for continued employment.
* During the probationary period, the employee’s performance should be assessed. An employer should give an employee reasonable evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling in order to allow the employee to render a satisfactory service.
* If the employer determines that the employee’s performance is below standard, the employer should advise the employee of any aspects in which the employer considers the employee to be failing to meet the required performance standards. If the employer believes that the employee is incompetent, the employer should advise the employee of the respects in which the employee is not competent. The employer may either extend the probationary period or dismiss the employee after complying with subitems (g) or (h), as the case may be.
* The period of probation may only be extended for a reason that relates to the purpose of probation. The period of extension should not be disproportionate to the legitimate purpose that the employer seeks to achieve.
* An employer may only decide to dismiss an employee or extend the probationary period after the employer has invited the employee to make representations and has considered any representations so made. A trade union representative or fellow employee may make the representations on behalf of the employee.
* If the employer decides to dismiss the employee, or to extend the probationary period, the employer should advise the employee of his or her rights to refer the matter to a council having jurisdiction, or to the Commission.
* Any person making a decision about the fairness of a dismissal of an employee for poor work performance during, or on expiry of the probationary period, ought to accept reasons for dismissal that may be less compelling than would be the case in dismissals effected after the completion of the probationary period.

It must be noted that different jobs may take different lengths of time to determine suitability. The requirement in terms of the length of probation is that of reasonableness.

If the probationary employee is not performing adequately, the evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling referred to in the Code should focus on making it possible for the probationary employee to perform to the satisfaction of the employer. If the performance is not up to standard, the probationary employee should be given an opportunity to improve to the requisite standard.

In sub items (f) to (i) the word "should" is used, so the duty on the employer is less onerous than if the employee had already been confirmed in a permanent position. Item 8(1)(g)-(h) makes it clear that there is a difference between a dismissal during probation and after probation.

The amended Item 8(1) emphasizes that an employee is protected against an unfair dismissal even while serving a probation. The justification for these amendments is to make the dismissal of probationary employees easier in order to encourage job creation and to relieve employers of the onerous procedures they had to comply with before this item was amended.

==== Poor-work-performance dismissals after probation ====
After the probationary period has expired, most employees will have tenure or permanent status. The procedures that an employer must follow to justify a dismissal for poor work performance after probation are to be found in Item 8(2)-(4), which provides that, after probation, an employee should not be dismissed for unsatisfactory performance unless the employer has

* given the employee appropriate evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling; and,
* after a reasonable period of time for improvement, the employee continues to perform unsatisfactorily.

The procedure leading to dismissal should include an investigation to establish the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance. The employer should consider other ways, short of dismissal, to remedy the matter.

In the process, the employee should have the right to be heard and to be assisted by a trade union representative or a fellow employee.

Incapacity dismissals are made difficult, then, by the fact that there is considerable overlap between substantive and procedural fairness. They are not always clearly distinguishable.

==== Setting standards and assessment ====
An employer is entitled to set the standards that it requires the employee to meet. The employer has the prerogative to decide whether or not those standards have been met.

In A-B v SA Brewaries, an employee engaged as a planning and administrative manager was charged with poor work performance on six occasions and demoted to the position of project controller. The arbitrator held that an employer is entitled to set the standards that it requires the employee to meet. Generally speaking, the court should not intervene unless the standards so set are "grossly unreasonable."

The commissioner held that the employee had been given a fair opportunity to meet the standards set by the employer and that the demotion was not procedurally unfair. The employer’s performance appraisal and review process had identified the problem areas. The employee had been given an opportunity to improve before the demotion.

The commissioner stressed that, in most cases, senior managers have a duty to appraise their own performance and to rectify poor performance themselves.

==== Senior managers ====
The status of the employee may play a role in the performance standards that the employee is expected to reach, and the extent to which the employee will be given an opportunity to improve his performance. The size of the organisation will also be a factor to consider when deciding the degree of the employer’s responsibility towards employees whose performance is sub-standard.

Senior managers may indeed have a duty to assess their own performance standards. The courts have long accepted that senior employees are not always entitled to an opportunity to improve. They have been held to have the ability and duty to monitor their own work performance.

==== Failure to meet the standards required by regulatory body ====
A dismissal for incapacity may be justified if the employee does not have the requisite qualifications or has not been accredited by a professional or statutory body.

==== Assessment and evaluation by employer ====
The courts have stressed the need for a proper evaluation and assessment of an employee before any action is taken. There must be careful assessment and consultation, and an opportunity to improve.

The Commission for Constellation, Meditation and Aggregation has accepted that less strict standards should be applied to small businesses tasked with evaluating an employee for poor work performance.

==== Consultation process ====
It is emphasised that it is through fair process that fair decisions are generally reached. If the dismissal was procedurally unfair, the courts have often been reluctant to reinstate the employee, choosing rather to award the employee compensation.

==== Dismissal as last resort ====
No employee may be dismissed for poor work performance without first being made aware of the standards required and then being given an opportunity to improve. The employer is expected to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee and offer the employee alternative employment in some circumstances.

==== Incompatibility ====
There was great debate regarding whether or not an employee’s incompatibility (his inability to work harmoniously with other employees or to fit in with the corporate culture of the undertaking or organisation) constituted incapacity or a ground for an operational-requirements dismissal.

Considering the way the LRA is now structured, this distinction has become vital. Different pre-dismissal procedures must be followed by the employer; disputes about an allegedly unfair dismissal would follow different procedures.

Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioners now generally take the view that incompatibility constitutes incapacity and not operational requirements, but the debate continues.

There must still be a fair reason and fair procedure for such a dismissal. The employer is obliged to assist an employee who is causing disruptions in workplace relationship before dismissing him. If the employee is a genuine "misfit," appropriate warnings and counselling would be required.

It may happen that a call is made for the dismissal of an employee by a third party or co-workers. If this happens, the demand made must be "good and sufficient," and must be backed by a real and serious threat: for example, that the employees making the demand will go on strike if the employee in question is not dismissed. The employer must investigate alternatives and consult the employee in question.

The requirement that there must be no possible alternative is particularly true when racial or ethnic tension is the cause of the incompatibility. The test in such cases is that of necessity.

==== Ill health or injury ====
The second type of incapacity dealt with in the Code is ill health or injury. It is addressed in Item 10 and Item 11.

The assessments referred to in Item 11 must be done in order to determine whether a dismissal would be appropriate in the circumstances. Item 11 of the Code provides that any person determining whether a dismissal arising from ill health or injury is unfair should consider

* whether or not the employee is capable of performing the work; and,
* if the employee is incapable
** the extent to which the employee is able to perform the work;
** the extent to which the employee’s work circumstances might be adapted to accommodate disability, or, where this is not possible, the extent to which the employee’s duties might be adapted; and
** the availability of any suitable alternative work.

Once again the dismissal must be both substantively and procedurally fair.

===== Substantive and procedural fairness =====
Various aspects of substantive and procedural fairness are illustrated in Item 10.

Incapacity on the grounds of ill health or injury may be temporary or permanent. If an employee is temporarily unable to work in these circumstances, the employer should investigate the extent of the incapacity or injury. If the employee is likely to be absent for a time that is unreasonably long in the circumstances, the employer should investigate all the possible alternatives short of dismissal.

When alternatives are considered, relevant factors might include

* the nature of the job;
* the period of absence;
* the seriousness of the illness or injury; and
* the possibility of securing a temporary replacement for the ill or injured employee.

In cases of permanent incapacity, the employer should ascertain the possibility of securing alternative employment or adapting the duties or work circumstances of the employee to accommodate the employee’s disability.

In the process of the investigation referred to above, the employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response, and to be assisted by a trade union representative or fellow employee.

The degree of incapacity is relevant to the fairness of any dismissal. The cause of the incapacity may also be relevant. In the case of certain kinds of incapacity, like alcoholism or drug abuse, counselling and rehabilitation may be appropriate steps for the employer to consider.

Particular consideration should be given to employees who are injured at work or who are incapacitated by work-related illness. The courts have indicated that the duty on the employer to accommodate the incapacity of the employee is more onerous in these circumstances.

Item 10(1) highlights the nature, degree and extent of the incapacity, and the steps the employer should take to accommodate the employee. Whether the incapacity is temporary or permanent is also an important consideration.

Item 10(2) sets out the guidelines specifically for procedural fairness. There has been debate as to whether this process entails a formal hearing. As long as the employee is given a fair opportunity to indicate why he should not be dismissed, however, this feature has been complied with.

The degree of incapacity also plays a role (see Item 10(3)).

The employer’s duty to accommodate is emphasized, with particular reference to employees incapacitated due to a work-related injury or illness (see Item 10(4)).

A related issue if that of habitual absenteeism, where an employee is often absent from work due to illness or injury. It appears that the approach of the court will vary according to the degree and nature of the absenteeism. Frequent and lengthy absences due to ill health may justify termination at a point where the employer can no longer be expected to tolerate such absences.

===== Disability =====
In many cases, the terms "incapacity" and "disability" are used interchangeably. Incapacity may be due to an accident causing a loss of limb or the slow onset of an illness like cancer or HIV/AIDS, or a person may have been born with a physical or mental impairment that others perceive as a disability.

The real issue in equity or anti-discrimination legislation is to protect the rights of disabled people, particularly in the area of employment, as employers may perceive a ‘disabled person’ to be unsuitable for the workplace.

Although the Constitution and LRA both have general equity provisions for people with disabilities, there is no statutory definition in these Acts. The EEA, however, defines people with disabilities as people who have a long-term or recurring physical or mental impairment which substantially limits their prospects of entry into, or advancement in, employment.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (arguably the most important international legislation in this field) defines a disabled person as "one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, a person who has a past record of such an impairment, or a person who is regarded by other people as having such an impairment."

"Reasonable accommodation" means any modification or adjustment to a job or to the working environment that will enable a person from a designated group to have access to or participate or advance in employment.

A dismissal based on disability may thus be automatically unfair, giving the employer no defense and the judge no discretion—except that the dismissal may be fair if the reason is based on an inherent requirement of the job.

The employer will also bear the onus of proving that the dismissal for disability was based on the inherent requirements of the job and that the dismissal is both substantively and procedurally fair.

=== Dismissal for operational requirements ===

==== Context ====
An employer may find itself facing financial ruin (due to unsound strategy, large clients or contracts having been lost, or factors in the economy at large). Under pressure, the employer may be forced into considering reducing its wage bill by restructuring the organisation, which may mean dismissing some employees. In this scenario, the word "retrenchment" is often used.

Section 188 of the LRA recognizes that an employer also has operational requirements and needs, and that, in certain cases, these may also be a fair and valid reason for dismissal.

According to section 213 of the LRA, "operational requirements" are requirements based on the economic, technological, structural or similar needs of an employer.

There are four categories of operational requirements. From these categories it is clear that the reason for the dismissal does not relate to the employee; it is due to the needs of the employer, and therefore reason for the dismissal is the employer's.

An employer’s economic needs, for example, include those needs and requirements relating to the economic well-being of the enterprise. One of the most common economic reasons for dismissal is financial difficulties (due to, for example, a downturn in the economy or a decrease in the demand for certain products).

"Technological needs" refers to the introduction of new technology, such as more advanced machinery, mechanization or computerization, leading to the redundancy of employees.

Structural needs as a reason for dismissal describes posts becoming redundant following a restructuring of the enterprise. This often follows a merger or amalgamation.

==== Employer’s similar needs ====
This is a very broad category and must be determined with reference to the circumstances of the case. There is no clear and absolute dividing line between an employer’s "economic" needs and "similar" needs, as there are often considerable overlaps.

==== Changes to employee’s terms and conditions of employment ====
A business may have to be restructured or amalgamated with another enterprise, or its mode of operation may have to be altered in order to ensure its survival or to make it more competitive.

These changes may lead to an employee's becoming redundant, but changes of this nature may also lead to the employee's being offered a new position, with changes to the terms and conditions of employment.

If the employee unreasonably refuses to accept the changes to the terms and conditions of employment, the employee may be dismissed for operational requirements.

In ''[[WL Ochse Webb &amp; Pretorius v Vermeulen]]'', the employee was a tomato salesman for WL Ochse (the employer) and was paid a basic salary and commission. He earned more than the other employees, as the sale of tomatoes attracted a higher commission than the sale of the vegetables sold by the other employees. This caused dissatisfaction among the other workers, which the employer tried to address by proposing a new remuneration system. The salesman was given three alternatives:

# He could accept the new system.
# He could present an alternative system.
# He could resign.

He proposed that the old system be retained. When this proposal was rejected by the employer, he resigned.

The court held that the employer had not acted unfairly, as a successful business requires contented employees. Unhappiness can lead to several problems, such as labour unrest and a drop in productivity. A commercial rationale for the changes was thus established by the employer.

Dismissal to compel an employee to accept changes to terms and conditions of employment is branded as automatically unfair by section 187(1)(c) of the LRA. The primary motive for dismissal must be a commercial rationale or operational reason in order for the dismissal to be fair.

The fundamental difference between an operational requirement dismissal and an automatically unfair dismissal is the employer’s reason for the dismissal. If an employer dismisses employees because the terms and conditions of employment must be altered for the business to continue being viable, the employees may be fairly dismissed, as they no longer serve the employer’s operational requirements.

In ''[[Fry's Metals v National Union of Metalworkers]]'', the court discussed the difference between an operational-requirement dismissal and an automatically unfair dismissal:

* In the case of a dismissal due to operational requirements, the purpose is to get rid of employees who do not meet the business requirements of the employer, so that new employees who will meet the business requirements can be employed.
* In the case of an automatically unfair dismissal, the employer wants his existing employees to agree to a change of their terms and conditions of employment, and has the attitude that, if the employees do not agree to the changes, he will dismiss them.

A change in the terms and conditions of employment need not always be the result of changes regarding the business. The circumstances or attitude of the employee could change. This could have such serious economic repercussions for the employer that the latter deems it vital to change the employee’s conditions of employment.

The nature of a business may be such that special demands are made on the employees. It may be essential for the economic success of the business, for example, that the employees are able and willing to work overtime. The employee’s inability or refusal to do so could jeopardise the well-being of the business; therefore a dismissal would be fair.

==== Incompatibility and related reasons ====
The courts have accepted than an employee whose actions negatively affect the operation of a business may be dismissed. This may occur where certain actions of the employee create disharmony among his co-workers, as when, for example, he antagonises co-workers by continually making racist or sexist remarks.

In ''[[Erasmus v BB Bread]]'', employees called for the dismissal of a manager because of his problematic attitude towards them, and his having made derogatory remarks, particularly aimed at black employees. The Industrial Court (in terms of the old LRA) held that his dismissal was for a valid and fair reason, as the employer is entitled to insist on reasonably harmonious interpersonal relationships between employees. If sound relationships appear to be impossible, the employer may be entitled to remove the employee from the scene.

In ''[[East Rand Proprietary Mines v UPUSA]]'', the issue was the fairness of the dismissal of a number of Zulu-speaking workers after violent clashes between them and workers belonging to other ethnic groups. Although the court found that the dismissal had been unfair in the circumstances, it did acknowledge that a dismissal which had its roots in an arbitrary ground, such as ethnic origin, could be fair if the employer could prove that dismissal was the only option left to ensure the safety of the targeted employees and the continued well-being of the business. The court held that an employer may dismiss employees because it cannot guarantee their safety in light of the ethnic hostilities, but the employer must be able to show that it truly had no other alternative.

==== Breakdown in the trust relationship ====
The relationship between the employer and employee is one of trust. It entails the confidence that the employee is adhering to the common-law duty to act in good faith towards and in the best interests of the business.

If the facts show that this duty is breached, the employee is guilty of misconduct and, if sufficiently serious, may be dismissed.

If the employer is unable to prove such a breach on a balance of probabilities, the employee may not be dismissed for misconduct, but may be dismissed for operational reasons, as such mistrust is counter-productive to the operation of the business.

In ''[[Food &amp; Allied Workers Union v Amalgamated Beverage Industries]]'', the Industrial Court accepted that the dismissal of a number of employees on suspicion of assault had an operational rationale to it.

==== Substantive issues ====

===== Real reasons and increases in profits =====
Before the introduction of section 189A of the LRA in 2002, there was no statutory definition of substantive fairness in the case of an operational-requirements dismissal. The question is a factual one; the employer must prove:

# that the proffered reason is based on the operational requirements of the business, so that the employer will have to prove that the reason for dismissal falls within the statutory definition of "operational requirements;" and
# that the operational reason actually existed, and was the real reason for the dismissal. The reason may not be a mere cover-up for another reason.

A dismissal for operational reasons need not be restricted to the cutting of costs and expenditure. Profit, or an increase in profit, or gaining some advantage such as a more efficient enterprise, may also be acceptable reasons for dismissal.

If the employer can show that a good profit is to be made in accordance with a sound economic rationale, and it follows a fair process to retrench an employee, the dismissal is fair.

===== Large-scale Dismissals =====
Section 189A of the LRA distinguishes between the size of employers and also the size of dismissals when regulating substantive and procedural fairness of dismissal.

Section 189A(1) distinguishes between a small employer (less than fifty employees) and a big employer (more than fifty employees).

In terms of s189A(1)(a) a large-scale dismissal would entail the employer's dismissing

* ten employees, if the employer employs between fifty and 200 employees;
* twenty employees, if the employer employs between 200 and 300 employees;
* thirty employees, if the employer employs between 300-400 employees;
* forty employees, if the employer employs between 400-500 employees; and
* fifty employees, if the employer employs more than 500.

In terms of s189A(1)(b), a dismissal by a big employer of fewer than the prescribed minimum listed above still constitutes a large-scale dismissal if the number of employees to be dismissed, together with the number of employees that have been dismissed for operational reasons in the twelve months previously, exceeds the number specified above.

This is a so-called "rolling twelve-month period" and must always be calculated backwards, starting from the date on which the employer gives notice in terms of section 189(3) of the latest proposed dismissal for operational reasons.

The purpose of the twelve-month rolling period is to ensure that employers do not manipulate the number of employees to be dismissed so that the dismissal always falls outside the ambit of section 189A.

Section 189A(19) of the LRA provides that, in any dispute referred to the Labour Court concerning the dismissal of the number of employees in terms of subsection (1), the court must find that the employee was dismissed for a fair reason if

* the dismissal was to give effect to requirements based on the employer’s economic, technological, structural or similar needs;
* the dismissal was operationally justifiable on rational grounds;
* there was a proper consideration of alternatives; and
* selection criteria were fair and objective.

====== "Economic, technological, structural or similar needs" ======
This requirement entails that the reason for dismissal must be for "operational requirements," as defined in section 213. It must also be the real reason for the dismissal.

====== "Operationally justifiable on rational grounds" ======
"Rational" grounds are grounds that are founded upon "reason" or "logic." The rationality test is an objective one, measuring the acceptability of the reasons for dismissal against that which would generally be considered acceptable. It is not a subjective test focussed only on what the particular employer considered to be justifiable under the circumstances.

====== "Proper consideration of alternatives" ======
One of the requirements for a procedurally fair dismissal is consultations on measures to avoid dismissals. This inclusion makes this procedural requirement also a requirement for substantive fairness, and goes further by requiring "proper" consideration.

"Proper" consideration entails more than merely considering alternatives. The employer must apply its mind and give defensible reasons for dismissing such alternatives, and show that dismissal was a last resort.

====== "Selection criteria were fair and objective" ======
One of the requirements for a procedurally fair operational requirements dismissal is that the parties must attempt to reach consensus about the method to be used to select employees for dismissal. Where the parties are unable to agree, the criteria used must be "fair and objective." This procedural requirement is also, therefore, a requirement for substantive fairness.

==== Courts' changing views ====
In the past, the courts took the view that the function of the court is not to second-guess the employer’s decision. It is not up to the court to ask whether it was the "best" decision under those circumstances; it needed only to consider whether it was a rational, commercial or operational decision.

Now the courts take a closer view of the employer’s business decisions.

In ''[[BMD Knitting Mills v SA Clothing &amp; Textile Workers Union]]'', the court departed from its deferential approach and focused on the fairness of the reason to both parties:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The starting point is whether there is a commercial rationale for the decision. But rather than take such justification at face value, a court is entitled to examine whether the particular decision has been taken in a manner which is also fair to the affected party, namely the employees to be retrenched. To this extent the court is entitled to enquire as whether a reasonable basis exists on which the decision, including the proposed manner, to dismiss for operational requirements is predicated. Viewed accordingly, the test becomes less deferential and the court is entitled to examine the content of the reasons given by the employer, albeit that the enquiry is not directed to whether the reason offered is the one which would have been chosen by the court. Fairness, not correctness is the mandated test.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Chemical Workers Industrial Union v Algorax]]'', the court considered itself to be entitled to scrutinize the employer’s business reasoning and decision-making in considerable detail. The reasoning given is that the court should not hesitate to deal with an issue which requires no special expertise, skills or knowledge that it does not have, but simply requires common sense or logic.

The most important implication of this approach is that the employer will need to convince the court not only that it has considered alternatives, but that it has chosen the option that makes the best business sense.

==== Procedural aspects ====
There is no clear dividing line between substantive and procedural fairness in dismissals for operational reasons; the issues overlap considerably.

===== Consultation process =====
The consultation process is at the heart of procedural fairness in the case of dismissal for operational requirements.

Section 189(1) of the LRA provides that, when an employer contemplates dismissing one or more employees for reasons based on the employer’s operational requirements, the employer must consult

* any person whom the employer is required to consult in terms of a collective agreement;
* if there is no such collective agreement,
** a workplace forum, if such exists; and
** any registered trade union whose members are likely to be affected;
* if there is no workplace forum, any registered trade union whose members are likely to be affected; or
* if there is no such trade union, the employees likely to be affected by the proposed dismissals or their representatives nominated for that purpose.

In ''[[United National Breweries v Khanyeza]]'', the court held that, where a union is recognized as a consulting party in a collective agreement, it is entitled to consult on behalf of all employees, even those falling outside the bargaining unit for which the union is recognised.

Note that consultation must take place when the employer "contemplates dismissal"—when the possibility of dismissal is foreseen, but the final decision to dismiss has not been reached. At most, therefore, the employer must have an intention to retrench.

Item 3 of the Code further entrenches the idea that consultation must take place when dismissal is "contemplated."

This ensures that the employees are afforded the opportunity to influence the employer in its final decision to dismiss or not to dismiss.

Section 189 does not prescribe the period over which consultation should extend, but Item 5 of the Code states that the circumstances of each case are relevant to the determination of a reasonable period.

Item 6 further states that the more urgent the need of the employer to respond to the factors giving rise to contemplated dismissals, the shorter the consultation process will be.

Consultation entails that the parties must engage in a meaningful joint consensus-seeking process and attempt to reach consensus. This means that the parties must embark on a joint problem-solving exercise, striving for consensus.

For the process to be meaningful, the employer must consult in good faith and not simply "go through the motions." This means the employer cannot have made up his mind to dismiss prior to consultation, and must be prepared to keep an open mind with regard to the representations made.

The employees must engage properly, make representations and ensure that their representations are well founded and substantiated, and not merely prolong consultations.

Should the parties fail to reach consensus, the final decision remains that of the employer.

In ''[[NEHAWU v University of Pretoria]]'', the Labour Appeal court held that, after restructuring had been exhaustively discussed by a steering committee, on which all stakeholders were represented, the university was not required to consult again on all those issues after formally giving notice in terms of section 189 of the LRA.

===== Consultation topics =====
Section 189(2) of the LRA provides that the employer and the other consulting parties must engage in a meaningful joint process, attempting to reach consensus on

* appropriate measures
** to avoid the dismissals;
** to minimize the number of dismissals;
** to change the timing of the dismissals; and
** to mitigate the adverse effects of the dismissals;
* the method for selecting the employees to be dismissed; and
* the severance pay for dismissed employees.

====== Measures to avoid dismissals ======
There must be proper consideration of alternatives. The employer must apply its mind to the proposals and, if applicable, give defendable reasons for dismissing these alternatives and coming to the conclusion that dismissal was the only solution.

Possible alternatives include the following:

* granting paid or unpaid leave;
* reducing or eliminating overtime or work on Sundays;
* transferring employees to other departments; and
* training or retraining employees to enable them to take up other positions in the organisation.

The parties may consider spreading the dismissals out over a period of time to allow a natural attrition of numbers through retirements or resignations.

====== Measures to minimize the number of dismissals ======
Once dismissals have been agreed as the only solution, the number of dismissals must be kept to a minimum. This may mean

* transferring employees to other sections or departments;
* asking for volunteers by means of offering a voluntary severance package;
* allowing natural attrition of numbers; or
* training or retraining.

====== Measures to change the timing of the dismissals ======
While the employer may prefer the dismissals to be immediate, the union may prefer them to be spread over a period of time, or that they take place at a later stage.

====== Measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the dismissals ======
The employer may, for example, assist the employee in finding alternative work by giving the employee time without loss of pay to search for alternative work.

The employer may also make an office available in which to complete job applications and arrange interviews.

The employer may provide a reference for the employee.

In ''[[Sikhosana v Sasol Synthetic Fuels]]'', the court noted that the LRA contemplates a hierarchy of consulting parties, each if applicable excluding its successors. The courts apply section 189(1) strictly. It was held that, although appropriate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the dismissals should be taken, employers are not required actively to seek alternative work for retrenched employees.

The employer may also undertake to give priority to the dismissed employee should a vacancy arise.

====== Criteria for dismissal and severance pay ======
Consensus must also be reached on the criteria used to select which employees will be dismissed and the amount of severance pay the employee is entitled to.

===== Written Disclosure of Information =====
The employer must disclose all relevant information in writing. Verbal assurances, explanations and information by the employer will not suffice; the other party may demand that the employer put everything down in writing or provide documentation such as financial reports.

According to section 189(3) of the LRA, all "relevant information" must be disclosed. This may include, ''inter alia'',

* the reasons for the proposed dismissals;
* alternatives considered and the reasons for rejection thereof;
* the number of employees likely to be affected;
* the proposed method for selecting which employees to dismiss;
* the time when the dismissals are likely to take effect;
* severance pay proposed;
* any assistance the employer proposes to offer;
* the possibility of the future re-employment of the employees who are dismissed;
* the number of employees employed by the employer; and
* the number of employees the employer has dismissed for operational requirements in the preceding twelve months.

Relevance is a question of fact and entails all information that will allow effective consultation.

The onus is on the employer to prove that any information that it has refused to disclose is not relevant for the purposes for which it is sought.

Privileged information, information that may cause harm if disclosed and private personal information relating to an employee is not required to be disclosed, even if it is relevant.

===== Representations and consideration of representations =====
Section 189(5) of the LRA provides that the employer must allow the other party an opportunity to make representations on any matter on which the parties are consulting. Representations on issues regarding the reasons for dismissal, alternatives to dismissal, measures to minimise the number of dismissals, the timetable for dismissal, assistance offered, severance pay, etc., are therefore allowed.

Representations about the disclosure of information and about "any other matter relating to the proposed dismissals" are also allowed: for example, the socio-economic effect that a mass dismissal would have on the local community.

The employer must engage with those representations and consider and respond to them.

===== Selection criteria =====
Employees must be selected for dismissal in terms of selection criteria that have either been agreed upon or that are fair and objective.

This means that the criterion should not be arbitrary; it must be relevant, in that it relates to the conduct of the employee, such as length of service, ability, capacity and the needs of the business.

The following criteria are commonly used:

* seniority;
* conduct;
* efficiency, ability, skills, capacity, experience, attitude to work and productivity;
* attendance;
* bumping;
* retirement; and
* volunteers.

====== Seniority ======
This is the "last in, first out" or LIFO principle. Long-serving employees are retained at the expense of those with shorter service in similar or less-skilled categories of work. This method minimises the use of subjective judgment to decide who shall be retrenched. This is why it is favoured by most unions.

The Code also acknowledges LIFO as a fair and objective criterion, but provides that it should not operate so as to undermine an agreed affirmative-action programme.

Exceptions may also include the retention of employees based on criteria (like special skills) which are fundamental to the successful operation of the business.

====== Conduct ======
This criterion will be fair and objective if it is based on objectively determined conduct, like attendance records and previous warnings, and if the employee was at all times made aware that the employer found such conduct unacceptable.

====== Efficiency, ability, skills, capacity, experience, attitude to work and productivity ======
These criteria are generally favored by employers. They are regarded as objective, provided they do not depend solely upon the opinion of the person making the selection, but can be objectively tested.

Furthermore, they may only be used if the employee knew that the employer considered them important.

====== Attendance ======
This criterion will only be allowed if it can be proved that the employee always knew that the employer regarded absences from work seriously.

====== Bumping ======
If retrenchment is to affect only one department in an enterprise, the practice is sometimes to retrench on the LIDO basis and to drain off remaining employees in that department into other departments.

====== Retirement ======
Employees who have reached the minimum retirement age may be identified as the first population for retrenchment. After these employees have been retrenched, LIFO is used. This criterion is often applied in jobs which require a level of fitness and strength.

====== Volunteers ======
Parties may agree that the employer will first ask for volunteers before embarking on any selection process.

===== Severance Pay =====
Section 41 of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration creates a statutory duty for the employer to pay severance to workers who are dismissed for operational reasons.

Severance pay is an amount for each completed year of continuous service.

Section 84 of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration suggests that, for the purposes of determining the length of the employee’s employment, previous employment with the employer must be taken into account if the break between the periods is less than one year.

The duty to pay severance is not absolute. If an employee unreasonably refuses an alternative position, he loses the right to severance pay.

The question of whether or not the refusal is reasonable is one of fact. Item 11 of the Code states that reasonableness is determined by a consideration of the reasonableness of the offer of alternative employment and the reasonableness of the employee’s refusal. Objective facts such as remuneration, status and job security are relevant.

If the offered position amounts to a demotion, the refusal will not be unreasonable.

==== Large-scale dismissal by big employer ====
Section 189A introduces additional requirements for a procedurally fair dismissal in the case of a large-scale dismissal.

Firstly section 189A affords either party the right to ask the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to appoint a facilitator to assist the parties during the consultations; secondly, section 189A introduces a moratorium of sixty days, during which the employer may not dismiss.

===== Facilitation option =====
Only the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may be approached to appoint a facilitator.

The employer must make this request when it gives notice in terms of section 189(3) to the employee party that it is contemplating a large-scale dismissal.

The employee party (the union, for example) representing the majority of the employees may also ask for a facilitator. The employee party must notify the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration within fifteen days of the employer's notice of contemplated dismissal.

If neither party asks for a facilitator within the above timeframes, they may agree to ask for one to be appointed during the consultation process.

If a facilitator is appointed, the facilitation must be conducted in terms of the regulations made by the Minister of Labour for the conduct of such facilitation.

These regulations relate to the time period and variation of such time periods for facilitation, the powers and duties of facilitators, the circumstances in which the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may charge a fee for appointing the facilitator, and the amount of the fee.

An employer may not dismiss before sixty days have elapsed from the date on which notice in terms of s189A(3) is given.

===== Non-facilitation option =====
If none of the parties request a facilitator, section 189A stipulates that a minimum period of thirty days, from when notice in terms of section 189A(3) was given, must have lapsed before a dispute may be referred to the CCMA or other council.

==== Resolution of disputes ====
Disputes regarding the procedural and substantive fairness of dismissals by a small employer, and small-scale dismissal by a big employer, are referred to the Labour Court.

In large-scale dismissals, disputes about procedural fairness must be referred to the Labour Court within thirty days after notice of dismissal has been given to employees.

In large-scale dismissals, where there are disputes about substantive fairness, there are two choices:

# strike action, in which case 48 hours' notice must be given; and
# the Labour Court, to which the employee party may elect to refer the dispute.

In the case of dismissal for operational reasons of a single employee, the employee may refer a dispute about substantive or procedural fairness either to arbitration or to the Labour Court.

==== Dismissal of strikers ====
In terms of section 67(5), employees engaged in a protected strike may be dismissed if

* they are guilty of misconduct during the strike; or
* operational requirements require such.

=== Closures, mergers and sales of businesses ===
A unique problem in labour law is the fate of employees when a business is sold or closes. This problem has a close practical connection to dismissals for operational reasons, as many businesses are sold because they are unhealthy and require restructuring.

==== Common law ====
In terms of the common law, the position of the employees was that no employee could be forced to continue his contract of employment with the new employer; conversely, the new employer had no obligation to continue to employ the employee.

Transfer of a business could therefore mean the termination of existing employment contracts.

==== LRA ====

===== Original s 197 =====
When the LRA came into operation, section 197 endeavored to address job security in cases of the transfer of a business in the normal run of things and as a result of insolvency. The section was much criticised for its creation of uncertainty and for failing to define certain concepts. The section did not expressly state that employees have the right to have their contracts of employment transferred; the courts had to read that into the section. It also did not address the exact rights of the employees in such a situation.

===== New s 197 =====
The rewritten section 197 attempts to address the situation in a more calculated and extensive way. The most important difference is that ordinary transfers are dealt with separately from insolvency transfers.

Section 197 applies only in cases of a transfer of a business.

Section 197(1) defines a "business" as the "whole or a part of a business, trade, undertaking or service."

"Transfer" is defined as a "transfer of a business [...] as a going concern."

The right of employees to have their contracts transferred is dependent, therefore, on the business's transfer meeting the exact wording of section 197.

====== "Transfer" ======
The meaning of this word is wider than a mere "sale." In ''[[Schutte &amp; Others v Powerplus Performance]]'', the court held as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A business or part of a business, may be transferred in circumstances other than a sale.  These may arise in the case of merger, takeover or as part of a broader process of restructuring within a company or group of companies. Transfer can take place by virtue of an exchange of assets or a donation [.... G]iven the range of circumstances under which a transfer can take place, the need for an agreed price or valuation may not arise. Consideration may take some other form. The outsourcing in this matter was part of a broader process of restructuring and must be seen against the backdrop of the [old employer's] acquisition of 50% stake in the [new employer].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====== "As a Going Concern" ======
Once it is established that there was a transfer, the important question is whether that transfer was of the "whole or a part of any business, trade, undertaking or service [...] as a going concern."

A distinction is often made between three ways of transferring a business:

# a sale of shares;
# a sale of assets; and
# a sale of the business itself.

In respect of a sale of shares, it has been held that a distinction should be made between a transfer of a business as a going concern and a transfer of possession and control of a business: the result of a sale of shares. A sale of shares is excluded from the ambit of section 197.

In respect of a sale of assets, the court in ''[[Kgethe v LMK Manufacturing]]'' held that an agreement to sell a portion of the assets of a business is not a transfer as a going concern. Although this judgment was overturned on appeal, it was on the basis that the court was not entitled to make a finding as to the true of the agreement. Therefore the previous decision is still tenuous authority for the proposition that a sale of assets does not constitute a transfer as a going concern.

In ''[[Schutte v Powerplus Performance]]'', however, the court held that, irrespective of the form the agreement takes, the court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether or not it is transferred "as a going concern."

The following factors may be taken into account in finding that there has been a transfer of a business as contemplated in section 197. This list is not exhaustive:

* a pre-existing relationship between the buyer and seller;
* a previous in-principle agreement to sell a certain part of the business;
* the wording of the contract itself;
* the fact that the buyer employed the majority of the employees;
* use of the same premises by the buyer; and
* continuation of the same activities without interruption.

In ''[[National Education Health &amp; Allied Workers Union v University of Cape Town]]'', the court held as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In deciding whether a business has been transferred as a going concern, regard must be had to the substance and not the form of the transaction. A number of factors will be relevant to [this question], such as the transfer or otherwise of assets both tangible and intangible, whether or not workers are taken over by the new employer, whether customers are transferred and whether or not the same business is being carried on by the new employer. What must be stressed is that this list [...] is not exhaustive and that none of them is decisive individually. They must all be considered in the overall assessment and therefore should not be considered in isolation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====== Outsourcing ======
The question of whether or not an outsourcing of services falls within the ambit of section 197 has been subject to some scrutiny.

In ''[[SAMWU v Rand Airport Management Company]]'', the employer outsourced its gardening and security services to outside contractors, as this was cheaper. The court held that the gardening and security services fell within the ambit of the term "service" in section 197, and that these services could be transferred from one employer to another. The next question considered was whether these services were being transferred as a going concern. The court referred to the decision in ''[[NEHAWU v University of Cape Town]]'', and affirmed that a flexible approach must be taken in finding an objective answer to this question. On the facts, the court held that the agreement between RAMC and the other employer in respect of the outsourced services amounted to a transfer of a service within the ambit of section 197. On the evidence, however, the court could not decide whether the agreement between the two companies had been implemented, and therefore could not decide whether the contracts had been transferred from RAMC to the service provider.

This decision confirms, however, that an outsourcing exercise may constitute a transfer of a going concern as envisaged in section 197. The Labour Appeal court did not specify, however, what factors are to be taken into account, so this does not provide a final answer to the question of whether or not all outsourcing arrangements will fall within section 197.

====== General rules ======
Once it is established that s197 applies, one must consider the effect thereof. The four consequences of such a transfer are listed in section 197(2). These principles have far-reaching implications for the new employer, who may want to restructure the business and possibly retrench employees.

If the new employer decides to retrench employees, severance pay will be calculated on the basis of service with the old and new employer to determine the years of service.

Similarly, remuneration and benefits may be linked to years of service, which may also place a financial burden on the new employer.

Section 197 may also affect the freedom of the new employer to apply certain selection criteria in cases of retrenchment. In ''[[Keil v Foodgro (A Division of Leisurenet)]]'', Keil was first employed by MacRib and then by Foodgro, who bought MacRib as a going concern. Keil was employed in the same position by both employers. Foodgro sought to justify Keil's selection for retrenchment on the basis that it had applied LIFO, and that Keil's old contract was substituted with a new one when Foodgro bought the business. The court rejected this argument on the basis that section 197 provides for continuity of employment, so Foodgro should have taken Keil's service with MacRib into account. Foodgro's selection for dismissal was therefore fundamentally flawed. Keil was awarded nine months' compensation.

The new employer will also be expected to pay for the "sins" of the old employer. In ''[[NUMSA v Success Panelbeaters &amp; Service Centre]]'', an employee was unfairly dismissed by the old employer. The employee successfully challenged the fairness of the dismissal, the Labour Court ordering that the employee be reinstated. By this time, however, the old employer had sold the business as a going concern. The court held, accordingly, that the new employer was obliged to take the employee into service.

There are a number of additional principles relating to the consequences of a transfer.&lt;ref&gt;ss 197(7)-(9).&lt;/ref&gt;

Should the new employer not adhere to its obligations to provide transferred employees with at least substantially the same conditions or circumstances at work, and should this lead to termination of the contract by the employee, it will be considered an automatically unfair dismissal according to sections 186 to 187 of the LRA.

====== Exceptions ======
The general rule that the employees of the old employer become the employers of the new employee, with the same terms and conditions of employment, and with continuity of employment, is subject to a number of exceptions.

Section 197(3) provides that the new employer may provide terms and conditions of employment that "are on the whole not less favorable."

Furthermore, the consequences of a transfer, as envisaged in section 197(2), are expressly subject to an agreement in terms of section 197(6). Although employees may insist on their contracts being transferred, the right to be afforded the same contractual rights must be agreed upon.

Regarding the identity if the parties, section 197(6)(a) states that the agreement must be with the same bodies or persons with whom an employer has to consult about retrenchments. As far as the employer is concerned, either the old or the new employer may be the other party to the agreement.

Any agreement which interferes with the employees' existing terms and conditions has to involve the employees in order to be valid.

In cases of retrenchment prior to transfer, the retrenchment will only be substantively fair if the retrenchment is based on the operational requirements of the old employer and not those of the new employer.

An employee of the old employer who refuses "adequate alternative" employment with the new employer when faced with retrenchment by the old employer is not entitled to severance pay.

Only those rights which actually did accrue contractually to employees prior to the transfer are transferred. Only the rights of the employees existing at the time of transfer become the obligations of the new employer.

Employees cannot use section 197 as a form of statutory bargaining to insist on better terms and conditions of employment.

Not all benefits (especially pension benefits) are provided by employers. Only existing rights may be transferred.

Section 197 of the LRA allows the transfer of employees from one pension fund to another as a result of a transfer of a business if the criteria in section 14 of the Pension Funds Act are met.

====== Insolvency ======
The term "sequestration" refers to the insolvency of an individual. The terms "liquidation" and "winding-up" refer to the insolvency of a company, close corporation or other legal entity.

In the past, the approach has been that all contracts of employment between the insolvent employer and its employees terminate automatically. This meant that the employees lost their jobs. In respect of unpaid wages, they became creditors of the insolvent estate of the employer. It also meant that an employer could manipulate the process of insolvency by applying for a [[provisional liquidation]] to get rid of employees, and then come to some kind of arrangement with a prospective buyer, or with the creditors, to ensure the survival or continuation of the operations. The employer could thus ensure the automatic termination of the employment contracts without actually going out of business.

Section 197A of the LRA addresses this situation.

This section also only applies to a "transfer" of a "business." These terms have the same meaning as under section 197.

Section 197A applies only if the old employer is insolvent, or if a scheme of arrangement or compromise with creditors is entered into in order to avoid winding-up or sequestration.

As a general principle, the effect of section 197A is that all employees of the old employer become employees of the new employer; continuity of employment is preserved.

These consequences are also subject to agreement (between the employees and the new or old employer, or both) to the contrary.

Other similarities between ordinary transfers and transfers in case of insolvency are:

* The new employer complies with its obligations if it takes over the employees as long as the terms and conditions of employment are, on the whole, not less favourable.
* Subject to agreement, the new employer is bound by pre-existing arbitration awards and collective agreements.
* Provision is made for the transfer of employees from one pension fund to another as a consequence of the transfer of the business.
* Resignation of an employee, faced with substantially less favourable conditions and circumstances, will be regarded as automatically unfair.

In transfers in the normal course of business, however,

* the rights and obligations of the old employer and the employees at the time of the transfer remain; and
* the new employer does not inherit the "sins" of the old employer.

Subsections 197(7) to (9), regarding the valuation and provision of accrued benefits, do not apply to transfers in cases of insolvency.

== Collective labour law ==

The power play between employers and employees is clearly in evidence in the engagement of employer and employee through collective labour law. The LRA, together with other labour legislation, lays down basic rights and duties and remedies for ensuring fairness in the employment relationship. These are matters relating to the rights of employees and are accordingly known as "rights issues."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 159"&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to creating new terms and conditions of employment—these are known as "interest issues" or "matters of mutual interest"&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 159"/&gt;—or to changing existing terms, no legislation exists which explicitly regulates the situation. These issues, it is assumed, are better dealt with by the parties themselves. A court may not, for example, determine an annual increase for employees, or decide whether or not a crèche facility at the workplace is mandatory, or whether employees should be permitted to take Friday afternoons off. The reason for this is that "it is impossible to regulate these matters of mutual interest."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 159"/&gt; This is where collective bargaining comes into the picture.

The LRA recognizes the importance of collective bargaining and supports the mechanism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If collective bargaining can be compared to a boxing match, the LRA can be seen as the organiser of the boxing match and the employers and trade unions are the boxers on opposite sides. The LRA provides the basic rules to protect the boxers both inside and outside the boxing ring. This is done, for example, by protecting the right of employees to form and join trade unions and to participate in their activities. This applies equally to employers who can form employers' organisations.&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 159"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 213 of the LRA defines a trade union as “an association of employees whose principal purpose is to regulate relations between employees and employers, including any employers’ organisation.” An employer organisation is defined as “any number of employers associated together for the purpose, whether by itself or with other purposes, of regulating relations between employers and employees or trade unions.”&lt;ref&gt;s 213 of the LRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA regulates the registration of trade unions and employers' organisations. It creates bargaining fora, such as bargaining councils and statutory councils, and guarantees the right to freedom of association. It also regulates organisational rights and strikes and lock-outs.

Once workers are organised in a registered trade union, and employers in an employers' organisation, the power play between workers and employers begins. Employees may try to force the employer's hand by way of strike action, while the employer ma exert pressure on the employees by way of a lock-out. It is accepted that strike action will result in a certain measure of economic handship for the employer. Provided that the strike has obtained protected status in terms of the law—in other words, is not prohibited, and the prescribed procedures have been followed—such economic hardship is considered to be part and parcel of the power struggle between employees and their employers: "In fact, this is the whole idea!"&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 160"&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The more the employer is hurt economically, the greater the chance that the strikers' demands will be met.

It is important to know when a strike or lock-out is protected, and when it is not, because that will determine the course of action and remedies for employers in the case of a strike, and for employees in the case of a lock-out.

=== History ===

==== Industrial Conciliation Act (1924) ====
Between 1911 and 1918, a succession of laws was promulgated in South Africa which dealt with various industrial sectors, and with labour in general. Only in the aftermath of large-scale industrial unrest on the Witwatersrand in 1922, however, was any comprehensive attempt undertaken to regulate relations between management and organised labour. The tumult on the Rand led directly to the first comprehensive piece of labour legislation, the [[Industrial Conciliation Act 1924]], which was also the first legislation to regulate strikes in the country. It also recognised and regulated lock-outs. The Act provided for the registration of white trade unions and employers’ organisations, "self-evidently also white,"&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 4"&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and established a framework for collective bargaining through industrial councils or conciliation boards, as well as a dispute settlement system. Although the Act was "largely voluntarist,"&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 4"/&gt; compliance with its provisions and with collective agreements was enforced by criminal sanction. The 1924 Act resulted in greater wage disparity between different racial groups. The Industrial Conciliation Act dealt only with collective labour rights; individual rights were dealt with in a Wage Act in 1925.

==== Industrial Conciliation Act (1937) ====
Problems of enforcement led to a major revision of South African labour law, with the introduction of the [[Industrial Conciliation Act 1937]]. The 1937 Act tried to introduce more councils, in a greater geographical spread, so that more collective engagements could be facilitated. There was a proliferation of unregistered trades union for black people, who were legislatively excluded. Specifically, pass-bearing black workers were excluded, although certain black women could unionise.

==== Botha Commission ====
1948 was a watershed year. The Nationalist Party won the election, albeit by small margin (which grew in later years), on the promise of apartheid. The Botha Commission was established to determine how to regulate labour relations in such a way as to protect the interests of white people. The Commission’s comprehensive review led to legislation that had a far-reaching effect on the labour structure. Trade unions were racially divided, job reservation was introduced and blacks were precluded from joining registered trade unions. The commission recommended that black trade unions should be dealt with in separate legislation, but the government went a step further and created an entirely separate legislative framework for black workers in general. Trade unions in the 1950s among black workers were therefore not part of the formal collective bargaining framework.

By 1952, black women were also excluded from trade-union membership, while in 1953 the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act made provision for, inter alia, the creation of a Central Black Labour Council and regional committees, black labour officials and black workers’ committees. 1956 saw the prohibition of the creation of mixed-race trade unions, necessitating different unions for different race groups. This was part of the State’s attempt to isolate and fragment the workforce. It fuelled unrest, however, rather than quelling it.

In the 1970s, the power of the black trade unions became especially notable, in a period marked by political unrest and industrial action. In 1973, provision was made for the creation of liaison and coordinating committees, and a restricted right to strike was accorded black workers. This attempt to accommodate black interests, without recognizing their parity with white interests, did not have the desired effect.

==== Wiehahn Commission ====
This dualistic system of labour relations—one for blacks and the other for whites, "coloureds" and Indians (although the latter groups were also discriminated against)—lasted until the beginning of the 1980s. In 1977, the government appointed the Commission of Enquiry into Labour Legislation, commonly known as the Wiehahn Commission that made significant recommendations for change, which changed the face of collective bargaining in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Pretorius"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of South Africa: From the Distant Past to the Present Day | publisher=Protea Book House | author=Pretorius, Fransjohan | year=2014 | location=Hatsfield, Pretoria | isbn=978-1-86919-908-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|488}} It was tasked to examine the current legislation and make recommendations to maintain the peace in the labour system.&lt;ref name=Pretorius/&gt;{{rp|488}} The Commission produced a six-part report, the primary recommendations of which were:

* that full trade union rights be accorded black workers;
* that job reservation be scrapped;
* that a Manpower Commission be established; and
* that the Industrial Court replace the existing Industrial Tribunal and be given extended powers.

In an attempt to give effect to these recommendations, significant amendments were made to the Industrial Conciliation Act (renamed the Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956), which with further amendments formed the legislative structure for regulating collective labour relations for the next 15 years.

The country’s labour laws were thus largely "deracialised." All African workers who were not migrant workers could now join trade unions. The National Manpower Commission, a statutory body comprising representatives from employers organisations, trades and the State, which would meet to discuss economic and industrial policy, was duly established.

In recognition of the fact dispute-resolution mechanisms, thitherto inadequate, needed to be bolstered, the Industrial Court (predecessor of the present-day Labour Court) was duly established, too. The Industrial Court was largely hands-off in respect of collective bargaining, in which it did not think it had any place involving itself here.

The last change to be implemented as a result of the Commission’s findings was the removal of race-based job reservation, which was seen as having contributed to the unrest. These changes led to a tremendous growth in the trade union movement, which proved instrumental, especially in the 1980s, in the struggle against apartheid.

==== Labour Relations Act (1995) ====
The system in place up to the advent of democracy, "when South Africa was shaken to the roots by the transformation of the apartheid regime into a fully democratic constitutional order,"&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 6"&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 6.&lt;/ref&gt; was very fragmented. There were numerous definitional problems, too. Given the prominent role played by trade unions in bringing down apartheid, and given "the rapid and large-scale movement of former union leaders and cadres into party politics and government, it is hardly surprising that much attention was given to labour rights m the new dispensation."&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 6"/&gt;

The right to fair labour practices, the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike were entrenched with a number of other fundamental rights in a new interim Constitution that came into force in 1993. Those rights remained entrenched in the final Constitution, adopted by the new democratic parliament on 8 May 1996. At that point, although all parties agreed that these fundamental labour rights should be given constitutional status (although there was some dispute about the extent of an employer’s right to lock out), there was room for disagreement on the scope and content of those rights. The final Constitution provided that "national legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining."

"From this cue," writes John Grogan, "the government set about preparing legislation to give flesh to the bones of the constitutional guarantees."&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 6"/&gt; The first step was to appoint a commission, under the chairmanship of Professor Halton Cheadle, to produce a draft Labour Relations Amendment Bill. This was accomplished six months later. The draft formed the basis of the new Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, which appeared in its current form after "intensive debate"&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 6"/&gt; in the National Economic Development &amp; Labour Council (NEDLAC), a body consisting of representatives of government, organised labour, and employers, including the Manpower Commission and the National Economic Forum. They started thrashing out a new framework, to deal comprehensively with both individual and collective labour law. Given the adversarial nature of the relationship between organised labour and employers up to that point,

&lt;blockquote&gt;this was a revolutionary development. Under the watchful eye of government representatives, and with their participation, management and labour were entrusted with the task of developing the draft bill into a uniquely South African product that at once satisfied the aspirations of labour and the reservations of management, and yet conformed to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and the requirements of the International Labour Organization (ILO), of which South Africa was now a member.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This produced the current LRA, "yet another turning point."&lt;ref name="Grogan Workplace Law 308"&gt;Grogan Workplace Law 308.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hopes of the drafters was to change the adversarial stance which tended to be adopted by unions and management under the old dispensation to a more co-operative one. The LRA created new institutions for encouraging union-management cooperation, and revamped old ones, "in the hope this would help transform and mature attitudes and bargaining styles."&lt;ref name="Grogan Workplace Law 308"/&gt;

=== Sources ===

==== Common law ====
The common law of South Africa, "an amalgam of principles drawn from Roman, Roman-Dutch, English and other jurisdictions, which were accepted and applied by the courts in colonial times and during the period that followed British rule after Union in 1910,"&lt;ref&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 11.&lt;/ref&gt; plays virtually no role in collective labour law. Initially, in fact, employment law, or "the law of master and servant," was regarded as a branch of the law of lease. As such, the common law did not concern itself directly with collective bargaining; its focus instead was on the rights and duties of individual employees and employers, as reflected in the contract on which their relationship was based. The law did not recognize claims by employees which had not been conferred by agreement. Although the role of the common law is minimal, therefore, it should be noted that the common-law contractual relationship between employer and employee underpins collective labour law in general and collective bargaining in particular.

==== Constitution ====
Legislation therefore is pivotal. The Constitution, however, is more pivotal still. Section 23 enshrines the right to "fair labour practices," while section 18 provides that "everyone has the right to freedom of association." The right to strike, furthermore, has been explicitly constitutionalized.&lt;ref name="s 232c"&gt;s 23(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also provides not only for the right of every worker "to form and join a trade union,"&lt;ref&gt;s 23(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; but also for the right of every trade union "to form and join a federation,"&lt;ref&gt;s 23(4)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; like COSATU. Similar rights are granted to employers and employers’ associations as well.&lt;ref&gt;s 23(3)-(4).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to collective bargaining is constitutionalized, with a mandate for national legislation to regulate it.&lt;ref name="s 235"&gt;s 23(5).&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, the Constitution also provides that   "national legislation may recognize union security arrangements contained in collective agreements."&lt;ref name="s 235"/&gt;

==== Labour Relations Act ====
Collective bargaining is one of the ways in which the LRA gives effect to section 23 of the Constitution. It is also an important part of freedom of association. Among the first of the LRA’s aspirations, listed in the Preamble, is "to regulate the organisational rights of trade unions." A trade union without organisational rights is not much of a trade union. Organisational rights allow the trade union to access the workplace, etc.

The Preamble also describes as a purpose of the LRA the promotion of collective bargaining, and the regulation of the rights to strike and to lock out. It seeks also to advance "the democratization of the workplace" by involving employees in decision-making through workplace forums, although these have not proliferated.&lt;ref&gt;Steadman, Felicity. "Workplace Forums in South Africa: A Critical Analysis." Indus. LJ 25 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA defines as an "employee" any person (excluding an independent contractor) who

* works for another person or the State;
* is entitled to receive remuneration for such work; and
* assists in conduct of the business.

"Trade union" is defined in the LRA as an association strictly of employees,&lt;ref&gt;If the association is one of students, for example, it clearly does not meet this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; whose principal purpose is to regulate relations between employees and employers. The trade union must act in the interests of its members. Trade unions also support individual members with individual disputes. A trade union must have an address in South Africa, and its name must not be so similar to that of another union "that it is likely to mislead or cause confusion."&lt;ref&gt;s 95(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Other requirements are set out in section 95.

Excluded from the application of the LRA are the members of

* the National Defense Force;&lt;ref name="s 2a"&gt;s 2(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
* the National Intelligence Agency;&lt;ref name="s 2a"/&gt; and
* the South African Secret Service.&lt;ref name="s 2a"/&gt;

=== Freedom of association ===
Freedom of association, "one of the cornerstones of liberal democracy,"&lt;ref&gt;Budeli, M. "Understanding the right to freedom of association at the workplace: components and scope." (2010) 16.&lt;/ref&gt; is also one of the basic principles of labour law, reflected in several ILO Conventions,&lt;ref&gt;Two fundamental ILO conventions on freedom of association have been ratified by South Africa: Convention 87 and Convention 98.&lt;/ref&gt; in the LRA and in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[SANDU v Minister of Defence (1999)|South African National Defence Union v Minister of Defence &amp; Another]]'' (1999) ''ILJ'' 2265 (CC); ''[[SANDU v Minister of Defence (2007)|SANDU v Minister of Defence &amp; Another]]'' [2003] 9 BCLR 1055 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of association "stems from a basic human need for society, community, and shared purpose in a freely chosen enterprise [...] protecting individuals from the vulnerability of isolation and ensuring the potential of effective participation in a society."&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, people have the right to associate with others in order to defend and protect their common interests. This constitutes "both an individual and a collective human right."&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 19. "The right to associate concerns an individual as an active participant in social activities and it is in a sense a collective right in so far as it can be exercised by a plurality of individuals" (19-20).&lt;/ref&gt; In addressing the individual facet of freedom of association, the Supreme Court of Canada, in ''[[Lavigne v Ontario]]'' recognized that "the essence of freedom of association is the protection of the individual interests in self-actualization and fulfillment that can be realized only through combination with others."

"However," writes [[Mpfariseni Budeli]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;freedom of association is important not only to facilitate effective participation in civil and political society. It is equally important in the field of social and economic activity and is particularly significant as a basis for securing trade union freedom from interference by the employer on the one hand and the government on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Freedom of association in the workplace may be defined as "those legal and moral rights of workers to form unions, to join unions of their choice and to demand that their unions function independently."&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 18, citing Olivier "Statutory Employment Relations in South Africa" in Slabbert, Prinsloo, Swanepoel and Backer (eds) ''Managing Employment Relations in South Africa'' (1999) 5-60.&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the right of workers to participate in these unions’ lawful activities. "Freedom of association must therefore be seen," according to Budeli, "as the foundation of the collective bargaining process,"&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 20.&lt;/ref&gt; which contributes to ensuring fairness and equity in labour matters, and to facilitating orderly and stable industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;See DA Basson ''South African Interim Constitution Text and Notes'' (1994) 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of association is the foundation of the collective-bargaining process. Before a group or collective may engage in collective bargaining, it is necessary that legal protection be extended to that group or collective. Legal measures are also necessary to protect the rights of people to belong to a group or collective. This is what freedom of association is all about: the legal protection of the freedom of persons to join a collective entity. The law, therefore, both permits people to join trade unions, and also protects their right to do so.

The ILO Committee of Experts has provided "what can be regarded as the correct approach concerning freedom of association and social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Committee’s view, freedom of association should be guaranteed in such a way as to allow trade unions to express their aspirations, and so as to provide an indispensable contribution to economic development and social progress.

The Constitution grants a general right to freedom of association to "everyone," as well as explicitly and specifically to trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;ss 18, 23(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 23 of the Constitution protects the right of employees to form and join a trade union and to participate in the activities and programmes of that union. Freedom of association does not apply only to employees, however; the employer’s freedom of association is protected, too: Section 23 also protects the right of employers to form and join employers’ organisations, and to participate in the activities and programmes of such organisations.

Both trade unions and employers' organisations have the right

* to determine their own administration programs and activities;
* "to organize; and
* "to form and join a federation."

Finally,

&lt;blockquote&gt;every trade union, employers’ organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining. National legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this chapter the limitation must comply with section 36(1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the Constitution lays emphasis on the importance of freedom of association, the LRA emphasizes, protects and gives concrete content to this foundational right. The LRA recognizes the right of trade unions to organize themselves. Membership of a trade union is subject to the constitution of the trade union.&lt;ref&gt;s 4(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a union may determine, in its constitution, what types of employees may become members of the union, and what types of employees are disqualified from membership. Unless an employee qualifies for membership in terms of the union’s constitution, he is ineligible for membership. This principle has its limits. A trade union which attempts, through its constitution, to limit its members to persons of a certain race or sex could find such a provision ruled invalid; "it would certainly not be registered in terms of the LRA."&lt;ref&gt;Basson ''Essential Labour Law'' 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4 does not only protect the right to join and form a union. It also grants members of a union the right to participate in the affairs of the union. As a member of a trade union, an employee has the following rights:

* to participate in the union’s lawful activities;
* to participate in the election of any of the union’s office-bearers, officials or trade-union representatives;
* to stand for election, and be eligible for appointment, as an office-bearer or official, and to hold office if elected or appointed; and
* to stand for election, and be eligible for appointment, as a trade-union representative, and to carry out, if so elected or appointed, the functions of a trade-union representative in terms of the LRA or any collective agreement.

Again, these rights are subject to the constitution of the union. If the constitution of a union requires that the nomination of a candidate as union office-bearer be signed by ten members in good standing, and also that the election be by means of a secret ballot at the union’s annual conference, these provisions of the union constitution must be complied with.

The LRA specifically grants employees the right to freedom of association,&lt;ref&gt;s 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and protects both employees and people seeking employment,&lt;ref&gt;s 5.&lt;/ref&gt; should this right be infringed by the employer. Section 5 of the LRA prohibits a wide range of actions which infringe the right to freedom of association in section 4. In terms of section 5(1), "No person may discriminate against an employee for exercising any right conferred by this Act." Examples of such discrimination would include an employer’s dismissal of an employee, or failure to give an employee a discretionary annual bonus, because the employee joined a trade union, and an employer’s resort to harassment against an employee because that employee has been elected as a trade-union representative.

The general protection of section 5(1) is complemented by section 5(2), which prohibits certain specific types of conduct that would undermine freedom of association. In terms of section 5(2)(a), no person may require an employee

* not to be a member of a trade union;
* not to become a member; or
* to give up membership.&lt;ref&gt;Again, it is worth emphasising that the protection of freedom of association accorded by section 5(2) applies also to prospective employees.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA grants the right of freedom of association to employers as well.&lt;ref&gt;s 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5(2)(b) provides that no person may prevent an employee (or a prospective employee) from exercising any right in terms of the LRA, or prevent an employee from participating in any LRA proceedings. For example, where an employer prevents an employee from standing for election as a trade-union representative, or where he threatens a union representative with dismissal because the representative is representing a union member at a disciplinary hearing, the employer would be acting unlawfully.

In terms of section 5(2)(c), employees or job seekers may not be prejudiced because of their trade-union membership, their joining a trade union, their participation in the lawful activities of a trade union, or their disclosure of information that they are entitled or required to disclose.

Section 5(3) prohibits an employer from attempting to persuade or tempt an employee into surrendering rights granted in terms of the LRA. The employer may not, for example, offer to promote the employee, or promise a wage increase, on the condition that the employee surrender rights accorded him by the LRA.

Section 5(4) provides that any contract of employment that limits freedom of association, either directly or indirectly, is regarded as invalid—irrespective of whether or not the contract was concluded before the LRA came into effect.

In terms of section 187 of the LRA, it will be an automatically unfair dismissal if the employer, in dismissing an employee, acts contrary to the provisions protecting an employee’s right to freedom of association.

The protection of freedom of association, then, has two aspects:

# Employers and employees must be protected against state infringement of the right. If the legislature enacts legislation that infringes the right, it may be challenged on the basis that it is in conflict with section 23 of the Constitution (South African National defense Union v Min of Defense and another).
# Employees’ freedom of association should be protected against attempts by the employer to infringe this right. It is in this regard that the LRA plays an important role.

Although the right to freedom of association is not only guaranteed in terms of the LRA, but also in terms of the Constitution, the scope of this right has not been tested. The question has arisen, however, of whether or not groups excluded from the application of the LRA,&lt;ref&gt;s 2.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Defense Force, are entitled to form and join trade unions, based on their constitutional right to freedom of association. The issue came before the Constitutional Court in ''[[SANDU v Minister of Defence (1999)|SANDU v Minister of Defence]]''. The court found that, although uniformed members of the South African Defense Force, the Secret Service and the Intelligence Service are excluded from the protection of the LRA,&lt;ref&gt;s 2.&lt;/ref&gt; they may claim the right to freedom of association under section 23 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Non-uniformed members of the Defence Force are civil servants; they fall under the LRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4 of the LRA states that all employees have the rights set out in that section. Section 4 therefore applies to senior managers as well. This may in some circumstances, "and does,"&lt;ref&gt;Basson Essential Labour Law 254.&lt;/ref&gt; cause problems both for employers and for the managers themselves. A senior manager involved in the formulation of an employer’s approach to the annual wage negotiations (including its "final offer") may not be able to perform his functions properly if he is also a member of the union sitting on the other side of the bargaining table. It might be difficult, too, for the manager not to divulge confidential information, bearing on the bargaining process, to the union.

This issue arose for decision in the case of ''[[Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union v Rustenburg Transitional Council]]'', where the Labour Court declared unconstitutional a prohibition on senior managers holding executive positions within a union. The court indicated, however, that there are limitations to the scope of section 4. It pointed out that, in terms of common-law principles, an employee owes an employer a "duty of fidelity"—a duty to act in good faith. Because of the conflicting aims of trade unions and employers, the joining of a union and participation in its affairs may, in terms of common-law principles at least, and especially in the case of senior managerial employees, breach this duty of fidelity.

Common-law principles have been amended by the Constitution, and especially by section 4 of the LRA. The court in ''IMATU'' stated that the rights granted in section 4 are "unequivocal and unconditional," but that they are not unlimited. Employees, including senior managers, are entitled to join trade unions and take part in their affairs, but this does not relieve them of their contractual obligations to their employers. If, for example, an employee takes time off without permission to attend to union affairs, the employee may be disciplined on the basis of misconduct. If a senior employee, part of whose job it is to conduct disciplinary enquiries, refuses to undertake this task when union members are disciplined, this will amount to incapacity.

A senior employee who has access to confidential information of the employer must also, the court added, tread carefully when conducting trade-union business, and ensure that this information is not disclosed.

In ''[[FAWU v The Cold Chain]]'', where an employee was offered a managerial position as an alternative to retrenchment, on condition that he no longer participated in the activities of the union, he refused and was retrenched, and the court found his dismissal to be automatically unfair, holding that there was nothing absurd in permitting a senior managerial employee to participate in the activities of a trade union—provided that the employee complies with his contractual obligations.

In ''[[Kroukam v SA Airlink]]'', the court held that Kroukam’s dismissal was automatically unfair in terms of section 187(1)(d) of LRA, because he had been dismissed for union activities and for initiating litigation against the company on behalf of his union. The court, in delivering its verdict, cautioned against the argument that participation in trade-union activities destroys the trust relationship between employer and employee; such an argument is unacceptable on policy grounds.

Managerial employees, therefore, must balance the right to freedom of association with their common-law duty to act in good faith towards their employers. If a manager, for example, divulges information to the trade union that he acquired by virtue of his managerial position, he may be disciplined.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union &amp; others v Rustenburg Transitional Local Council]]'' (2000) 21 ''ILJ'' 377 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 6 and 7 of the LRA grant and protect employer rights to freedom of association in terms similar to those granted to employees: to form, join and participate in the activities of employers’ organisations.

==== Freedom not to associate and freedom to dissociate ====
{{Original research|section|date=August 2014}}Freedom of association is generally regarded as a positive right; it protects the rights of employees and employers actively to form collective entities and to join them. In the case of trade unions, this positive right is protected by prohibiting both the State and employers from infringing it.

Freedom of association also has a negative aspect, however. This does not refer to any disadvantages or drawbacks it may have; it refers to the right ''not'' to associate. In the context of labour relations, the principle of freedom of non-association means that no person may force an employee to belong to a union in the first place, or to belong to a union other than the union of the employee’s choice.

Where the limits of freedom of non-association lie is the subject of considerable controversy.

Closed-shop agreements exist where an employer and a trade union conclude a collective agreement in terms of which the employer undertakes to employ or retain in its services only those employees who have joined the union. The closed-shop agreement forces employees to join a certain union if they are to keep their jobs. A closed-shop agreement could be seen as an infringement of the employees’ right not to associate.

Sometimes mention is made of the freedom of dissociation. This refers to the situation where employees who have decided to associate with each other also decide to prevent other employees from associating with them: for example, where the union’s constitution stipulates that only employees in a certain industry may join.

In practice, this freedom of dissociation is not so controversial. More controversial is that the constitutions of some unions state that the union has the right to refuse to admit a person as a member of that union even if that person is eligible for membership. A constitution may also provide for the expulsion of members. This becomes vitally important if there is a closed-shop agreement, because the refusal of membership of the union may mean the loss of a job.

==== Dispute resolution ====
If a person alleges that one of the rights relating to freedom of association has been infringed, the dispute-resolution procedure contained in section 9 of the LRA applies. Disputes about the interpretation or application of the right to freedom of association should be referred for conciliation to a bargaining council, a statutory council&lt;ref&gt;This type of council is established where no bargaining council exists (ss 39-43 of LRA), but very few councils of this type exist in practice.&lt;/ref&gt; or (if no council exists) the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. If the dispute remains unresolved, it should be referred to the Labour Court for adjudication, unless the parties agree to arbitration.

==== Union security arrangements ====
The Constitution allows for "union security arrangements contained in collective agreements."&lt;ref&gt;s 23(6).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no firm definition of the term "union-security arrangements," but it is generally viewed as a generic term for a collective agreement between an employer or employers’ organisation and a trade union or trade unions, in terms of which union membership, or alternatively the payment of trade union subscriptions, is a condition of employment for all employees. Clearly this infringes upon an employee's right to freedom of association. Union security arrangements therefore require compulsory union membership, or compulsory payment of a union subscription.

In the South African context, the term "union-security arrangements" refers to the so-called "closed-shop" and "agency-shop" agreements. The only limits set in the Constitution are that such agreements must

* be contained in a collective agreement; and
* comply with the general limitations clause of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;s 36(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two types of union security arrangements are illustrated by way of the following example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;K employs 100 employees. 60 of them belong to trade union T. These members pay a monthly membership fee of R20. From the other 40 employees 10 belong to union R and 30 are non-unionised. Every year with wage negotiations, T negotiates with K and the increase agreed on is applied across the board. T feels that it does all the hard work which both union and non-union members benefit from. If T concludes an agency-shop agreement with K, it will mean that K will deduct an agency fee of R20 from the salaries of all the other 40 employees and pay it over to T. The other 40 employees do not have to become members of T [... but] the members of R will pay their own membership fee for R as well as the R20 agency fee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If K and T conclude a closed-shop agreement, it will mean that all other 40 employees of K must become members of T. R will no longer be allowed to operate in the workplace. All 100 employees will have to pay the R20 membership fee to T.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Agency-shop agreements =====
An agency-shop agreement is defined in section 25(1) of the LRA: "A representative trade union and an employers organisation may conclude a collective agreement, to be known as an agency shop agreement, requiring the employer to deduct an agreed agency fee from the wages of employees identified in the agreement who are not members of the trade union but are eligible for membership thereof."

An agency-shop agreement is concluded by a majority union and an employer or an employers’ organisation—concluded, that is, by way of a collective agreement. The employer must deduct an agreed agency fee from the salaries of the employees identified in the agreement. In this regard, it is important to note that it may be deducted only from those who are not members of the union but also from those who are eligible for membership. Conscientious objectors to the policies of the union (on religious or moral grounds) must pay the fee; the fee, in turn, must be paid into a fund administered by the DoL. The fee that non-members pay must not be higher than the subscription fee payable by members of the majority union. Agency fees are paid over to a separate account and may be used only for the benefit of all employees at the workplace. Agency fees may not be used for political affiliation and may not be used for any purpose other than advancing or protecting the socioeconomic interests of employees. The employer may deduct agency fees from the wages of employees without their authorisation.

===== Closed-shop agreements =====
A closed shop is defined in section 26(1) of the LRA: "A representative trade union and an employer or employer’s organisation may conclude a collective agreement, to be known as a closed-shop agreement, requiring that all employees covered by the agreement be members of the trade union."

A closed-shop agreement is concluded by a majority union and an employer or an employers' organisation, by way of a collective agreement. The employees to be covered by the agreement must have a ballot before a closed-shop agreement is concluded. Two thirds of the employees (who will potentially be covered) who voted must have voted in favour of the agreement. Union subscription fees may not be used for political affiliation; they may be used only to advance the socioeconomic interests of the employees. Employees who were already employed when the closed-shop agreement came into effect, along with conscious objectors, may not be dismissed for refusing to join the union which is a party to a closed-shop agreement. A closed-shop agreement may be terminated if a majority of the employees votes for its termination. It is not unfair to dismiss an employee for refusing to join a union which is a party to a closed-shop agreement, or who is refused union membership, or has been expelled from a union which is a party to the agreement—provided that the refusal or expulsion is in accordance with the union’s constitution, and provided that the reason for the refusal or expulsion is a fair one.

An employee may not be required to be a member of a majority union before the commencement of employment. The latter is called a post entry closed-shop agreement. The opposite of this is a pre-entry closed-shop agreement: that is, a closed-shop agreement that requires an employee to be a member of a majority trade union before employment. Pre-entry closed shops are not allowed in South Africa.

===== Distinction =====
There is an important difference between the two: In the agency shop, employees are not compelled to be or to become members of the trade union. In the closed shop, however, all employees who are covered by the collective agreement must be or must become members of the trade union.

===== Controversy =====
The reason for these agreements relates to the nature and practice of collective bargaining. Under certain circumstances, employees who are not members of a trade union will be bound by the provisions of an agreement entered into by the union. In other circumstances, the employer may, in the interests of administrative convenience, extend the provisions of a collective agreement to non-union members. In effect, employees who are not members of the trade union may derive benefits from a collective agreement entered into by a union. "Understandably,"&lt;ref&gt;Basson Essential Labour Law 286.&lt;/ref&gt; unions have reservations about this state of affairs. These non-union employees are sometimes called "free riders," because they derive benefits for free: They do not pay union subscriptions, but they still obtain the benefits of the union’s collective bargaining. This is the main argument in favour of forcing employees either to belong to a union (in the case of closed-shop agreements) or to pay a fee (in the case of agency-shop agreements).

Those who support union-security arrangements argue that they are necessary to avoid free riders. Furthermore, there is a view that they encourage "responsible" unionism.&lt;ref&gt;Haggard ''Compulsory Unionism, the NLRB and the Courts'' (1977) 13.&lt;/ref&gt; They support collective bargaining by aiding the development of strong and representative trade unions. Such arrangements are said to give union organizers a sense of security, and to enable them to devote themselves to the long-term interest of their members, "instead of collecting subscriptions and trying to persuade reluctant employees to join."&lt;ref name="Budeli Understanding 31"&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 31.&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the main justification for union-security arrangements is that they add to the power of the unions during the collective-bargaining process, creating a more effective counterbalance to the naturally superior economic power of the corporate employer. This they do by preventing the defection of members during wage bargaining which may lead to strike action.&lt;ref name="Budeli Understanding 31"/&gt;

There may also be some benefit in such arrangements for the employer. If all employees belong to one union (or contribute to that union), the employer need only deal with that specific union. As a collective-bargaining relationship grows, a certain pattern and consistency of collective bargaining can thus be formed.

On the other hand, those who consider that the unions already possess monopoly status and excessive power see union security arrangements, particularly the closed shop, "as a main cause of undesirable state of affairs at the workplace."&lt;ref&gt;Budeli "Understanding" 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The main arguments against union security arrangements are,

* in the case of closed-shop agreements, that they give more power to the unions, since the union controls the pool of applicants for the post;
* in the case of agency-shop arrangements, that workers who are members of minority unions end up paying double subscriptions (one for their union and one for the representative union); and
* that union security arrangements, particularly closed-shop arrangements, infringe the right not to be a member of a trade union or the freedom ''not'' to associate, which is an intrinsic part of the right of freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;See Budeli "Understanding" 29-31 and the sources there cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ILO Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining do not make any express reference to the notion of union-security arrangements. The ILO Committee also left it to the practice and regulation of each state to authorise and, where necessary, to regulate the use of union-security clauses in practice.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Venezuela'' case (Case 1611).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Committee, union security arrangements are compatible with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association, provided that they are the results of free negotiations between workers’ organisations and employers. As long as this is the case, then, the international body will not interfere with them, provided that the law of a particular country does not go so far as to impose them generally and make union membership compulsory. However, when trade union security clauses are imposed by the law itself, then the right to join an organization of one's own choosing is compromised, and those provisions will be incompatible with the ILO Convention. Accordingly ILO member states are at liberty to include or not to include in their constitutions and labour legislation provisions regulating union-security arrangements.

Despite the arguments in favour of agency shops and closed shops, it would appear ''prima facie'' that these types of agreement do infringe the employee’s freedom of association. Particularly in the case of a closed shop, an employee is no longer free not to associate: The employee ''must'' belong to a specific trade union. Employees are no longer free to choose which union they want to belong to, or even if they want to belong to a union at all. If the employee is not a member of a particular trade union, or if he loses his trade-union membership in terms of the union’s constitution, the employee may end up out of a job.

It has been argued, accordingly, that the closed-shop agreement amounts to an infringement of the employee’s freedom of association, as protected by sections 18 and 23 of the Constitution. The situation is different in the case of agency shops: The employee still has the freedom to choose whether or not he wants to belong to the union which is party to the collective agreement—"that is if the employee wants to belong to a union in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;Basson Essential Labour Law 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to this problem lies in a constitutional provision, section 23(6) of the Constitution, which provides that "national Legislation may recognize union security arrangements contained in collective agreements. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this Chapter, the limitation must comply with s 36(1)." In other words, union-security arrangements are permitted within the scheme of constitutional rights, and these arrangements may be recognized by national legislation (the LRA).

Agency shops and closed shops, then, are not ''automatically'' unconstitutional, but a limitation of any right by a union-security arrangement must comply with section 36(1) of the Constitution, which provides that a fundamental right, such as freedom of association, may be limited by legislation as long as that limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. Section 36(1) contains a list of the factors that must be considered:

* the nature of the right;
* the importance and purpose of the limitation of the right;
* the nature and extent of the limitation, and the purpose of the limitation; and
* whether or not there are less restrictive means to achieve this purpose.

Applied to agency and closed shops, the purpose of these arrangements is, at least in part, to enhance collective bargaining by the development of strong and powerful trade unions and stable bargaining relationships. (Collective bargaining is also protected by section 23 of the Constitution.)

While agency shops do not represent all that serious an infringement of freedom of association, it is clear that the closed-shop agreement does. The question (which still awaits an answer) is whether or not it is really necessary to force employees to become members of a union, especially when a less restrictive method—that is, the agency shop—exists.

===== Dispute resolution =====
Disputes about collective agreements (including closed- and agency-shop agreements) must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation. If conciliation fails, any party to the dispute may refer the matter to arbitration. By way of exception, the LRA makes provision in this context for an appeal against an award issued by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioner. The arbitration award may be taken on appeal to the Labour Court.&lt;ref&gt;s 24(6)-(7).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisational rights ===

==== Purpose ====
The LRA does not impose a legal obligation on employers to bargain collectively with unions. The law encourages collective bargaining; it does not compel it. One of the ways it seeks to do this is by enabling trade unions to acquire organisational rights in certain circumstances. The granting of organisational rights to a trade union is seen as a way of enabling that trade union to establish a collective-bargaining relationship with an employer or employer’s organisation.

The trade union is the essential instrument for engaging in collective bargaining. The LRA sets certain minimum rights for trade unions (which may be expanded upon by agreement) in their engagement with employers. These organisational rights are granted to unions by the LRA to enable them to function more effectively, to build support at the workplace, and thereby to lay the foundations of a collective-bargaining relationship with the employer.

If the union, through the acquisition of organisational rights, gains sufficient membership and a significant presence in the workplace or industry, an employer or employers’ organisation may be persuaded to "recognize" the union for the purpose of collective bargaining.

==== Registration ====

===== Prerequisite =====
Organisational rights are granted only to registered trade unions. The LRA does not compel trade unions and employers’ organisations to register, but it does encourage registration. It does this by granting most of the rights in the LRA only to registered unions. For instance, only a registered union may

* conclude collective agreements which are enforceable in terms of the LRA;
* apply for the establishment of a bargaining or a statutory council;
* apply for the establishment of a workplace forum;
* authorize a picket by its members; and
* exercise organisational rights.

Registration is not a prerequisite for protected strike action.

===== Procedure =====
Once a trade union or employers' organisation has complied with the requirements set out in the LRA, the Registrar of Labour Relations must register the union or organisation. In respect of unions, there are four requirements to be met:

# The name of the union, and the shortened form of that name, may not resemble the name or shortened name of another union.
# The constitution of the union must comply with certain requirements.
# The union must have an address in South Africa.
# The union must be independent; it must not be under the control of the employer or employers’ organisation.

The first three requirements apply also in the case of an employers’ organisation; the last one, given the overlap, obviously does not.

===== Specific rights =====
The LRA makes provision for granting of five types of organisational rights. Other organisational rights may also be granted which are not referred to in the LRA; these must be obtained through negotiation and agreement. The five types of organisational rights made provision for in the LRA are listed and discussed below:

# the right of access to the premises of the employer;
# the right to have trade-union membership fees deducted by way of a stop order;
# the right to elect shop stewards;
# the right of shop stewards to get time off for trade-union activities; and
# the right to disclosure of information.

====== Access to the workplace ======
The logical place for contact between union representatives and the members they represent, as well as prospective members whom the union might recruit, is in the workplace. Section 12 of the LRA states that a registered trade union, sufficiently representative, has the right of access to the workplace. This right allows the union

* to enter the employer's premises, to recruit members, to communicate with members and also to serve members' interests;
* to hold meetings with employees at the workplace (but outside of working hours); and
* to let members vote at the employer's premises in union elections or ballots.

The purpose of this access is for the union to recruit new members, to communicate with existing ones and to serve the interests of union members in other ways.

The right of access refers to access for union officials, to be clear, not just anyone who is affiliated with union. Nor do such officials also not have free rein. The right of access is not unlimited. Section 12(4) states that the exercise of the union’s right of access to the workplace may be subject to such conditions, as regards time and place, as are reasonable and necessary to protect life and property, or to prevent the undue disruption of work.

In the case of domestic workers, there is no right of access to workplace, given the intimate nature of the workplace.

====== Deduction of union fees ======
This is the primary source of income for unions. Section 13 of the LRA grants unions the right to stop-order facilities. Union fees are used to perform the work and functions of the union, to hire officers and offices, and to provide training. There is no stipulation in the LRA or in related regulations as to how much unions are allowed to charge, but usually it is not much. The amount is determined by the constitution of the trade union.

Payment is voluntary: A member of a registered and sufficiently representative union may authorize the employer, in writing, to deduct union subscriptions from his wages. Usually this is done on the union membership form. The employer should start to make the deductions agreed to as soon as possible, and should pay the subscription over to the union not later than the fifteenth day of each month.

The employee may subsequently revoke authorization, however, on written notice of a month, to both the employer and the trade union. At end of that period, employer must stop making the deduction.

When paying deductions to the trade union, the employer must also furnish union with

* a list of union members from whose wages deductions were made;
* details as to amounts deducted and paid to the union;
* the period to which the deductions relate; and
* copies of all written notices of revocation of authorization by union members.

====== Election of shop stewards ======
Shop stewards are union representatives, "the infantry of the trade union."&lt;ref&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 58.&lt;/ref&gt; They play a very important role in industrial relations, being in the best position to represent the union in the workplace and to relay information about the workplace to the union. They look after the day-to-day operation of the union and the protection and assistance of workers with their work-related problems. Their statutory role is to ensure compliance with the law and with collective agreements.

Section 14 of the LRA provides that members of a registered trade union, provided that the union represents the majority of employees in the workplace, are entitled to elect trade-union representatives if the union has at least ten members in the workplace. The nomination, election, terms of office and removal from office of representatives are governed by the union’s constitution.

The number of representatives is determined according to the number of union members in the specific workplace. For example, if there are only between ten and fifty union members, there will be two representatives. The amount increases on a sliding scale. The maximum number of representatives is twenty.

The functions of union representatives are set out in section 14(4) of the LRA:

* to assist and represent the employee at his request in grievance and disciplinary  proceedings;
* to monitor the employer’s compliance with the LRA and all other applicable laws;
* to report alleged contraventions of LRA or collective agreements to the employer, the representative trade union and the responsible authority or agency; and
* to perform any other function agreed between representative trade union and the employer.

Shop stewards are employed by the employer, not by the union. Grogan describes "the difficult position in which shop stewards find themselves," keeping two sets of books, or attempting "to serve two masters,"&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 60"&gt;Grogan Collective Labour Law 60.&lt;/ref&gt; their employer and their trade union—masters whose interests are often diametrically opposed. "This situation is particularly difficult," writes Grogan, "when shop stewards also occupy supervisory or managerial positions."&lt;ref name="Grogan Collective Labour Law 60"/&gt; The courts have held, however, that employers may not for this reason forbid managerial employees from being elected as shop stewards; the most they can do is to discipline them if their union role actually prevents them from performing their managerial duties properly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union v Rustenburg Transitional Council]]'' (2000) 21 ILJ 377 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between union officials and union representatives (like shop stewards) is an important one. Trade-union officials are employees of the trade union; they perform various duties for the trade union in this capacity. Trade-union representatives, on the other hand, remain employees of the particular employer at the workplace, although they also represent the union in various ways within the workplace where they are employed.

====== Time off for trade-union activities ======
Section 14(5) of LRA entitles the trade-union representative to "reasonable" time off, during working hours,&lt;ref&gt;s 15(1).&lt;/ref&gt; without loss of pay, to perform union functions and be trained in any subject relevant to performance of those functions. The meaning of "reasonable" in relation to paid time off is not stated in the Act.

Attendance at union conferences and meetings may require the office-bearer to be absent from work. In terms of section 15(1), the office-bearer of a registered, sufficiently representative trade union is entitled to take reasonable leave during working hours for the purpose of performing the functions of his office. In terms of section 15(2), the union and employer may agree on the number of days’ leave, the number of days’ paid leave and the conditions attached to any leave. If the union and the employer are unable to reach an agreement, the dispute may be determined by an award made in terms of section 21 of the LRA.

No benchmark for shop stewards’ leave emerges from the decided cases, but arbitrators have generally accepted ten days per annum as "reasonable." Employers may take disciplinary action against shop stewards if they exceed or abuse their powers by, for example, intimidating employees, including other shop stewards. Employers are entitled to refuse to deal with shop stewards if they have committed serious misconduct.

Item 4(2) of the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal, seeks to discourage victimization of shop stewards by requiring employers to inform and "consult" their unions before taking disciplinary action against them for any reason. A number of cases concerning the dismissal of shop stewards have reached the courts. The approach in such cases is to determine

# the dominant reason for the dismissal; and then
# whether that reason relates to the performance by the shop steward of his or her duties.

If it does, the dismissal is ‘automatically’ unfair, and the shop steward will invariably be reinstated.

====== Disclosure of information ======
For a trade union to do its job effectively, it may need access to certain information. Section 16 provides for the provision of information both to trade-union representatives and to trade unions. Only registered unions which represent the majority of the employees in the workplace are entitled to rely on section 16.

Only relevant information must be disclosed: That is to say, in terms of section 16(2), all relevant information that will allow the representative trade union to engage effectively in consultation or collective bargaining must be disclosed. The information must be relevant to the effective performance of functions in terms of section 14(4). There is, in other words, an important link between the information required and the function of the representative. Often the requirement of "relevance" means relevance to the performance of a specific task.

Typically the information in question is in the hands of the employer. A common example is production plans or plans for restructuring, which will affect or cause retrenchment.

The registered majority union has a right to information when the employer is actually involved in consultation or bargaining with the union, or when consultation or bargaining is about to start. For example, at annual wage negotiations, the employer may argue that its financial position, both short- and long-term, is poor. The trade union may dispute this and demand that all relevant information on which the employer bases this argument be disclosed. The employer would then have to furnish, for example, proof of cancellation of orders, and reasons for such cancellation, any existing and possible new orders, and financial statements.

The employer, however, cannot be expected to disclose information which

* is unavailable;
* is irrelevant to the issue or issues under discussion;
* is legally privileged;
* could harm the employer's business interests if disclosed; or
* is private personal information relating to an employee, unless the employee has consented to the disclosure of such information. It is also possible for the employer to convey such information to the union without disclosing identities.

If the employer regards certain types of information as confidential, it must notify the union of this fact.

Disputes on the disclosure of information are to be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, which will attempt to settle the dispute through conciliation and, failing that, arbitration.

==== Different levels of representativeness by unions for different rights ====
Whether a trade union is entitled to organisational rights depends on the level of representativeness of the trade union in the workplace, which can be either majority representation or "sufficient" representation. If a union represents the majority of workers, it will have access to all organisational rights. If the union is sufficiently representative, it will have access only to certain organisational rights: the rights of access, leave and stop-order facilities. The rights to elect shop stewards and to disclosure of information, on the other hand, are reserved for unions that have as members the majority of the employees in the workplace.

Usually, only a single union will be seeking organisational rights, but two or more unions may also act together to do so.

===== Majority representation =====
Where the union has a majority, representing 50 per cent plus one, or more, of all employees in the workplace, it enjoys the following organisational rights:

* the right of access to the workplace;
* the right to have membership fees deducted from wages;
* the right to elect shop stewards;
* the right of shop stewards to leave for union activities; and
* the right of disclosure of information.

===== Sufficient representation =====
Where the union is "sufficiently represented," it represents less than the majority of employees in the workplace. There is no fixed rule as to "sufficient representation;" it is decided on a case-by-case basis. A sufficiently representative union enjoys the following organisational rights:

* the right of access to the workplace;
* the right to deduction of membership fees from wages; and
* the right to leave of shop stewards for trade-union activities.

If the union is a member of a bargaining council, it enjoys the following organisational rights:

* access to the workplace; and
* deduction of membership fees from wages.

If it is a minority union, it may enforce its rights through collective bargaining and industrial action. Two or more trade unions may act jointly to acquire rights.

The LRA does not define "sufficient representation," but it does give guidelines. Factors to be taken into account would include the nature of the workplace and the industry involved, as well as the presence or absence of other unions with membership in the workplace. The approximate figure is thirty per cent.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[UPUSA v Komming Knitting]]'', the Commissioner extended the right to access the workplace, together with the right to deductions of union subscriptions, to a union which, at the time of the award, represented just seven employees out of 31. The Commissioner made this decision on the basis

* that the union was the only union organising and recruiting at the workplace;
* that it had been present in the workplace since shortly after the employer’s inception; and
* that its current low level of representation was due to high labour turnover.

The Commissioner held that the union seemed capable of recruiting a majority of the workers at the workplace.

In ''[[SACTWU v Marley]]'', the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration refused organisational rights to a union with 42 per cent representivity, on the basis that another union represented 56 per cent of employees in the workplace, and because the employer had a long association with the other union, which included an agency-shop agreement.

In ''[[NUMSA v Feltex Foam]]'', the question was whether differing degrees of "sufficient representativeness" could be set for different organisational rights: a higher degree for gaining access to workplace, for example, than for stop-order facilities. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration held that there have to be very special circumstances to allow him to distinguish between such rights. If the arbitrator is prepared to grant one of these rights, in other words, there would have to be special circumstances to justify a refusal to grant any of the others.

In ''[[Organisation of Labour Affairs v Old Mutual Life Assurance]]'', the Commissioner was prepared to order the employer to grant access to the workplace and stop-order facilities to a union with level of representivity which would not ordinarily have permitted the granting of these rights, on the basis that the rights had been granted to other unions with lower representivity. A similar approach was adopted in ''[[Group 4 Falck v DUSWO]]''.

The effect of these decisions is that, when an employer grants organisational rights to a union with, for example, only ten per cent representivity, the employer cannot really argue that another union seeking organisation rights must have at least thirty per cent.

Section 18 allows an employer and majority union in a workplace, as well as parties to a bargaining council, to establish by collective agreement the level of representativeness required for the purposes of gaining access, deductions and leave at a particular workplace.

The only limit is that the agreed threshold must be applied equally to all unions seeking to exercise any, or all, of these rights.

===== "Workplace" =====
The "workplace" is defined in section 213 of LRA. There is a distinction to be drawn, in this regard, between the public service and the private sector.

* In the public sector, the workplace is the national department, provincial administration, provincial department or organisational component contemplated in the Public Service Act.
* In the private sector, the workplace is the place where employees of the employer work.

If the private employer has two businesses, independent of each other by reason of size or function or organisation, the place where the employees work in connection with each independent operation constitutes the workplace for that operation. This foresees the possibility that geographically distinct operations may constitute one workplace. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioners been unwilling to accept too easily that geographically distinct places of work constitute separate workplaces.

In ''[[Speciality Stores v SACCAWU]]'', the Labour Court was loath to find, in the absence of proof by the trade union, that different stores of a retailer constituted different workplaces. The court also made it clear that the onus rests on the union to prove that two operations are two different workplaces.

===== Thresholds =====
Employers and majority unions are permitted to conclude collective agreements that set thresholds for the acquisition of rights under sections 12 (union access to the workplace), 13 (stop-orders) and 15 (time off). This right is conferred by section 18 ("Right to establish thresholds of representativeness"), which reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) An employer and a registered trade union whose members are a majority of the employees employed by that employer in a workplace, or the parties to a bargaining council, may conclude a collective agreement establishing a threshold of representativeness required in respect of one or more of the organisational rights referred to in sections 12, 13 and 15.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) A collective agreement concluded in terms of subsection (1) is not binding unless the thresholds of representativeness in the collective agreement are applied equally to any registered trade union seeking any of the organisational rights referred to in that subsection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A threshold agreement, then, is an agreement to restrict certain rights to unions with a certain percentage of representation. The idea is to prevent union fragmentation, and to make bargaining genuinely collective.

==== Acquisition of organisational rights ====
Trade unions may acquire organisational rights in the following ways:

* through collective agreement;
* through membership of a bargaining council;
* through strike action; or
* through the section-21 procedure.

===== Through collective agreement =====
The LRA makes provision in section 20 for a registered trade union and an employer or employers' organisation to conclude a collective agreement that regulates organisational rights. This means that, even if the trade union is not representative, it could have organisational rights on which the parties agreed.

This route generally begins with an approach by the union to the employer, and a request that it grant the union organisational rights. Section 20 does not prescribe any representivity requirements before the employer will be entitled to grant such rights in a collective agreement. Even a union with only a small degree of representivity, therefore, may obtain organisational rights.

===== Through membership of a bargaining council =====
In terms of section 19 of the LRA, a registered trade union, if party to a bargaining council, automatically acquires the right of access to the premises, together with the right to have trade union subscriptions deducted by stop orders, in respect of all workplaces falling within the jurisdiction of the bargaining council. Again, it does not matter, for the purposes of this route, how representative the union is in the specific workplace. A union acquires these rights irrespective of whether it is sufficiently representative or not.

===== Through s 21 procedure =====
Briefly, the section-21 procedure involves notice by the union to the employer of its intention to seek organisational rights, consultation between union and employer in an attempt to reach a collective agreement, and referral by the union of a dispute, if any, to the CCMA, which will attempt to settle the matter through conciliation, failing which it will arbitrate the dispute and issue a binding award. The union in this case must be registered, and must enjoy a certain level of representation in the workplace.

The onus rests on the union to notify the employer, in writing, that it intends to seek the organisational rights conferred by the Act. The notice must contain the following information:

* the workplace in which the union seeks to exercise the rights;
* the representivity of the trade union in that workplace;
* the rights that the trade union wishes to exercise; and
* the manner in which the trade union wishes to exercise those rights.

The notice must be accompanied by a certified copy of the trade union registration certificate.

Within thirty days of receiving the notice, employer must meet with the union. The parties must then try to conclude a collective agreement regulating the manner in which the organisational rights will be exercised. The employer may refuse to grant union rights on the grounds there is a dispute as to what constitutes a "workplace," or because the employer argues that the union does not enjoy the required degree of representativeness.

If the parties fail to conclude a collective agreement, either of the parties may refer the dispute, in writing, to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation. If conciliation fails, either party may request that the dispute be arbitrated. The CCMA has jurisdiction to arbitrate only if the union has complied with all the provisions of section 21, which are peremptory. Failure by the union to comply with them will mean that Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may not deal with the dispute.

The CCMA commissioner will be called upon to decide whether or not the union is representative. Section 21 authorizes him to make inquiries, conduct a ballot and take all other relevant information into account.

Once the actual number of members has been established, section 21(8) provides that the commissioner

* must seek to minimize the proliferation of trade union representation in a single workplace and, where possible, to encourage a system of a representative trade union in a workplace; and
* must seek to minimize the financial and administrative burden of requiring an employer to grant organisational rights to more than one registered union.

Here the LRA gives "clear legislative support for the principle of majoritarianism."&lt;ref&gt;Grogan ''Workplace Law'' 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, the commissioner must consider

* the nature of the workplace;
* the nature of the one or more organisational rights that the registered trade union seeks to exercise;
* the nature of the sector in which the workplace is situated; and
* the organisational history at the workplace or any other workplace of the employer.

If the employer is of the opinion that the union is no longer representative, it may refer matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, requesting that it withdraw the organisational rights. The commissioner may withdraw any of the organisational rights once conferred which are exercised by any other registered trade union in respect of that workplace, if that other union has ceased to be a representative union.

In order to determine the membership or support of the registered trade union, the Commissioner may

* make any necessary inquiries;
* where appropriate, conduct a ballot of the relevant employees; and
* take into account any other relevant information.

The employer must co-operate with the Commissioner and make available any information and facilities that are reasonably necessary for this purpose. An employer who alleges that a union is no longer a representative trade union may apply to the CCMA to withdraw any of the organisational rights previously granted.

In summary, the section 21 procedure runs as follows:

* The union notifies the employer in writing that it intends to exercise organisational rights.
* Within thirty days of the notice, employer and union meet in an attempt to conclude a collective agreement.
* If a collective agreement is concluded, they need go no further with section 21; if not, either party refers the dispute in writing to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation.
* If the matter is not successfully conciliated, there are two options:
** Either party may request arbitration, where after a Commissioner may determine the representativeness of the union and the manner in which rights are to be exercised. The Commissioner may consider an application for withdrawal of the rights, and relevancy and confidentiality of the information. An arbitration award is binding on the parties.
** The union may strike, or the employer may lock out:
*** If the union gives notice of its intention to strike, it may not refer the dispute to arbitration for a period of twelve months from the date of the notice.
*** The same condition applies to an employer giving notice of a lock-out.

The LRA Amendment Bill now before parliament proposes to amend section 21. Section 8A of the proposed amendment would allow a non-majority trade union to bring shop stewards into the workplace.

===== Through strike action =====
The LRA would prohibit a strike in support of a demand that the employer grant all or some organisational rights to a union, because such a dispute may be referred to arbitration in terms of section 21. Section 65(2)(a) specifically ''permits'' a union which would otherwise have the right to refer a dispute about organisational rights to arbitration in terms of section 21 to embark on strike action in an attempt to force employer to grant these rights.

A trade union, including a minority union, may therefore strike in support of a demand for organisational rights even if it does not meet the statutory threshold for acquiring such rights. Except for the right to information, in fact, organisational rights are the only rights conferred by the LRA over which strikes are permitted.

This is the consequence of ''[[NUMSA v Bader Bop]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(2003) 24 lU 305 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; where NUMSA, although not a majority union, sought to acquire the right to elect shop stewards by striking. The lower courts were divided. A divided Labour Appeal Court held that minority unions could not do strike for such a right because,

# once the union conceded that it lacked a majority, there would be no dispute over which to strike; and
# such a strike would be hit by section 65(1)(c), which prohibits strikes over disputes that either party may refer to arbitration.

This judgment was overturned by the Constitutional Court, however, which held that the minority unions may strike in support of demands for organisational rights to which they are not entitled under the LRA.

The Constitutional Court found that nothing in section 20 of the LRA precludes a collective agreement granting collective-bargaining rights, even if the qualification for representativity is not met. The court's interpretation of this was that, if a minority union asks for, but does not succeed in acquiring, the organisational rights in question, and if conciliation subsequently fails, the dispute-resolution mechanism is to strike for it.

This judgment has been severely criticized.

If the union uses the strike remedy, but is unsuccessful in forcing employer to grant the rights, the union loses the right to use the section-21 procedure for one year from date on which notice was given of the intention to go on strike.

==== Dispute resolution for organisational rights ====
If there is a dispute about the interpretation of organisational rights, any party may refer the dispute in writing to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation and, if conciliation fails, for arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;s 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes about disclosure of information follow the same route. In determining the dispute, the Commissioner must strike a balance between the employer’s right to privacy and the interests of sound collective bargaining. The Commissioner has a fairly wide discretion to make a suitable award to achieve this.

=== Collective bargaining ===
The legal rules relating to freedom of association and organisational rights are all aimed at making collective bargaining possible. There are specific rules that govern the collective bargaining process and the result thereof: collective agreements.

Neither the Constitution nor the LRA defines "collective bargaining." This is primarily because the law does not impose a legal duty to bargain on employers and trade unions.

Collective bargaining must be understood as a process. The process of collective bargaining entails negotiations between the two parties:

# a union on the one hand; and
# an employer or an employers’ organisation on the other hand.

Broadly, then, the collective-bargaining process may be defined as a process whereby employers (or employers’ organisations) bargain with employee representatives (trade unions) about terms and conditions of employment, and about other matters of mutual interest.

Unlike mere consultation, collective bargaining presumes a willingness from each party, not only to listen to and consider the representations of the other party, but also to abandon its own fixed positions where possible, in order to find common ground.

Bargaining occurs, ''inter alia'',

* where two opposing parties exchange demands and make counter-demands;
* where they propose (and accept or reject) compromises;
* where they negotiate; and
* where one party places pressure on the other to give in to its demands.

Bargaining, then, is a dynamic process.

Collective bargaining is mainly concerned with disputes of interest, but not to the exclusion of disputes of right.

The word "collective" refers to the fact that employees join together in trade unions to increase their power in bargaining with employers over wages, working conditions and any other matters of mutual interest between them.&lt;ref&gt;Steenkamp A ''et al'' "The right to bargain collectively" (2004) 25 ''ILJ'' 943.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that, on the workers' side, only trade unions may engage in collective bargaining. Although a single employer can engage in collective bargaining, an individual employee cannot, by definition, engage in collective bargaining.

If successful, collective bargaining leads to a settlement and the conclusion of a collective agreement. If it fails, there are several options available to the employer or the union, including

* resort to a lock-out or a strike; and
* submitting the dispute to mediation.

When a trade union enters into the collective-bargaining process, it will normally have one of three objectives in mind:

# The first, and most important, is the regulation of terms and conditions of employment.
# The second is regulation of the relationship between the union and the employer in whose workplace it has members. The union may negotiate organisational rights with an employer.
# Linked to the first three objectives, the union may wish to attempt to resolve a dispute that has arisen between it and the employer.

==== Bargaining fora ====
The LRA makes provision for the establishment of two institutions within which collective bargaining may take place:

# bargaining councils; and
# statutory councils.

The establishment, composition and function of bargaining councils and statutory councils are regulated in some detail by the LRA. Employers and trade unions remain free, however, to agree to their own collective-bargaining fora and procedures. The Act, however, does not regulate this "non-statutory collective bargaining" in any detail; it is left to the employer and the trade union to reach agreement on issues such as

* where the collective bargaining will take place (at industry, enterprise or plant level);
* when the collective bargaining will take place;
* on what topics collective-bargaining will occur;
* who will represent the parties during the collective-bargaining process;
* which employees will be covered by the collective-bargaining process; and
* the precise procedures to be followed.

The only facet of this type of bargaining regulated by the LRA is the legal effect and binding nature of collective agreements entered into.

==== Duty to bargain ====
It could be argued that the constitutional right to bargain collectively (s 23(5)) includes both a legally enforceable right to bargain collectively, as well as a corresponding duty to bargain collectively on the other party to the relationship. Since the LRA does not create a duty to bargain, this may give rise to the argument that the Act does not go far enough in protecting and giving content to the constitutional right. This debate may have to be solved by the courts in the future. For now, however, there is no general duty to bargain on employers and trade unions in terms of the LRA. An employer may refuse to engage with a trade union; in turn, the trade union may take strike action.

The question of whether the constitutional right to bargain collectively includes a duty on the other party has arisen in connection with one group of persons not covered by the Act: members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). In three separate disputes, the High Court had to consider whether the South African National Defense Force Union (SANDU) may rely on the provisions of section 23 in order to obtain a court order to require the State to bargain collectively with it. These decisions, and their arguments, were contradictory.

The SCA, on appeal, held that the constitutional provision does not impose a judicially enforceable duty to bargain on employers or employees. On further appeal, however, the Constitutional court left the question open. It did point out, however, that the contrary approach could create difficulties. It came close, then, to agreeing with the SCA that no duty to bargain collectively exists in South African labour law.

Although the LRA does not compel parties to bargain with each other, it encourages collective bargaining through the granting of organisational rights, the right to establish bargaining institutions and closed-shop and agency-shop agreements. Should an employer refuse to bargain, the Act allows for strike action by employees to convince the employer to bargain. A refusal to bargain includes:

* the employer’s refusal to recognise a trade union as a bargaining agent;
* the employer’s refusal to establish a bargaining council;
* the employer’s withdrawal of recognition of a collective bargaining agent;
* the employer’s resignation as a party to a bargaining council; and
* the employer disputing appropriate bargaining units, levels and topics.&lt;ref&gt;s 64(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes regarding refusal to bargain must first be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for an advisory award. An advisory award provides guidance only; it is not binding on the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Although part of alternative dispute resolution, an advisory arbitration is more than mediation. It allows parties to debate their case without fear of a final decision.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bargaining agents ====
Collective bargaining is performed by bargaining agents, namely trade unions and employers’ organisations. The LRA sets requirements for unions and organisations relating to registration. A trade union is defined as an association of employees whose principal purpose is to regulate the relations between employers or employers’ organisations and employees.&lt;ref name="s 213"&gt;s 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Only employees may be members of a trade union. Job seekers and ex-employees may not be members of a trade union.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[NEWU v Mtshali &amp; Another]]'' (2000) 21 lU 1166 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as a trade union, an association of employees need not be registered. Registration is beneficial, however, since only a registered trade union is entitled to rights, such as the right to

* conclude a collective agreement enforceable under the LRA;
* acquire organisational rights;
* be a member of a bargaining council, statutory council and workplace forum; and
* conclude closed-shop and agency-shop agreements.

The powers and functions of a bargaining council are outlined in section 28 of the LRA.&lt;ref&gt;The functions of a statutory council are narrower than those of a bargaining council.&lt;/ref&gt; A bargaining council has three main functions:

# to conclude collective agreements;
# to enforce those collective agreements; and
# to prevent and resolve labour disputes.

==== Levels of bargaining ====
Collective bargaining can take place at plant level,&lt;ref&gt;Plant-level bargaining refers to bargaining that takes place between the employees (normally represented by unions) and the employer at a specific plant or factory.&lt;/ref&gt; sector level&lt;ref&gt;Sectoral bargaining refers to bargaining that takes place in a specific sector of the economy and linked to a specific geographical area.&lt;/ref&gt; or industry level.&lt;ref&gt;Industry-wide bargaining refers to bargaining for a whole industry, like mining or motor manufacturers, normally on the national level.&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA encourages collective bargaining at sector or industry level. Provision is made for the establishment of bargaining councils for a particular sector. It is at this level that bargaining will take place in bargaining councils.&lt;ref name="s 27"/&gt; Moreover, bargaining councils may be established in the private as well as the public sector. The private sector is the economic sector in which the State is not the employer; in the public sector, the State is the employer.&lt;ref&gt;In the public service, the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council coordinates the activities of the four main bargaining councils in the public sector:

# the General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council;
# the Public Health and Social Development Sectoral Bargaining Council;
# the Education Labour Relations Council; and
# the Safety and Security Sectoral Bargaining Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disputes requiring bargaining council to resolve ====
* Disputes about freedom of association: A bargaining council only can conciliate these disputes, failing which they should be referred to the Labour Court for adjudication.
* Disputes of interest in an essential service: A bargaining council can conciliate and arbitrate these disputes.
* Disputes about severance pay: A bargaining council can conciliate and arbitrate these disputes.
* Disputes about unfair labour practices: A bargaining council can conciliate unfair-labour-practice disputes provided that they do not relate to discrimination. Discrimination disputes must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation, failing which they must go to the Labour Court for adjudication.
* Disputes that may lead to a strike or lock-out: A bargaining council only can conciliate these disputes.
* Dismissal disputes, if the reason for dismissal is based on operational requirements, for participating in an unprotected strike, for reasons connected to a closed-shop agreement, or automatically unfair: A bargaining council only can conciliate these
disputes.
* Disputes based on misconduct
and incapacity: A bargaining council may conciliate and arbitrate these disputes by way of the con-arb procedure.

==== Collective agreements ====
The main goal of collective bargaining between an employer and a trade union is to reach consensus about certain matters and formalise their relationship by means of a collective agreement. A collective agreement regulates the rights and duties of parties, as well as the terms and conditions of the employment of workers.

In terms of section 213 of the LRA, a collective agreement is a written agreement concerning terms and conditions of employment or any other matter of mutual interest concluded by one or more registered trade unions, on the one hand and, on the other

* one or more employees;
* one or more registered employers’ organisations; or
* one or more employers and one or more registered employers’ organisations.&lt;ref name="s 213"/&gt;

The parties, therefore, are

* a registered trade union; and
* the employer/s and/or registered employers' organisation/s.

===== Requirements =====
There are three important elements that distinguish a collective agreement from any other agreement between employees and employers:

# A collective agreement must be in writing.
# Only a registered trade union can be a party to a collective agreement. Agreement with unregistered trade union not a collective agreement.
# A collective agreement must regulate terms and conditions of employment or any other matter of mutual interest between a trade union and the employer or employers’ organisations.

====== In writing ======
A collective agreement need not be signed by the parties to the agreement to be valid. All that is required is that the agreement be in writing. It is not even necessary that the collective agreement be contained in a single document. It would, however, be advisable for the parties to the agreement to sign a single written document, as this would assist in eliminating later disputes as to whether or not an agreement was actually entered into, and what the content of the agreement was.

====== Registration ======
Only registered unions may be parties to collective agreements, but a union being unregistered does not mean that the union may not conclude an agreement with an employer; it simply means that the agreement will fall outside the scope of the LRA, and will not be enforceable in terms of the LRA. A single employer may conclude a collective agreement; a single employee cannot. The reason for this is the inequality of power between an employer and a single employee, and that a single employee is not a "collective".

====== Content ======
The definition also states what topics must be regulated by a collective agreement. It must deal with the terms and conditions of employment, and other matters of mutual interest between the parties. Terms and conditions of employment relate to those substantive provisions of the employment relationship, like working hours, remuneration and leave. Collective agreements can also regulate the granting of organisational rights to registered unions.

===== Binding effect =====
A distinction must be drawn between parties to the agreement and members of the parties to the agreement. Section 23 of the LRA provides that the following entities or persons are bound by a collective agreement:

* the parties to the agreement;
* each party to the agreement and the members of every other party to the agreement, in so far as the provisions are applicable to them;
* members of a registered trade union and employers who are members of a registered employers’ organisation that are party to the collective agreement if it regulates
** terms and conditions of employment; or
** the conduct of the employers in relation to their employees or the conduct of the employees in relation to their employer.
* employees who are not members of the registered trade union or unions party to the agreement, if
** the employees are identified in the agreement;
** the agreement expressly binds the employees; and
** the trade union or unions represent the majority of all the employees employed in the workplace.

A collective agreement binds for the whole period of the collective agreement every person bond in terms of section (1)(c) who was a member at the time it became binding, or who becomes a member after it became binding, whether or not that person continues to be a member of the registered trade union or registered employers’ organisation for the duration of the collective agreement.

===== Contracts of employment =====
Where applicable, a collective agreement varies any contract of employment between an employee and an employer if they are both bound by the collective agreement.&lt;ref&gt;s 23(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Termination =====
Unless the collective agreement provides otherwise, any party to a collective agreement that is concluded for an indefinite period may terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice in writing to the other parties.

=== Workplace fora ===
To encourage workers’ participation in the workplace, the concept of a "workplace forum" has been introduced by the LRA. A workplace forum is an in-house institution promoting workers’ participation in decision making at the workplace. Workplace fora are intended to deal with non-wage-related issues such as restructuring, introduction of new technology, new work methods, and the like.

It is important not to confuse a trade union and a workplace forum, as the latter is not a bargaining structure:

* A union is a juristic body; a forum is not.
* A union deals with wage-related issues; a forum deals with non-wage-related issues.
* A union can embark on industrial action; a forum cannot.

All employees, including non-union members, may be members of a forum. Senior managerial employees, however, may not be members of a forum. Only registered trade unions or trade unions acting jointly, representing the majority of all employees employed in the workplace, may apply for the establishment of a forum.

A forum may be established in any workplace of employers with more than 100 employees, either through a collective agreement or through the intervention of the CCMA. Only larger employers, therefore, will be involved in fora.

A forum must meet regularly. Its functions are to consult on certain matters and to have joint decision making on other matters.

==== Consultation ====
Consultation entails that the employer

* allows the forum to make representations and to advance alternative proposals; and
* considers and responds to these. If the employer disagrees with them, it must state the reasons for disagreeing.

Consultation must take place before the employer implements any proposal.&lt;ref name="s 841"&gt;s 84(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Joint decision making ====
Joint decision making requires the employer to consult and reach consensus with a forum.

==== Matters for consultation ====
Matters for consultation include (unless they are regulated by a collective agreement) proposals relating to

* restructuring the workplace (for example, the introduction of new technology and new work methods);
* changes in the organisation of work;
* total or partial plant closure;
* mergers and transfers of ownership in so far as they affect the employees;
* the retrenchment of employees;
* exemption from any collective agreement or law;
* job grading;
* criteria for merit increases or the payment of discretionary bonuses;
* education and training;
* product development plans; and
* export promotion.&lt;ref name="s 841"/&gt;

A bargaining council or a representative union and an employer may conclude a collective agreement granting a forum the right to be consulted about additional matters that fall within the council’s registered scope.&lt;ref&gt;s 84(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Matters for joint decision making ====
Matters for joint decision making cannot be regulated by a collective agreement. Matters for joint decision making relate to

* disciplinary codes and procedures;
* the proper regulation of the workplace (except for work-related performance);
* measures designed to protect and advance persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination; and
* changes by employer-representatives on boards of employer-controlled schemes with regard to social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;s 86(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative union and the employer may also enter into a collective agreement conferring on the forum joint decision making in respect of additional matters or removing other matters.&lt;ref name="s 841"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fulfilling its duties to consult and to have joint decision making, an employer is required to disclose all relevant information that will allow the forum to participate effectively in consultation and joint decision making. The employer is not obliged to disclose information, however,

* that is legally privileged;
* that the employer may not disclose without contravening a law or court order,
* that is confidential and, if disclosed, may cause substantial harm to the employee or the employer; and
* private personal information relating to an employee (unless the employee has consented to the disclosure).&lt;ref&gt;s 89(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes about disclosure of information must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. If parties fail to resolve the dispute through conciliation, any party to the dispute may request arbitration.

The Commissioner will not compel the employer to disclose "irrelevant" information.

Despite the potentially important influence that a forum may have on a workplace, few such forums are found in practice. This is due to employers' viewing fora as an inroad to managerial prerogative, and the concern of unions that fora will undermine collective bargaining structures.&lt;ref&gt;Van Niekerk 362-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial action ===
At the end of a collective-bargaining session or process, parties may either reach an agreement or fail to do so. If an agreement is reached, a collective agreement is concluded. If no agreement is reached, parties may agree on mediation or arbitration, or decide to exert pressure on each other through industrial action.

Industrial action, sometimes also called collective action, generally refers to employees acting together to force the hand of the employer, but employers, too, for the purposes of industrial action, employers may act individually or collectively with other employers to lock out employees. Industrial action for employees can take the form of strikes, secondary strikes, pickets and protest action, while employers have recourse to lock-outs.

Strikes and lock-outs are a reality in the workplace—"just like friction in a marriage is a reality."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 160"/&gt; Conflict in the workplace—"and in a marriage"&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 160"/&gt;—is not necessarily negative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It gives the parties an opportunity to reaffirm their different bargaining strengths and positions. Conflict becomes problematic only if matters get out of hand as a result of the power struggle. That will then undermine the purpose of the conflict.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Another problematic aspect of conflict is that once parties are in a stand-off, the matter will not be resolved without a "loser" and a "winner". In the long run, this may lead to a deterioration of the relationship and it may even spark further friction about other issues.&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 160"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the workplace, again "just like in a marriage," the law seeks "to ensure healthy and productive conflict that can lead to the resolution of matters of mutual interest."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 160"/&gt; The LRA sets out the manner in which this is to be done by regulating various types of industrial action.

In the past few years, South Africa has seen a high level of industrial action. The Department of Labour has reported that working days lost to work stoppages in 2010 were the highest ever, with approximately 20,674,737 working days lost from about 74 work stoppages; in 2009, there were only 51.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Labour ''[http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/report/2010/revised.pdf Annual Report, Industrial Action Report]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' (2010) 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to strike is clearly protected in South Africa through the Constitution, which guarantees that "every worker has the right [...] to strike."&lt;ref&gt;23(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution does not give employers the right to lock out employees.&lt;ref&gt;Section 27(5) of the Interim Constitution, 1993, included the right of employers to have "recourse to a lock-out," but this right was not included in the final Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; Employers’ right to lock-out is implied in the Constitution’s express protection of the right to bargain collectively.&lt;ref name="s 235"/&gt; The LRA provides, however, in section 64(1), that every employee has the right to strike, and that every employer has recourse to a lock-out.

Neither the right to strike nor the right to a lock-out is directly protected in terms of an ILO Convention, but it is indirectly done through ILO Convention 87 and ILO Convention 98, which were both ratified by South Africa.

Both strikes and lock-outs are essential elements of collective bargaining, but "such rights should be used only as measures of last resort."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 181"&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes are used by employees to back up their demands in promoting and defending their employment-related interests; lock-outs are used by employers to back up their employment-related demands.

In matters of industrial action, "it is important to know what type of action to take."&lt;ref name="Dekker p. 181"/&gt; Different types of industrial action serve different purposes. The purpose of the employer or the employees will determine the type of action to be taken:

* A strike is undertaken to remedy a grievance or resolve any matter of mutual interest between employees and employers.
* A secondary strike is a strike in support of another strike (known as the primary strike) in order to put pressure on the primary employer to accede to the demands of its striking employees.
* A picket is a peaceful demonstration of support for any protected strike, or of opposition to any lock-out.
* Protest action is undertaken to promote or defend the socioeconomic interests of workers.
* A lock-out is undertaken by an employer to compel its employees to accept a demand in respect of any matter of mutual interest between them.

Not only is it important to ensure that the right type of action is chosen; it is important "also to ensure that the action will be protected by the LRA."&lt;ref&gt;McGregor and Dekker ''Labour Law Rules!'' p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a protected strike or lock-out—it used to be called a "legal" strike or lock-out under the 1956 LRA—the parties taking part in the action are not guilty of breach of contract and cannot be dismissed for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;An exception exists in cases of misconduct committed during strike action, and if, as a result of the prolonged industrial action, the employer suffers economically and needs to dismiss employees based on the operational requirements of the business.&lt;/ref&gt; The court may not order an interdict to stop the action from continuing, and the participants in the industrial action will not be held liable for compensation for the work stoppage.

==== Hurdles in the way of protected industrial action ====
No right is unlimited. Rights may be limited in the interests of society or by the rights of others. Section 36(1) of the Constitution provides for the limitation of rights in terms of law of general application. The LRA is such a law. It limits the right to strike.

Strikes and lock-outs are not automatically protected, as there are some hurdles that employees and employers have to cross before their actions will be protected:

# To cross the first hurdle, the parties should ensure that their action complies with the definition of a strike or a lock-out. They must therefore avoid the inherent limitations in the definitions of both strikes and lock-outs.
# To cross the second hurdle, the parties should comply with the procedure prescribed by the LRA in section 64. In certain limited circumstances, employers and employees will be exempted from complying with these procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Section 64(3) provides for circumstances in which there is no need to comply with the procedural requirements.&lt;/ref&gt;
# To cross the third hurdle, the parties should ensure that none of the prohibitions against industrial action, as contained in section 65 of the LRA, are applicable to their issue in dispute. The parties will be able to continue with collective action only if the nature of the particular dispute between the parties allows it. For example, employees may go on strike only if the dispute is one of "interest," meaning a dispute about a change to an existing right or about creating a new right. Employees may not strike about a dispute of "right," which would be a dispute about the application and interpretation of an existing right, since these must be referred to arbitration. They are better suited to resolution by third-party determination than by industrial action.

===== Compliance with definition of "strike" or "lock-out" =====
It is important that the actions taken by employees and employers fall within the definitions of a strike or a lock-out. Action that does not amount to a strike or a lock-out will not enjoy protection in terms of the LRA. This is the first hurdle to be crossed by employees and unions for a protected strike, and by employers for a protected lock-out. This hurdle stands on two legs:

# definition of a strike; and
# definition of a lock-out.

====== Definition of a strike ======
"Strike" is defined as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the partial or complete concerted refusal to work, or the retardation or obstruction of work, by persons who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers, for the purposes of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee and every reference to work in this definition includes overtime work, whether it is voluntary or compulsory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Except for "protest action," any intentional refusal to work will amount to misconduct unless it can be regarded as strike action in terms of the above definition. In order to qualify as strike action, the employees must comply with the following three elements contained in the definition:&lt;ref&gt;See Maserumule P "A perspective on developments in strike law" (2001) 22 ''ILJ'' 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

# there must be a refusal to work (a complete or partial retardation or obstruction of work);
# the refusal must be a concerted action by persons (employed by the same or different employers); and
# the refusal must be for the purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between an employer and an employee.

There must be a refusal to work in order for an action to qualify as a strike. This is the first hurdle that employees must cross. The refusal to work must be

* in relation to work which employees are contractually obliged to perform; and
* not contrary to the law or a collective agreement.

The action may be partial (in that the employees still perform some of their duties),&lt;ref&gt;Examples of partial strikes are "work-to-rule" and "go-slows."&lt;/ref&gt; or complete (in that the employees do not perform any of their duties), or the retardation of work (where employees work, but at a reduced pace), or obstruction of work (where employees disturb production through their actions). A refusal by employees to work overtime also constitutes a strike, whether the overtime is compulsory (required by a contract or by a collective agreement) or voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;This is also called an overtime ban.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ford Motor]] Co. of SA (Pty) Ltd v National Union of Metalworkers'' (2008) 29 ''ILJ'' 667 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constitution grants individual workers the right to strike,&lt;ref name="s 232c"/&gt; the right itself cannot be exercised individually. The action must be

* "concerted;"
* "by persons;" and
* constitute collective action.

An individual employee cannot engage in a strike. More than one person must be involved in order for the action to constitute a strike. The action must be carried out by people acting together who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers (as in the case of an industry-wide strike). The action is thus directed at the employer or employers. If, for example, employees refuse to work because they have a demand against a union, that will not amount to strike action.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mzeku &amp; others v Volkswagen SA]]'' (2001) 22 IL) 771 (CCMA).&lt;/ref&gt; An exception exists in respect of secondary strikes.

The refusal to work must be for the common purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between the employer and employee. A grievance or an issue in dispute in respect of a matter of mutual interest must exist, therefore, before an action may be deemed a strike. Where there is no grievance or dispute against the employer, there cannot be a strike.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Simba (Pty) Ltd v FAWU &amp; others]]'' (1998) 19 lU 1593 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of "mutual interest" is not defined in the LRA, it was described as "whatever can be fairly and reasonably regarded as calculated to promote the well-being of the trade concerned."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rand Tyre and Accessories (Pty) Ltd &amp; Appel v Industrial Council for the Motor Industry (Transvaal), Minister of Labour, and Minister for Justice]]'' (1941) TPD 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Mischke C "What are 'matters of mutual interest'?" (2001) ''CLL'' 10(9) 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters of mutual interest may include, for example,

* terms and conditions of employment;
* health and safety issues;
* the negotiation of disciplinary procedures; and
* wage increases.

An important indication that a matter is one of mutual interest would be that the matter can be dealt with through collective bargaining. For example, political issues or demands against the State do not qualify, unless the State is the employer and the demands relate to the State’s role as employer. These political issues or demands should be dealt with by way of protest action.

====== Definition of a lock-out ======
While employees have the right to strike in terms of the Constitution and the LRA, employers do not have a right to lock-out, but they do have recourse to a lock-out in terms of section 64 of the LRA.

"Lock-out" is defined as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the exclusion by an employer of employees from the employer’s workplace, for the purpose of compelling the employees to accept a demand in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee, whether or not the employer breaches those employees’ contracts of employment in the course of or for the purpose of that exclusion.&lt;ref name="Section 213"&gt;Section 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To constitute a lock-out, the employer’s action must contain the following two elements:

# The employer must exclude employees from the workplace. This normally happens when the employer closes the workplace entrance or gates and refuses to permit employees to enter the premises. In practice, this allows the employer to refuse to pay the employees their remuneration. This is in line with the LRA,&lt;ref&gt;s 67(3).&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the employer is not obliged to remunerate an employee for services not rendered during a protected strike or a protected lock-out. Put differently, the principle of "no work, no pay" applies. In terms of the definition of a lock-out, the employer cannot exclude only one employee; it must be a group of employees.
# The exclusion must be for the purpose of compelling the employees to accept a demand in any matter of mutual interest between employer and employees. If it is for a different purpose, the action will not constitute a lock-out and will be breach of contract. "Matters of mutual interest" with regard to strikes are also "matters of mutual interest" in the case of lock-outs.

===== Procedural requirements for protection of strikes and lock-outs in terms of section 64 =====
The second hurdle to be crossed in order for a strike or lock-out to be regarded as protected is that certain procedural requirements must be complied with. This hurdle stands on the three legs prescribed by section 64(1):

# the issue in dispute must be referred to the CCMA (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration) for conciliation;&lt;ref&gt;s 64(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
# the CCMA must have issued a certificate to verify that the dispute has not yet been resolved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# A written notice must be handed to the employer, employees or trade union at least 48 business hours prior to the commencement of the strike or lock-out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====== The issue in dispute ======
The LRA defines an "issue in dispute" as "the demand, the grievance, or the dispute that forms the subject matter of the strike or lock-out."&lt;ref name="s 213"/&gt; The issue in dispute must fall within the definition of a strike (or lock-out). In other words, the demand, grievance or dispute about which the employees strike (or the employer locks out) must relate to a matter of mutual interest.

The LRA requires that parties must try to resolve the issue. It requires that the parties first refer the dispute to a bargaining council (if there is one for that sector). If no bargaining council exists, the dispute must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation.

====== Certificate of outcome ======
The bargaining council or the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration must attempt to resolve the dispute through conciliation within thirty days of the referral. If the parties to the dispute reach an agreement, the dispute is resolved. If no agreement is reached, the conciliator must issue a certificate to indicate that the matter has not been resolved. After this (or after thirty days have gone by since referral of the dispute for conciliation), the parties can give notice of the proposed strike (or lock-out).&lt;ref&gt;s 64(1)(a)(i)-(ii).&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Prescribed notice ======
If conciliation fails, or thirty days have passed since the referral of the dispute,&lt;ref&gt;s 64(1)(b)-(c).&lt;/ref&gt; at least 48 hours’ written notice must be given of the commencement of the strike or lock-out. If the State is the employer, at least seven days’ notice must be given. If the employer is a member of an employers’ organisation, notice must be given to the employers’ organisation.

In case of a proposed lock-out, the employer must give notice to the union involved in the dispute, or to the employees directly if there is no union.

The LRA does not prescribe what details the notice must contain; it only regulates that it must be in writing and must be issued 48 hours before commencement of the industrial action.&lt;ref&gt;''[[SA Airways (Pty) Ltd v SA Transport Allied Workers Union]]'' (2010) ILl 1219 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some exceptions, according to which, the parties do not need to follow the procedures prescribed by the LRA:

* if the parties to the dispute are members of a bargaining council and the dispute followed the procedure set by that council’s constitution;&lt;ref&gt;s 64(3)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
* if the parties concluded a collective agreement with prescribed procedures to be followed before they strike or lock-out, and they have complied with that agreement,&lt;ref&gt;s 64(3)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Columbus Joint Venture t/a Columbus Stainless Steel v NUMSA]]'' [1997] 10 BLLR 1292 (LC).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[County Fair Foods (Pty) Ltd v Food &amp; Allied Workers Union &amp; others]]'' (2001) 22 ''ILJ'' 1103 (LAC).&lt;/ref&gt;
* if an employer implements an unprotected lock-out and the employees strike in response to that (and the same would apply if the employer locked-out the employees in response to an unprotected strike);&lt;ref&gt;s 64(3)(c)-(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
* if a strike takes place after the employer has unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of employment, and the employer fails to rectify this despite prior warning;&lt;ref&gt;s 64(3)(e).&lt;/ref&gt; and
* if an employer refuses to bargain with a union, in which case the dispute must first be referred for conciliation and then for advisory arbitration before notice of a strike can be given.

A '''stamp act''' is any legislation that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents. Those who pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents, making them legal documents. A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including [[playing cards]], [[dice]], [[patent medicine]]s, [[cheque]]s, [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[contract]]s, [[marriage license]]s and [[newspaper]]s. The items often have to be [[Impressed duty stamp|physically stamped]] at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of [[Revenue stamp|adhesive stamps]] are more practical and common.

This system of taxation was first devised in the [[Netherlands]] in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax.&lt;ref name=dagnall&gt;[[Harry Dagnall|Dagnall, H.]] (1994) ''Creating a Good Impression: three hundred years of The Stamp Office and stamp duties.'' London: HMSO, p. 100. {{ISBN|0116414189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp acts have been enforced in many countries, including Australia, Canada, People's Republic of China, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

The taxes raised under a stamp act are called [[stamp duty]].

==Australia==

Stamps acts were enacted in various [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] in 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, and 1894, with amendments from 1892 to 1907.&lt;ref name=YearBook1908&gt;{{cite book | title = Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia, Containing Authoritative Statistics for the period 1901-1907 and Corrected Statistics for the period 1788 to 1900 | volume = No. 1.-1908 | year = 1908 | author = Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, Melbourne | publisher = McCarron, Bird &amp; Co. | location = Melbourne, Australia | pages = 675-676 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fxF0dz0su4cC&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these acts, stamps were required on many types of business transactions: [[negotiable instrument]]s, [[promissory note]]s, [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], and [[receipt]]s.&lt;ref name=YearBook1908 /&gt;

In [[Western Australia]], duties of this type were overhauled in the Western Australian Stamp Act 1921, which took effect on 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blog.thomsonreuters.com.au/2010/05/changes-to-the-western-australian-stamp-act-1921/ | title = Changes to the Western Australian Stamp Act 1921 | first = Janina | last = Leuii | date = 19 May 2010 | work = Insider | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters]] | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Australia]], the Stamp Duties Act 1923 was first enacted in 1923, then revised or amended almost yearly until its current version of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/STAMP%20DUTIES%20ACT%201923/CURRENT/1923.1569.UN.PDF | format = PDF | title = Stamp Duties Act 1923 | date = 15 March 2017 | publisher = Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and United Kingdom Stamp Acts==

===Stamps Act 1694===
A [[stamp duty]] was first introduced in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as ''An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on [[Vellum]], Parchment and Paper for 10 years, towards carrying on the war against [[France]]'' (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=David Lee|title=The American Revolution in the Southern Colonies|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7864-0783-5|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duty ranged between 1 penny to several [[shilling]]s on a number of different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, grants of honour, grants of probate and letters of administration. It raised around £50,000 a year and although it was initially a temporary measure, it proved so successful that its use was continued.

===Stamp Act 1712===
{{Main|Stamp Act 1712}}

The [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act of 1712]] was an act passed in the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 August 1712 to create a new tax on publishers, particularly of newspapers.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1916"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 456958 | title = Swift and the Stamp Act of 1712 | first = Joseph M. | last = Thomas | journal = PMLA   | publisher = Modern Language Association | volume = 31 | number = 2 | year = 1916 | pages = 247–263 | doi = 10.2307/456958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511895890&amp;cid=CBO9780511895890A016 | chapter = 7 - The Stamp Act of 1712 | title = Robert Harley and the Press:  Propaganda and Public Opinion in the Age of Swift and Defoe | first = J.

The stamp tax was a tax on each newspaper and thus hit cheaper papers and popular readership harder than wealthy consumers, because it formed a higher proportion of the purchase price. The act had a [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on publishers; the tax is blamed for the decline of English literature critical of the government during the period, notably with ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' ending the same year of the tax's enactment.&lt;ref name="Justice2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=George | last = Justice|title=The Manufacturers of Literature: Writing and the Literary Marketplace in Eighteenth-Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYiuo_4F9MC|accessdate=10 December 2012|year=2002|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-750-7|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its repeal in 1855 allowed a cheap press again.

=== Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 and Stamp Act 1891===
All the above Acts were superseded by the Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 and the Stamp Act 1891, which still constitute the bulk of UK law on stamp duties today.

===The modern UK Stamp Act===
From 1914 to 1928, the Director of Stamping at the [[Stamp Office]] oversaw the production of ''Treasury Notes'' (a type of banknote, not to be confused with [[Treasury security#Treasury note|US Treasury notes]]). These were issued for denominations of £1 and 10's to enable coins to be removed from circulation and were not convertible to gold. Existing Bank of England banknotes in higher denominations continued to circulate alongside the Treasury Notes. In 1963 production of postage stamps passed to the [[General Post Office]].

The [[Finance Act 1986]] introduced [[Stamp duty#Stamp Duty Reserve Tax|Stamp Duty Reserve Tax]]. From October 27, 1986, the charge was imposed on 'closing' transactions at the [[London Stock Exchange]] which until then had been transactions where no document was used and therefore exempt from Stamp Duty.

A public display of Stamp Office [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s and records was held at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in 1994 to commemorate the three hundredth anniversary of the introduction of UK Stamp Duty. The Stamp Office was also awarded the [[Charter Mark]] by [[John Major]]'s Advisory Committee as a reward for its public service.

Stamp duties are the oldest taxes still raised by the [[HM Revenue and Customs]].

As part of domestic taxation, the PRC includes a stamp tax as one of the "behavioural taxes". Foreign investors are also subject to a stamp tax. Stamp taxes in China are governed by "Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning Stamp Tax Detailed Rules for Its Implementation", implemented in 1988. In 1997, stamp taxes produced revenue of 26.63 billion [[Renminbi|yuan]] and comprised 3.6% of China's [[gross domestic product]].

===Stamp Act 1765===
{{Main|Stamp Act 1765}}
After Great Britain was victorious over France in the [[Seven Years' War]] – which manifested in America as the [[French and Indian War]] – a small Stamp Act was enacted that covered of all sorts of documents. The [[Stamp Act 1765]] (short title ''Duties in American Colonies Act 1765''; 5 George III, c. 12) was a [[direct tax]] imposed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] on the colonies of [[British America]]. The act required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on [[stamped paper]] produced in London and carrying an embossed [[revenue stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan and Morgan (1995), pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Stamp Act of 1765 - A Serendipitous Find | first = Hermann | last = Ivester | journal = The Revenue Journal | publisher = The [[Revenue Society]] | volume = XX | issue = 3 | date = December 2009 | pages = 87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; These printed materials were on every legal document, magazine, and newspaper, plus many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, including playing cards.&lt;ref name=Williamsburg&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.org/history/teaching/tchcrsta.cfm | title = A Summary of the 1765 Stamp Act | work = Education | publisher = The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation  | date = | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. 

The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America. The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and the colonial population should pay at least a portion of the expense. The colonists claimed their constitutional rights were violated since only their own colonial legislatures could levy taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Edmund S. |last1 = Morgan | first2 = Helen M. | last2 = Morgan | title = The Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution | year = 1995 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | asin = B01FGOQCC4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent. Some opponents of the Stamp Act distinguished between "internal" taxes like the stamp duty, which they claimed Parliament had no right to impose, and revenue legitimately raised through the regulation on trade.&lt;ref name=Williamsburg /&gt; In general, however, most colonists considered the Act to be a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent – consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant because Americans were unrepresented in Parliament. The rallying cry of "[[No Taxation without Representation]]" reflected an increasingly major grievance that led to the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=ThisDay&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/parliament-repeals-the-stamp-act | title = This Day in History: March 18, 1766 – Parliament repeals the Stamp Act | work = [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]] | publisher = A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC | date = | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans saw no need for the troops or the taxes; the British saw colonial defiance of their lawful rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gordon S. | last = Wood | title = The American Revolution: A History | publisher = Modern Library | year = 2002 | page = 24 | asin = B01K2REAH4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests. Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence – the so-called "[[Committees of Correspondence]] – that created a loose coalition extending from New England to Georgia. British goods were [[boycotted]].&lt;ref name=ThisDay /&gt;&lt;ref name=PennState&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engr.psu.edu/mtah/timelines/timeline3.htm | title = Colonial American Timeline | work = Building Community: Medieval Technology and American History | first = Brigitte | last = Weinsteiger | publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]], Center for Medieval Studies | date = | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the tax also took the form of violence and intimidation. [[Custom house]]s and [[tax collectors]] were attacked.&lt;ref name=ThisDay /&gt; Protests and demonstrations initiated by the newly formed [[Sons of Liberty]] often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved. A word used frequently by colonists was "liberty" during the Stamp Act upheaval. Opponents of the new tax staged mock funerals in which "liberty's" coffin was carried to a burial ground. They insisted that liberty could not be "taken away without consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Eric | last = Foner | title = Give Me Liberty! An American History, Volume One | edition = Second | year = 2008 | pages = 176, 178 | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | asin = B011DC94BO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more reasoned approach was taken by some elements. [[James Otis, Jr.]] wrote the most influential protest, ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved''. Otis, the radical leader in Massachusetts, convinced the Massachusetts assembly to send a circular letter to the other colonies, which called for an inter-colonial meeting to plan tempered resistance. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] convened in New York City on October 7, 1765, with nine colonies in attendance; others would likely have participated if earlier notice had been provided. The [[Stamp Act Congress]] was another step in the process of attempted common problem-solving. The [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 had been held at the urging of royal officials as a forum for voicing constitutional concerns and afforded the more conservative critics of British policy some hope of regaining control of events from the unruly mobs in the streets of many cities; in contrast, the Stamp Act Congress was strictly a colonial affair, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure. Delegates to the Stamp Act Congress approved a fourteen-point ''Declaration of Rights and Grievances'' as a petition to the Parliament and the [[George III of the United Kingdom|King]], formulated largely by [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]] of Pennsylvania. The statement echoed the recent resolves of the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], which argued that colonial taxation could only be carried on by their own assemblies.&lt;ref name=Williamsburg /&gt; The delegates singled out the Stamp Act and the use of the vice-admiralty courts for special criticism, yet ended their statement with a pledge of loyalty to the King.

Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies. In Canada, Nova Scotia largely ignored the Act; they allowed ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Wilfred B. | last = Kerr | title = The Stamp Act in Nova Scotia | journal = New England Quarterly | date = September 1933 | volume = 6 | number = 3 | pages = 552–566 | jstor = 359557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] experienced some protests and petitions based on legislation dating back to the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anspach|first=Lewis Amadeus|title=A History of the Island of Newfoundland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nb4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=192|publisher=self-published|year=1819|location=London|oclc=1654202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caribbean colonies also protested.  Political opposition was expressed in a number of colonies, including [[Barbados]] and [[Antigua]], and by absentee landowners living in Britain.  The worst violence took place on [[St. Kitts]] and [[Nevis]], with rioting and blockage of stamp delivery.  [[Montserrat]] and Antigua also succeeded in avoiding the use of stamps. In [[Jamaica]] there was also vocal opposition, and much evasion of the stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Andrew J. | last = O'Shaughnessy | title = The Stamp Act Crisis in the British Caribbean | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | date = Apr 1994 | volume = 51 | number = 2 | pages = 203–26 | jstor = 2946860}}&lt;/ref&gt; British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial boycotts, also pressured Parliament.

The act was repealed in early 1766, although the [[Declaratory Act]] maintained Parliament's right to tax the colonies.&lt;ref name=ThisDay /&gt;

===Revival===
{{Main|Revenue stamps of the United States}}

"Revenue stamps" were revived in the United States during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1862, the United States (Union) government began taxing a variety of goods, services, and legal dealings, in an effort to raise revenue for the great costs of the war.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum-Washington&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2047019 | title = 5000-dollar Washington | work = Arago: People, Postage &amp; the Post | publisher = Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]] | date = | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To confirm that taxes were paid a "revenue stamp" was purchased and appropriately affixed to the taxable item.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum-Washington /&gt; This excise tax continued until the federal government finished paying the war debt in 1883, at which time the tax was repealed.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum-Washington /&gt;

In 1898, revenue stamps were again issued, to provide funding for the [[Spanish–American War]]. Tax was levied on a wide range of goods and services including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions such as [[stock certificates]], [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], [[Manifest (transportation)|manifests]], and [[marine insurance]]. To pay these tax duties revenue tax stamps were purchased and affixed to the taxable item or respective certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garbade | first = Kenneth D. | year = 2012 | title = Birth of a Market: The U.S. Treasury Securities Market From the Great War to the Great Depression | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue stamps were issued at irregular intervals for alcohol products, tobacco products, matches, proprietary medicines, and perfumes.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum-General&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arago.si.edu/record_73270_img_1.html | title = General Issues | work = Arago: People, Postage &amp; the Post | publisher = Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]] | date = | access-date = 12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11497">In [[United States|American]] [[jurisprudence]], a '''suspect classification''' is any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] claim alleging [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.

== Federal classifications ==
[[Strict scrutiny]] is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a "suspect classification." The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.&lt;ref name="Wintemute"&gt;Wintemute, Robert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFhzZiPF2YC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22criteria+for+identifying+suspect+classifications%22&amp;ei=rbVkS72tA5X6Ndm15dcN&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22criteria%20for%20identifying%20suspect%20classifications%22&amp;f=false Sexual Orientation and Human Rights]'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the criteria that have been cited include:
* The group has historically been discriminated against or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Wintemute" /&gt;
* They possess an [[wikt:immutable|immutable]]&lt;ref name="Lyng"&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=477&amp;invol=635 Lyng v. Castillo]'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or highly visible trait.
* They are powerless&lt;ref name="Lyng" /&gt; to protect themselves via the political process. (The group is a "discrete" and "insular" minority.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[US v. Carolene Products Co.#Text of Footnote Four|U.S. v. Carolene Products]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]] 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspect class ===
The Supreme Court  established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 320 U.S. 81 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Hirabayashi v. United States |vol=320 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 81|court= United States Supreme Court=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', 323 U.S. 214 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Korematsu v. United States|vol=323 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 214|court= United States Supreme Court=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court recognizes [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[national origin]], [[religion]] and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under [[strict scrutiny]].

In ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in its Findings of Fact commented  that [[sexual orientation]] could be considered a suspect class but, on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Perry v. Schwarzenegger|vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint=122 |court=United States District Court for the Northern District of California|date=2010-08-05|url=http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2010/08/04/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL.pdf|quote= The trial record shows that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review to apply to legislative classifications based on sexual orientation. All classifications based on sexual orientation appear suspect, as the evidence shows that California would rarely, if ever, have a reason to categorize individuals based on their sexual orientation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska]] held the same in ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 368 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D.Neb. 2005)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235759/http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was reversed on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213233153/http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf |date=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such. 

==== Alienage ====
[[Alienage]], or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of [[U.S. state|state]] law, [[alien (law)|legal aliens]] are a suspect class (''[[Graham v. Richardson]]'', 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the [[United States Congress]] has the power to regulate [[immigration]], [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive [[rational basis scrutiny]]. State acts that affect [[alien (law)|unlawful immigrants]] are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', 457 U.S. 202 (1982).

=== Quasi-suspect class ===
[[Intermediate scrutiny]] is applied to groups that fall under a "quasi-suspect classification." Gender&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan|Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan]]'', 458 U.S. 718 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy of birth]] have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for 
Northern California]] discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management'', C 10-00257 (N.D. Cal. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Striking down Section 3 of [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] as unconstitutional in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'' (2012), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit Court of Appeals]] held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1afe4f62-fbf9-4e0d-a409-26ab7396971e/1/doc/12-2335_complete_opn.pdf ''Windsor v. United States''], 12-2335-cv(L), October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=David|title=The End of an Unjust Law: The Second Circuit Strikes Down DOMA and Sets the Stage for Supreme Court Review|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/22/the-end-of-an-unjust-law|publisher=Justia|date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court however has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class.

=== All others ===

[[Rational basis review|Rational basis scrutiny]] is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria—''e.g.'', [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.

== Levels of judicial review ==

=== Strict scrutiny ===
To satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest.

The practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], skin [[color]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], or [[Nationality|national]] origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with [[national security]], defense, or [[affirmative action]]. ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', regarding Japanese internment, and ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test.

Strict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any [[fundamental right]], regardless of the group involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Souter, David|first=US Supreme Court Justice|title=Vacco v. Quill - 521 U.S. 793 (1997)|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/793/case|work=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate scrutiny ===
When [[intermediate scrutiny]] is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes.

=== Rational basis ===
When [[rational basis review]] is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.

== Classifications under state law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] holdings impose a minimum standard to which each [[U.S. state|State]] must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the [[Supreme Court of California]] used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a [[California]] statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages.

[[California]] classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. [[Connecticut]] and [[Iowa]] classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Chuck, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IwNhIK9Fn1sC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+and+suspect+class&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qvlLLVJ3VE&amp;sig=LpvcmKqGjXX4N4YyC-YdTxy4GwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OmZmSqLcEJGKMpDG7aEB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Homosexuality and the Law: A Dictionary]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Intercept''''' &lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; ({{lang-ru|Перехват|Perehvat}}, loose direct translation is "''to nab''"&lt;ref name="cs" /&gt;) was a popular 1997 [[Russia]]n [[TV show]], the concept of which was for the contestant to "steal" (actually, be given the keys to) a car and avoid the police for 35 minutes. If the contestant successfully avoided the police, he won the car. The car chase was done in the real [[Moscow]] streets, and had to obey traffic laws.&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1998/0130/013098.intl.intl.3.html|title=Russian TV Viewers Cry, 'Go, Thief'|date=30 January 1998|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the show had 60 million viewers per episode.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borderherald.com/popular-russian-tv-game-show-intercept-may-making-comeback/|title=borderherald.com|website=www.borderherald.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115193705/http://www.borderherald.com/popular-russian-tv-game-show-intercept-may-making-comeback/|archive-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was created with the cooperation of the Russian police, and the police chasing the "thief" were real officers. With the odds being tilted against the "thieves", the show had the aim of discouraging car thieves. The show failed to lower the sky-high car theft rates, and was therefore cancelled.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

The '''Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo''' was a territorial and dynastic [[treaty]] between the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. Signed on 1 June 1773, it transferred control of ducal [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the [[County of Oldenburg]] and adjacent lands within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The treaty reduced the fragmentation of Danish territory and led to an alliance—The Eternal Alliance ({{lang-da|Den Evige Alliance}})&lt;ref&gt;Feldbæk, Ole (1998): ''Nædhed og adskillelse 1720–1814'', pp. 320 and 325&lt;/ref&gt;—between Denmark and Russia that lasted into the [[Napoleonic Wars]], effectively ending in 1809, when Russian diplomats suggested to Sweden that Norway be a possible compensation for [[Finland]].

==Historical background==

===Oldenburg and Delmenhorst===
In 1448 the Count of [[County of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] was elected [[King of Denmark]] and took the throne as [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]]. He assigned Oldenburg to his brother, [[Gerhard VI, Count of Oldenburg|Gerhard]], in 1454, and that brother's descendants in the [[House of Oldenburg]] continued to rule the county for the next two centuries. For supporting him in the [[Schmalkaldic War]], [[Emperor Charles V]] gave the Oldenburgers control of the town of [[Delmenhorst]], which adjoins Oldenburg on the left bank of the [[Weser]], in 1547. After [[Anthony Günther, Count of Oldenburg|Count Anthony Günther]] died childless in 1667, these territories began to be ruled by the kings of Denmark in [[personal union]].&lt;ref name="Oldenburg"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Oldenburg|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor-first=Hugh|editor-last=Chrisholm|edition=11th|year=1911|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/72/mode/2up|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schleswig-Holstein===
[[File:Map SLH-1650.png|thumb|Territorial borders in Schleswig-Holstein c.1650 (with royal holdings in orange and ducal holdings in yellow), showing the region's extreme fragmentation]]
In 1460, upon his election as [[Duke of Holstein]], King Christian I promulgated the [[Treaty of Ribe]], affirming that [[Schleswig]] (a Danish fief) and [[Holstein]] (part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) were to remain "forever undivided" in return for his recognition by the region's noble estates as the rightful ruler of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. From that time forward, Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein were ruled in personal union by the Danish kings for nearly a century. Then, in 1544 King [[Christian III of Denmark]] [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] the two duchies between himself and his two half-brothers, [[John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|John]] and [[Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Adolf]], in an unusual way that would shape Danish politics for centuries.&lt;ref name="Bohn"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert|last=Bohn|title=Geschichte Schleswig-Holsteins|publisher=[[C.H. Beck]]|location=[[Munich]]|year=2006|language=German|isbn=978-3-406-50891-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZP2w83nHz4C&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schleswig-Holstein's noble estates remained opposed to the actual division of the region, so the revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and [[estate (land)|landed estates]] to particular brothers. The piecemeal assignment of the estates left Holstein and Schleswig with a patchwork of political boundaries, inhibiting any future separation of the regions, as intended by the estates. The rule in the duchies thus became a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the king and the two dukes. Duke John died childless, and his share in the region was divided between his brothers' lines, but Duke Adolf's descendants in the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp]], who ruled not only the ducal share of Schleswig-Holstein but also the [[Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck]], became rivals to the Danish kings.&lt;ref name="Bohn" /&gt;

By the mid-17th century the so-called "Gottorp Question" of Holstein's relationship with the crown threatened the stability of the Danish kingdom, as the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp allied themselves with [[Sweden]] and other foreign powers against Denmark. During the minority of [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Duke Charles Frederick]], Schleswig-Holstein's government affairs were entrusted to Minister [[Georg Heinrich von Görtz]], who supported Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]]; in that war's aftermath, Denmark seized the duke's territory in Schleswig and ended Sweden's patronage of Holstein-Gottorp with the 1720 [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Northern Wars: War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe 1558–1721|first=Robert I.|last=Frost|publisher=Longman|year=2000|isbn=978-0-582-06429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke Charles Frederick, now only of Holstein-Gottorp, sought support for the recovery of Schleswig in [[Russia]], and in 1725 he married [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia|Tsarevna Anna]], the daughter of Tsar [[Peter the Great]] and sister of Tsarina [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In 1742 the childless Empress Elizabeth appointed her nephew, Charles Peter Ulrich (Charles Frederick and Anna's son), to be her successor in Russia. After her death in 1762, this Duke of Holstein ascended the throne as Tsar [[Peter III of Russia]]; Holstein was now ruled in personal union by the Emperor of Russia.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial Russian Foreign Policy|first=Hugh|last=Ragsdale|first2=V. N.|last2=Ponomarev|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1993|pages=56–58|isbn=9780521442299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwvllKkPQtYC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
Peter, now both Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and Russian Emperor, dispatched minister [[Caspar von Saldern]] to the Danish court to demand the recovery of his former ducal territory in Schleswig. At the time of Peter's accession Russia was already fighting in the [[Seven Years' War]], but he directed troops into [[Pomerania]] to threaten war against Denmark if Schleswig were not restored. The Danish government under [[Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff]] refused to relinquish Schleswig, and Russian and Danish troops faced off in [[Mecklenburg]]; but, on 9 July 1762, before fighting began or any agreement could be reached, Peter was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of General History, Ancient and Modern|first=Lord Alexander Fraser|last=Tytler Woodhouselee|authorlink=Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|pages=428–429|year=1823|publisher=H. Hill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp9FAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA428|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress Catherine reversed Russia's stance, withdrawing her husband's ultimatum and even entering an alliance with Denmark in 1765. She transferred the Duchy of Holstein to her minor son, Grand Duke Paul (later Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]]), and instructed her representative, von Saldern, to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Schleswig-Holstein conflict with his Danish counterpart, Foreign Minister [[Andreas Peter Bernstorff]]. The negotiators reached a provisional agreement in 1767.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale" /&gt;

Grand Duke Paul would renounce the [[House of Romanov]]'s claims in Schleswig-Holstein and transfer the ducal lands in Holstein to King [[Christian VII of Denmark]], ending the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp; in return Denmark would reaffirm its alliance with Russia, pay a sizable [[indemnity]], and give Paul control of the County of Oldenburg and other hereditary Oldenburg lands in the Holy Roman Empire. The agreement was accepted by Catherine in 1767; after he came of age, Grand Duke Paul ratified the treaty on 1 June 1773 at the Russian imperial family's residence in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], south of [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Ragsdale" /&gt; On 12 August Russia and Denmark signed a further treaty of alliance against Sweden, and the bargain was complete.&lt;ref name="Bernstorff"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Bernstorff, Andreas Peter|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor-first=Hugh |editor-last=Chrisholm|edition=11th|year=1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jw3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA806|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
[[File:HHR 1789 Oldenburg Holstein.png|thumb|The duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Oldenburg c.1789, showing the outcome of the treaty]]
The territorial exchange placed the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein under a single sovereign, the Danish King, and ended the political and dynastic conflicts that had divided the region since its partition two centuries earlier. The establishment of full, direct control over this strategically significant borderland strengthened Denmark's geopolitical position considerably and marked a major step toward Denmark's emergence as a centralized, [[unitary state]]. The treaty of alliance which shortly followed tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Danish involvement in the [[Theatre War]] of 1788–1789 and the [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808–09]].&lt;ref name="Bernstorff" /&gt;

On the Russian side, the exchange allowed Catherine to turn Denmark from an enemy into an ally, furthering [[Nikita Ivanovich Panin]]'s policy of building a [[Northern Accord]] to balance the power of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[France]];&lt;ref name="Ragsdale" /&gt; a stronger Denmark would also help to contain Sweden (Russia's chief rival in the [[Baltic Sea]] region). In 1774, Grand Duke Paul (at the urging of his mother) transferred the German lands obtained from the exchange to his great-uncle, [[Frederick August I, Duke of Oldenburg|Frederick August]], and in 1777 they were united within a newly declared [[Duchy of Oldenburg]]. The Duchy of Oldenburg would remain connected to the Russian Empire until its annexation by [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1810.&lt;ref name="Oldenburg" /&gt;

'''William R. Kasik''' (June 13, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 1986&lt;ref&gt;United States Social Security Death Index&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Wisconsin]] businessman and [[insurance agent]] who served one term as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] from the 19th [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legis.state.wi.us/LRB/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf Cannon, A. Peter, ed. ''Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848 – 1999''. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Kasik was born in [[Milwaukee]] on June 13, 1920, and attended [[Milwaukee Country Day School]] and [[Milwaukee University School]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], in 1942 and 1943. He was serving as vice-president of English Woolen Mills when he was elected to the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1956 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1956'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1956; p. 56]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative service ==
In 1954, Kasik was nominated to the Assembly from the 19th Milwaukee County district, which included the [[Milwaukee (town), Wisconsin|Town of Milwaukee]] (but not the City of [[Milwaukee]] itself), [[Bayside, Wisconsin|Bayside]], [[Fox Point, Wisconsin|Fox Point]], [[Glendale, Wisconsin|Glendale]], [[Granville, Wisconsin|Granville]], [[River Hills, Wisconsin|River Hills]], [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], and [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]]. Prior to [[redistricting]], most of the district had been represented by fellow Republican [[Arthur R. Godar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1954 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1954'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1954; p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated with only a plurality of votes in the Republican [[primary election|primary]] (2982 votes, to 2679 for [[Ervin Schneeberg]] and 613 for Henry Gefke); but had less trouble in the general election, defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Stanley Lieberman by 15,685 to 6778. He was assigned to the [[standing committee]]s on [[insurance]] and [[banking]], and on [[taxation]]; and to a [[special committee]] on Urban Development (which was studying issues of [[annexation]] of particular concern to his suburban district).&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1956 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1956'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1956; pp. 713, 753, 288-89, 300]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the sponsors of an unsuccessful bill for a statewide [[referendum]] in favor of a [[right-to-work law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UPI]]. "Right-to-work Bill's Backers Try New Tack" [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] ''[[Telegraph-Herald]]'' September 30, 1955; p. 10, col. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Kasik (described as a "conservative Republican") served as an [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] [[Delegate#Republican Party|delegate]] to the [[1956 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, William R. "Didn't Read Platform They Voted to Adopt; Wisconsin Delegates Voice No Worry Over Omission of Some of Their Pet Issues" ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' August 22, 1956; p. 6, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He ran for the Republican nomination for the 4th [[Wisconsin State Senate]] district, losing narrowly (8803 to 8903) to eventual winner [[Kirby Hendee]] in a three-way primary race&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1958 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1958'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1958; pp. 631, 671]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he carried the rest of the district, but lost by a hefty margin in Hendee's home village of Shorewood.&lt;ref&gt;Getter, Doyle K. "Hendee Win Is Feature in a State Senate Race" ''Milwaukee Journal'' September 12, 1956; p. 15, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Kasik was succeeded by fellow Republican [[Jerris Leonard]].

== After the Assembly ==
At a 1957 Milwaukee County Republican meeting, Kasik referred to the state's [[United States Senate|United States senators]] [[Alexander Wiley]] and [[Joe McCarthy]] (themselves both Republicans) as "the senior [and] the junior windbags from Wisconsin".&lt;ref&gt;"Vote Against Chiding Ike; County GOP Acts" ''Milwaukee Journal'' April 11, 1957; p. 28, col. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Kasik (now living in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] and working as an [[insurance agent]]&lt;ref&gt;"Kasik Will Run For Assembly" ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' May 22, 1964; pt. 2, p. 1, col. 8&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of three challengers to incumbent Assemblyman (and Assistant Majority Leader) [[J.
