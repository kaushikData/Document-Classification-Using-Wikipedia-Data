'''Abell 1835''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] in the [[Abell catalogue]]. It is a cluster that also [[gravitational lens]]es more-distant background [[galaxy|galaxies]] to make them visible to astronomers.  The cluster has a red shift of around 75,900&amp;nbsp;km/[[second|s]] and spans 12&amp;prime;.&lt;ref name="NED" /&gt;

In 2004, one of the galaxies lensed by this cluster was proposed to be the most distant galaxy known, [[Galaxy Abell 1835 IR1916]].

'''Ahrnsbrak Glacier''' is a [[glacier]] in the [[Enterprise Hills]] of the [[Heritage Range]] in [[Antarctica]], flowing north between [[Sutton Peak (Antarctica)|Sutton Peak]] and [[Shoemaker Peak]] to the confluent ice at the lower end of [[Union Glacier]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] from surveys and [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1961&amp;ndash;66, and was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for William F. Ahrnsbrak of the [[United States Antarctic Research Program]], a [[glaciologist]] at [[Palmer Station]] in 1965.

== Early life and education ==

Bowman grew up in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. She was influenced at an early age by the [[Gemini program]], and in 1969 she watched the [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 moon landings]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Bowman originally majored in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at university, gaining a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] from the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="MedicineSciences20174"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxraDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|title=Extending Science: NASA's Space Science Mission Extensions and the Senior Review Process|date=29 January 2017|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-44878-9|pages=76– |author=Committee on NASA Science Mission Extensions |author3=Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |author2=Space Studies Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

She first worked in the [[defense industry]] analyzing [[infrared]] detectors&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/employment/meet/bowman.asp|title=Meet Our Staff|website=www.jhuapl.edu|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developing [[anti-cancer drugs]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She entered the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] as an [[engineer]], intending to work on tracking incoming [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ballistic missiles]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A member of the principal professional staff at the APL, she is supervisor of the university's own Space Mission Operation Group and Mission Operations Manager (MOM) of the Mission Operations Centre on the ''New Horizons'' project.&lt;ref name="MedicineSciences20174"/&gt; This title is one, it has been suggested, that male personnel refer to traditionally as "Ops manager"; but Bowman, as "a physicist, space commander and parent, embraces the broader term" of MOM.&lt;ref name="Group2007"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Witherspoon |first=Roger |title=Rocket Science: Navigating through the Solar System |journal=US Black Engineer &amp; IT |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsYR13clarsC&amp;pg=PA25 |date=January–February 2007 |volume=30 |issue=4 |publisher=Career Communications Group |pages=25– |issn=1088-3444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman leads a team of approximately 40 people,&lt;ref name="MedicineSciences20174"/&gt; and personally assesses every piece of information the centre sends to the space crew before it dispatches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-women-who-power-nasa-s-new-horizons-mission-to-pluto|title=The Women who Power NASA’s New Horizons Mission to Pluto|last=Talbert|first=Tricia|date=2015-07-12|work=NASA|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days before the eventual [[New Horizons#Pluto system encounter|Pluto-encounter day]], that entailed over 20,000 commands.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4443006/Mission-to-Pluto--An-interview-with-New-Horizons--MOM-|title=Mission to Pluto: An interview with New Horizons' "MOM"|last=Taranovich|first=Steve|work=EDN|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has compared the levels of accuracy required to achieving a [[hole in one]] in [[golf]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Memberships ==

Bowman is a member of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] and the International SpaceOps Committee.&lt;ref name="MedicineSciences20174"/&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

Asteroid [[146040 Alicebowman]], discovered by [[Marc Buie]] at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in 2000, was named after her.&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid-Alicebowman" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 11 July 2018 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 110636}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

== Personal life ==

She is married with one son, and for leisure plays the [[clarinet]] and [[Bass (guitar)|bass]],&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; with a particular interest in [[bluegrass music]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Align-m has the ability to accomplish the following tasks:
* multiple sequence alignment,
* include extra information to guide the sequence alignment,
* multiple [[structural alignment]],
* [[homology modeling]] by (iteratively) combining sequence and structure alignment data,
* 'filtering' of [[BLAST]] or other pairwise alignments,
* combining many alignments into one [[consensus sequence]],
* multiple [[genome alignment]] (can cope with rearrangements).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''behavioral immune system''' is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist [[Mark Schaller]] to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing [[parasite]]s in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_2 |last=Schaller |first=M. |year=2006 |title=Parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages= 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sd2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Duncan, L.A. |title=Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition |editor=J.P. Forgas, M.G. Haselton &amp; W. von Hippel |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=293–307 |chapter=The behavioral immune system: Its evolution and social psychological implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0963721411402596 |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Park, J.H. |year=2011 |title=The behavioral immune system (and why it matters) |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of [[Acne scarring|pox]] or [[pustules]]), as well as [[stimulus–response]] systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of [[disgust]], automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaten |first=M. |author2=Stevenson, R.J. |author3=Case, T.I. |date=March 2009 |title=Disgust as a disease–avoidance mechanism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=303–21 |doi=10.1037/a0014823 |pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;

==Implications for human behavior==
Within the [[psychological sciences]], there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against [[obese]] individuals, [[elderly]] individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J.H. |author2=Faulkner, J. |author3=Schaller, M. |date=June 2003 |title=Evolved disease-avoidance processes and contemporary anti-social behavior: Prejudicial attitudes and avoidance of people with physical disabilities |journal= Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=65–87 |issn=1573-3653 |doi=10.1023/A:1023910408854 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l147k15h81282134/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Crandall, C.S. |year=2007 |title=Pathogen-avoidance mechanisms and the stigmatization of obese people |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=410–4 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/ParkSchallerCrandall2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=L.A. |author2=Schaller, M. |date=October 27, 2009 |title=Prejudicial Attitudes Toward Older Adults May Be Exaggerated When People Feel Vulnerable to Infectious Disease: Evidence and Implications |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |publisher=The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–115 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122665436/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01188.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Park, J.H. |author4= Duncan, L.A.  |year=2004 |title=Evolved Disease–Avoidance Mechanisms and Contemporary Xenophobic Attitudes |journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |volume=7 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1368430204046142 |pages=333–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarrete |first=C.D. |author2=D.

Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610361706 |last=Mortensen |first=C.R. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4=Neuberg, S.L. |author5=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2010 |title=Infection breeds reticence: The effects of disease salience on self-perceptions of personality and behavioral tendencies |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=440–7 |pmid=20424082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.008 |last=Ackerman |first=J.M. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Mortensen, C.R. |author4=Sasaki, T. |author5=Neuberg, S.L.  |author6=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2009 |title=A pox on the mind: Disjunction of attention and memory in the processing of physical disfigurement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 478–85 |url=http://web.mit.edu/joshack/www/Ackerman_Pox-on-the-mind2009.pdf |pmid=19578547 |pmc=2699287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for human culture==
The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a [[cultural]] level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincher |first=C.L. |author2=Thornhill, R. |author3=Murray, D.R. |author4= Schaller, M.  |year=2008 |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279–85 |pmid=18302996 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/FincherThornhillMurraySchaller2008.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmc=2602680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Murray, D.R. |date=July 2008 |title=Pathogens, personality, and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=212–21 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2008-08084-014&amp;CFID=5418322&amp;CFTOKEN=19787463 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 |pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for immunology==
Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological [[immune system]] too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin 6]] in response to a bacterial stimulus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Miller, G.E. |author3=Gervais, W.M. |author4=Yager, S. |author5= Chen, E.  |year=2010 |title=Mere visual perception of other people's disease symptoms facilitates a more aggressive immune response |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=649–52 |pmid=20483842 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/SchallerMillerGervaisYagerChen2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/0956797610368064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huang|first=J.Y. |author2=Sedlovskaya, A. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4= Bargh, J.A.  |year=2011 |title=Immunizing Against Prejudice: Effects of Disease Protection on Attitudes Toward Out-Groups |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1550–56 |pmid=22058107 |doi=10.1177/0956797611417261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bone fracture'''  (sometimes abbreviated '''FRX''' or '''Fx''', '''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''', or '''#''') is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of the [[bone]]. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bone fracture may be the result of high force [[Impact force|impact]] or [[Stress fracture|stress]], or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as [[osteoporosis]], [[osteopenia]], [[bone cancer]], or [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], where the fracture is then properly termed a [[pathologic fracture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel K. |last1=Witmer |first2=Silas T. |last2=Marshall |first3=Bruce D. |last3=Browner |chapter=Emergency Care of Musculoskeletal Injuries |chapterurl={{Google books|KYstDAAAQBAJ|page=462|plainurl=yes}} |pages=462–504 |editor1-first=Courtney M. |editor1-last=Townsend |editor2-first=R.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although bone tissue itself contains no [[nociceptors]], bone fracture is painful for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/fracture/article.htm MedicineNet – Fracture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221165251/http://www.medicinenet.com/fracture/article.htm |date=2008-12-21 }} Medical Author: Benjamin C. Wedro, MD, FAAEM.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Breaking in the continuity of the [[periosteum]], with or without similar discontinuity in [[endosteum]], as both contain multiple pain receptors.
* [[Edema]] of nearby [[soft tissues]] caused by bleeding of broken periosteal blood vessels evokes pressure pain.
* Involuntary [[muscle spasms]] trying to hold bone fragments in place.
* [[Hematoma]] on the fracture site.

Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves, muscles or blood vessels, spinal cord, and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) may cause other specific signs and symptoms.

===Complications===
[[File:Nonunion2010.JPG|thumb|An old fracture with [[Pseudarthrosis|nonunion]] of the fracture fragments]]
Some fractures may lead to serious complications including a condition known as [[compartment syndrome]]. If not treated, eventually, compartment syndrome may require [[amputation]] of the affected limb. Other complications may include non-union, where the fractured bone fails to heal or mal-union, where the fractured bone heals in a deformed manner.

Complications of fractures may be classified into three broad groups, depending upon their time of occurrence. These are as follows – 
# ''Immediate'' complications – occurs at the time of the fracture.
# ''Early'' complications – occurring in the initial few days after the fracture.
# ''Late'' complications – occurring a long time after the fracture.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Bone healing}}
The natural process of healing a fracture starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture [[hematoma]]. The [[clotting|blood coagulates]] to form a blood [[clot]] situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, [[angiogenesis|blood vessels grow]] into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring [[white blood cell|phagocyte]]s to the area, which gradually removes the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring [[fibroblast]]s in the walls of the vessels and these multiply and produce [[collagen]] fibres. In this way, the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen's rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.

At this stage, some of the fibroblasts begin to lay down [[bone matrix]] in the form of collagen monomers. These monomers spontaneously assemble to form the bone matrix, for which bone crystals ([[calcium hydroxyapatite]]) are deposited in amongst, in the form of insoluble [[crystal]]s. This mineralization of the collagen matrix stiffens it and transforms it into bone. In fact, bone ''is'' a mineralized collagen matrix; if the mineral is dissolved out of bone, it becomes rubbery. Healing bone [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] on average is sufficiently mineralized to show up on [[X-ray]] within 6 weeks in adults and less in children. This initial "woven" bone does not have the strong mechanical properties of mature bone. By a process of remodelling, the woven bone is replaced by mature "lamellar" bone. The whole process may take up to 18 months, but in adults, the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury.

Several factors may help or hinder the [[bone healing]] process. For example, [[tobacco]] smoking hinders the process of bone healing,&lt;ref name="pmid20303894"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.surge.2009.10.014 |pmid=20303894 |title=The effects of smoking on fracture healing |journal=The Surgeon |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=111–6 |year=2010 |last1=Sloan |first1=A. |last2=Hussain |first2=I. |last3=Maqsood |first3=M. |last4=Eremin |first4=O. |last5=El-Sheemy |first5=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adequate nutrition (including [[calcium]] intake) will help the bone healing process. Weight-bearing stress on bone, after the bone has healed sufficiently to bear the weight, also builds bone strength.

Although there are theoretical concerns about [[NSAIDs]] slowing the rate of healing, there is not enough evidence to warrant withholding the use of this type analgesic in simple fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1100/2012/606404 |pmid=22272177 |pmc=3259713 |title=Do Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Affect Bone Healing?

===Effects of smoking===
Smokers generally have lower bone density than non-smokers, so they have a much higher risk of fractures. There is also evidence that smoking delays bone healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00198-004-1640-3 |pmid=15175845 |title=Smoking and fracture risk: A meta-analysis |journal=Osteoporosis International |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=155–62 |year=2004 |last1=Kanis |first1=J.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Xraymachine.JPG|thumb|[[Medical radiography|Radiography]] to identify possible fractures after a knee injury]]
A bone fracture may be diagnosed based on the history given and the physical examination performed. [[Medical radiography|Radiographic imaging]] often is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Under certain circumstances, radiographic examination of the nearby joints is indicated in order to exclude dislocations and fracture-dislocations. In situations where projectional radiography alone is insufficient, [[Computed Tomography|Computed Tomography (CT)]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]] may be indicated.

[[File: Periprosthetic fracture of left femur, case 1, before treatment.jpg|thumb|200px|Periprosthetic fracture of left femur]]
In [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]] [[medicine]], fractures are classified in various ways. Historically they are named after the physician who first described the fracture conditions, however, there are more systematic classifications as well.

They may be divided into stable versus unstable depending on the likelihood that they may shift further.

===Mechanism===
* [[Trauma (medicine)|Traumatic]] fracture – This is a fracture due to sustained trauma. e.g., fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight, etc.
* [[Pathologic fracture]] – A fracture through a bone that has been made weak by some underlying disease is called pathological fracture. e.g., a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.
* [[Periprosthetic]] fracture – This is a fracture at the point of mechanical weakness at the end of an [[Implant (medicine)|implant]]

===Soft-tissue involvement===
* Closed fractures are those in which the overlying skin is intact
* [[Open fracture|Open/compound fractures]] involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, or where fracture [[hematoma]] is exposed, and may thus expose bone to [[contamination]]. Open injuries carry a higher risk of [[infection]].
** Clean fracture
** Contaminated fracture

===Displacement===
* Non-displaced
* [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|Displaced]]
** Translated, or ''ad latus'', with sideways displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fractures-of-the-extremities-general-rules-and-nomenclature-1|title=Fractures of the extremities (general rules and nomenclature)|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|author=Roberto Schubert|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Angulated
** Rotated
** Shortened

===Fracture pattern===
* Linear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis
* Transverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis
* Oblique fracture: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis (more than 30°)
* [[Spiral fracture]]: A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted
* [[Compression fracture]]/[[wedge fracture]]: usually occurs in the vertebrae, for example when the front portion of a [[vertebra]] in the spine collapses due to [[osteoporosis]] (a medical condition which causes bones to become brittle and susceptible to fracture, with or without trauma)
* Impacted fracture: A fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other
* [[Avulsion fracture]]: A fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass

===Fragments===
* Incomplete fracture: Is a fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined, in such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.
* Complete fracture: Is a fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.
* Comminuted fracture:  Is a fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.

===Anatomical location===
An anatomical classification may begin with specifying the involved body part, such as the head or arm, followed with more specific localization. Fractures that have additional definition criteria than merely localization often may be classified as subtypes of fractures, such as a [[Holstein-Lewis fracture]] being a subtype of a [[humerus fracture]]. Most typical examples in an orthopaedic classification given in the previous section cannot be classified appropriately into any specific part of an anatomical classification, however, as they may apply to multiple anatomical fracture sites.

{{main|Müller AO Classification of fractures}}

The [[Orthopaedic Trauma Association]] Committee for Coding and Classification published its classification system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8814583 |year=1996 |title=Fracture and dislocation compendium. Orthopaedic Trauma Association Committee for Coding and Classification |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma |volume=10 Suppl 1 |pages=v–ix, 1–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996, adopting a similar system to the 1987 [[AO Foundation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Classification AO des fractures.

Treatment of bone fractures are broadly classified as surgical or conservative, the latter basically referring to any non-surgical procedure, such as pain management, immobilization or other non-surgical stabilization. A similar classification is ''open'' versus ''closed treatment'', in which ''open treatment'' refers to any treatment in which the fracture site is opened surgically, regardless of whether the fracture is an [[#Classification|open]] or [[#Classification|closed fracture]].

===Pain management===
In arm fractures in children, [[ibuprofen]] has been found to be as effective as a combination of [[acetaminophen]] and [[codeine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.06.005 |pmid=19692147 |title=A Randomized Clinical Trial of Ibuprofen Versus Acetaminophen with Codeine for Acute Pediatric Arm Fracture Pain |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=553–60 |year=2009 |last1=Drendel |first1=Amy L. |last2=Gorelick |first2=Marc H. |last3=Weisman |first3=Steven J. |last4=Lyon |first4=Roger |last5=Brousseau |first5=David C. |last6=Kim |first6=Michael K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immobilization===
Since [[bone healing]] is a natural process that will occur most often, fracture treatment aims to ensure the best possible ''function'' of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called [[reduction (orthopaedic surgery)|reduction]], in a good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray is all that is needed. This process is extremely painful without [[anaesthesia]], about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a [[plaster]] or [[glass-reinforced plastic|fibreglass]] [[Cast (orthopaedic)|cast]] or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture oedema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or [[orthosis]]. If being treated with surgery, [[intramedullary rod|surgical nails]], screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the [[Ilizarov apparatus|Ilizarov method]] which is a form of an external fixator.

Occasionally smaller bones, such as phalanges of the [[toes]] and [[finger]]s, may be treated without the cast, by [[buddy wrapping]] them, which serves a similar function to making a cast. A device called a [[Suzuki frame]] may be used in cases of deep, complex intra-articular digit fractures.&lt;ref name="pmid16217475"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keramidas EG, Miller G|date=October 2005|title=The Suzuki frame for complex intraarticular fractures of the thumb|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=116&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1326|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=116|issue=5|pages=1326–31|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000181786.39062.0b|pmid=16217475}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing only limited movement, immobilization helps preserve anatomical alignment while enabling [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation, toward the target of achieving union.

Splinting results in the same outcome as casting in children who have a distal radius fracture with little shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.100119 |pmid=20823169 |pmc=2950182 |title=Cast versus splint in children with minimally angulated fractures of the distal radius: A randomized controlled trial |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=182 |issue=14 |pages=1507–12 |year=2010 |last1=Boutis |first1=K. |last2=Willan |first2=A. |last3=Babyn |first3=P. |last4=Goeree |first4=R. |last5=Howard |first5=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
[[Surgery|Surgical]] methods of treating fractures have their own risks and benefits, but usually surgery is performed only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or likely to result in a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as [[hip fracture]]s (usually caused by [[osteoporosis]]), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged immobilisation, which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, deconditioning, [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT), and [[pulmonary embolism]], which are more dangerous than surgery. When a joint surface is damaged by a [[fracture]], surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.

[[Infection]] is especially dangerous in bones, due to the recrudescent nature of bone infections. Bone tissue is predominantly [[extracellular matrix]], rather than living cells, and the few [[blood vessels]] needed to support this low metabolism are only able to bring a limited number of [[immune cell]]s to an injury to fight infection. For this reason, open fractures and [[Osteotomy|osteotomies]] call for very careful [[antiseptic]] procedures and [[prophylactic]] use of antibiotics.

Occasionally, [[bone grafting]] is used to treat a fracture.

Sometimes bones are reinforced with metal. These [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s must be designed and installed with care. ''[[Stress shielding]]'' occurs when plates or screws carry too large of a portion of the bone's load, causing [[atrophy]]. This problem is reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of low-[[Young's modulus|modulus]] materials, including [[titanium]] and its alloys. The heat generated by the friction of installing hardware can accumulate easily and damage [[bone tissue]], reducing the strength of the connections. If dissimilar metals are installed in contact with one another (i.e., a titanium plate with [[cobalt]]-[[chromium]] alloy or [[stainless steel]] screws), galvanic [[corrosion]] will result. The metal [[ion]]s produced can damage the [[bone]] locally and may cause systemic effects as well.

===Other===
A Cochrane review of [[low-intensity pulsed ultrasound]] to speed healing in newly broken bones found insufficient evidence to justify routine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=XL|last2=Parsons|first2=N|last3=Costa|first3=ML|last4=Metcalfe|first4=D|title=Ultrasound and shockwave therapy for acute fractures in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=23 June 2014|issue=6|pages=CD008579|pmid=24956457|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008579.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews have found tentative evidence of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Lou|first1=S.|last2=Lv|first2=H.|last3=Li|first3=Z.|last4=Zhang|first4=L.|last5=Tang|first5=P|title= The effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on fresh fracture: A meta-analysis|journal=Medince|date=1 September 2017|volume=96|issue=39|pages=e8181|pmid=28953676|pmc=5626319 |doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000008181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be an alternative to surgery for established nonunions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal |last1=Leighton|first1= R. |last2= Watson |first2=J.T |last3= Giannoudis|first3=P.|last4=Papakostidis|first4=C.|last5=Harrison|first5=A. |last6=Steen|first6=R.G. |title= Healing of fracture nonunions treated with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS): A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Injury|date=May 2017|volume=48|issue=7|pages=1339–1347|pmid= 28532896 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2017.05.016}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin D supplements combined with additional calcium marginally reduces the risk of hip fractures and other types of fracture in older adults; however, vitamin D supplementation alone did not reduce the risk of fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avenell|first=Alison|last2=Mak|first2=Jenson C. S.|last3=O'Connell|first3=Dianne|date=2014-04-14|title=Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women and older men|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD000227|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000227.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24729336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
{{Main|Child bone fracture}}
In children, whose bones are still developing, there are risks of either a growth plate injury or a [[greenstick fracture]].
* A greenstick fracture occurs due to mechanical failure on the tension side. That is since the bone is not so brittle as it would be in an adult, it does not completely fracture, but rather exhibits bowing without complete disruption of the bone's [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] in the surface opposite the applied force.
* Growth plate injuries, as in [[Salter-Harris fractures]], require careful treatment and accurate reduction to make sure that the bone continues to grow normally.
* [[Plasticity (physics)|Plastic deformation]] of the bone, in which the bone permanently bends, but does not break, also is possible in children. These injuries may require an [[osteotomy]] (bone cut) to realign the bone if it is fixed and cannot be realigned by closed methods.
*Certain fractures mainly occur in children, including fracture of the [[clavicle]] and [[Supracondylar humerus fracture|supracondylar fracture of the humerus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Campylite''' is a variety of the [[lead]] [[arsenate]] [[mineral]] [[mimetite]] which received the name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'kampylos'- bent, on account of the barrel-shaped bend of its crystals. It has also been used as an alternate name for [[pyromorphite]].

It occurs in the upper lead deposits through the oxidation of [[galena]] or [[cerussite]]. The main deposits are [[Příbram]] in [[Bohemia]] and [[Dry Gill]], [[Caldbeck Fells]], near [[Wigton]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]].

'''Criticism of the theory of relativity''' of [[Albert Einstein]] was mainly expressed in the early years after its publication in the early twentieth century, on [[Science|scientific]], [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], or [[Ideology|ideological]] bases.&lt;ref group=A name=hentschel&gt;Hentschel (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner&gt;Goenner (1993ab)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck&gt;Wazeck (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of these criticisms had the support of reputable scientists, Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] is now accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Research Methodology: The Aims, Practices and Ethics of Science |edition=illustrated |first1=Peter |last1=Pruzan |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27167-5 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWShCwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uWShCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 Extract of page 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special relativity==

===Relativity principle versus electromagnetic worldview===
Around the end of the 19th century, the view was widespread that all forces in nature are of electromagnetic origin (the "[[Electromagnetic mass|electromagnetic worldview]]"), especially in the works of [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897) and [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900). This was apparently confirmed by the experiments of [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1901–1903), who measured an increase of the mass of a body with velocity which was consistent with the hypothesis that the mass was generated by its electromagnetic field. [[Max Abraham]] (1902) subsequently sketched a theoretical explanation of Kaufmann's result in which the electron was considered as rigid and spherical. However, it was found that this model was incompatible with the results of many experiments (including the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], the [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]], and the [[Trouton–Noble experiment]]), according to which no motion of an observer with respect to the [[luminiferous aether]] ("aether drift") had been observed despite numerous attempts to do so. [[Henri Poincaré]] (1902) conjectured that this failure arose from a general law of nature, which he called "the [[principle of relativity]]". [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1904) created a detailed theory of electrodynamics ([[Lorentz ether theory]]) that was premised on the existence of an immobile aether and employed a set of space and time coordinate transformations that Poincaré called the Lorentz transformations, including the effects of [[length contraction]] and [[relativity of simultaneity|local time]]. However, Lorentz's theory only partially satisfied the relativity principle, because his transformation formulas for velocity and charge density were incorrect. This was corrected by Poincaré (1905) who obtained full Lorentz covariance of the electrodynamic equations.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 47–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Lorentz (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticizing Lorentz's 1904 theory, Abraham (1904) held that the Lorentz contraction of electrons requires a non-electromagnetic force to ensure the electron's stability. This was unacceptable to him as a proponent of the electromagnetic worldview. He continued that as long as a consistent explanation is missing as to how those forces and potentials act together on the electron, Lorentz's system of hypotheses is incomplete and doesn't satisfy the relativity principle.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 75–85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Abraham (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré (1905) removed this objection by showing that the non-electromagnetic potential ("[[Electromagnetic mass#Poincaré stresses and 4/3 problem|Poincaré stress]]") holding the electron together can be formulated in a Lorentz covariant way, and showed that in principle it is possible to create a Lorentz covariant model for gravitation which he considered non-electromagnetic in nature as well.&lt;ref group=B name=poinc&gt;Poincaré (1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the consistency of Lorentz's theory was proven, but the electromagnetic worldview had to be given up.&lt;ref group=A name=darr&gt;Darrigol (2000), pp. 372–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Janssen (2007), pp. 25–34&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Albert Einstein]] published in September 1905 what is now called [[special relativity]], which was based on a radical new application of the relativity principle in connection with the constancy of the speed of light. In special relativity, the space and time coordinates depend on the inertial observer's frame of reference, and the luminiferous aether plays no role in the physics. Although this theory was founded on a very different kinematical model, it was experimentally indistinguishable from the aether theory of Lorentz and Poincaré, since both theories satisfy the relativity principle of Poincaré and Einstein, and both employ the Lorentz transformations. After Minkowski's introduction in 1908 of the geometric spacetime model for Einstein's version of relativity, most physicists eventually decided in favor of the Einstein-Minkowski version of relativity with its radical new views of space and time, in which there was no useful role for the aether.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=darr /&gt;

===Claimed experimental refutations===
[[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]: To conclusively decide between the theories of Abraham and Lorentz, Kaufmann repeated his experiments in 1905 with improved accuracy. However, in the meantime the theoretical situation had changed. [[Alfred Bucherer]] and [[Paul Langevin]] (1904) developed another model, in which the electron is contracted in the line of motion, and dilated in the transverse direction, so that the volume remains constant. While Kaufmann was still evaluating his experiments, Einstein published his theory of special relativity. Eventually, Kaufmann published his results in December 1905 and argued that they are in agreement with Abraham's theory and require rejection of the "basic assumption of Lorentz and Einstein" (the relativity principle). Lorentz reacted with the phrase "I am at the end of my Latin", while Einstein did not mention those experiments before 1908. Yet, others started to criticize the experiments. [[Max Planck]] (1906) alluded to inconsistencies in the theoretical interpretation of the data, and [[Adolf Bestelmeyer]] (1906) introduced new techniques, which (especially in the area of low velocities) gave different results and which cast doubts on Kaufmann's methods. Therefore, Bucherer (1908) conducted new experiments and arrived at the conclusion that they confirm the mass formula of relativity and thus the "relativity principle of Lorentz and Einstein". Yet Bucherer's experiments were criticized by Bestelmeyer leading to a sharp dispute between the two experimentalists. On the other hand, additional experiments of Hupka (1910), Neumann (1914) and others seemed to confirm Bucherer's result. The doubts lasted until 1940, when in similar experiments Abraham's theory was conclusively disproved. (It must be remarked that besides those experiments, the relativistic mass formula had already been  confirmed by 1917 in the course of investigations on the theory of spectra. In modern [[particle accelerator]]s, the relativistic mass formula is routinely confirmed.)&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1921), pp. 636–637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1981), pp. 334–352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Staley (2009), pp. 219–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Planck (1906b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Bucherer (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Kaufmann (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902–1906, [[Dayton Miller]] repeated the Michelson–Morley experiment together with [[Edward W. Morley]]. They confirmed the [[null result]] of the initial experiment. However, in 1921–1926, Miller conducted new experiments which apparently gave positive results.&lt;ref group=C&gt;Miller (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiments initially attracted some attention in the media and in the scientific community&lt;ref group=A&gt;Lalli (2012), p. 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; but have been considered refuted for the following reasons:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Swenson (1970), pp. 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Lalli (2012), pp. 187–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein, [[Max Born]], and [[Robert S. Shankland]] pointed out that Miller hadn't appropriately considered the influence of temperature. A modern analysis by Roberts shows that Miller's experiment gives a null result, when the technical shortcomings of the apparatus and the error bars are properly considered.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Roberts (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Miller's result is in disagreement with all other experiments, which were conducted before and after. For example, [[Georg Joos]] (1930) used an apparatus of similar dimensions to Miller's, but he obtained null results. In recent experiments of Michelson–Morley type where the [[coherence length]] is increased considerably by using [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s the results are still negative.

In the 2011 [[Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly]], the [[OPERA experiment|OPERA collaboration]] published results which appeared to show that the speed of [[neutrino]]s is slightly faster than the speed of light. However, sources of errors were found and confirmed in 2012 by the OPERA collaboration, which fully explained the initial results. In their final publication, a neutrino speed consistent with the speed of light was stated. Also subsequent experiments found agreement with the speed of light, see [[measurements of neutrino speed]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Acceleration in special relativity===
It was also claimed that special relativity cannot handle acceleration, which would lead to contradictions in some situations. However, this assessment is not correct, since acceleration actually can be described in the framework of special relativity (see [[Acceleration (special relativity)]], [[Proper reference frame (flat spacetime)]], [[Hyperbolic motion (relativity)|Hyperbolic motion]], [[Rindler coordinates]], [[Born coordinates]]). Paradoxes relying on insufficient understanding of these facts were discovered in the early years of relativity. For example, [[Max Born]] (1909) tried to combine the concept of rigid bodies with special relativity. That this model was insufficient was shown by [[Paul Ehrenfest]] (1909), who demonstrated that a rotating rigid body would, according to Born's definition, undergo a contraction of the circumference without contraction of the radius, which is impossible ([[Ehrenfest paradox]]). [[Max von Laue]] (1911) showed that rigid bodies cannot exist in special relativity, since the propagation of signals cannot exceed the speed of light, so an accelerating and rotating body will undergo deformations.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1920), pp. 689–691&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Born (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ehrenfest (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Langevin]] and von Laue showed that the [[twin paradox]] can be completely resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, and one of them is accelerating and coming back to the other, then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a single frame.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Laue (1921a), pp. 59, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Langevin (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Sagnac effect]]. Two signals were sent in opposite directions around a rotating platform. After their arrival a displacement of the interference fringes occurs. Sagnac himself believed that he had proved the existence of the aether. However, special relativity can easily explain this effect. When viewed from an inertial frame of reference, it is a simple consequence of the independence of the speed of light from the speed of the source, since the receiver runs away from one beam, while it approaches the other beam. When viewed from a rotating frame, the assessment of simultaneity changes during the rotation, and consequently the speed of light is not constant in accelerated frames.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Laue (1921a), pp. 25–26, 128–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Langevin (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

As was shown by Einstein, the only form of accelerated motion that cannot be described is the one due to [[gravitation]], since special relativity is not compatible with the [[Equivalence principle]]. Einstein was also unsatisfied with the fact that inertial frames are preferred over accelerated frames. Thus over the course of several years (1908–1915), Einstein developed [[general relativity]]. This theory includes the replacement of [[Euclidean geometry]] by [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and the resultant curvature of the path of light led Einstein (1912) to the conclusion that (like in accelerated frames) the speed of light is not constant in extended gravitational fields. Therefore, Abraham (1912) argued that Einstein had given special relativity a [[coup de grâce]]. Einstein responded that within its area of application (in areas where gravitational influences can be neglected) special relativity is still applicable with high precision, so one cannot speak of a coup de grâce at all.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pais (1982), pp. 177–207, 230–232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Abraham (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superluminal speeds===
In special relativity, the transfer of signals at [[Faster-than-light|superluminal speeds]] is impossible, since this would violate the Poincaré-[[Einstein synchronization]], and the [[causality]] principle. Following an old argument by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Poincaré (1904) alluded to the fact that [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] is founded on an infinitely great [[speed of gravity]]. So the clock-synchronization by light signals could in principle be replaced by a clock-synchronization by instantaneous gravitational signals. In 1905, Poincaré himself solved this problem by showing that in a relativistic theory of gravity the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. Although much more complicated, this is also the case in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref group=B name=poin&gt;Poincaré (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Carlip (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Poincaré (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another apparent contradiction lies in the fact that the [[group velocity]] in [[Dispersion (optics)|anomalously dispersive media]] is higher than the speed of light. This was investigated by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1907, 1914) and [[Léon Brillouin]] (1914). They came to the conclusion that in such cases the [[signal velocity]] is not equal to the group velocity, but to the [[front velocity]] which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by [[Günter Nimtz]] can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1921), 672–673&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=Faq&gt;PhysicsFaq: FTL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Sommerfeld (1907, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Brillouin (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[quantum entanglement]] (denoted by Einstein as "spooky action at a distance"), according to which the quantum state of one entangled particle cannot be fully described without describing the other particle, does not imply superluminal transmission of information (see [[quantum teleportation]]), and it is therefore in conformity with special relativity.&lt;ref group=B name=Faq&gt;PhysicsFaq: FTL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradoxes===
Insufficient knowledge of the basics of special relativity, especially the application of the Lorentz transformation in connection with [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], led and still leads to the construction of various apparent [[paradox]]es. Both the [[twin paradox]] and the [[Ehrenfest paradox]] and their explanation were already mentioned above. Besides the twin paradox, also the reciprocity of time dilation (''i.e.'' every inertially moving observer considers the clock of the other one as being dilated) was heavily criticized by [[Herbert Dingle]] and others. For example, Dingle wrote a series of letters to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] at the end of the 1950s. However, the self-consistency of the reciprocity of time dilation had already been  demonstrated long before in an illustrative way by Lorentz (in his lectures from 1910, published 1931&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 257–264&lt;/ref&gt;) and many others—they alluded to the fact that it is only necessary to carefully consider the relevant measurement rules and the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. Other known paradoxes are the [[Ladder paradox]] and [[Bell's spaceship paradox]], which also can simply be solved by consideration of the relativity of simultaneity.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Chang (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Mathpages: Dingle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Dingle (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aether and absolute space===
Many physicists (like [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert Abraham Michelson]], [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]], [[Harry Bateman]], [[Ebenezer Cunningham]], [[Charles Émile Picard]], [[Paul Painlevé]]) were uncomfortable with the rejection of the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], and preferred to interpret the Lorentz transformation based on the existence of a preferred frame of reference, as in the aether-based theories of Lorentz, Larmor, and Poincaré. However, the idea of an aether hidden from any observation was not supported by the  mainstream scientific community, therefore the aether theory of Lorentz and Poincaré was superseded by Einstein's special relativity which was subsequently formulated in the framework of four-dimensional spacetime by Minkowski.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1983), pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Warwick (2003), pp. 410–419, 469–475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Paty (1987), pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Lodge (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Michelson (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Prokhovnik (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Others such as [[Herbert E. Ives]] argued that it might be possible to experimentally determine the motion of such an aether,&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ives (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never found despite numerous experimental tests of Lorentz invariance (see [[tests of special relativity]]).

Also attempts to introduce some sort of relativistic aether (consistent with relativity) into modern physics such as by Einstein on the basis of general relativity (1920), or by [[Paul Dirac]] in relation to quantum mechanics (1951), were not supported by the scientific community (see [[Luminiferous aether#End of aether?]]).&lt;ref group=A&gt;Kragh (1990), pp. 189–205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Dirac (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Nobel Prize|Nobel lecture]], [[George F. Smoot]] (2006) described his own experiments on the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] anisotropy as "New Aether drift experiments". Smoot explained that "one problem to overcome was the strong prejudice of good scientists who learned the lesson of the Michelson and Morley experiment and Special Relativity that there were no preferred frames of reference." He continued that "there was an education job to convince them that this did not violate Special Relativity but did find a frame in which the expansion of the universe looked particularly simple."&lt;ref group=B&gt;Smoot (2006), pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
The theory of complete [[aether drag hypothesis|aether drag]], as proposed by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (1844), was used by some critics as [[Ludwig Silberstein]] (1920) or [[Philipp Lenard]] (1920) as a counter-model of relativity. In this theory, the aether was completely dragged within and in the vicinity of matter, and it was believed that various phenomena, such as the absence of aether drift, could be explained in an "illustrative" way by this model. However, such theories are subject to great difficulties. Especially the [[aberration of light]] contradicted the theory, and all auxiliary hypotheses, which were invented to rescue it, are self-contradictory, extremely implausible, or in contradiction to other experiments like the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]]. In summary, a sound mathematical and physical model of complete aether drag was never invented, consequently this theory was no serious alternative to relativity.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Joos (1959), pp. 448ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Michelson (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=lenard&gt;Lenard (1921a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Silberstein (1921a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative was the so-called [[emission theory]] of light. As in special relativity the aether concept is discarded, yet the main difference from relativity lies in the fact that the velocity of the light source is added to that of light in accordance with the [[Galilean transformation]]. As the hypothesis of complete aether drag, it can explain the negative outcome of all aether drift experiments. Yet, there are various experiments that contradict this theory. For example, the [[Sagnac effect]] is based on the independence of light speed from the source velocity, and the image of [[Double star]]s should be scrambled according to this model—which was not observed. Also in modern experiments in particle accelerators no such velocity dependence could be observed.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Norton (2004), pp. 14–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;De Sitter (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Fox (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ritz (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;  These results are further confirmed by the [[De Sitter double star experiment]] (1913), conclusively repeated in the X-ray spectrum by K. Brecher in 1977;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Brecher, K.|title=Is the speed of light independent of the velocity of the source|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=39|issue=17|year=1977|pages=1051–1054|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1051|postscript=.|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39.1051B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the terrestrial experiment by Alväger, ''et al''. (1963);,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Alväger, T. |author2=Nilsson, A. |author3=Kjellman, J. |title=A Direct Terrestrial Test of the Second Postulate of Special Relativity|journal=Nature|volume=197|issue=4873|year=1963|pages=1191 |doi=10.1038/1971191a0|bibcode = 1963Natur.197.1191A}}&lt;/ref&gt; which all show that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the source within the limits of experimental accuracy.

===Principle of the constancy of the speed of light===
Some consider the ''principle of the constancy of the velocity of light'' insufficiently substantiated. However, as already shown by [[Robert Daniel Carmichael]] (1910) and others, the constancy of the speed of light can be interpreted as a natural consequence of ''two'' experimentally demonstrated facts:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Carmichael (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

# The velocity of light is independent of the ''velocity of the source'', as demonstrated by [[De Sitter double star experiment]], [[Sagnac effect]], and many others (see [[emission theory]]).
# The velocity of light is independent of the direction of ''velocity of the observer'', as demonstrated by [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], [[Kennedy–Thorndike experiment]], and many others (see [[luminiferous aether]]).

Note that measurements regarding the speed of light are actually measurements of the two-way speed of light, since the [[one-way speed of light]] depends on which convention is chosen to synchronize the clocks.

==General relativity==

===General covariance===
Einstein emphasized the importance of [[general covariance]] for the development of general relativity, and took the position that the general covariance of his 1915 theory of gravity ensured implementation of a generalized relativity principle.  This view was challenged by [[Erich Kretschmann]] (1917), who argued that every theory of space and time (even including Newtonian dynamics) can be formulated in a covariant way, if additional parameters are included, and thus general covariance of a theory would in itself be insufficient to implement a generalized relativity principle. Although Einstein (1918) agreed with that argument, he also countered that Newtonian mechanics in general covariant form would be too complicated for practical uses. Although it is now understood that Einstein's response to Kretschmann was mistaken (subsequent papers showed that such a theory would still be usable), another argument can be made in favor of general covariance: it is a natural way to express the [[equivalence principle]], ''i.e.'', the equivalence in the description of a free-falling observer and an observer at rest, and thus it is more convenient to use general covariance together with general relativity, rather than with Newtonian mechanics. Connected with this, also the question of absolute motion was dealt with. Einstein argued that the general covariance of his theory of gravity supports [[Mach's principle]], which would eliminate any "absolute motion" within general relativity. However, as pointed out by [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1916, Mach's principle is not completely fulfilled in general relativity because there exist matter-free solutions of the field equations. This means that the "inertio-gravitational field", which describes both gravity and inertia, can exist in the absence of gravitating matter. However, as pointed out by Einstein, there is one fundamental difference between this concept and absolute space of Newton: the inertio-gravitational field of general relativity is determined by matter, thus it is not absolute.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Janssen (2008), pp. 3–4, 17–18, 28–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Norton (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;De Sitter (1916ab)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Kretschmann (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1920, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad Nauheim Debate===
In the "Bad Nauheim Debate" (1920) between Einstein and (among others) [[Philipp Lenard]], the latter stated the following objections: He criticized the lack of "illustrativeness" of Einstein's version of relativity, a condition that he suggested could only be met by an aether theory. Einstein responded that for physicists the content of "illustrativeness" or "[[common sense]]" had changed in time, so it could no longer be used as a criterion for the validity of a physical theory. Lenard also argued that with his relativistic theory of gravity Einstein had tacitly reintroduced the aether  under the name "space". While this charge was rejected (among others) by [[Hermann Weyl]], in an inaugural address given at the University of Leiden in 1920, shortly after the Bad Nauheim debates, Einstein himself acknowledged that according to his general theory of relativity, so-called "empty space" possesses physical properties that influence matter and ''vice versa''. Lenard also argued that Einstein's general theory of relativity admits the existence of superluminal velocities, in contradiction to the principles of special relativity; for example, in a rotating coordinate system in which the Earth is at rest, the distant points of the whole universe are rotating around Earth with superluminal velocities. However, as been pointed out by Weyl, it's not possible to handle a rotating extended system as a rigid body (neither in special nor in general relativity)—so the [[signal velocity]] of an object never exceeds the speed of light. Another criticism that was raised by both Lenard and [[Gustav Mie]] concerned the existence of "fictitious" gravitational fields in accelerating frames, which according to Einstein's Equivalence Principle are no less physically real than those produced by material sources. Lenard and Mie argued that physical forces can only be produced by real material sources, while the gravitational field that Einstein supposed to exist in an accelerating frame of reference has no concrete physical meaning. Einstein responded that, based on [[Mach's principle]], one can think of these gravitational fields as induced by the distant masses. In this respect the criticism of Lenard and Mie has been vindicated, since according to the modern consensus, in agreement with Einstein's own mature views, Mach's principle as originally conceived by Einstein is not actually supported by general relativity, as already mentioned above.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Goenner (1993a), pp. 124–128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=nau&gt;Lenard, Einstein, Gehrcke, Weyl (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silberstein–Einstein controversy===
[[Ludwik Silberstein]], who initially was a supporter of the special theory, objected at different occasions against general relativity. In 1920 he argued that the deflection of light by the sun, as observed by [[Arthur Eddington]] et al. (1919), is not necessarily a confirmation of general relativity, but may also be explained by the [[Hamar experiment|Stokes-Planck theory]] of complete aether drag. However, such models are in contradiction with the [[aberration of light]] and other experiments (see "Alternative theories"). In 1935, Silberstein claimed to have found a contradiction in the [[Two-body problem in general relativity]]. However, also this claim was refuted by Einstein and Rosen (1935).&lt;ref group=A&gt;Havas (1993), pp. 97–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein/Rosen (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Silberstein (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical criticism==
The consequences of relativity, such as the change of ordinary concepts of space and time, as well as the introduction of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in general relativity, were criticized by some philosophers of different [[List of schools of philosophy|philosophical schools]]. It was characteristic for many philosophical critics that they had insufficient knowledge of the mathematical and formal basis of relativity,&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), Chapter 6.2, pp. 555–557&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the criticisms often missing the heart of the matter. For example, relativity was misinterpreted as some form of [[relativism]]. However, this is misleading as it was emphasized by Einstein or Planck. On one hand it's true that space and time became relative, and the inertial frames of reference are handled on equal footing. On the other hand, the theory makes natural laws invariant—examples are the constancy of the speed of light, or the covariance of Maxwell's equations. Consequently, [[Felix Klein]] (1910) called it the "invariant theory of the Lorentz group" instead of relativity theory, and Einstein (who reportedly used expressions like "absolute theory") sympathized with this expression as well.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 92–105, 401–419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Klein (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Petzoldt (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Planck (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical responses to relativity were also expressed by proponents of [[Neo-Kantianism]] ([[Paul Natorp]], [[Bruno Bauch]], etc.), and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] ([[Oskar Becker]], [[Moritz Geiger]] etc.). While some of them only rejected the philosophical consequences, others rejected also the physical consequences of the theory. Einstein was criticized for violating [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Category (Kant)|categoric]] scheme, ''i.e.'', it was claimed that space-time curvature caused by matter and energy is impossible, since matter and energy already require the concepts of space and time. Also the three-dimensionality of space, Euclidean geometry, and the existence of absolute simultaneity were claimed to be necessary for the understanding of the world; none of them can possibly be altered by empirical findings. By moving all those concepts into a metaphysical area, any form of criticism of [[Kantianism]] would be prevented. Other pseudo-Kantians like [[Ernst Cassirer]] or [[Hans Reichenbach]] (1920), tried to modify Kant's philosophy. Subsequently, Reichenbach rejected Kantianism at all and became a proponent of [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 199–239, 254–268, 507–526&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Reichenbach (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Cassirer (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Natorp (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Linke (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Friedlaender (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Henri Poincaré]]'s [[conventionalism]], philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] (1914) or [[Hugo Dingler]] (1920) argued that the classical concepts of space, time, and geometry were, and will always be, the most convenient expressions in natural science, therefore the concepts of relativity cannot be correct. This was criticized by proponents of [[logical positivism]] such as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], or Reichenbach. They argued that Poincaré's conventionalism could be modified, as to bring it into accord with relativity. Although it is true that the basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics are simpler, it can only be brought into accord with modern experiments by inventing auxiliary hypotheses. On the other hand, relativity doesn't need such hypotheses, thus from a conceptual viewpoint, relativity is in fact simpler than Newtonian mechanics.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 293–336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Schlick (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Reichenbach (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Dingler (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of [[Philosophy of Life]], [[Vitalism]], [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|Critical realism]] (in German speaking countries) argued that there is a fundamental difference between physical, biological and psychological phenomena. For example, [[Henri Bergson]] (1921), who otherwise was a proponent of special relativity, argued that [[time dilation]] cannot be applied to biological organisms, therefore he denied the relativistic solution of the [[twin paradox]]. However, those claims were rejected by [[Paul Langevin]], [[André Metz]] and others. Biological organisms consist of physical processes, so there is no reason to assume that they are not subject to relativistic effects like time dilation.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 240–243, 441–455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Metz (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Bergson (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the philosophy of [[Fictionalism]], the philosopher [[Oskar Kraus]] (1921) and others claimed that the foundations of relativity were only fictitious and even self-contradictory. Examples were the constancy of the speed of light, time dilation, length contraction. These effects appear to be mathematically consistent as a whole, but in reality they allegedly are not true. Yet, this view was immediately rejected. The foundations of relativity (such as the equivalence principle or the relativity principle) are not fictitious, but based on experimental results. Also, effects like constancy of the speed of light and relativity of simultaneity are not contradictory, but complementary to one another.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 276–292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Kraus (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union (mostly in the 1920s), philosophical criticism was expressed on the basis of [[dialectic materialism]]. The theory of relativity was rejected as anti-materialistic and speculative, and a mechanistic worldview based on "[[common sense]]" was required as an alternative. Similar criticisms also occurred in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. (On the other hand, other philosophers considered relativity as being compatible with [[Marxism]].)&lt;ref group=A name=vizgin&gt;Vizgin/Gorelik (1987), pp. 265–326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=hu&gt;Hu (2007), 549–555&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relativity hype and popular criticism==
Although Planck already in 1909 compared the changes brought about by relativity with the [[Copernican Revolution]], and although special relativity was accepted by most of the theoretical physicists and mathematicians by 1911, it was not before publication of the experimental results of the eclipse expeditions (1919) by a group around [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] that relativity was noticed by the public. Following Eddington's publication of the eclipse results, Einstein was glowingly praised in the mass media, and was compared to [[Nikolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]], which caused a popular "relativity hype" ("Relativitätsrummel", as it was called by Sommerfeld, Einstein, and others). This triggered a counter-reaction of some scientists and scientific laymen who could not accept the concepts of modern physics, including relativity theory and quantum mechanics. The ensuing public controversy regarding the scientific status of Einstein's theory of gravity, which was unprecedented, was partly carried out in the press. Some of the criticism was not only directed to relativity, but personally at Einstein as well, who some of his critics accused of being behind the promotional campaign in the German press. &lt;ref group=A name=goenner1&gt;Goenner (1993a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck /&gt;

===Academic and non-academic criticism===
Some academic scientists, especially experimental physicists such as the Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]], as well as [[Ernst Gehrcke]], [[Stjepan Mohorovičić]], [[Rudolf Tomaschek]] and others criticized the increasing abstraction and mathematization of modern physics, especially in the form of [[relativity theory]], and later [[quantum mechanics]]. It was seen as a tendency to abstract theory building, connected with the loss of intuitive "[[common sense]]". In fact, relativity was the first theory, in which the inadequacy of the "illustrative" classical physics was thought to have been demonstrated. Some of Einstein's critics ignored these developments and tried to revitalize older theories, such as aether drag models or emission theories (see "Alternative Theories"). However, those qualitative models were never sufficiently advanced to compete with the success of the precise experimental predictions and explanatory powers of the modern theories. Additionally, there was also a great rivalry between experimental and theoretical physicists, as regards the professorial activities and the occupation of chairs at German universities. The opinions clashed at the "[[Bad Nauheim]] debates" in 1920 between Einstein and (among others) Lenard, which attracted much attention in the public.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 74–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=nau /&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1924a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Mohorovičić (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there were many critics (with or without physical training) whose ideas were far outside the scientific mainstream. These critics were mostly people who had developed their ideas long before the publication of Einstein's version of relativity, and they tried to resolve in a straightforward manner some or all of the enigmas of the world. Therefore, Wazeck (who studied some German examples) gave to these "free researchers" the name "world riddle solver" ("Welträtsellöser", such as Arvid Reuterdahl, Hermann Fricke or Johann Heinrich Ziegler). Their views had their quite different roots in [[monism]], [[Lebensreform]], or [[occultism]]. Their views were typically characterized by the fact that they practically rejected the entire terminology and the (primarily mathematical) methods of modern science. Their works were published by private publishers, or in popular and non-specialist journals. It was significant for many "free researchers" (especially the monists) to explain all phenomena by intuitive and illustrative mechanical (or electrical) models, which also found its expression in their defense of the aether. For this reason they objected to the abstractness and inscrutability of the relativity theory, which was considered a pure calculation method that cannot reveal the true reasons underlying the phenomena. The "free researchers" often used [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation]], in which gravity is caused by some sort of "aether pressure" or "mass pressure from a distance". Such models were regarded as an illustrative alternative to the abstract mathematical theories of gravitation of both Newton and Einstein. Additionally, also the enormous self-confidence of the "free researchers" is noteworthy, since they not only believed to have solved all the riddles of the world, but also had the expectation that they would rapidly convince the scientific community.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 27–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Fricke (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ziegler (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Reuterdahl (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Einstein rarely defended himself against these attacks, this task was undertaken by other relativity theoreticians, who (according to Hentschel) formed some sort of "defensive belt" around Einstein. Some representatives were [[Max von Laue]], [[Max Born]], etc. and on popular-scientific and philosophical level [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[André Metz]] etc., who led many discussions with critics in semi-popular journals and newspapers. However, most of these discussions failed from the start. Physicists like Gehrcke, some philosophers, and the "free researchers" were so obsessed with their own ideas and prejudices that they were unable to grasp the basics of relativity; consequently, the participants of the discussions were talking past each other. In fact, the theory that was criticized by them was not relativity at all, but rather a caricature of it. The "free researchers" were mostly ignored by the scientific community, but also, in time, respected physicists such as Lenard and Gehrcke found themselves in a position outside the scientific community. However, the critics didn't believe that this was due to their incorrect theories, but rather due to a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] of the relativistic physicists (and in the 1920s &amp; 1930s of the [[Jew]]s as well), which allegedly tried to put down the critics, and to preserve and improve their own positions within the academic world. For example, Gehrcke (1920/24) held that the propagation of relativity is a product of some sort of mass [[Hypnosis|suggestion]]. Therefore, he instructed a [[media monitoring service]] to collect over 5000 newspaper clippings which were related to relativity, and published his findings in a book. However, Gehrcke's claims were rejected, because the simple existence of the "relativity hype" says nothing about the validity of the theory, and thus it cannot used for or against relativity.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 163–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 113–193, 217–292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1924b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, some critics tried to improve their positions by the formation of [[Voluntary association|alliances]]. One of them was the "Academy of Nations", which was founded in 1921 in the USA by [[Robert T. Browne]] and [[Arvid Reuterdahl]]. Other members were [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]] and as well as Gehrcke and Mohorovičić in Germany. It is unknown whether other American critics such as [[Charles Lane Poor]], [[Charles Francis Brush]], [[Dayton Miller]] were also members. The alliance disappeared as early as the mid-1920s in Germany and by 1930 in the USA.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 293–378&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chauvinism and antisemitism===
Shortly before and during World War I, there appeared some nationalistically motivated criticisms of relativity and modern physics. For example, [[Pierre Duhem]] regarded relativity as the product of the "too formal and abstract" German spirit, which was in conflict with the "common sense". Similarly, popular criticism in the Soviet Union and China, which partly was politically organized, rejected the theory not because of factual objections, but as ideologically motivated as the product of western decadence.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 123–131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=vizgin /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=hu /&gt;

So in those countries, the Germans or the Western civilization were the enemies. However, in Germany the [[Jewish]] ancestry of some leading relativity proponents such as Einstein and Minkowski made them targets of racially minded critics, although many of Einstein's German critics did not show evidence of such motives. The engineer [[Paul Weyland]], a known nationalistic agitator, arranged the first public meeting against relativity in Berlin in 1919. While Lenard and Stark were also known for their nationalistic opinions, they declined to participate in Weyland's rallies, and Weyland's campaign eventually fizzled out due to a lack of prominent speakers. Lenard and others instead responded to Einstein's challenge to his professional critics to debate his theories at the scientific conference held annually at Bad Nauheim. While Einstein's critics, assuming without any real justification that Einstein was behind the activities of the German press in promoting the triumph of relativity, generally avoided antisemitic attacks in their earlier publications, it later became clear to many observers that antisemitism did play a significant role in some of the attacks.

Reacting to this underlying mood, Einstein himself openly speculated in a newspaper article that in addition to insufficient knowledge of theoretical physics, antisemitism at least partly motivated their criticisms. Some critics, including Weyland, reacted angrily and claimed that such accusations of antisemitism were only made to force the critics into silence. However, subsequently Weyland, Lenard, Stark and others clearly showed their antisemitic biases by beginning to combine their criticisms with [[racism]]. For example, [[Theodor Fritsch]] emphasized the alleged negative consequences of the "Jewish spirit" within relativity physics, and the [[Far-right politics|far right]]-press continued this propaganda unhindered. After the murder of [[Walther Rathenau]] (1922) and murder threats against Einstein, he left Berlin for some time. Gehrcke's book on "The mass suggestion of relativity theory" (1924) was not antisemitic itself, but it was praised by the far-right press as describing an alleged typical Jewish behavior, which was also imputed to Einstein personally. [[Philipp Lenard]] in 1922 spoke about the "foreign spirit" as the foundation of relativity, and afterward he joined the [[Nazi party]] in 1924; [[Johannes Stark]] did the same in 1930. Both were proponents of the so-called [[Deutsche Physik|German Physics]], which only accepted scientific knowledge based on experiments, and only if accessible to the senses. According to Lenard (1936), this is the "[[Aryanism|Aryan]] physics or physics by man of [[Nordic race|Nordic kind]]" as opposed to the alleged formal-dogmatic "Jewish physics". Additional antisemitic critics can be found in the writings of [[Wilhelm Müller (physicist)|Wilhelm Müller]], [[Bruno Thüring]] and others. For example, Müller erroneously claimed that relativity was a purely "Jewish affair" and it would correspond to the "Jewish essence" etc., while Thüring made comparisons between the [[Talmud]] and relativity.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Kleinert (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Beyerchen (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 131–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="goenner1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Posch (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 271–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="B"&gt;Einstein (1920a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Lenard (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Stark/Müller (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Thüring (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of plagiarism and priority discussions===
Some of Einstein's critics, like Lenard, Gehrcke and Reuterdahl, accused him of plagiarism, and questioned his priority claims to the authorship of relativity theory. The thrust of such allegations was to promote more traditional alternatives to Einstein's abstract hypothetico-deductive approach to physics, while Einstein himself was to be personally discredited. It was argued by Einstein's supporters that such personal accusations were unwarranted, since the physical content and the applicability of former theories were quite different from Einstein's theory of relativity. However, others argued that between them Poincaré and Lorentz had earlier published several of the core elements of Einstein's 1905 relativity paper, including a generalized relativity principle that was intended by Poincaré to apply to all physics. Some examples:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 194–216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1921b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Lenard (1921b)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] (1801) was credited for his calculation of the [[Tests of general relativity|deflection of light]] in the vicinity of celestial bodies, long before Einstein's prediction which was based on general relativity. However, Soldner's derivation has nothing to do with Einstein's, since it was fully based on Newton's theory, and only gave half of the value as predicted by general relativity.
* [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) published a formula for the perihelion advance of Mercury, which was formally identical to an approximate solution given by Einstein. However, since Einstein's formula was only an approximation, the solutions are not identical. In addition, Gerber's derivation has no connection with General relativity and was even considered as meaningless.
* [[Woldemar Voigt]] (1887) derived a [[History of Lorentz transformations|transformation]], which is very similar to the [[Lorentz transformation]]. As Voigt himself acknowledged, his theory was not based on electromagnetic theory, but on an elastic aether model. His transformation also violates the relativity principle.
* [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) applied the concept of [[electromagnetic mass]] and momentum (which were known long before) to cavity- and thermal radiation. Yet, the applicability of Einstein's [[Mass–energy equivalence]] goes much further, since it is derived from the relativity principle and applies to all forms of energy.
* [[Menyhért Palágyi]] (1901) developed a philosophical "space-time" model in which time plays the role of an imaginary fourth dimension. Palágyi's model was only a reformulation of Newtonian physics, and had no connection to electromagnetic theory, the relativity principle, or to the constancy of the speed of light.

Some contemporary historians of science have revived the question as to whether Einstein was possibly influenced by the ideas of Poincaré, who first stated the relativity principle and applied it to electrodynamics, developing interpretations and modifications of Lorentz's electron theory that appear to have anticipated what is now called special relativity. &lt;ref group=A&gt;Darrigol (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Another discussion concerns a possible mutual influence between Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] as regards completing the [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] of general relativity (see [[Relativity priority dispute]]).

===''A Hundred Authors Against Einstein''===
A collection of various criticisms can be found in the book ''Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein'' (''A Hundred Authors Against Einstein''), published in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=Israel, Hans |editor2=Ruckhaber, Erich |editor3=Weinmann, Rudolf | year=1931 | title=Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein | location=Leipzig | publisher=Voigtländer | url=https://archive.org/details/HundertAutorenGegenEinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains very short texts from 28 authors, and excerpts from the publications of another 19 authors. The rest consists of a list that also includes people who only for some time were opposed to relativity. Besides philosophic objections (mostly based on [[Kantianism]]), also some alleged elementary failures of the theory were included; however, as some commented, those failures were due to the authors' misunderstanding of relativity. For example, [[Hans Reichenbach]] described the book as an "accumulation of naive errors", and as "unintentionally funny". Albert von Brunn interpreted the book as a backward step to the 16th and 17th century, and Einstein said, in response to the book, that if he were wrong, then one author would have been enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Goenner, the contributions to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, [[hubris]], and the feelings of the critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, that this was not a reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians ([[Jean-Marie Le Roux]], [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Hjalmar Mellin]]) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't know what to do with relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger.&lt;ref name=goenner2 group=A /&gt; Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Oskar Kraus]], [[Menyhért Palágyi]]).&lt;ref name=goenner2 group=A&gt;Goenner (1993b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 356–361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Israel et al. (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of criticism==
{{See also|Tests of special relativity|Tests of general relativity}}

The theory of relativity is considered to be self-consistent, is consistent with many experimental results, and serves as the basis of many successful theories like [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Therefore, fundamental criticism (like that of [[Herbert Dingle]], [[Louis Essen]], [[Petr Beckmann]], [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Tom van Flandern]]) has not been taken seriously by the scientific community, and due to the lack of quality of many critical publications (found in the process of [[peer review]]) they were rarely accepted for publication in reputable scientific journals. Just as in the 1920s, most critical works are published in small publications houses, alternative journals (like "Apeiron" or "Galilean Electrodynamics"), or private websites.&lt;ref group=A name=farrell /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck2 /&gt; Consequently, where criticism of relativity has been dealt with by the scientific community, it has mostly been in historical studies.&lt;ref group=A name=hentschel /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck /&gt;

However, this does not mean that there is no further development in modern physics. The progress of technology over time has led to extremely precise ways of testing the predictions of relativity, and so far it has successfully passed all tests (such as in particle accelerators to test special relativity, and by astronomical observations to test general relativity). In addition, in the theoretical field there is continuing research intended to unite general relativity and quantum theory. The most promising models are [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]]. Some variations of those models also predict violations of Lorentz invariance on a very small scale.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Mattingly (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=will group=B&gt;Will (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Liberati (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17734">'''Cross-impact analysis''' is a [[methodology]] developed by Theodore Gordon and Olaf Helmer in 1966 to help determine how relationships between events would impact resulting events and reduce uncertainty in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], United Nations University Millennium Project, 1994, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) became interested in the methodology in the late 1960s and early 1970s as an analytic technique for predicting how different factors and variables would impact future decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', CQ Press, 2011, p 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, futurists began to use the methodology in larger numbers as a means to predict the probability of specific events and determine how related events impacted one another.&lt;ref name="Cross Impact Method"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, cross-impact analysis matured into a number of related methodologies with uses for businesses and communities as well as futurists and intelligence analysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/2_scoping/meth_cross-impact-analysis.htm '''For Learn – Cross Impact Analysis'''], For Learn, Joint Research Centre, European Commission, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The basic principles of cross-impact analysis date back to the late 1960s, but the original processes were relatively simple and were based on a game design.&lt;ref name="lampsacus1"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 1&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, advanced techniques, methodologies, and programs were developed to apply the principles of cross-impact analysis, and the basic method is now applied in futures think tanks, business settings, and the intelligence community.

===Origins===

Theodore J. Gordon writes that cross-impact analysis was the result of a question: "can forecasting be based on perceptions about how future events may interact?"&lt;ref name="lampsacus1"/&gt;

The first format of the method was a card game titled ''Future'', where events were determined by probabilities, a special die, and impacts from previously played events.&lt;ref name="lampsacus1"/&gt; This initial game format of cross-impact analysis was programmed for computers at UCLA in 1968.&lt;ref name="Cross Impact Method"/&gt; From this point on, the methodology underwent increasing development and sophistication to meet certain needs and conditions of users.

===Early development===

As cross-impact analysis expanded in the early 1970s, researchers and futurists modified the basic principles to improve on the methodology. In 1972, researchers at '''The Institute for the Future''' added time-series instead of "Slice of Time", Norman Dalkey used conditional probabilities, and Julius Kane developed "KSIM", a simulation technique that used interactions between time series variables rather than events.&lt;ref name="lampsacus2"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Duperrin and Godet developed Cross Impact Systems and Matrices (or SMIC) in France for prospective forecasting studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/2_scoping/meth_cross-impact-analysis.htm '''For Learn - Cross Impact Analysis''']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in simulation models continued into the 1980s. In 1980, Selwyn Enzer at the University of California incorporated cross-impact analysis into a simulation method known as Interax, The Delphi technique was combined with Cross Impact Analysis in 1984, and researchers at Texas A&amp;M University used Cross Impact in a process called "EZ-IMPACT" that was based on Kane's algorithm from KSIM.&lt;ref name="lampsacus2"/&gt;

===Recent development===

After simulation models and methods were developed for cross-impact analysis, analysts began to develop the range of topics that it could address. Cross-impact analysis was being used to solve real world issues as John Stover applied the methodology to simulate the economy of Uruguay.&lt;ref name="lampsacus2"/&gt; However, real world application of the methodology advanced rapidly in the 1990s. By 1993, SMIC was used for subjects as diverse as the nuclear industry, world geopolitical evolution, and corporate activities and jobs to 2000.&lt;ref name="lampsacus3"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], pp 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Robert Blanning and Bruce Reinig from the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University utilized a modified form of cross-impact analysis to determine futures for Hong Kong and the Hong Kong economy as the United Kingdom relinquished control to the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, Robert and Bruce Reinig, [http://www.ifu.ethz.ch/ESD/education/Masterstudium/PEA/Blanning_Reinig_1999.pdf '''Cross-impact analysis using group decision support systems: an application to the future of Hong Kong'''], Elsevier Science Ltd., 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Cross-impact analysis has two schools of thought and ways of approach. The first is the futures forecasting style that originally developed the methodology. The second is a sub-school of intelligence analysts which modified the original methodology to better address their needs. Nevertheless, cross-impact analysis is based upon the premise that events and activities do not happen in a vacuum and other events and the surrounding environment can significantly influence the probability of certain events to occur.&lt;ref name="lampsacus4"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-impact analysis attempts to connect relationships between events and variables. These relationships are then categorized as positive or negative relative to each other, and are used to determine which events or scenarios are most probable or likely to occur within a given time frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/2_scoping/meth_cross-impact-analysis.htm '''For Learn - Cross Impact Analysis'''], For Learn, Joint Research Center, European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

===Futures forecasting style===

The futures forecasting style is based in the systems and methods developed during the 1970s and 1980s and follows several strict steps.

First, analysts must consider the number and type of events to be considered in the analysis and create an event set. Because each event will have an interaction with every other event, Gordon recommends that 10–40 events be used.&lt;ref name="lampsacus4"/&gt;

Second, analysts must take the initial probability of each event into account. The probabilities of events must be taken in isolation from one another.&lt;ref name="lampsacus4"/&gt;

Third, analysts need to generate conditional probabilities that events have on each other. Basically, this asks the question, "If event 'A' occurs, what is the new probability of event 'B' occurring?" This must be done for every possible interaction between events.&lt;ref name="lampsacus5"&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, analysts must test their initial conditional probabilities to ensure that there are no mathematical errors. This is usually done by running simulations in a computer several times.&lt;ref name="lampsacus5"/&gt;

Fifth, analysts can run the analysis to determine future scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/2_scoping/meth_cross-impact-analysis.htm For '''Learn – Cross Impact Analysis'''], For Learn, Joint Research Centre, European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; or determine how significant other events are to specific events.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mathematical technique====

The futurist forecasting style of cross-impact analysis relies heavily on probabilities and mathematics in its processes. Initial probabilities and conditional probabilities are calculated using either percentages&lt;ref name="lampsacus5"/&gt; or factor numbers equivalent to percentages.&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;[http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/2_scoping/meth_cross-impact-analysis.htm '''For Learn – Cross Impact Analysis'''], For Learn, Joint Research Centre, European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers must calculate the numerical values or percentages very precisely to ensure accurate results and that impacts of events on each other are realistic and not contradictory. In addition, researchers must be careful when calculating negative impacts as the negative influence can create mathematical impossibilities.&lt;ref name="lampsacus5"/&gt;

This mathematical strictness makes the futurist forecasting style of cross-impact analysis uniform and differences in actual analytic methods, simulations and programs have only minor differences to fit the needs of the specific researcher or analyst.

====Relationship to Delphi technique====

The accuracy of the math and specific events requires special expertise in the events or topic of discussion. In order to get the insight needed to get events and calculations, analysts typically contact a large number of experts and ask their opinions on events or probabilities in -person as groups&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 5&lt;/ref&gt; or through surveys.&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

These groupings often resemble the [[Delphi Technique]], which is an analytic technique that gathers a group of experts on a subject together and asks their opinion on a scenario or prediction. Usually, analysts consider the average prediction or scenario as the most likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', p 247&lt;/ref&gt; The two are so closely related, that analysts often use the two techniques in combination or as part of a larger methodology.&lt;ref name="lampsacus2"/&gt;

====Strengths====

The futurist forecasting style of cross-impact analysis carries a few key strengths. Its use of groups of experts ensures a number of opinions worth considering when calculating probabilities of events. The level of mathematics in calculating probabilities ensures that the results are as accurate as a researcher can make them. In addition, when used on consort with other analytic techniques, this type of cross-impact analysiscan give greater quantitative results to an otherwise qualitative analysis.&lt;ref name="lampsacus5"/&gt; The relative conformity of methods ensures that analysts using different methods or simulations can come to similar results, making the results testable in a broader setting.

====Weaknesses====

Many of the strengths of the futurist forecasting style of cross-impact analysis give rise to many of its weaknesses. The conformity of the style generates a certain level of inflexibility when dealing with variables other than events, like environmental conditions or political issues. In addition, the severe level of mathematics involved in this style leads to long delays as scenarios must be run to ensure mathematical accuracy of probabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], p 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; or particular issues with [[Bayes' theorem]] appear.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, Robert, Bruce A. Reinig, [http://www.ifu.ethz.ch/ESD/education/Masterstudium/PEA/Blanning_Reinig_1999.pdf '''Cross-impact analysis using group decision support systems: an application to the future of Hong Kong'''], p 40&lt;/ref&gt; The level of math also require researchers to either be knowledgeable in math or additional computer programs to deal with the scenarios and probabilities of the method.

===Intelligence analysis style===

Shortly after Theodore Gordon and Olaf Helmer developed the original cross-impact method, the [[United States intelligence community]] picked up the technique and has been using it for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richardsj., Randolph H Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

While the basic premise of relationships and impacts between multiple variables remains the same, the intelligence community modified cross-impact analysis to meet its various needs.

The intelligence community has created a more flexible and variable system than the original methodology. Event relationships and impacts are still similar to the method incorporated by futurists.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Robert M., '''Intelligence Analysis: A Target-Centric Approach''', CQ Press, Third Edition, 2010. p 202-203&lt;/ref&gt; However, intelligence analysts have expanded the parameters of cross-impact analysis beyond comparing events to include variables like environment, political circumstances, and popular opinion to influence probabilities of certain events.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', pp 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, intelligence analysts can choose to use more flexible measurements like "enhancing," "inhibiting," or "unrelated" instead of the rigid mathematics of the tradition methodology to include non-event variables.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', p 105&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-impact matrix====

A major part of the intelligence analysis style of cross-impact analysis is the cross-impact matrix. The matrix is a visualization of the cross-impact analysis and allows for modification. It also allows an analyst to find both the most influential variables and those variables that are impacted by the most other variables, not just direct, one-to-one relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', p 106&lt;/ref&gt; While several traditional cross-impact analysis methods suggest the creation of a matrix, the priority still relies in probabilities, one-to-one relationships, and the order of events.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], pp 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the intelligence analysis style cross-impact matrix, analysts use pluses and minuses instead of numerical values allowing for non-event variables and allowing the analyst to compare variables directly to all other variables without calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', pp 105-106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strengths====

Intelligence analysis style cross-impact analysis has several key advantages. The flexibility of the model allows for analysts to measure different types of variables against each other, not just probable events.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', pp 104-106&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ability to discard stringent mathematical criteria means that researchers do not need extensive mathematics training or specialized software to use cross-impact analysis. This also enables experts in a topic to use the methodology relatively quickly without having to cross-check the numerous calculations faced by the Futurist Forecasting Style.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Theodore Jay, [http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf '''Cross Impact Method'''], pp 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weaknesses====

The lack of stringent procedures of the intelligence analysis style also bring considerable drawbacks. The flexibility of the style relies heavily on the opinions and knowledge of the analysts involved, and is difficult to reproduce results with a different group. In addition, the option to remove mathematics can harm analysts by creating results that do not have numerical values to back them. This lack of mathematics may make the process easier at first, but the amount of specialized software is limited when compared to the Futurist Forecasting Style, making work more tedious as the number of variables increases.

==Applications==

Researchers can use cross-impact analysis for a wide variety of applications. Futurists have already used the methodology for forecasting events in specific industries, politics, markets, and even entire communities.&lt;ref name="lampsacus3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, Robert W., Bruce A. Reinig, [http://www.ifu.ethz.ch/ESD/education/Masterstudium/PEA/Blanning_Reinig_1999.pdf '''Cross-impact analysis using group decision support systems: an application to the future of Hong Kong''']&lt;/ref&gt;

In intelligence analysis, analysts can use the method to predict events, conditions, or decisions based on a wide variety of variables and conditions at local, national, and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;Heuer, Richards J., Randolph H. Pherson, '''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis''', pp. 104–06&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drools''' is a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS) with a [[forward chaining|forward]] and [[backward chaining]] inference based [[rules engine]], more correctly known as a [[Production system (computer science)|production rule system]], using an enhanced implementation of the [[Rete algorithm]].

KIE (Knowledge Is Everything) is the new umbrella name to drools, [[optaPlanner]], [[jBPM]], Guvnor, uberFire and related technologies.

Drools supports the Java Rules Engine API (Java Specification Request 94) standard for its [[business rule]] engine and enterprise framework for the construction, maintenance, and enforcement of business policies in an organization, application, or service.

== Example ==
This example&lt;ref&gt;http://downloads.jboss.com/drools/docs/5.1.1.34858.FINAL/drools-expert/html_single/index.html#d0e2676{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a simple rule to print out information about a holiday in July. It checks a condition on an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Holiday&lt;/code&gt; class, and executes Java code if that condition is true.

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
rule "validate holiday" 
dialect "mvel"
dialect "java"
when
    $h1 : Holiday( month == "july" )
then
    System.out.println($h1.name + ":" + $h1.month);
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The purpose of dialect "&lt;code&gt;mvel&lt;/code&gt;" is to point the Getter and Setters of the variables of your [[Plain Old Java Object]] (POJO) classes.
Consider the above example, in which a &lt;code&gt;Holiday&lt;/code&gt; class is used and inside the circular brackets (parentheses) "&lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt;" is used. So with the help dialect "&lt;code&gt;mvel&lt;/code&gt;" the getter and setters of the variable "&lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt;" can be accessed.

Dialect "&lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;" is used to help us write our Java code in our rules. There is one restriction or characteristic on this. We cannot use Java code inside "when" part of the rule but we can use Java code in "then" part.

We can also declare a Reference variable &lt;code&gt;$h1&lt;/code&gt; without the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; symbol. There is no restriction on this. The main purpose of putting the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; symbol before the variable is to mark the difference between variables of POJO classes and Rules.

'''Eddie''' Crater is a crater in the [[Elysium quadrangle]] of Mars at 12.3° north latitude and 217.9° west longitude.  It is 89&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Lindsay Eddie]], a South African astronomer (1845–1913).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flag.wr.usgs/gov{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) they usually have a central peak, as this crater has.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/&lt;/ref&gt; The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact.  It contains material uplifted from beneath the surface.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H.

"'''Electricity'''" is the 1979 debut single of the English group [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], featured on their [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (album)|eponymous debut album]] the following year. Inspired by [[Kraftwerk]]'s "[[Radioactivity (song)|Radioactivity]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity by OMD |publisher= Songfacts |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17624 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song addresses society's wasteful usage of energy sources. [[Andy McCluskey]] and [[Paul Humphreys]] sing the lead vocals on the track together in unison. As with single "[[Messages (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Messages]]" from the same album, the song features a melodic synth break instead of a sung chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Interview: Andy McCluskey, OMD |date= 19 March 2013 |publisher= [[PRS for Music]] |accessdate= 1 October 2013 |quote= Many of our songs use the synth melody as the chorus. There are verses but generally the melody is the chorus. |url= http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/creators/interview-andy-mcluskey-omd/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on the strength of "Electricity" that the band were offered a [[recording contract]] with [[Dindisc]],&lt;ref&gt;''Synth Britannia''. [[BBC Four]]. 16 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; who twice re-issued the single. In 2012, "Electricity" peaked at no. 126 in the [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|French charts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= lescharts.com – OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark) – Electricity |url= http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=OMD+%28Orchestral+Manoeuvres+In+The+Dark%29&amp;titel=Electricity&amp;cat=s |publisher= Lescharts.com.

[[Vince Clarke]] of [[Erasure]] (and formerly chief songwriter of [[Depeche Mode]], [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] and [[The Assembly]]) has cited "Electricity" as his primary inspiration to pursue a career in electronic music,&lt;ref name="ozone"&gt;{{cite episode|title= Erasure |series= [[The O-Zone]] |network= [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] |minutes= 8 |airdate= 29 November 1995 |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |quote= When I was 18 or 19 I heard a single called 'Electricity' by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

# "Almost"

==History==
After OMD's first concert, opening for [[Joy Division]] in a 1978 appearance at [[Eric's Club]] in Liverpool, McCluskey was inspired to send a demo of the song to [[Factory Records]] founder [[Tony Wilson]]. They later heard that while he was not impressed with it, his wife was, so he bought it from them and released it as a single. Its ensuing success led to them receiving a seven-album record deal worth £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Hugo |last= Lindgren |title= O.M.D.'s Plot Against Rock |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 19 May 2013 |accessdate= 19 May 2013 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/magazine/omds-plot-against-rock.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"Electricity" was a hit with veteran [[Disk jockey|DJ]] [[John Peel]], who gave the song regular play on his late-night radio show;&lt;ref name="lamacq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="messages"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Johnny |last1= Waller |first2= Mike |last2= Humphreys |title= Messages |year= 1987 |publisher= [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]] |page= 49 |isbn= 0-283-99234-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, the British music press quickly picked up on the song.&lt;ref name="messages"/&gt; Adrian Thrills in the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' cited it as "the best example of [[Factory Records]] to date – excellent, melodic, synthesiser pop." He also lauded B-side "Almost", calling it "a doleful, heartsick slab of electronic angst."&lt;ref name="messages"/&gt;

Conversely, [[Garry Bushell]] gave a negative review in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', in which he remarked: "If [[Mike Oldfield]] was ten years younger and a [[Tubeway Army]] fan, this is what he'd sound like – who wants to listen to a bunch of [[Scouse]]rs whining about electricity anyway?"&lt;ref name="messages"/&gt; However, [[David Hepworth]], who re-appraised the track in the same publication, opined that OMD's sound "commands your attention" and lauded the single for being "packaged with as much taste as it's played."&lt;ref name="messages"/&gt; "Electricity" featured on the ''NME'' end-of-year list for 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= NME End of Year Lists 1979 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1979.html |work= [[NME]] |publisher= Rocklist.net |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospectively, [[AllMusic]] critic Ned Raggett described the song as "pure zeitgeist, a celebration of synth pop's incipient reign".&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;{{cite web|first= Ned |last= Raggett |title= Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark |publisher= [[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |accessdate= 23 June 2013 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-mw0000202497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleague Dave Thompson called it a "perfect electro-pop number".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Dave |last= Thompson |title= Electricity – Song Review |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/electricity-mt0013639162 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vince Clarke]] cited "Electricity" as the track that sparked his interest in electronic music. In a [[BBC]] interview he said: "When I was 18 or 19 I heard a single called 'Electricity' by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. It sounded so different from anything I'd heard; that really made me want to make electronic music, 'cause it was so unique."&lt;ref name="ozone"/&gt; [[Simple Minds]] frontman [[Jim Kerr]] admitted to being "downright jealous" of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Andy |last= Coleman |title= A Simple concept |newspaper= [[Birmingham Mail]] |publisher= [[The Free Library]] |date= 27 November 2009 |accessdate= 4 May 2016 |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+Simple+concept%3B+USB+idea+will+help+Birmingham+concert+stick+in+the...-a0213045763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Electricity" and "Almost" versions==
Multiple versions of "Electricity" exist; the earliest are recordings by McCluskey and Humphreys' previous group [[The Id]].

There are many different versions of the two songs that were present on OMD's debut single. After the band left [[Factory Records]], DinDisc attempted twice to score a hit with "Electricity". Consequently, four versions of "Electricity" and three of "Almost" exist.

;Version I
*"Electricity" (3:36) and "Almost" (3:50) were originally recorded at [[Cargo Studios]], Rochdale and produced by [[Martin Hannett]] under the [[Nickname|moniker]] Martin Zero, to be released by [[Factory Records]].

;Version II
*The band felt Hannett had overproduced their songs somewhat, so they recorded new versions at Henry's Studio, Liverpool. These versions were produced by themselves and band manager [[Paul Collister]] under the moniker Chester Valentino.
*A compromise was reached for the versions used on the single. This first Factory single contains the band's version of "Electricity" (3:44) and the Hannett version of "Almost" (3:50).&lt;ref name="OWD1"&gt;{{cite web|title= Official OMD website discography entry for first issue. |accessdate= 22 December 2007 |url= http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/singles/html/s_1.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/69itoRWxk?url=http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/singles/html/s_1.html |archivedate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Version II of "Almost" (3:43) remained unreleased until appearing on the 2001 compilation; ''[[Navigation: The OMD B-Sides]]''.

;Version III
*The [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (album)|album]] versions of "Electricity" (3:39) and "Almost" (3:44) differ from the previous versions, and were used for the third and final release of the single. "Electricity" was remixed from the original Hannett version. It's also the version used on the 1988 ''[[The Best of OMD|Best Of]]'' and the 1998 ''[[The OMD Singles|Singles]]'' collections and is the best-known version of the song. The album version of "Almost" is similarly a remix of Hannett's version.

;Version IV ("Electricity" only)
*A fourth mix of "Electricity" (3:43) was produced by [[Mike Howlett]]. This version of "Electricity" was recorded during the ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]'' sessions when the band fancied extending the instrumental section in the middle of the song. It was initially released on the ''Dindisc 1980'' compilation album in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Official OMD website discography - Compilations: DINDISC 1980 |accessdate= 17 April 2010 |url= http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/comps/html/done.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it was released on CD as a bonus track on the re-issue of ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]''.

;The Micronauts Remix
*A radical remix by dance music act [[The Micronauts]] was released in 1998 both as part of ''[[The OMD Remixes]]'' release and as part of the bonus disc of the special edition ''[[The OMD Singles]]'' (France only).

==Sleeve design==
The sleeve was designed by Factory's designer [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]]. The band and Saville met in a Rochdale pub and exchanged ideas. Saville told them about a book of avant-garde musical scores which he'd come across. Andy McCluskey said that he sometimes wrote down the tunes he composed in a similar shorthand. This led to the unusual graphics that feature on the sleeve. Saville suggested to use shiny black ink on black paper. Neither OMD nor [[Tony Wilson]] believed it could be done, but Saville persuaded a printer to do the job. The [[thermographic printing]] was a success, but the place set on fire three times, so eventually only 5,000 sleeves were printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Industrial Manoeuvres in the Art |first= Steve |last= Taylor |magazine= [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] |date= February 1981 |issue= 10 |pages= 50–53 |issn= 0263-1210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reissue sleeves were standard white on black printed sleeves.

The '''FNRS-3''' or '''FNRS III''' is a [[bathyscaphe]] of the [[French Navy]]. It is currently presevered at [[Toulon]]. She set world depth records, competing against a more refined version of her design, the first [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|bathyscaphe ''Trieste'']]. The French Navy eventually replaced her with the bathyscaphe [[FNRS-4]], in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Paine-1997&gt;Houghton Mifflin, "Ships of the World", '''Lincoln P. Paine''', ''1997'', pg.188&lt;/ref&gt;

After damage to the [[FNRS-2]] during its sea trials in 1948, [[NFWO|FNRS]] ran out of funding, and the submersible was sold to the French Navy, in 1950. She was subsequently substantially rebuilt and improved at Toulon naval base, and renamed FNRS-3.&lt;ref name=Britannica-2010-09-09&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010 Online, 9 September 2010 (accessed 9 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; She was relaunched in 1953, under the command of [[Georges Houot]], a French naval officer.&lt;ref&gt;University of Washington Press, "Oceanographic History: The Pacific and Beyond", '''Keith R. Benson, Phillip F. Rehbock, ed.s''', ''1993'', 2002, pp.387&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 1954, she made a {{convert|4050|m}} dive 160 miles off [[Dakar, Senegal]] in the Atlantic Ocean, beating Piccard's 1953 record, set by the ''Trieste'', by 900 meters.&lt;ref name=Britannica-2010-09-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paine-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time-1954-03-01&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Deepest Divers |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819513,00.html |work= [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date= 1 March 1954 |accessdate=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the floor of the Mediterranean off Naples, {{convert|10392|ft|m}})&lt;ref name=Paine-2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage, [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml "To the Bottom of the Sea"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203173230/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml |date=3 December 2008 }}, '''T.

The '''''Flexiviridae''''' were a new family of [[virus]]es in the 2004 classification of viruses, but have since the 2009 classification been split into the three  new families ''[[Alphaflexiviridae]]'', ''[[Betaflexiviridae]]'' and ''[[Gammaflexiviridae]]''. These have in turn been subsumed under the new [[Order (biology)|order]] ''[[Tymovirales]]'' along with the old family ''[[Tymoviridae]]'' by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] based on [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetic systematic analyses]] of proteins ([[RNA polymerase]] and [[capsid|viral coat]]).  The viruses are [[RNA virus|positive-sense ssRNA viruses]], placing them in Group IV of the [[Baltimore classification]].  These viruses are filamentous and named for being highly flexible.  
Members of these families are readily transmitted mechanically and have other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of transmission.  Species tend to be confined to a single host plant, many species preferring [[Woody plant|woody]] hosts, but a diversity of [[angiosperm]] hosts are known to the ''Flexiviridae''.  Viral aggregates are known to form in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[plant cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = M. J. |author2=J. F. Antoniw |author3=M. Bar-Joseph |author4=A. A.

'''Functional assessment''' is an ongoing process collecting information to understand the reason under a problem or target behavior. The function of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or [[Therapy|treatments]] used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional assessments we have learned that there are complex [[patterns]] to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that [[evokes]] the behavior. More work needs to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and [[efficiency]], being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention.&lt;ref name= "JABA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Robert H|title=Functional Assessment: Contributions and Future Directions|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|issue=2|pages=401–404|pmc=1297816|pmid=16795831|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Functional assessment is a method developed by [[applied behavior analysis]] to identify the [[variable (research)|variable]]s that maintain a [[problem]] [[behavior]]. Behavior is [[lawful]]. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[Operant conditioning|consequences]] that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the [[time]] and place, the presence of others and the [[frequency]]. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be [[reinforcing]] for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Sandra L|title=Functional Assessment|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=April 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=233|doi=10.1023/a:1022968200344}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 July 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MMPP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miltenberger|first=Raymond G|title=Behavior Modification Principles &amp; Procedures|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=United States|isbn=978-1-111-30611-3|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of problem behavior==
The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior.&lt;ref name= "Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siebert|first=Carol|title=Functional Assessment: Process and Product|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=December 2006|volume=19|issue=1|pages=51–57|url=http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=functional+assessment&amp;facet[0]=addFacetValueFilters(ContentType,Journal+Article)|accessdate=5 August 2012|doi=10.1177/1084822306292516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social positive reinforcement===
Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[positive reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of [[attention]], fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother ([[social]]) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Social negative reinforcement===
Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[negative reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic positive reinforcement===
Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs [[Automation|automatically]] and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an [[autistic]] child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the [[sensory perception|sensory]] stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic negative reinforcement===
Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be [[binge eating]]. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Assessment methods==
There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories.&lt;ref name= "Furniss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furniss|first=Frederick|title=Assessment Methods|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2009|volume=10|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0088-3_3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect methods===
Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barribeau|first=Paul|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of the Survey Method|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/research/survey/com2d1.cfm|work=Survey Research. Writing@CSU.|publisher=Colorado State University Department of English.|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective  as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior.

Indirect methods can help develop a [[correlation]] [[hypothesis]] but not a [[functional relationship]].

===Direct observation methods===
Direct observation methods involve is present to [[observe]] and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a [[natural environment]]. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.&lt;ref name= "Furniss" /&gt;

The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively.

Direct observation can also be can ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Experimental methods===
Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Gregory P|author2=Brian A Iwata |author3=Brandon E McCord |title=Functional analysis of problem behavior: a review.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=Summer 2003|volume=36|issue=2|pages=146–185|pmc=1284431|pmid=12858983|doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=RH|author2=EG Carr |author3=J Halle |author4=G McGee |author5=S Odom |title=The use of single-subject research to identify evidence-based practice in special education|journal=Exceptional children|year=2005|volume=71|issue=2|pages=165|url=http://www.freewebs.com/lowvisionstuff/Single_Subject.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1177/001440290507100203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis.

==Conducting a functional assessment==
A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment.&lt;ref name= "JABA" /&gt;

# The first step should start with a '''behavioral interview''' with the client or someone who knows him/her well.
# The interview from the first step should help '''develop a hypothesis''' about which antecedent would produce the behavior and which reinforcing consequence would maintain it.
# Once a hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to '''conduct a direct observation assessment''' in the natural environment. If the data collected from the interview is [[consistent]] with the observation, the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the hypothesis is strengthened.
# With the information from both sources being consistent, '''confirm your initial hypothesis''' to develop appropriate treatment plans for the identified antecedent and consequence.
# If the data collected from the behavioral interview and the information observed from the direct observation is inconsistent, '''conduct further assessments''' such as another interview or continued observation to clear up any of the inconsistencies.
# If after review and extra interviews and further observations, the information collected are still inconsistent, it is time to '''conduct a functional analysis'''. A functional analysis is also need if the information is consistent but can not lead to a conclusive, firm hypothesis about the [[predictably]] of the antecedent and consequence.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Functional interventions==
After a function assessment has been conducted with success, the information collected is used to develop appropriate treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence for more desirable behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Siebert" /&gt;

Functional interventions include [[extinction]], [[differential reinforcement]] and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also nonaversive as punishment is not involved.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

More aversive interventions can be used as  latter resort if previous nonaversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as [[time-out (parenting)|time-out]] and response cost are considered [[negative punishment]], which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than [[positive punishment]] such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and [[physical restraint]]. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered.

==Research==
A lot of [[research]] being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of [[mentally challenged]] children or adults and [[autistic]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matson|first=Johnny L.|author2=Megan Sipes |author3=Max Horovitz |author4=Julie A. Worley |author5=Mary E. Shoemaker |author6=Alison M. Kozlowski |title=Behaviors and corresponding functions addressed via functional assessment|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|date=January 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=625–629|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142221000301X|accessdate=5 August 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with [[intellectual disabilities]] exhibiting [[aggressive]] behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands.

Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with [[developmental disabilities]] showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintaining their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or [[Sensory system|sensory]] stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iwata|first=Brian A|author2=Michael F.

'''Gisela Mosig''' (November 29, 1930 – January 12, 2003) was a German-American [[molecular biologist]] best known for her work with [[enterobacteria phage T4]].&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VUMC_obit_2003"/&gt; She was among the first investigators to recognize the importance of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] intermediates in establishing new [[DNA replication#Replication fork|DNA replication forks]], a fundamental process in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syeda|first=Aisha H.|last2=Hawkins|first2=Michelle|last3=McGlynn|first3=Peter|date=2014-10-23|title=Recombination and replication|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=6|issue=11|pages=a016550|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a016550|issn=1943-0264|pmc=4413237|pmid=25341919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"/&gt;

==Early years==
While growing up on a farm in [[Saxony]], Mosig became interested in biology and physics.&lt;ref name="VUMC_obit_2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneering genetic researcher Gisela Mosig dies|date=January 24, 2003|url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=2484|website=Vanderbilt Reporter|publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nossal|first1=NG|last2=Franklin|first2=JL|last3=Kutter|first3=E|last4=Drake|first4=JW|title=Gisela Mosig|journal=Genetics|date=November 2004|volume=168|issue=3|pages=1097–104|pmid=15579671|series=Anecdotal, historical and critical commentaries on genetics|pmc=1448779}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After [[World War II]] (when she was 14 years old), the region where she lived became part of [[East Germany]] and evolutionary teaching in her high school skewed toward [[Lysenkoism]].&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"/&gt; Finding the intellectual atmosphere intolerable, she fled to the west on her bicycle with only the belongings she could carry. After undergraduate studies at the [[University of Bonn]], she earned her doctoral degree in plant genetics at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="VUMC_obit_2003"/&gt;

From there, she was recruited to Vanderbilt University to study [[bacteriophage T4]], a topic for which she became a leading investigator.&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"/&gt; After postdoctoral research at Vanderbilt and then the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute of Washington at Cold Spring Harbor]] (with Nobel laureate [[Alfred Hershey|A. D. Hershey]]), she returned to Vanderbilt as a faculty member in 1965, and became a citizen of the [[United States of America]] in 1968. Mosig served on the Vanderbilt faculty until her death in 2003.&lt;ref name="Nossal_2004"/&gt;

Davis is remembered for her pioneering science-based prison reform and groundbreaking research about [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

==Biography==
She was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], on January 15, 1860, to Oscar Bill Davis and Frances Freeman. She was the oldest of five children—three girls and two boys.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="More Than Petticoats"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petrash|first=Antonia |title=More Than Petticoats: Remarkable New York Women|publisher=The Globe Pequot Press|year=2002|pages=92|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine's mother Frances was a strong proponent of women's rights and a zealous advocate for women's [[suffrage]].&lt;ref name="More Than Petticoats" /&gt;

The Davis family lived in [[Dunkirk, New York]], during most of her childhood. Both of her parents were active in community organizations in Dunkirk.&lt;ref name="More Than Petticoats" /&gt; Oscar Davis worked for Bradstreet company, and when Katharine was seventeen he relocated to [[Rochester, New York]], to manage a regional office there.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="More Than Petticoats" /&gt;

===Education and early careers===
In 1879, Davis graduated from Rochester Free Academy, a public high school. Since her family was unable to afford the tuition for college, she taught at Dunkirk Academy. While at Dunkirk Academy, she established a women's equality club and led a women's literacy group.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

After teaching [[General chemistry|high school chemistry]] for ten years, Davis saved enough money to continue her schooling full-time. In 1890, she enrolled in [[Vassar College]], a center of progressive education for women. Davis combined her interests in science and [[social reform]] by studying food chemistry and nutritional studies. Taking this course of study gave Davis the opportunity for career in a [[public health]] agency after graduation.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

After graduating from Vassar, Davis continued her studies at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Barnard College]], a separate women's college within the university, while teaching at Brooklyn Heights Seminary for Girls. She studied the chemistry of food.

While studying at Barnard, Davis managed a project to develop a model home for New York State's display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World Fair]]. As a result of the success of the home display, she was offered a job running a [[settlement house]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

===Philadelphia's College Settlement House===
The [[settlement house]] movement began in the late 19th century to socialize the poor and uneducated residents that occupied immigrant neighborhoods in a city to American values and customs. In the United States, "college settlements" were run by young women graduates of progressive colleges who as "workers" moved into a neighborhood house in order to Americanize the local residents.&lt;ref name="The enduring vision: a history of the American people"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Paul S. |title=The enduring vision: a history of the American people|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2008|pages=581|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoR98M6c-t0C&amp;pg=PA581&amp;dq=settlement+house+movement&amp;num=30&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=settlement%20house%20movement&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 March 2010 | isbn=978-0-618-80159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College Settlement on Philadelphia's St. Mary's Street served a district of indigent blacks and Russian immigrants. Davis moved into the house as "head worker". While in Philadelphia, Davis worked with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], who was then at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] conducting groundbreaking research on blacks in urban America. Davis noted in the Settlement's annual report that "the investigation into the condition of the colored people of . . . the seventh ward which contains about 10,000 Negroes, nearly one fourth the entire number in the city" would be carried out "by means of house-to-house canvass."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

===Chicago===
Davis moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] to return to school at [[Chicago University]] where she was to be the first female Fellow in Political Science-Economics to earn a Ph.D.

==Corrections career==

===Bedford Hills Reformatory===
The [[New York State Reformatory for Women]] at [[Bedford Hills, New York]] opened in May 1901 with Davis as the superintendent.&lt;ref name=bedford/&gt; Besides the administration building, the campus included "a reception hall, four cottages, a laundry building, a powerhouse, a gate house, and a stable". The reception hall had two wings, one wing modeled after a traditional prison with three tiers of 24 cells each, and the other wing contained rooms accommodating 42 inmates.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

===Pre-sentencing evaluations===
In 1909 Davis arranged for the [[New York Public Education Association]] to do a psychological testing study at Bedford. The results showed that serious mental problems existed in a significant number of the female inmates. This result indicated a disconnect between the original focus of the reformatory and the population of inmates that it was serving. In 1910 Davis advocated for judges to have access to pre-sentencing background research and evaluations so that they can made appropriate placements. Davis wrote up her ideas in a pamphlet, ''A Rational Plan for the Treatment of Women Convicted in the Courts of New York City.'' that was widely distributed to people affiliated with criminal justice system in New York City.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

The Prison Association of New York recognized the reforms that Davis made at Bedford Hills saying that "the reformatory is becoming perhaps the most scientific institution of its kind in the world."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

Reform-minded Mayor [[John Purroy Mitchel]] selected Davis to head the Correction Commission making her the first woman to lead an agency in New York City on January 1, 1914.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bedford/&gt; Based on her relationship with Mitchel and his associates, Davis was on the Progressive party's 1914 slate for State Constitutional Convention seat, making her the first woman to run for a New York statewide office on a major party ticket.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

==Bureau of Social Hygiene==
The [[Bureau of Social Hygiene]] in New York City was an agency incorporated by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] in 1913 for "the study, amelioration, and prevention of those social conditions, crimes, and diseases which adversely affect the well-being of society, with special reference to [[Prostitution in the United States|prostitution]] and the evils associated therewith."&lt;ref name="Rockefeller-Related Organization Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockarch.org/collections/rockorgs/bsh.php|title=Bureau Of Social Hygiene Archives, 1911-1940|location=Sleepy Hollow, New York|work=Rockefeller-Related Organization Archives|publisher=The Rockefeller Archive Center|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller established the agency as a result of his appointment in 1911 to a special grand jury to investigate [[prostitution|white slavery]] in New York City. The Bureau's work was influenced by the view that there was a biological basis for crime. During the Bureau's early years the main focus was on prostitution, [[vice]], and [[political corruption]]. During later years, the Bureau shifted its emphasis towards criminology and the control of crime. The Bureau stopped granting new appropriations in 1934, and by 1937 all prior commitments were completed.&lt;ref name="Rockefeller-Related Organization Archives"/&gt;

In 1918 Davis became the head of the Bureau.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

===Sexuality research===
At the Bureau of Social Hygiene, Davis arranged for ground-breaking research on women's sexuality on "normal" females. These were women whose names were found from club memberships directories and college alumnae lists. They were surveyed about "auto-erotic practices, the frequency of sexual desire, homosexual experiences, use of contraceptives, frequency of sexual intercourse, pre-marital and extra-marital sexual experiences."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=Annette Fuglsang |date=July 25, 2000|title=Book Review|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|volume=3|url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/book7.htm|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[Compulsory sterilization]] was seen by many as a way to reduce the incidence of [[mental illness]] and [[mental retardation]] in the general population of the United States. Davis was an [[eugenicist]] and during her tenure as General Secretary, she affiliated the Bureau with leaders in the field of [[eugenics]] such as [[Harry Laughlin]], [[Charles Davenport]] and [[E. S. Gosney]], director of The Human Betterment Foundation in California. In 1924, Davis accepted a position on the Committee on Eugenics of the United States' Advisory Council.&lt;ref name="The Mendel Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/othersrv/isar/archives2/sources/bsh.htm|title=Sources in the Study of Eugenics #2: The Bureau of Social Hygiene|last=Mehler|first=Barry |date=September 1978|work=The Mendel Newsletter|publisher=Institute for the Study of Academic Racism at Ferris State University|pages=No. 16|accessdate=7 March 2010|location=Big Rapids, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
At the end of 1927 her contract was not extended and she retired. On February 2, 1928, the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] ballroom was filled with Progressive Era reformers to honor Davis at a testimonial dinner. The guests including [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], Rev. [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], [[Walter Lippman]], Judge [[William McAdoo (New Jersey)|William McAdoo]], [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], [[Lillian Wald]] and [[Felix Warburg]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;

==Later life, death, and legacy==
Davis retired to Pacific Grove, California with her sisters. Davis died December 10, 1935 from [[cerebral arteriosclerosis]] at her home.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

During her lifetime Davis was honored numerous times by a variety of organizations. The [[Panama-Pacific Exposition]] designated her one of the three most distinguished women in America.&lt;ref name="Problems Women Solved"/&gt; Davis received honorary degrees from [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Western Reserve University|Western Reserve]] and [[Yale]] universities.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

{{Economics sidebar}}

In economics, the '''law of increasing costs''' is a principle that states that once all factors of production (land, labor, capital) are at maximum output and efficiency, producing more will cost more than average. As production increases, the [[opportunity cost]] does as well. The best way to look at this is to review an example of an economy that only produces two things - cars and oranges.  If all the resources of the economy are put into producing only oranges, there will not be any factors of production available to produce cars.  So the result is an output of X number of oranges but 0 cars.  The reverse is also true - if all the factors of production are used for the production of cars, 0 oranges will be produced.  In between these two extremes are situations where some oranges and some cars are produced.  There are three assumptions that are made in this possibility.  The economy is experiencing full employment (everyone who wants to work has a job), the best technology is being used and production efficiency is being maximized.  So the question becomes, what is the cost of producing more oranges or cars?  If the economy is at the maximum for all inputs, then the cost of each unit will be more expensive.  The economy will have to incur more variable costs, such as overtime, to produce the unit.

The law also applies to ''switching'' production in a maxed out economy. Essentially, the economy is still '''producing''' more, so the law still applies. The only difference is that resources are being taken from one area and applied to another, instead of simply producing more of the same (as assumed in the first paragraph)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This is a '''list of [[Procellariiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Procellariiformes have had their numbers quantified.

All of the [[United States]]' 50 [[U.S. state|states]] have a state [[motto]], as do the [[District of Columbia]] and three [[territories of the United States|US territories]]. A motto is a phrase intended to formally describe the general motivation or intention of an organization. State mottos can sometimes be found on [[Seals of the U.S. states|state seals]] or [[Flags of the U.S. states|state flags]]. Some states have officially designated a state motto by an act of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], whereas other states have the motto only as an element of their seals. The motto of the United States itself is ''[[In God We Trust]]'', proclaimed by Congress and signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on July 30, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/currency/in-god-we-trust.shtml|title=History of 'In God we Trust'|publisher=U.S. Treasury|accessdate=2009-02-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228174920/http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-sheets/currency/in-god-we-trust.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto ''[[E Pluribus Unum]]'' (Latin for "One from many") was approved for use on the Great Seal of the United States in 1782, but was never adopted as the national motto through legislative action.

[[South Carolina]] has two official mottos, both of which are in Latin.&lt;ref name=SC/&gt; Kentucky, North Dakota, and Vermont also have two mottos, one in Latin and the other in English.&lt;ref name="KY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.gov/content.htm?parentCatID=74&amp;id=State%20Coat%20of%20Arms|title=State Coat of Arms|publisher=State of North Dakota|accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other states and territories have only one motto, except Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, which do not have any mottos.&lt;ref name=GU/&gt;&lt;ref name=NMI/&gt; [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]] are the most-used languages for state mottos, each used by 25 states and territories. Seven states and territories use another language, of which each language is only used once. Eight states and two territories have their mottos on their [[50 State Quarters|state quarter]]; thirty-eight states and four territories have their mottos on their state seals.

The dates given are, where possible, the earliest date that the motto was used in an official sense. Some state mottos are not official but are on the official state seal; in these cases the adoption date of the seal is given. The earliest use of a current motto is that of [[Puerto Rico]], ''Johannes est nomen ejus'', granted to the island by the Spanish in 1511.&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;

Convictions of computer crimes, or hacking, began as early as 1983 with the case of [[The 414s]] from the [[Area code 414|414 area code]] in [[Milwaukee]]. In that case, six teenagers broke into a number of high-profile computer systems, including [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Security Pacific Bank]]. On May 1, 1983, one of the 414s, [[The 414s|Gerald Wondra]], was sentenced to two years of probation.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES_1983"&gt;{{cite news|date=May 1, 1983|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2D71338F932A35756C0A962948260|title = Computer User Sentenced|format =|work= [[The New York Times]]| accessdate = September 11, 2008| last=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a prison term of nearly five years was handed down to [[Jeanson James Ancheta]], who created hundreds of [[zombie computer]]s to do his bidding via giant bot networks or [[botnet]]s.&lt;ref name="Digital_Underworld"&gt;pg 26—{{cite book| last = Richard Gissel| authorlink =| title = Digital Underworld|edition= August 23, 2005|page= 222| publisher = [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]]| isbn= 1-4116-4423-9|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then sold the botnets to the highest bidder who in turn used them for [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks]].&lt;ref name="CNET_2006"/&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, the longest sentence for computer crimes is that of [[Albert Gonzalez]] for 20 years.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|date=March 25, 2010|url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/tjx-sentencing/|title = TJX Hacker Gets 20 Years in Prison|publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| accessdate = January 22, 2012|quote=|first=Kim|last=Zetter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11112">The [[TRS-80]] series of computers were sold via [[Radio Shack]] &amp; [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] dealers in North America and Europe in the early 1980s.  Much software was developed for these computers, particularly the relatively successful [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] I, II &amp; III models, which were designed for both home office and entertainment (gaming) uses.

A '''list of software for the TRS-80''' computer series appears below.  This list includes software that was sold labelled as a Radio Shack or Tandy product.

[[Image:Maloca.jpg|thumb|Maloca]]
A '''maloca''' is an ancestral [[long house]] used by the natives of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], notably in [[Colombia]] and [[Brazil]]. Each community has a maloca with its own unique characteristics. Several families with [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] relations live together in a maloca, distributed around the long house in different compartments. In general, the [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the local descent group lives in the compartment nearest to the back wall of the long house. As well, each family has its own furnace.

During festivals and in formal ceremonies, which involve dances for males, the long house space is rearranged; the centre of the long house is the most important area where the dance takes place. Each maloca has two entrances, for men and for women. Married men and women sleep together, and unmarried men sleep separately, as do unmarried women. A maloca is traditionally surrounded with two gardens: the inner called the kitchen gardens (growing plants such as bananas, papaya, mango and pineapple) and the manioc gardens growing manioc (yuca).

For many years, these long houses were Jesuit missionaries’ objects of attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8050">[[File:Centrifugal governor.png|thumb|The [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]] is an early classic example of proportional control. The balls rise as speed increases, which closes the valve, until a balance is achieved between demand and the proportional gain of the linkage and valve.]]
'''Proportional control''', in engineering and process control, is a type of linear [[feedback]] [[control system]] in which a correction is applied to the controlled variable which is proportional to the difference between the desired value (set point, SP) and the measured value (process value,  PV). Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl and the [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]].  

The proportnal control concept is more complex than an [[on–off control]] system like a bi-metallic domestic [[thermostat]], but simpler than a [[PID controller|proportional–integral–derivative]] (PID) control system used in something like an automobile [[cruise control]]. On–off control will work where the overall system has a relatively long response time, but can result in instability if the system being controlled has a rapid response time. Proportional control overcomes this by modulating the output to the controlling device, such as a [[control valve]] at a level which avoids instability, but applies correction as fast as practicable by applying the optimum quantity of proportional gain.

A drawback of proportional control is that it cannot eliminate the residual SP − PV error in processes with compensation e.g. temperature control, as it requires an error to generate a proportional output. To overcome this the [[PI controller]] was devised, which uses a proportional term (P) to remove the gross error, and an integral term (I) to eliminate the residual offset error by integrating the error over time to produce an "I" component for the controller output.

==Theory==
In the proportional control algorithm, the controller output is proportional to the error signal, which is the difference between the [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and the [[process variable]]. In other words, the output of a proportional controller is the multiplication product of the error signal and the proportional gain.

This can be mathematically expressed as,

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}} = K_p\,{e(t)+p0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;p0&lt;/math&gt;: Controller output with zero error.
* &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;: Output of the proportional controller
* &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;: Proportional gain
* &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt;: Instantaneous process error at time ''t''.  &lt;math&gt;e(t)=SP - PV&lt;/math&gt;
* ''SP'': Set point
* ''PV'': Process variable
Constraints:  In a real plant, actuators have physical limitations that can be expressed as constraints on &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; may be bounded between −1 and +1 if those are the maximum output limits.

Qualifications:  It is preferable to express &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; as a unitless number.  To do this, we can express &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as a ratio with the span of the instrument.  This span is in the same units as error (e.g. C degrees) so the ratio has no units.

==Development of control block diagrams==
[[File:Simple feedback control loop2.png|thumb|Simple feedback control loop2]]
Proportional control dictates &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_c = k_c}}&lt;/math&gt;. From the block diagram shown, assume that ''r'', the setpoint, is the flowrate into a tank and ''e'' is ''error'', which is the difference between setpoint and measured process output. &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_p}},&lt;/math&gt; is process transfer function; the input into the block is flow rate and output is tank level. 

The output as a function of the setpoint, ''r'', is known as the ''closed-loop transfer function''.
&lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_{cl}}} = \frac{\mathit{g_{p}g_{c}}}{1 + g_{p}g_{c}},&lt;/math&gt; If the poles of &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{g_{cl}}},&lt;/math&gt; are stable, then the closed-loop system is stable.

==Offset error==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|300px|Flow control loop. If only a proportional controller, then there's always an offset between SP and PV.]]
Proportional control cannot eliminate the offset error, which is the difference between the desired value and the actual value, SP − PV error, as it requires an error to generate an output. When a disturbance (deviation from existing state) occurs in the process value being controlled, any corrective control action, based purely on Proportional Control, will always leave out the error between the next steady state and the desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]], and result in a residual error called the offset error. This error will increase as greater process demand is put on the system, or by increasing the set point.

Consider an object suspended by a spring as a simple proportional control.  The spring will attempt to maintain the object in a certain location despite disturbances which may temporarily displace it.  [[Hooke's law]] tells us that the spring applies a corrective force that is proportional to the object's displacement.  While this will tend to hold the object in a particular location, the absolute resting location of the object will vary if its mass is changed.  This difference in resting location is the offset error.

Imagine the same spring and object in a weightless environment.  In this case, the spring will tend to hold the object in the same location regardless of its mass.  There is no offset error in this case because the proportional action is not working against anything in the steady state.

==Proportional band==
The proportional band is the band of controller output over which the final control element (a control valve, for instance) will move from one extreme to another. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt; PB = \frac{100}{K_p}\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;, the proportional gain, is very high, the proportional band is very small, which means that the band of controller output over which the final control element will go from minimum to maximum (or vice versa) is very small. This is the case with on–off controllers, where &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; is very high and hence, for even a small error, the controller output is driven from one extreme to another.

==Advantages==
The car advae of proportional over on–off control can be demonstrated by car speed control. An analogy to on–off control is driving a car by applying either full power or no power and varying the [[duty cycle]], to control speed. The power would be on until the target speed is reached, and then the power would be removed, so the car reduces speed. When the speed falls below the target, with a certain [[hysteresis]], full power would again be applied. It can be seen that this would obviously result in poor control and large variations in speed. The more powerful the engine; the greater the instability, the heavier the car; the greater the stability. Stability may be expressed as correlating to the [[power-to-weight ratio]] of the vehicle. 

In proportional control, the power output is always proportional to the (actual versus target speed) error. If the car is at target speed and the speed increases slightly due to a falling gradient, the power is reduced slightly, or in proportion to the change in error, so that the car reduces speed gradually and reaches the new target point with very little, if any, "overshoot", which is much smoother control than on–off control. In practice, PID controllers are used for this and the large number of control processes that require more response control than proportional alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11964">'''Recession shapes''' are used by economists to describe different types of [[recession]]s.  There is no specific academic theory or classification system for recession shapes; rather the terminology is used as an informal shorthand to characterize recessions and their recoveries.&lt;ref name=TBM&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/explainer/2009/01/12/recession-was-brought-you-letters-u-v-and-l | title = This Recession Was Brought to You by the Letters U, V and L | author = Martha C. White | date = January 12, 2009 | work = The Big Money }} DEAD? {{cite web |url=http://blview21.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/this-recession-was-brought-to-you-by.html |title=This Recession Was Brought to You by the Letters U, V and L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used terms are V-shaped, U-shaped, W-shaped, and L-shaped recessions.  The shapes take their names from the approximate shape economic data make in graphs during recessions.  The letters can also be applied referring to the recoveries (''ie'' "V-shaped recovery").

== V-shaped recession ==
[[File:1953 recession in US.jpg|The [[Recession of 1953]] in the United States is a classic V-shape.&lt;br&gt;{{Legend2|#4682B4|Percent Change From Preceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product (annualized; seasonally adjusted)|border=1px solid #aaa}}; {{Legend2|#800000|Average GDP growth 1947–2009|border=1px solid #aaa}}&lt;br&gt;Source: [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]
|right|thumb|300px]]
In a V-shaped recession, the economy suffers a sharp but brief period of economic decline with a clearly defined trough, followed by a strong recovery. V-shapes are the normal shape for recession: "There is a strong historical “snap back” relationship between the strength of economic recovery and the severity of the preceding recession. Thus, recessions and their recoveries have a tendency to trace out a “V” shape."&lt;ref name=Macro&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://artsci.wustl.edu/~morley/shapes.pdf | title = The Shape of Things to Come | author = James Morley | date = April 27, 2009 | work = Macro Focus | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014125145/http://artsci.wustl.edu/~morley/shapes.pdf | archivedate = October 14, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear example of a v-shaped recession is the [[Recession of 1953]] in the United States.  In the early 1950s the economy in the United States was booming, but because the [[Federal Reserve]] expected inflation it raised interest rates, tipping the economy into recession.  In 1953 growth began to slow, in the third quarter, the economy shrank by 2.4 percent.  In the fourth quarter the economy shrank by 6.2 percent, and in the first quarter of 1954 it shrank by 2 percent before returning to growth.  By the fourth quarter of 1954, the economy was growing at an 8 percent pace, well above the trend.  Thus GDP ''growth'' for this recession forms a classic v-shape.{{fact|date=September 2012}} More importantly, the GDP graph itself has a V shape.

== U-shaped recession ==
[[File:1973-75 recession.jpg|The Recession of 1973–1975 in the United States could be considered a U-shaped recession.&lt;ref name=TBM/&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{Legend2|#4682B4|Percent Change From Preceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product (annualized; seasonally adjusted)|border=1px solid #aaa}}; {{Legend2|#800000|Average GDP growth 1947–2009|border=1px solid #aaa}}&lt;br&gt;Source: [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|left|thumb|300px]]

A U-shaped recession is longer than a V-shaped recession, and has a less-clearly defined trough.  GDP may shrink for several quarters, and only slowly return to trend growth.  [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]], former chief economist for the [[International Monetary Fund]], says a U-shaped recession is like a bathtub: "You go in. You stay in. The sides are slippery. You know, maybe there's some bumpy stuff in the bottom, but you don't come out of the bathtub for a long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june09/econshape_06-23.html | title = Deciphering the Shape of Economic Recovery | work = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] | date = June 23, 2009 }} (U,V,W,L)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1973–75 recession]] in the United States can be considered a U-shaped recession.  In early 1973 the economy began to shrink and continued to decline or have very low growth for nearly two years.  After bumping along the bottom, the economy climbed back to recovery in 1975.&lt;ref name=TBM/&gt;

== W-shaped recession ==
[[File:Early-80s recession.jpg|The [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States is sometimes given as an example of a W-shaped recession.&lt;br&gt;{{Legend2|#4682B4|Percent Change From Preceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product (annualized; seasonally adjusted)|border=1px solid #aaa}}; {{Legend2|#800000|Average GDP growth 1947–2009|border=1px solid #aaa}}&lt;br&gt;Source: [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]
|right|thumb|300px]]
In a W-shaped recession, (also known as a '''double-dip recession'''), the economy falls into recession, recovers with a short period of growth, then falls back into recession before finally recovering, giving a "down up down up" pattern resembling the letter W.

The [[early 1980s recession]] in the United States is cited as an example of a W-shaped recession. The [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] considers two recessions to have occurred in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name = NBER&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=NBER Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER }}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy fell into recession from January 1980 to July 1980, shrinking at an 8 percent annual rate from April to June 1980.  The economy then entered a quick period of growth, and in the first three months of 1981 grew at an 8.4 percent annual rate.  As the Federal Reserve under [[Paul Volcker]] raised interest rates to fight inflation, the economy dipped back into recession (hence, the "double dip") from July 1981 to November 1982.  The economy then entered a period of mostly robust growth for the rest of the decade.

The European debt crisis in the early-2010s is a more recent example of a W-shaped recession. A combination of government austerity, falling business investment, rising interest rates, global economic weakness, high energy prices, and weak consumer spending after the Great Recession of 2008-2009 tipped many Eurozone countries into a second recession from 2011 to 2013. Countries affected included Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Ireland, Germany, Cyprus, and Portugal. Greece, while part of the Eurozone, saw continuous economic contraction from 2007 to 2015, and thus does not fit the definition of a W-shaped recession, but rather an L-shaped recession. The United Kingdom is not a member of the Eurozone, but is a member of the European Union, and suffered a minor W-shaped recession when GDP contracted in Q4 2011 and Q1 2012.

== L-shaped recession ==
An L-shaped recession or [[Depression (economics)| depression]] occurs when an economy has a severe recession and does not return to trend line growth &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for many years, if ever.  The steep drop or degrowth, is followed by a flat line makes the shape of an L.  This is the most severe of the different shapes of recession. Alternative terms for long periods of underperformance include "[[Depression (economics)|depression]]" and [[lost decade (disambiguation)|lost decade]]; compare also "[[economic malaise|malaise]]".

[[File:Japan's asset bubble.jpg||The [[Japanese asset price bubble]] led to a [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade in Japan]]; this period has been characterized as an L-shaped recovery.&lt;br&gt;{{Legend2|#4682B4|Percent Change From Preceding Year in Real Gross Domestic Product|border=1px solid #aaa}}; &lt;br&gt;{{Legend2|#800000|Average GDP growth 1950–2000|border=1px solid #aaa}}&lt;br&gt;Source: Penn World Tables
|left|thumb|300px]]  A classic example of an L-shaped recession occurred in Japan following the bursting of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] in 1990.  From the end of World War II throughout the 1980s, Japan's economy was growing robustly.  In the late 1980s a massive [[economic bubble|asset-price bubble]] developed in Japan.  After the bubble burst the economy suffered from [[deflation]], and experienced years of sluggish growth; never returning to the higher growth Japan experienced from 1950-1990.  After the [[late-2000s recession]] in the United States followed a similar economic bubble (the [[United States housing bubble]]) some economists feared the U.S. economy could enter a prolonged period of low growth even after recovering from the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/252460/ | title = The US Recession: V or U or W or L-Shaped? | author = [[Nouriel Roubini]] | date = April 7, 2008 | work = RGE Monitor | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090717062330/http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/252460 | archivedate = July 17, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, however, U.S. GDP growth rebounded, allaying fears of stagnation.

The Greek recession of 2007–2016 could be considered an example of an L-shaped recession, as Greek GDP growth in 2017 was merely 1.6%. Greece technically suffered through four separate, but compounding, periods of contractions over the 9 year period.

== Other shapes ==
Since the terms are informal, commentators will sprinkle in other descriptions.  Financial blogger [[Mike Shedlock]] describes a WW-shaped recession with the country "slipping in and out of recession for a prolonged period of time, perhaps 3-4 years or more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/04/case-for-l-shaped-recession.html | author = Mike Shedlock | title = Case for an "L" Shaped Recession | date = April 8, 2008 | work = Mish's Global Economic Trend Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financier [[George Soros]] has said the current recession may be an "inverted [[square root]] sign"-shaped recession.  Soros explained to [[Reuters]] that this meant: "You hit bottom and you automatically rebound some, but then you don't come out of it in a V-shape recovery or anything like that. You settle down — step down."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE53537D20090406 | title = Soros says U.S. faces "lasting slowdown" | author = Jennifer Ablan and Daniel Burns | work = [[Reuters]] | date = April 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[2001 recession]], a trader named Thierry Martin writing for [[Jim Cramer]]'s [[TheStreet.com]] proposed a J-shaped recovery, which he says was "strictly for optimists" and could be caused by "a new high-tech product category, or even a series of improving earnings reports, [that] could send us sky-high without looking back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.thestreet.com/story/1463701/the-best-of-realmoney-mulls-the-recovery.html | title = The Best of RealMoney Mulls the Recovery | work = [[TheStreet.com]] | author = Marty Klinkenberg | date = June 16, 2001 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the J-shaped economic recovery is unrelated to the [[J-curve]] phenomenon.

[[File:Ring_of_Bright_Water_first_edition_cover.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Cover of first edition]]
'''''Ring of Bright Water''''' is a book by [[Gavin Maxwell]] about his life in a remote house in coastal Scotland where he kept several wild otters as pets.&lt;ref name=penguin&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ring of Bright Water Trilogy|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140290493,00.html|publisher=penguin.com.uk|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=RING OF BRIGHT WATER|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gavin-maxwell-3/ring-of-bright-water/|publisher=kirkusreviews.com|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First published in 1960, it became a best seller and is considered a literary masterpiece,&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; eventually selling over two million copies.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; A fictionalised [[Ring of Bright Water (film)|film of the same name]] was made from it&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; and released in 1969.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;

==Book==

The book describes how Maxwell brought a [[smooth-coated otter]] back from [[Iraq]] and raised it at "Camusfeàrna" (the name he used for his house at Sandaig near [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]]), on the west coast of [[Scotland]]. He took the otter, called Mijbil, to the [[London Zoological Society]], where it was decided that this was a previously unknown [[subspecies]], and it was named after him: ''Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli'' (or [[colloquialism|colloquially]], "Maxwell's otter").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dani Garavelli |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/dani-garavelli-gavin-maxwell-s-love-of-nature-1-3452667 |title=Gavin Maxwell's Love of Nature |publisher=Scotland on Sunday |date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's title was taken from a poem by [[Kathleen Raine]],&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; who claimed in her autobiography that Maxwell had been the love of her life. Her relationship with Maxwell deteriorated after 1956 when she indirectly caused the death of Mijbil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Janet Watts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/08/guardianobituaries.books |title=Kathleen Raine: Obituary |publisher=Guardian |date=8 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A reviewer in the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' described the book as having "inspired a generation of naturalists" and referred to it as a "classic account of man and wildlife". The review calls ''Ring of Bright Water'' "one of the most popular wildlife books ever written", as over two million copies had been sold worldwide by 1999.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news |title=Film helps Ring of Bright Water to shine again |newspaper=Sunday Herald |date=21 February 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18982649.html |accessdate=18 November 2014 |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Two sequels were published: ''The Rocks Remain'' (1963) and ''Raven Seek Thy Brother'' (1968), which were less idyllic than the first, chronicling accidents and misfortunes involving both the otters and Maxwell's life.&lt;ref name="chinn"/&gt; All three books were republished as ''Ring of Bright Water: A Trilogy'' in 2011 by Nonpareil Books.&lt;ref name="Book news"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ring of bright water; a trilogy |publisher=Reference &amp; Research Book News |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-257994228.html |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy does not include the full text of the latter two volumes, but removes the tangential travel sections which take place outside Scotland.&lt;ref name="chinn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chinn|first1=Austin|title=Introduction to Ring of Bright Water: A Trilogy|publisher=Nonpareil|isbn=978-1567924008|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Shuttle missions designated '''STS-3xx''' (officially called '''Launch On Need''' (LON) missions) were rescue missions which would have been mounted to rescue the crew of a [[Space Shuttle]] if their vehicle was damaged and deemed unable to make a successful reentry. Such a mission would have been flown if [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] determined that the heat shielding tiles and [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] panels of a currently flying orbiter were damaged beyond the repair capabilities of the available on-orbit repair methods. These missions were also referred to as '''Launch on Demand''' (LOD) and '''Contingency Shuttle Crew Support'''. The program was initiated following [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|loss of Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003. No mission of this type was launched during the Space Shuttle program.

==Procedure==
The orbiter and four of the crew which were due to fly the next planned mission would be retasked to the rescue mission. The planning and training processes for a rescue flight would allow [[NASA]] to launch the mission within a period of 40 days of its being called up. During that time the damaged (or disabled) shuttle's crew would have to take refuge on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The ISS is able to support both crews for around 80 days, with oxygen supply being the limiting factor.&lt;ref name=FRRBriefingTranscript&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/150494main_frr_brief_20060617.pdf |title=Flight Readiness Review Briefing, Transcript of press briefing carried on NASA TV|date= 17 June 2006|publisher=NASA|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within NASA, this plan for maintaining the shuttle crew at the ISS is known as Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) operations.&lt;ref name=CSCSResourceBook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153444main_CSCS_Resource_%20Book.pdf |title=Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS)/Rescue Flight Resource Book|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|date= 12 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to [[STS-121]] all rescue missions were to be designated '''STS-300'''.

In the case of an abort to orbit, where the shuttle is unable to reach the ISS orbit and the thermal protection system inspections suggest the shuttle cannot return to Earth safely, the ISS may be capable of descent down to meet the shuttle. Such a procedure is known as a joint underspeed recovery.&lt;ref name=jointunderspeed&gt;[https://postdoc.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/postdoc/get/download/HORM-1-Final.to.AdvisoryCommittee.doc?url_id=117371&amp;ext=doc Engineering for Complex Systems Knowledge Engineering for Safety and Success Project]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To save weight, and to allow the combined crews of both shuttles to return to Earth safely, many shortcuts would have to be made, and the risks of launching another orbiter without resolving the failure which caused the previous orbiter to become disabled would have to be faced.

==Flight hardware==
A number of pieces of Launch on Need flight hardware were built in preparation for a rescue mission including:
* An extra three recumbent seats to be located in the aft middeck (ditch area)
* Two handholds located on the starboard wall of the ditch area
* Individual Cooling Units mounting provisions
* Seat 5 modification to properly secure in a recumbent position
* Mounting provisions for four additional Sky Genie egress devices (see picture on right) [[File:Ochoa on Sky Genie - GPN-2000-001068.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Training with a Sky Genie egress device]]

==Remote Control Orbiter==
{{update|section|date=February 2013}}
The Remote Control Orbiter (RCO), also known as the Autonomous Orbiter Rapid Prototype (AORP), was a term used by NASA to describe a shuttle that could perform entry and landing without a human crew on board via remote control. NASA developed the RCO in-flight maintenance (IFM) cable to extend existing auto-land capabilities of the shuttle to allow remaining tasks to be completed from the ground. The purpose of the RCO IFM cable was to provide an electrical signal connection between the Ground Command Interface Logic (GCIL) and the flight deck panel switches.  The cable is approximately {{convert|28|ft|m}} long, weighs over {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}}, and has 16 connectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kestenbaum | first = David | title = Emergency Rescue Plans in Place for Astronauts | publisher=NPR | date = 29 June 2006  | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5521668 | accessdate =19 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070019347_2007018898.pdf USA Master Template - Revised&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  With this system, signals could be sent from the Mission Control Center to the unmanned shuttle to control the following systems:
*[[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU) start and run
*Air Data Probe (ADP) deployment
*Main [[Landing gear|Landing Gear]] (MLG) arming and deployment
*[[Drag chute]] arming and deployment
*[[Fuel cell]] reactant valve closure

The RCO IFM cable first flew aboard [[STS-121]] and was transferred to the ISS for storage during the mission. The cable remained aboard the ISS until the end of the Shuttle program. Prior to STS-121 the plan was for the damaged shuttle to be abandoned and allowed to burn up on reentry. The prime landing site for an RCO orbiter would be [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California.&lt;ref name="NSF-AORP"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bergin|date=7 August 2006|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/08/nasa-enhancing-unmanned-orbiter-capability/ |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com |title= NASA enhancing unmanned orbiter capability}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwards Air Force Base]], a site already used to support shuttle landings, was the prime RCO landing site for the first missions carrying the equipment; however Vandenberg was later selected as the prime site as it is nearer the coast, and the shuttle can be ditched in the Pacific should a problem develop that would make landing dangerous. [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] is a likely alternate site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tariq|last=Malik|date=29 June 2006|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060629_newtools.html |publisher=Space.com|title=Shuttle to Carry Tools for Repair and Remote-Control Landing}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major consideration in determining the landing site would be the desire to perform a high-risk re-entry far away from populated areas. The flight resource book, and flight rules in force during STS-121 suggest that the damaged shuttle would reenter on a trajectory such that if it should break up, it would do so with debris landing in the South Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=CSCSResourceBook/&gt;

The Soviet [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran shuttle]] was also remotely controlled during its entire maiden flight without a crew aboard. Landing was carried out by an on board, automatic system.&lt;ref name=Karimov_A.G.&gt;{{cite book|title=Aerospace Systems: Book of Technical Papers |editor1-first=G.E.|editor1-last=Lozino-Lozinsky|editor2-first=A.G.|editor2-last=Bratukhin.|location=Moscow|publisher=Publishing House of Moscow Aviation Institute|year=1997|chapter=Control of Onboard Complex of Equipment|last1=Karimov|first1=A.G.|page=206|quote=The structure is built with allowance for three possible Orbiter’s control modes: automatic, manual and under commands from the ground-based control complex (GBCC).|url=http://www.buran.ru/other/p-206.zip|format=ZIP MSWORD|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011 the [[Boeing X-37]] extended duration robotic spaceplane has demonstrated autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639|publisher=Office of the Secretary of the Air Force (Public Affairs)|title=X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle|accessdate =12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801120013/http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639|archivedate=1 August 2013}}

==Pre-ISS era==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
The STS-3xx missions were developed in the aftermath of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|loss of ''Columbia'']]. However, NASA spent some effort researching rescue options even before the disaster. Before the ISS was launched, or in the event of a Shuttle being unable to reach the station, crews would have had to transfer directly between Shuttles. The orbiters would have been unable to dock, so while they used their RMS arms to grapple each other, the crew would have made an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] between the Shuttles. This would have been carried out using the two EVA-designated mission specialists wearing the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|Shuttle/ISS Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) spacesuits, while the remaining crew would have been sealed up in pressurized [[Personal Rescue Enclosure]] and carried over either by hand, or using a pulley system (akin to that of a clothesline pulley) like that employed in the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] program for lifting samples from the Moon's surface into the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].

==Sample timeline==
Had a LON mission been required, a timeline would have been developed similar to the following:

*'''FD-10''' A decision on the requirement for Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) is expected by flight day 10 of a nominal mission.
*'''FD-10''' Shortly after the need for CSCS operations a group C powerdown of the shuttle will take place.
*'''FD-11-&gt;21''' During flight days 11 ~ 21 of the mission the shuttle will remain docked to the international space station (ISS) with the hatch open. Various items will be transferred between the shuttle and ISS.
*'''FD-21''' Hatch closure will be conducted from the ISS side. The shuttle crew remains on the ISS, leaving the shuttle unmanned
*'''FD-21''' Deorbit Burn – Burn occurs four hours after separation. Orbiter lands at Vandenberg Air Force Base under remote control from Houston. (Prior to STS-121, the payload bay doors would have been left open to promote vehicle breakup.)
*'''FD-45''' Launch of rescue flight. 35 days from call-up to Launch for the rescue flight is a best-estimate of the minimum time it will take before a rescue flight is launched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153444main_CSCS_Resource_%20Book.pdf Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS)/Rescue Flight Resource Book. 12 July 2005] p.101&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FD-45-&gt;47''' The rescue flight catches up with the ISS, conducting heat shield inspections en route.
*'''FD-47''' The rescue flight docks with the station, on day three of its mission.
*'''FD-48''' Shuttle crew enters the rescue orbiter. Vehicle with a crew complement of 11 undocks from ISS.
*'''FD-49''' Rescue orbiter re-enters atmosphere over Indian or Pacific Ocean for landing at either Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base. A Russian [[progress spacecraft|''Progress'']] resupply spacecraft is launched at later date to resupply ISS crew. ISS precautionary de-crew preparations begin.
*'''FD-58''' De-crew ISS due to [[ISS ECLSS|ECLSS]] [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] exhaustion in event ''Progress'' unable to perform resupply function.

'''STS-400''' was the [[Space Shuttle]] contingency support (Launch On Need) flight that would have been launched using {{OV|105}} if a major problem occurred on {{OV|104}} during [[STS-125]], the final [[Hubble Space Telescope]] servicing mission (HST SM-4).&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/345918main_FLT_PLN_400_B.pdf|title=STS-400 Flight Plan|author=[[NASA]] Mission Operations Directorate|date=2 June 2008|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 May 2009|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/sts400-ready-and-waiting.html|title=STS-400: Ready and Waiting|author=NASA|date=5 May 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/04/17/the-sts-400-shuttle-rescue-mission-scenario/|title=The STS-400 Shuttle Rescue Mission Scenario|first=Nancy |last=Atkinson|date=17 April 2009|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/01/sts-125400-single-pad-option-progress-protect-ares-i-x/|title=STS-125/400 Single Pad option progress – aim to protect Ares I-X|last=Bergin|first=Chris|date=19 January 2009|publisher=[[NASASpaceflight.com]]|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the much lower [[orbital inclination]] of the HST compared to the ISS, the shuttle crew would have been unable to use the [[International Space Station]] as a "safe haven," and NASA would not have been able to follow the usual plan of recovering the crew with another shuttle at a later date.&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;  Instead, NASA developed a plan to conduct a shuttle-to-shuttle rescue mission, similar to [[STS-3xx#Pre-ISS era|proposed rescue missions for pre-ISS flights]].&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="move"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/05/hubble-servicing-mission-moves-up/|title=Hubble Servicing Mission moves up|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=16 October 2007|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|first=Chris |last=Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rescue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2006/07/nasa-evaluates-rescue-options-for-hubble-mission/|title=NASA Evaluates Rescue Options for Hubble Mission|accessdate=16 October 2007|date=31 July 2007|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|first=John |last=Copella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rescue mission would have been launched only three days after call-up and as early as seven days after the launch of STS-125, since the crew of ''Atlantis'' would only have about three weeks of consumables after launch.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;

The mission was first rolled out in September 2008 to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] two weeks after the STS-125 shuttle was rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]], creating a rare scenario in which two shuttles were on launch pads at the same time.&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; In October 2008, however, STS-125 was delayed and rolled back to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|VAB]].

Initially, STS-125 was retargeted for no earlier than February 2009. This changed the STS-400 vehicle from [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] to [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]. The mission was redesignated STS-401 due to the swap from ''Endeavour'' to ''Discovery''. STS-125 was then delayed further, allowing ''Discovery'' mission [[STS-119]] to fly beforehand. This resulted in the rescue mission reverting to ''Endeavour'', and the STS-400 designation being reinstated.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;  In January, 2009, it was announced that NASA was evaluating conducting both launches from Complex 39A in order to avoid further delays to [[Ares I-X]], which, at the time, was scheduled for launch from LC-39B in the September 2009 timeframe.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;  It was planned that after the STS-125 mission in October 2008, Launch Complex 39B would undergo the conversion for use in [[Project Constellation]] for the [[Ares I-X]] rocket.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt; Several of the members on the NASA mission management team said at the time (2009) that single-pad operations were possible, but the decision was made to use both pads.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;

=== Early mission plans ===
[[File:Space shuttles Atlantis (STS-125) and Endeavour (STS-400) on launch pads.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' (foreground) and ''Endeavour'' on LC-39A and LC-39B in 2008.]]
Three different concept mission plans were evaluated: The first would be to use a shuttle-to-shuttle docking, where the rescue shuttle docks with the damaged shuttle, by flying upside down and backwards, relative to the damaged shuttle.&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt; It was unclear whether this would be practical, as the forward structure of either orbiter could collide with the payload bay of the other, resulting in damage to both orbiters. The second option that was evaluated, would be for the rescue orbiter to rendezvous with the damaged orbiter, and perform station-keeping while using its [[Canadarm|Remote Manipulator System]] (RMS) to transfer crew from the damaged orbiter. This mission plan would result in heavy fuel consumption. The third concept would be for the damaged orbiter to grapple the rescue orbiter using its RMS, eliminating the need for station-keeping.&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; The rescue orbiter would then transfer crew using its RMS, as in the second option, and would be more fuel efficient than the station-keeping option.&lt;ref name="rescue" /&gt;

The concept that was eventually decided upon was a modified version of the third concept. The rescue orbiter would use its RMS to grapple the end of the damaged orbiter's RMS.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescue2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/10/sts-400-nasa-draws-up-their-hubble-rescue-plans/|title=

=== Preparations ===
[[File:STS400CT.svg|thumb|Diagram showing one of the proposals for crew and equipment transfers during STS-400.]]
After its most recent mission ([[STS-123]]), ''Endeavour'' was taken to the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] for routine maintenance. Following the maintenance, ''Endeavour'' was on stand-by for [[STS-326]] which would have been flown in the case that [[STS-124]] would not have been able to return to Earth safely. Stacking of the [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRB) began on 11 July 2008. One month later, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] arrived at KSC and was mated with the SRBs on 29 August 2008. ''Endeavour'' joined the stack on 12 September 2008 and was rolled out to Pad 39B one week later.

Since STS-126 launched before STS-125, ''Atlantis'' was rolled back to the VAB on 20 October, and ''Endeavour'' rolled around to Launch Pad 39A on 23 October. When it was time to launch STS-125, ''Atlantis'' rolled out to pad 39A.&lt;ref name="NSF-singlepad"/&gt;

=== Mission plan ===
The Mission would not have included the extended heatshield inspection normally performed on flight day two.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; Instead, an inspection would have been performed after the crew was rescued.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; On flight day two, ''Endeavour'' would have performed the rendezvous and grapple with ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; On flight day three, the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] would have been performed.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="briefingmats"/&gt; During the first EVA, Megan McArthur, Andrew Feustel and John Grunsfeld would have set up a tether between the airlocks.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; They would have also transferred a large size [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) and, after McArthur had repressurized, transferred McArthur's EMU back to ''Atlantis''. Afterwards they would have repressurized on ''Endeavour'', ending flight day two activities.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

The final two EVA were planned for flight day three.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; During the first, Grunsfeld would have depressurized on ''Endeavour'' in order to assist Gregory Johnson and Michael Massimino in transferring an EMU to ''Atlantis''. He and Johnson would then repressurize on ''Endeavour'', and Massimino would have gone back to ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; He, along with Scott Altman and Michael Good would have taken the rest of the equipment and themselves to ''Endeavour'' during the final EVA. They would have been standing by in case the RMS system should malfunction.&lt;ref name="rescue2" /&gt; The damaged orbiter would have been commanded by the ground to deorbit and go through landing procedures over the Pacific, with the impact area being north of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt; On flight day five, ''Endeavour'' would have had a full heat shield inspection, and land on flight day eight.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rescueplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UTRescue"/&gt;

This mission could have marked the end of the Space Shuttle program, as it is considered unlikely that the program would have been able to continue with just two remaining [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]s, ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Watson | first = Traci | title = The mission NASA hopes won't happen |work=USA Today | date = 22 March 2005  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-03-22-shuttle-cover_x.htm  | accessdate =13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 21 May 2009, NASA officially released ''Endeavour'' from the rescue mission, freeing the orbiter to begin processing for [[STS-127]]. This also allowed NASA to continue processing LC-39B for the upcoming Ares I-X launch, as during the stand-down period, NASA installed a new lightning protection system, similar to those found on the [[Atlas V]] and [[Delta IV]] pads, to protect the newer, taller Ares I rocket from lightning strikes.&lt;ref name="FD11a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090521fd11/index2.html|title=Iffy weather forecast for Friday's shuttle landing|first=William |last=Harwood |date=21 May 2009|publisher=CBS News, Spaceflightnow.com|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Bergin|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/05/atlantis-sets-sights-saturday-endeavour-sts-127-flow/|title=Endeavour in STS-127 flow|date=22 May 2009|publisher=NASA Spaceflight.com|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==STS-335==
[[STS-134]] was the last scheduled flight of the Shuttle program. Because no more were planned after this, a special mission was developed as STS-335 to act as the LON mission for this flight. This would have paired [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']] with [[Space Shuttle external tank|ET-122]], which had been refurbished following damage by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/04/downstream-processing-and-planning-preparing-fleet-to-sts-135/|title=Downstream processing and planning – preparing the fleet through to STS-135|accessdate=14 June 2009|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=26 April 2009|first=Chris |last=Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there would be no next mission, STS-335 would also carry a [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] filled with supplies to replenish the station.&lt;ref name="STS-335"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bergin|date=13 October 2009|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/10/nasa-evaluate-sts-335-sts-133-cross-country-farewell/ |title=NASA Evaluate STS-335/STS-133 Cross Country Farewell| publisher=NASASpaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate authorized [[STS-135]] as a regular flight on 5 August 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Clark|date=6 August 2010|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1008/06senate/ |title=Senate approves bill adding extra space shuttle flight| publisher=Spaceflight Now Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the House on 29 September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Abrams|date=30 September 2010|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/national/nasa-bill-passed-by-congress-would-allow-for-one-additional-shuttle-flight-in-2011|title=NASA bill passed by Congress would allow for one additional shuttle flight in 2011|publisher=ABC Action News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707073317/http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/national/nasa-bill-passed-by-congress-would-allow-for-one-additional-shuttle-flight-in-2011|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later signed by President Obama on 11 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|date=11 October 2010|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11518049 |title=Obama signs Nasa up to new future|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; However funding for the mission remained dependent on a subsequent appropriations bill.

Nonetheless NASA converted STS-335, the final Launch On Need mission, into an operational mission (STS-135) on 20 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.flatoday.net/2011/01/atlantis-officially-designated-final.html Dean, James "Atlantis officially named final shuttle mission" (23 January 2010) ''Florida Today'']&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 February 2011, program managers told their workforce that STS-135 would fly "regardless" of the funding situation via a continuing resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/02/nasa-insist-sts-135-will-fly-payload-options-assessment/ NASA managers insist STS-135 will fly – Payload options under assessment] NASASpaceFlight.com&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the U.S. government budget approved in mid-April 2011 called for $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion for NASA's space operations division, including the Space Shuttle and space station programs. According to NASA, the budget running through 30 September 2011 ended all concerns about funding the STS-135 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110421budget/|title=Federal budget pays for summer shuttle flight|publisher=Spaceflight Now|author=Stephen Clark|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the successful completion of STS-134, STS-335 was rendered unnecessary and launch preparations for STS-135 continued as Atlantis neared LC-39A during her rollout as STS-134 landed at the nearby [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/live-endeavour-one-final-time-conclude-sts-134/ Endeavour arrives home one final time to conclude STS-134 | NASASpaceFlight.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the STS-135, no shuttle was available for a rescue mission. [[STS-135#Crew|A different rescue plan]] was devised, involving the four crew members remaining aboard the International Space Station, and returning aboard [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft one at a time over the next year. That contingency was not required.

'''''Science and Civilisation in China''''' (1954–[2016]) is a series of books initiated and edited by British [[biochemist]], [[historian]] and [[sinologist]] [[Joseph Needham| Joseph Needham, Ph.D]] (1900–1995). Needham was a well-respected scientist before undertaking this encyclopedia and was even responsible for the "S" in [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/20/archives/joseph-needham-the-real-thing.html|title=Joseph Needham, the Real Thing|last=Boston|first=Richard|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with the [[history of science and technology in China]]. To date there have been seven volumes in twenty-seven books. The series was on the Modern Library Board's [[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|100 Best Nonfiction]] books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Library, 1999. [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnonfiction.html 100 Best Nonfiction."]&lt;/ref&gt; Needham's work was the first of its kind to praise Chinese scientific contributions and provide their history and connection to global knowledge in contrast to eurocentric historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Stefan Gaarsmand|date=2013|title=Chinese Influences or Images?: Fluctuating Histories of How Enlightenment Europe Read China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=3|pages=623–660|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Needham—along with an international team of collaborators—initiated the project to study the science, technology, and civilisation of ancient China. This project produced a series of volumes published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The project is still  continuing under the guidance of the Publications Board of the [[Needham Research Institute]] (NRI), chaired by [[Christopher Cullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nri.cam.ac.uk/science.html|title=Science and Civilisation in China|publisher=Needham Research Institute|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 of the encyclopedia was the first body of work to describe Chinese improvements to [[cartography]], [[geology]], [[seismology]] and [[mineralogy]]. It also includes descriptions of nautical technology, sailing charts, and wheel-maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779676|title=Science and civilisation in China|last=1900-1995,|first=Needham, Joseph,|others=Wang, Ling, 1917-1994., Métailie, Georges., Huang, H. T.|isbn=052105799X|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=779676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham's transliteration of [[Chinese characters]] uses the [[Wade-Giles]] system, though the aspirate apostrophe (e.g., ''ch'i'') was rendered 'h' (viz. ''chhi''; traditional Chinese: 氣; Mandarin Pinyin: ''[[qì]]''). However, it was abandoned in favor of the [[pinyin]] system by the NRI board in April 2004, with Volume 5, Part 11 becoming the first to use the new system.&lt;ref&gt;volume 5, part 11, page xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Needham]]’s interest in the history of Chinese science developed while he worked as an Embryologist at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Needham had already published works relating to the history of science, including his 1934 book titled ''[[A History of Embryology]]'', and was open to expanding his historical scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=92 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s first encounter with Chinese culture occurred in 1937 when three Chinese medical students arrived to work with him at the Cambridge Biochemical Laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=409 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s interest in Chinese civilization and scientific progress grew as a result and led him to learn Chinese from his students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two of those students,[[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], would later become his collaborators on ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brook |first1=Timothy |title=The Sinology of Joseph Needham |journal=Modern China |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=3 |page=341 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/009770049602200304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, China’s eastern universities were forced to relocate to the west as a result of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winchester|first1=Simon|date=2008|title=The man who unveiled China|url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7203|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese academics sought the help of the British government in an effort to preserve their intellectual life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1942, Needham was selected and appointed as a diplomat by the British government and tasked with traveling to China and assessing the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years there, Needham discovered that the Chinese had developed techniques and mechanisms which were centuries older than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Needham became concerned with the exclusion of China in the history of science and began to question why the Chinese ceased to develop new techniques after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Publication ===
Armed with his new-found knowledge, Needham returned to Cambridge in 1948 and began working on a book with one of the Chinese medical students he met in Cambridge, [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], who was now a professor at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=883 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he planned on releasing only one volume of his findings through the Cambridge University Press, but later changed his mind and proposed up to eleven volumes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1954, Needham published the first volume of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', which was well received and was followed by other volumes which focused on specific scientific fields and topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=93 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham, along with his collaborators, was personally involved in all of the volumes of Science and Civilization, up until Needham’s death in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Needham’s death, Cambridge University established an institution named after Needham, The [[Needham Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=411 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the institution continue Needham’s work and have published 8 additional volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', since his death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Summaries==
There have been two summaries or condensations of the vast amount of material found in ''Science and Civilisation''. The first, a one-volume [[popular history]] book by [[Robert K. G. Temple|Robert Temple]]  entitled ''The Genius of China'', was completed in a little over 12 months to be available in 1986 for the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to China. This addressed only the contributions made by China and had a "warm welcome" from Joseph Needham in the introduction, though in the ''Beijing Review'' he criticized that it had "some mistakes ... and various statements that I would like to have seen expressed rather differently".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|journal=Beijing Review|url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/beijing_review.pdf|title=East-West: Bridging the Scientific Chasm|author=Ling Yuan|date=Mar 23, 1987|accessdate=2011-02-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A second was made by [[Colin Ronan]], a writer on the history of science, who produced a five volume condensation ''The Shorter Science and Civilisation: An abridgement of Joseph Needham's original text'', between 1980 and his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Colin Ronan|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980–95}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes cover:
# China and Chinese science
# Mathematics, astronomy, meteorology and the earth sciences
# Magnetism, nautical technology, navigation, voyages
# Mechanical engineering, machines, clockwork, windmills, aeronautics
# Civil engineering, roads, bridges, hydraulic engineering

==Reception==

=== Criticism from Scholars ===
''Science and Civilisation in China '' is highly regarded among scholars because of its extensive comparative coverage of Chinese innovations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finlay, Robert. "China, the West, and World History in Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China." ''Journal of World History'', vol. 11 no. 2, 2000, pp. 265-303. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/jwh.2000.0035&lt;/ref&gt; Needham spent a large amount of time translating, and decoding primary sources for ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of his efforts helped to confirm that scientific advancements, and analytical ingenuity were abundant in [[China]] in early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Peter C."Joseph Needham's Problematic Legacy." ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 47 no. 1, 2006, pp. 175-178. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/tech.2006.0092&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, beginning with his first volume, some scholars in the [[Science|scientific]], [[history of science]], and [[sinology]] fields criticized Needham’s work for being too comparative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his work, Needham wrote that numerous Chinese inventions ended up in the west, including the [[Compass|magnetic compass]], and the [[Clock|mechanical clock]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham also wrote that once these inventions reached [[Europe]], they had a great impact on social life, and helped to stimulate the economy, as well as usher in the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars criticized his [[Marxism|Marxist]] background, his understanding of Chinese culture, and his methodology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dr. of History Roger Hart wrote "A Post-Needham Critique" in an East Asia journal accusing Needham of attributing scientific achievements to Chinese civilization in contrast to evidence by exaggerating claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Roger|date=1999|title=Beyond Science and Civilization: A Post-Needham Critique|jstor=43150558|journal=East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=16|pages=88–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor of Volume 6, [[Nathan Sivin]] and Needham's research collaborator [[Lu Gwei-djen]] include updated research to support some of Needham's claims. However, Sivin is critical of Needham suggesting more research is required citing his assumptions of Taoisms' role in promoting scientific feats in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199920082-0006|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=2013-04-22|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Acclaim ===
Needham's ''Science and Civilisation in China'' did not receive criticism from scholars in other fields of study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Groff Conklin]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1955 said that Vol. 1 "presents a richly patterned tapestry of the development of civilization in the Far East", and that "it is for everyone who is intrigued by the unknown, whether future (science fiction) or past (scientific history)".&lt;ref name="conklin195503"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Jonathan Spence]] wrote in a 1982 [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article "this work is the most ambitious undertaking in Chinese studies during this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/books/the-china-the-west-knew-nothing-about.html|title=THE CHINA THE WEST KNEW NOTHING ABOUT|last=Spence|first=Jonathan|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times obituary for Needham stated that those educated in China hail Dr. Needham's encyclopedia and compare him to [[Charles Darwin]] in terms of importance regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/obituaries/joseph-needham-china-scholar-from-britain-dies-at-94.html|title=Joseph Needham, China Scholar From Britain, Dies at 94|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Arun Bala, the author of ''[[The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science]],'' Needham postulates that scientific knowledge may evolve to more closely resemble Chinese philosophical views of nature; signifying his belief in Chinese inherent wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bala|first=Arun|date=2006|title=The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230601215|doi=10.1057/9780230601215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Needham Question ==

=== Origins ===
After his extensive research of Chinese innovations, [[Joseph Needham]] became concerned with the question: Why did modern science stop developing in China after the 16th century?&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Needham believed this was due to [[China]]’s sociopolitical system which was not affected by Chinese inventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[China]] did not have a structure in which merchants could profit off of their inventions, unlike the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once Chinese inventions reached [[Europe]], they revolutionized their sociopolitical system, which used the inventions to dominate political rivals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Needham, Chinese innovations, such as [[gunpowder]], the [[compass]], [[paper]], and [[printing]], helped transform European [[Feudalism]] into [[Capitalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, [[Europe]] was actively financing scientific discoveries, and nautical exploration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[paradox]] of this conclusion was that [[Europe]] surpassed [[China]] in scientific innovations, using Chinese technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Re-formulation ===
After several volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'' had been published, Needham was questioned about his theory of the origin of science in the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham, troubled by past criticism and dismissal of his work as [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, declined to publicly state his relationship to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, in Needham’s work ''[[The Grand Titration]],'' he re-framed his question as: ''“why, between the first century BC and the fifteenth century AD, Chinese civilization was much more efficient than occidental in applying human natural knowledge to practical human needs”''&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. “Science and Society in East and West.” In ''The Grand Titration: Science and Society in East and West''. By Joseph Needham, 190–217. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1969a.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformulation of the question, changed the narrative of ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, the question centered around [[China]]’s failure to develop scientifically after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The focus shifted towards an examination of China’s accomplishments prior to development in Europe, this focus was addressed throughout ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0006.xml#obo-9780199920082-0006-bibItem-0003|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued Debate ===
Needham's attempt to uncover the reasoning behind China's rise and fall as an elite scientific and technologically advanced nation has been expounded upon and debated for decades including [[Justin Yifu Lin]]'s [[University of Chicago Press|University of Chicago]] journal article "The Needham Puzzle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=January 1995|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/452150|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stigler's law of eponymy''', proposed by [[University of Chicago]]  [[statistics]] professor [[Stephen Stigler]] in his 1980 publication "Stigler’s law of eponymy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gieryn|editor-first= T. F.|title=Science and social structure: a festschrift for Robert K. Merton|publisher= NY Academy of Sciences|year= 1980|pages= 147–57|location= New York|isbn=0-89766-043-9}}, republished in Stigler's collection "Statistics on the Table"&lt;/ref&gt; states that no scientific discovery is [[eponym|named after]] its original discoverer. Examples include [[Hubble's law]] which was derived by [[Georges Lemaître]] two years before [[Edwin Hubble]], the [[Pythagorean theorem]] although it was known to [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian mathematicians]] before  [[Pythagoras]], and [[Halley's comet]] which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Stigler himself named the [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] as the discoverer of "Stigler's law" to show that it follows its own decree, though the phenomenon had previously been noted by others.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[Henry Dudeney]] noted in his 1917 *Amusements in Mathematics* solution 129 that [[Pell's equation]] was called that "because Pell neither first propounded the question nor first solved it!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
Historical acclaim for discoveries is often assigned to persons of note who bring attention to an idea that is not yet widely known, whether or not that person was its original inventor&amp;nbsp;– theories may be named long after their discovery. In the case of [[eponymy]], the idea becomes named after that person, even if that person is acknowledged by [[History of science|historians of science]] not to be the one who discovered it. Often, several people will [[Multiple discovery|arrive at a new idea around the same time]], as in the case of [[calculus]]. It can be dependent on the publicity of the new work and the fame of its publisher as to whether the scientist's name becomes historically associated.

==Similar concepts&lt;!--'Boyer's law' and 'Boyer's Law' redirect here--&gt;==
There is a similar quote attributed to [[Mark Twain]]: "It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite — that is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest.

Stephen Stigler's father, the economist [[George Stigler]], also examined the process of discovery in [[economics]]. He said, "If an earlier, valid statement of a theory falls on deaf ears, and a later restatement is accepted by the science, this is surely proof that the science accepts ideas only when they fit into the then-current state of the science." He gave several examples in which the original discoverer was not recognized as such.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond Jr., Arthur M (December 2005, pp 639 – 640).

The [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]] was coined by Robert K. Merton to describe how eminent scientists get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar, so that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous. Merton notes that "this pattern of recognition, skewed in favor of the established scientist, appears principally (i) in cases of collaboration and (ii) in cases of independent multiple discoveries made by scientists of distinctly different rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=5 January 1968|title =The Matthew Effect in Science|journal=Science|volume=159|doi=10.1126/science.159.3810.56|pmid=17737466|pages=56–63|bibcode=1968Sci...159...56M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect applies specifically to women through the [[Matilda effect]].

'''Boyer's law'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was named by [[Hubert Kennedy]] in 1972. It says, "Mathematical formulas and theorems are usually not named after their original discoverers" and was named after [[Carl Boyer]], whose book ''History of Mathematics'' contains many examples of this law. Kennedy observed that "it is perhaps interesting to note that this is probably a rare instance of a law whose statement confirms its own validity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=H.C.|date=January 1972|title=Who Discovered Boyer's Law?|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=79|number=1|pages=66–67|doi=10.2307/2978134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Everything of importance has been said before by somebody who did not discover it" is an [[adage]] attributed to [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/02/19/070219crbo_books_menand|title=Notable Quotables|last=Menand|first=Louis|date=19 February 2007|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''supralittoral zone''', also known as the '''splash zone''', '''spray zone''' or the '''supratidal zone''', is the area above the spring high [[tide]] line, on [[coast|coastlines]] and [[estuaries]], that is regularly splashed, but not submerged by ocean water. Seawater penetrates these elevated areas only during storms with high tides.&lt;ref name="Thurman et al."&gt;Thurman et al., p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms here must cope also with exposure to air, fresh water from rain, cold, heat and [[predation]] by land animals and seabirds. At the top of this area, patches of dark [[lichen]]s can appear as crusts on rocks. Some types of [[Common periwinkle|periwinkles]], [[Neritidae]] and detritus feeding [[Isopod]]a commonly inhabit the lower supralitoral.&lt;ref name="Yip and Madl"&gt;Yip and Madl&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18108">'''Surface metrology''' is the [[measurement]] of small-scale features on surfaces, and is a branch of [[metrology]]. Surface [[primary form]], surface [[Fractal dimension|fractality]] and surface [[surface roughness|roughness]] are the parameters most commonly associated with the field. It is important to many disciplines and is mostly known for the machining of precision parts and assemblies which contain mating surfaces or which must operate with high internal pressures.

Surface finish may be measured in two ways: ''contact'' and ''non-contact'' methods. Contact methods involve dragging a measurement [[stylus]] across the surface; these instruments are called [[profilometer]]s. Non-contact methods include: [[interferometry]], [[Digital holographic microscopy|digital holography]], [[confocal microscopy]], [[focus variation]], [[structured light]], [[electrical capacitance]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[photogrammetry]].

==Overview==
The most common method is to use a [[diamond]] stylus [[profilometer]]. The stylus is run perpendicular to the lay of the surface.&lt;ref name="degarmo223"/&gt; The probe usually traces along a straight line on a flat surface or in a circular arc around a cylindrical surface. The length of the path that it traces is called the ''measurement length''. The wavelength of the lowest frequency filter that will be used to analyze the data is usually defined as the ''sampling length''. Most standards recommend that the measurement length should be at least seven times longer than the sampling length, and according to the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] it should be at least two times longer than the wavelength{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} of interesting features. The ''assessment length'' or ''evaluation length'' is the length of data that will be used for analysis. Commonly one sampling length is discarded from each end of the measurement length. 3D measurements can be made with a profilometer by scanning over a 2D area on the surface.

The disadvantage of a profilometer is that it is not accurate when the size of the features of the surface are close to the same size as the stylus. Another disadvantage is that profilometers have difficulty detecting flaws of the same general size as the roughness of the surface.&lt;ref name="degarmo223"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Degarmo | first = E. Paul | last2 = Black | first2 = J T. | last3 = Kohser | first3 = Ronald A. | title = Materials and Processes in Manufacturing | publisher = Wiley | year = 2003 | edition = 9th | isbn = 0-471-65653-4 |pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also limitations for non-contact instruments. For example, instruments that rely on optical interference cannot resolve features that are less than some fraction of the operating wavelength. This limitation can make it difficult to accurately measure roughness even on common objects, since the interesting features may be well below the wavelength of light. The wavelength of red light is about 650&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html|title= What Wavelength Goes With a Color?|accessdate= 2008-05-14|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html|archivedate= 2011-07-20|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the average roughness, (R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of a ground shaft might be 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

The first step of analysis is to filter the raw data to remove very high frequency data (called "micro-roughness") since it can often be attributed to vibrations or debris on the surface. Filtering out the micro-roughness at a given cut-off threshold also allows to bring closer the roughness assessment made using profilometers having different stylus ball radius e.g. 2&amp;nbsp;µm and 5&amp;nbsp;µm radii. Next, the data is separated into roughness, waviness and form. This can be accomplished using reference lines, envelope methods, digital filters, fractals or other techniques. Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;Whitehouse, DJ. (1994).

===Contact (tactile measurement)===
[[File:Rugosimetro portatile.jpg|thumb]]
Stylus-based contact instruments have the following advantages:
* The system is very simple and sufficient for basic roughness, waviness or form measurement requiring only 2D profiles (e.g. calculation of the Ra value).
* The system is never lured by the optical properties of a sample (e.g. highly reflective, transparent, micro-structured).
* The stylus ignores the oil film covering many metal components during their industrial process.

''Technologies'':

* Contact [[Profilometer]]s – traditionally use a diamond [[stylus]] and work like a [[phonograph]]
* [[Atomic force microscope]] are sometimes also considered contact profilers operating at atomic scale.

===Non-Contact (optical microscopes)===
Optical measurement instruments have some advantages over the tactile ones as follows:
* no touching of the surface (the sample can not be damaged)
* the measurement speed is usually much higher (up to a million 3D points can be measured in a second)
* some of them are genuinely built for 3D surface topography rather than single traces of data
* they can measure surfaces through transparent medium such as glass or plastic film
* non-contact measurement may sometimes be the only solution when the component to measure is very soft (e.g. pollution deposit) or very hard (e.g. abrasive paper).

''Vertical scanning'':

* [[Coherence Scanning Interferometry]]
* [[Confocal microscopy]]
* [[Focus variation]]
* [[Confocal chromatic aberration]]

''Horizonal scanning'':

* [[Scanning laser microscope]] (SLM)
* [[Structured Light 3D Scanner|Structured light scanning]]
''Non-scanning''
* [[Digital holographic microscopy|Digital Holography microscopy]]

===Choice of the right measurement instrument===
Because of every instrument has advantages and disadvantages the operator must choose the right instrument depending on the measurement application. In the following some advantages and disadvantages to the main technologies are listed:
* Interferometry: This method has the highest vertical resolution of any optical technique and lateral resolution equivalent to most other optical techniques except for confocal which has better lateral resolution. Instruments can measure very smooth surfaces using phase shifting interferometry (PSI) with high vertical repeatability; such systems can be dedicated for measuring large parts (up to 300mm) or microscope-based.  They can also use [[coherence scanning interferometry]] (CSI) with a white-light source to measure steep or rough surfaces, including machined metal, foam, paper and more. As is the case with all optical techniques, the interaction of light with the sample for this instruments is not fully understood. This means that measurement errors can occur especially for roughness measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface Measurement errors using commercial scanning white light interferometers|journal=Measurement Science and Technology|volume=19|pages=015303|doi=10.1088/0957-0233/19/1/015303|bibcode=2008MeScT..19a5303G|year=2008|last1=Gao|first1=F|last2=Leach|first2=R K|last3=Petzing|first3=J|last4=Coupland|first4=J M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Discrepancies between roughness measurements obtained with phase-shifting and white-light interferometry|doi=10.1364/AO.44.005919|journal=Applied Optics|volume=44|issue=28|pages=5919–27|pmid=16231799|year=2005|author1=Rhee|first1=H. G.|last2=Vorburger|first2=T. V.|last3=Lee|first3=J. W.|last4=Fu|first4=J|bibcode=2005ApOpt..44.5919R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DIgital Holography: this method provide 3D topography with the similar resolution than interferometry. Moreover, as it is a non-scanning technique, it ideal for measurement of moving sample, deformable surfaces, MEMS dynamics, chemical reaction, effect of magnetic or electrical field on samples, and measurement in presence of vibration, in particular for quality control.:
* Focus variation: This method delivers color information, can measure on steep flanks and can measure on very rough surfaces. The disadvantage is that this method can not measure on surfaces with a very smooth surface roughness like a silicon wafer. The main application is metal (machined parts and tools), plastic or paper samples.
* Confocal microscopy: this method has the advantage of high lateral resolution because of the use of a pin hole but has the disadvantage that it can not measure on steep flanks.  Also, it quickly loses vertical resolution when looking at large areas since the vertical sensitivity depends on the microscope objective in use.
* Confocal chromatic aberration: This method has the advantage of measuring certain height ranges without a vertical scan, can measure very rough surfaces with ease, and smooth surfaces down to the single nm range. The fact that these sensors have no moving parts allows for very high scan speeds and makes them very repeatable. Configurations with a high numerical aperture can measure on relatively steep flanks. Multiple sensors, with the same or different measurement ranges, can be used simultaneously, allowing differential measurement approaches (TTV) or expanding the use case of a system.
* Contact profilometer: this method is the most common surface measurement technique.  The advantages are that it is a cheap instrument and has higher lateral resolution than optical techniques, depending on the stylus tip radius chosen.  New systems can do 3D measurements in addition to 2D traces and can measure form and critical dimensions as well as roughness. However, the disadvantages are that the stylus tip has to be in physical contact with the surface, which may alter the surface and/or stylus and cause contamination. Furthermore, due to the mechanical interaction, the scan speeds are significantly slower than with optical methods. Because of the stylus shank angle, stylus profilometers cannot measure up to the edge of a rising structure, causing a "shadow"or undefined area, usually much larger than what is typical for optical systems.

===Resolution===
The scale of the desired measurement will help decide which type of microscope will be used.

For 3D measurements, the probe is commanded to scan over a 2D area on the surface. The spacing between data points may not be the same in both directions.

In some cases, the physics of the measuring instrument may have a large effect on the data. This is especially true when measuring very smooth surfaces. For contact measurements, most obvious problem is that the stylus may scratch the measured surface. Another problem is that the stylus may be too blunt to reach the bottom of deep valleys and it may round the tips of sharp peaks. In this case the probe is a physical filter that limits the accuracy of the instrument.

== Roughness parameters ==
{{Main|Surface roughness#Parameterization}}
{{split section portions|Surface roughness#Parameterization|date=May 2014}}

The real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gadelmawla E.S. |author2=Koura M.M. |author3=Maksoud T.M.A. |author4=Elewa I.M. |author5=Soliman H.H. |title=Roughness parameters|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=123|pages=133|doi=10.1016/S0924-0136(02)00060-2|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Profile roughness parameters ===
Parameters used to describe surfaces are largely [[statistics|statistical]] indicators obtained from many samples of the surface height.  Some examples include:

This is a small subset of available parameters described in standards like ASME B46.1&lt;ref name="B46"&gt;[http://www.asme.org/products/codes---standards/surface-texture-(surface-roughness--waviness--and- ASME B46.1]. Asme.org. Retrieved on 2016-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 4287.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=10132 ISO 4287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040119202443/http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=10132 |date=January 19, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of these parameters originated from the capabilities of profilometers and other mechanical probe systems. 
In addition, new measures of surface dimensions have been developed which are more directly related to the measurements made possible by high-definition optical gauging technologies.

Most of these parameters can be estimated using the SurfCharJ plugin [http://www.gcsca.net/IJ/SurfCharJ.html] for the [[ImageJ]].

=== Areal surface parameters ===
The surface roughness can also be calculated over an area. This gives S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; instead of R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values. The [[ISO 25178]] series describes all these roughness values in detail. The advantage over the profile parameters are:

* more significant values
* more relation to the real function possible
* faster measurement with actual instruments{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} possible (optical areal based instruments can measure an S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in higher speed then R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

Surfaces have [[fractal]] properties, multi-scale measurements can also be made such as Length-scale Fractal Analysis or Area-scale Fractal Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.wpi.edu/Research/SurfMet/Research/fractal.html Surface Metrology Laboratory – Washburn Shops 243 – Scale-sensitive Fractal Analysis]. Me.wpi.edu. Retrieved on 2016-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filtering ==
{{further|ISO 16610{{!}}ISO 16610: Geometrical product specifications (GPS) – Filtration}}
To obtain the surface characteristic almost all measurements are subject to filtering. It is one of the most important topics when it comes to specifying and controlling surface attributes such as roughness, waviness, and form error.  These components of the surface deviations must be distinctly separable in measurement to achieve a clear understanding between the surface supplier and the surface recipient as to the expected characteristics of the surface in question. 
Typically, either digital or analog filters are used to separate form error, waviness, and roughness resulting from a measurement. Main multi-scale filtering methods are Gaussian filtering, Wavelet transform and more recentlty Discrete Modal Decomposition. There are three characteristics of these filters that should be known in order to understand the parameter values that an instrument may calculate. These are the spatial wavelength at which a filter separates roughness from waviness or waviness from form error, the sharpness of a filter or how cleanly the filter separates two components of the surface deviations and the distortion of a filter or how much the filter alters a spatial wavelength component in the separation process.&lt;ref name="B46" /&gt;

It is about the [[Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869]] which was the first trip down the Colorado River by boat, including the first trip through the [[Grand Canyon]]. 

Powell's first written accounts of his exploration appeared in the January, February and March 1875 editions of ''[[Scribner’s Monthly]]'' as "The Canons of the Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Canons of the Colorado |journal=[[Scribner's Monthly]] |author1=[[John Wesley Powell]] |date=1875 |volume=9 |number= |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924079633172;view=1up;seq=3 }} Pages 293, 394 and 523.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian]] published it in book form in 1875 under title ''Report of the Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries.

The '''''Tokamak à configuration variable''''' ('''''TCV''''', literally "variable configuration [[tokamak]]") is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] research [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactor of the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]. Its distinguishing feature over other tokamaks is that its torus section is three times higher than wide. This allows studying several shapes of plasmas, which is particularly relevant since the shape of the plasma has links to the performance of the reactor. The TCV was set up in November 1992.

== Characteristics ==
* Plasma height: 1.40 metres
* Minor radius: 0.25 metre
* Major radius: 0.88 metre
* Plasma current: 1.2 megaamperes
* Plasma life span: 2 seconds maximum
* Toroidal magnetic field: 1.43 teslas
* Additional heating power: 4.5 megawatts

== Main studies ==
* Confinement studies
** confinement as a function of the shape of the plasma (triangular, square or elongated)
** Improvement of the confinement of the core
* Studies on vertically elongated plasmas 
* Studies with ECRH and ECCD ([[electron cyclotron resonance heating]] and [[electron cyclotron current drive]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/research_TCV_Heating TCV Auxiliary Heating.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 it had 16 poloidal plasma shaping coils and could achieve a variety of field configurations and plasma shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/TCV-new-shapes TCV - Development of new plasma shapes. May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/research_TCV_Tokamak ] diagram shows 16 shaping coils and 7 other poloidal coils&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
* 1976: First proposal for an elongated tokamak by the "New Swiss Association"
* 1985: Second proposal, with a more elongated tokamak
* 1986: Acceptance of the TCV proposal (Tokamak à Configuration Variable)
* 1992: First plasma discharge
* 1997: World record of plasma elongation (see [[plasma shaping]])
* by August 2015 it has had a 19-month shutdown/upgrade to install its first [[neutral beam injector]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/keeping-fusion-research-on-the-boil-three-tokamaks-and-one-stellarator/ Keeping fusion research on the boil: Three tokamaks and one stellarator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">{{Distinguish|Units of measurement}}
In [[statistics]], a '''unit of observation''' is the unit described by the [[data]] that one analyzes. For example, in a study of the [[demand for money]], the unit of observation might be chosen as the individual, with different observations ('''data point'''s) for a given point in time differing as to which individual they refer to; or the unit of observation might be the country, with different observations differing only in regard to the country they refer to. A study may have a differing unit of observation and [[unit of analysis]]: for example, in [[community]] research, the [[research design]] may collect data at the individual level of observation but the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] might be at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals. Together, the unit of observation and the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blalock |first=Hubert M., Jr. |year=1972 |title=Social Statistics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=0-07-005751-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data point==
A '''data point''' or '''observation''' is a set of one or more [[Level of measurement|measurement]]s on a single member of unit of observation. For example, in a study of the determinants of [[money demand]] with the [[unit of observation]] being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, and number of dependents. [[Statistical inference]] about the population would be conducted using a [[statistical sample]] consisting of various such data points.

In addition, in [[statistical graphics]], a "data point" may be an individual item with a statistical display; such points may relate to either a single member of a population or to a [[summary statistic]] calculated for a given subpopulation.

==Types of data==
The measurements contained a unit of observation are formally ''typed'', where here ''type'' is used in a way compatible with [[datatype]] in [[computing]]; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value from {yes, no}, an [[integer]] or [[real number]], the identity of some [[Category (mathematics)|category]], or some [[vector space|vector]] or [[Array data structure|array]]. 

The implication of ''point'' is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are [[data processing|processed numerically]] before that is done. In the context of [[statistical graphics]], measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single ''data point'' within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2186">In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Veneziano amplitude''' refers to the discovery made in 1968 by [[Italy|Italian]] theoretical physicist [[Gabriele Veneziano]] that the [[Beta function|Euler beta function]], when interpreted as a [[scattering amplitude]], has many of the features needed to explain the physical properties of [[Strong interaction|strongly interacting]] [[meson]]s, such as symmetry and duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veneziano |first=G. |authorlink=Gabriele Veneziano |date=1968 |title=Construction of a crossing-symmetric, Regge-behaved amplitude for linearly rising trajectories |journal=[[Nuovo Cimento]] A |volume=57 |pages=190–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conformal symmetry]] was soon discovered. The formula is the following:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{ \Gamma (-1+\frac12(k_1+k_2)^2) \Gamma (-1+\frac12(k_2+k_3)^2)  } { \Gamma (-2+\frac12((k_1+k_2)^2+(k_2+k_3)^2)) } &lt;/math&gt; .

''k''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector (such as a [[four-vector]]) referring to the momentum of the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; particle. Γ is the [[gamma function]].

This discovery can be considered the birth of [[string theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Di Vecchia |first=P.  |chapter=The Birth of String Theory  |pages=59–118 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w212062126125881/fulltext.pdf |editor1-last=Gasperini |editor1-first=Maurizio |editor2-last=Maharana |editor2-first=Jnan |title=String Theory and Fundamental Interactions – Gabriele Veneziano and Theoretical Physics: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |series=[[Lecture Notes in Physics]] |date=2008 |volume=737 |isbn=978-3-540-74232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the discovery and invention of string theory came about as a search for a physical model which would give rise to such a scattering amplitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1711">'''Water filling algorithm''' is a general name given to the ideas in [[communication systems]] design and practice for [[adaptive equalizer|equalization]] strategies on [[channel (communications)|communications channels]]. As the name suggests, just as water finds its level even when filled in one part of a vessel with multiple openings, as a consequence of [[Pascal's law]], the amplifier systems in communications network repeaters, or receivers amplify each channel up to the required power level compensating for the channel impairments. See, for example, channel power allocation in [[MIMO]] systems.

==Single channel systems==
In a single channel communication system the deamplification and loss present on them can be simplistically taken as attenuation by a percentage ''g'', then amplifiers restore the signal power level to the same value at transmission setup by operating at a gain of 1/ (1-g). E.g. if we experience 6dB attenuation in transmission, i.e. 75% loss, then we have to amplify the signal by a factor of  ''4x'' to restore the signal to the transmitter levels.

==Multichannel systems==
Same ideas can be carried out in presence impairments and a multiple channel system. Amplifier nonlinearity, crosstalk and power budgets prevent the use of these waterfilling algorithms to restore all channels, and only a subset can benefit from them.
