[[File:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]]'', oil on [[fiberboard]], 244 × 122 cm (96 × 48 in), private collection]]

'''Abstract expressionism''' is a post–[[World War II]] [[art movement]] in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors of Phaidon Press|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put [[New York City]] at the center of the western [[art world]], a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term ''abstract expressionism'' was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Barbara; "Abstract Expressionism", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]

Technically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of "the men in the new movement." Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103&lt;/ref&gt; Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190"&gt;Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), "Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting." p. 189–190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000–1): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&amp;tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12"&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12" /&gt; a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably [[Robert Frank]]—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==


{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.

While New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin. ''Off the Wall: A Portrait of Robert Rauschenberg'' [Deckle Edge] [Paperback], p. 5. Publisher: Picador; Revised and Updated edition (November 29, 2005) {{ISBN|0-312-42585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240–241, [[University of California Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, "Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangely the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist; [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Clement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "Art and Culture Critical essays", ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", pp.23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941–42]]

During the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[André Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 – 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} × 98" (186 × 249 cm) [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: "I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by Thomas B. Hess&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref name =dorment&gt;Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.



==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''.

Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-CluVdSYL4b5yASbmYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw|title=George McNeil|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QypuVfDEBtKTyAS66IOQBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCpuVYq4EsuxyASNjoGACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kootz Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mypuVY-QAdX_yQTHyIOoDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=New York Modern|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| title = ''The American Action Painters''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.

[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.&lt;ref&gt;based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970, NY 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].

Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an "[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters [[Franz Kline]] (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and [[Cy Twombly]], who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the [[Collective unconscious]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoryunstuffed.com/abstract-expressionism-redefining-art-part-one/ Jeanne Willette, abstract expressionism, redefining art, part one]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/abex/hd_abex.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Abstract Expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Robert Motherwell]] in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489403 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79007 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.

[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an "all-over" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one.

In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the [[Hard-edge painting]] exemplified by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued by [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/CIAcultCW.html |title=Ratical.org |publisher=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of this information (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.&lt;ref name=kimmelman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294–306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'' by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time; and ''Pollock and After'' edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapié]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].

However, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.&lt;ref name="New York and Abstract Expressionism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Acquired Taste (disambiguation)}}

An '''acquired taste''' is an appreciation for something unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it. In the case of food and drink, this may be due to a strong [[odor]] (such as certain types of [[cheese]], [[durian]], [[hákarl]], [[Kala Namak|black salt]], [[nattō]], [[asafoetida]], [[surströmming]], or [[stinky tofu]]), [[taste]] ([[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[Vegemite]] or [[Marmite]], bitter [[tea]]s, [[salty liquorice]], [[malt bread]], [[Types of chocolate#Classification|unsweetened chocolate]], [[sushi]], [[garnatálg]]), mouthfeel (such as [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] featuring uncooked seafood), appearance, or association (such as [[Entomophagy|eating insects]] or organ meat).

== Acquiring the taste ==
===General acquisition of tastes===
The process of acquiring a taste can involve developmental maturation, genetics (of both taste sensitivity and personality), family example, and biochemical reward properties of foods.  Infants are born preferring sweet foods and rejecting sour and bitter tastes, and they develop a preference for salt at approximately 4 months.  [[Neophobia]] (fear of novelty) tends to vary with age in predictable, but not linear, ways.  Babies just beginning to eat solid foods generally accept a wide variety of foods, toddlers and young children are relatively neophobic towards food, and older children, adults, and the elderly are often adventurous eaters with wide-ranging tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=L. L.|title=Development of food preferences|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=41–62|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general personality trait of novelty-seeking does not necessarily correlate highly with willingness to try new foods.  Level of food adventurousness may explain much of the variability of food preferences observed in "[[supertasters]]".  Supertasters are highly sensitive to bitter, spicy, and pungent flavours, and some avoid them and like to eat only mild, plain foods, but many supertasters who have high food adventurousness enjoy these intense flavors and seek them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullrich|first1=N. V.|last2=Touger-Decker|first2=R.|last3=O’Sullivan-Maillet|first3=J.|last4=Tepper|first4=B. J.|title=PROP taster status and self-perceived food adventurousness influence food preferences|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=2004|volume=104|issue=4|pages=543–549|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some chemicals or combinations of chemicals in foods provide both flavor and beneficial or enjoyable effects on the body and mind and may be reinforcing, leading to an acquired taste.  A study that investigated the effect of adding caffeine and theobromine (active compounds in chocolate) vs. a placebo to identically-flavored drinks that participants tasted several times, yielded the development of a strong preference for the drink with the compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smit|first1=H. J.|last2=Blackburn|first2=R. J.|title=Reinforcing effects of caffeine and theobromine as found in chocolate|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2005|volume=181|issue=1|pages=101–106|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-2209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional acquisition of tastes===
Intentionally changing one's preferences can be hard to accomplish. It usually requires a deliberate effort, acting as if one likes something in order to have the responses and feelings that will produce the desired taste. The challenge becomes one of distinguishing authentic or legitimate acquired tastes as a result of deeply considered preference changes from inauthentic ones motivated by status or [[conformity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=Sour Grapes and Character Planning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1992|volume=89|issue=2|pages=57–78|doi=10.2307/2027152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=The Intentional Acquisition of Mental States|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1995|volume=55|issue=4|pages=821–840|doi=10.2307/2108334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;
{{cite book

  |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  |edition=Summer 2012
  |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta
  |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/environmental-aesthetics/
  |accessdate=2 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Stolnitz|first=J.
  |year=1961
  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Conron|first=J.
  |year=2000
  |title=American Picturesque
  |location=University Park, Pennsylvania
  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

  |publisher=[[Ashgate]]

  |isbn=9780754605430
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;
U.S. Congress (1973), Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-205), sec. 2a.
&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This is a result of the chemicals interacting with chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;
{{cite book
  |first=Aldo|last=Leopold
  |year=1968
  |title=A Sand County Almanac
  |location=New York
  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
  |pages=224–225
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Any color perceived by human visitors for a few hours is entirely different from what is really happening.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;  According to Leopold, the three features of [[ecosystem]]s that generate land ethic are integrity, stability and beauty.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; None of the mentioned features are real in nature.  Ecosystems are not stable: they are dramatically changing and they have little integration; ergo, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

==Objectives==
In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating a natural thing, we give meaning to the thing we appreciate and in that meaning, we express and develop our own attitudes, values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Parsons|first=G.
  |title=Aesthetics and Nature
  |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our interest in natural things are not only a passive reflection of our inclinations, as Croce describes as the appreciation of nature as looking in a mirror, or what we might call our inward life; but may instead be the things we come across in nature that engage and stimulate our imagination.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; As a result, we are challenged to think differently and apply thoughts and associations to in new situations and ways.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;
 
As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications. On the contrary, there are not obvious instances of debate and appraisals where different judgments about the aesthetics of character of nature are evaluated.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;

The '''Altavista petroglyph complex''' is located near the village and beach-town of [[Chacala]], south of the Compostela Municipality, in [[Nayarit]] [[Mexico]].

The area is known as "La Pila del Rey", "Chacalán", "El Santuario", "The Petroglyphs” or "the Altavista petroglyphs", near the Jaltemba Bay, in the Pacific Ocean of Nayarit.&lt;ref name= Richard &gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawhorn |first= Richard |date= |title= Petroglyphs at Altavista |trans-title= Petroglifos en Altavista |journal= |location= |url=http://richardlawhorn.com/altavista/pila_del_rey.html |accessdate=Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region was originally home to the largely unstudied [[Tecoxquin]] (Tequectequi) native culture dating from approximately 2000 BC to 2300 BCE.&lt;ref name="Vecinal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pro-conservacion Difusion del Patrimonio Historico Cultural de Las Varas Nayarit A.C. |last= |first= |authorlink=  |year= |publisher=Ejido de Altavista.

Aside from its cultural and archeological importance, the site remains an important religious center for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]es who still leave offerings and perform ceremonies here.&lt;ref name="MexDes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armendáriz |first=Lorenzo |date=February 2008 |title=Viva la Riviera Nayarita |journal=Guía México Desconocido |volume=372 |pages=70–77 |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas,-sus-frutos-del-mar,-su-paz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811110947/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas%2C-sus-frutos-del-mar%2C-su-paz |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehispanic times, the Compostela municipality area was inhabited by the Mazatán peoples, tributary of Xalisco-Zacualpan Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit COMPOSTELA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |date=2011-05-17 }} Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Nayarit (Spanish) Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) engraved images in volcanic stone over two thousand years ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings might have been meant as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

There are fifteen signs (Spanish &amp; English posted along entrance path,&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt; a brief summary is provided below:

=== Sign 1 - Altavista===
Altavista petroglyphs archaeological site, located along the sides of a creek on the slopes the Copo volcano. Covers an area of approximately 80&amp;nbsp;hectares, with a large concentration of petroglyphs. (More than 2000 engravings identified)&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

=== Sign 2 - The Tecoxquin (Throat-Cutters) ===
Original Altavista inhabitants. This native group inhabited a vast region covering the South coast of Nayarit, neighbouring coasts, and mountainous regions of Jalisco, Mexico. They were mainly farmers, fishermen, salt producers and traders of cocoa and cotton. The Tecoxquines were organized in a number of villages under the control of Teuzacualpan Chila Valley (modern city of Zacualpan). Business links allowed them to develop an intensive trade, reached Sinaloa to the north and Colima and Michoacán to the South and East.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 3 - Religious Life (Tecoxquines)===
No doubt, many religious ceremonies at this site were based on nahualism. [[Nagual|Nahualism]] or [[Shamanism]] as former religious practices whereby people communicated with their gods and spirits during altered states of consciousness. This tradition has deep roots in the region; the Nayarit word derives from the word "nahualli". The Tecoxquines used psychotropic plants and tobacco plants to achieve states of ecstasy and communicate with their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 4 - The Last of The Tecoxquines===
[[File:Altavistapeto3.jpg|thumb|350px|Petroglyphs at Altavista Site, Compostela, Nayarit.]]
After the Spanish conquest, the Tecoxquines completely annihilated by epidemics and forced labor. Today native cities of the region still talk about "white Indians," ghosts appearing from the mountains to honor their ancient gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 5 – The Tecuales===
The Tecoxquin ancient villages, as far as the Ixtapa salt producers, were populated by Tecuales, ancestors of the current Huichol.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 6 - The Water Cycle ===
Nayarit State is characterized by heavy rainfall. Rainfall is concentrated between May and October. The Altavista mountains attract heavy rains leaving drier areas to the East (desert weather at the opposite side). Perhaps because of this abundance of water, Altavista was considered a special place.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 7 - Tomoanchan (or Tamoanchan)===
[[Tamoanchan]] is a mythical paradisiac location known to the [[Mesoamerican]] cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassical period, is a central part of the ancient Mesoamerican cosmology. Tamoanchan is the cosmic tree that connects life and supports the world. Its roots are underground in the water and fertility field. Its trunk is between human beings above ground and heavens. The Crown of the tree is in heaven, the kingdom of gods and rain. Tamoanchan was represented by the Ceiba tree.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 8 - Warfare: Trophy Heads ===
The "Guerra Florida " (flower war) was one of the main religious practices associated with the Tecoxquines. The aim was not to conquer. Rather, get warriors prisoners for ritual sacrifice, and whose heads were cut and then offered to the gods. These wars were usually produced locally, but also conducted in places as far away as the Talpa and Mascota Valleys and Mochitiltic Canyon in Jalisco.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 9 – Tlalocan===
water was thought to be underground in ancient Mesoamerica, hence the underworld was considered a fertile place. Tlalocan was the "water"paradise underground. It was inhabited by the “Chanes”, or water spirits, as well as the spirits of people drowned or whose death was water related. Tlalocan also was the site of the legendary crocodile [[Cipactli]],&lt;ref&gt;in Aztec mythology; Cipactli was a voracious, primitive and monstrous creature, half crocodile, half fish. It was always hungry, and in each joint of its 18 bodies had a mouth adorning it. Tezcatlipoca sacrificed a foot, using it as bait to attract it. It is also the first day of the sacred Aztec calendar, Tonalpohualli.&lt;/ref&gt; a "earth monster", symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 10 – The Devoted Christ ===
The first historical references of the archaeological site of Altavista date from 1612. These describe many crosses, and above all, a devout Christ that local people venerates. This is possibly a reference to the "corn man", a figure that symbolizes fertility and growth. Local farmers leave offerings of candles and gourd bowls of salt to this figure in order to obtain fertility for their coffee and tobacco crops.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 11 – The Apostle Matthew ===
During the early 17TH century, Spaniards believed that the Apostle Matthew traveled to the new world in prehispanic times to evangelize natives. This is thought to explain the crosses engraved in the Altavista rocks.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 12 – The Cross ===
For Tecoxquines, as well as for most ancient Mesoamerican, the cross actually was a mental map of the cosmos. Symbolizes five sacred directions: the four cardinal points and the center. Each is associated with certain gods, colors, and sacred kingdoms, as well as each of the four trees that formed the tamoanchan kingdoms. The idea of the universe of four corners is still present among native Mexico today, symbolized by crosses, diamonds and other similar forms.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 13 – Communication With The Gods ===
The Altavista rocks were probably associated with the mythical [[Tamoanchan]] trees connecting the underworld, earth and heaven. The prayers of the people went up through the sap of the trunks into the realm of the gods. In turn, the gifts of the gods, rain, fertility and good health returned to land the same way. For the Tecoxquines the Altavista rocks would have served the same purpose, a means of communication between the people and their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 14 – Tecoxquin Symbolism ===
Spirals, wavy lines, and other symbols carved in the Altavista rocks probably constitute a ritual prayer language for the gods. As an agricultural culture, the Tocoxquines would have been concerned with rain, fertility of the land and the continuity of the seasonal rhythms that they relied on. While the exact meaning of symbols will never be known, spirals have been interpreted as the Sun, storm, the wind, the spiral snake, or as a symbol of the natural cycle of station rainy and dry.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 15 –Huichol Offerings===
Huichol natives occasionally visit Altavista originally lived in the Nayar mountains, recently a group moved to the Las Varas area. They present offerings and perform ceremonies for Nakahue, "our fertility grandmother" and Tatevari, "our grandfather of fire". Some Huicholes also travel to the nearby Chacala Port, where ancient petroglyphs are present and leave offerings for Tatei Aramara “our mother Ocean”.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

'''Avenida de Colores, Inc.''' was founded in 2010 by Denise Kowal as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&amp;inq_doc_number=N10000007673&amp;inq_came_from=NAMFWD&amp;cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&amp;names_name_ind=N&amp;names_cor_number=&amp;names_name_seq=&amp;names_name_ind=&amp;names_comp_name=AVENIDADECOLORES&amp;names_filing_type=|title= Florida Non-Profit Corporation Details (Avenida de Colores, Inc.)|work= Florida Department of State Division of Corporations|publisher= State of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Sarasota, Florida]] in the [[United States]]. The corporation is organized for the purpose of providing students with experiences and instruction in the visual and performing arts and to enrich communities with cultural events. The corporation produces the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]], a cultural event designed to that celebrate the sixteenth century [[performing arts|performance art]] of [[Italy|Italian]] [[street painting]]. The corporation functions solely on donations from patrons, sponsorships, and grants and it is a fully volunteer organization.

==First international street painting festival in the U.S.==

While pursuing its mission to create cultural events, in 2010, the Avenida de Colores made history by producing the first international street painting festival in the United States, called the ''[[Sarasota Chalk Festival]]''. Street painting festivals started in the United States in 1987, but this festival was the first to attract many renowned street painting artists from all over the world to participate. The festival had notable [[Guinness World Record]] holders [[Edgar Mueller]] from [[Germany]], Leon Keer from [[Netherlands]], and [[Tracy Lee Stum]] from the USA. Genna Panzarella from the USA, who was the first woman to receive Italy's honorable Maestra Madonnari title at the International Grazi di [[Curtatone]] competition, participated as well as Vera Bugatti from Italy, who also holds the Maestra Madonnari title. Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller created a 100' x 40' 3-D street painting that is the first known contemporary street painting that [[metamorphosis|metamorphosed]] from one image to another with the change from day to night because the painter used [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] paints. The Sarasota Chalk Festival also was the first street painting festival to have a [[Halloween]]-theme for the artists work as well as three oversized 3-D installations, one of which incorporating [[two-point perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Street art goes global this year|author= Weingarten, Abby|date=  October 28, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= E6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004|title= Artists to make the pavement come alive in Sarasota|author= Ball, David|date= October 23, 2010|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= BN1|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/102920108602/WEEKEND-BEST-BET-Sarasota-Chalk-Festival|title= Weekend Best Bet: Sarasota Chalk Festival|author= Observer Staff|date= October 29, 2010|work= Your Observer.Com|publisher= The Observer Group|accessdate= December 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101034857/http://www.yourobserver.com/news/sarasota/Front-Page/102920108602/WEEKEND-BEST-BET-Sarasota-Chalk-Festival| archivedate= 1 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/around-world-downtown-sarasota,1499527.html|title= Around World Downtown Sarasota|author= Sarasota Chalk Festival|date= October 12, 2010|work= Earth Times|accessdate= December 8, 2010|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120729012810/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/press/around-world-downtown-sarasota,1499527.html|archive-date= 2012-07-29|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;


A catalogue ''(right)'' entitled, '''''Sarasota Chalk Festival''''', was published by Avenida de Colores following the 2010 festival. Exceeding two hundred pages, it provides an extensive history of the street painting it features at the festival and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists performed at the debut of the new international status of the festival. The catalogue provides examples of their work—either here or abroad, some being works produced at the 2010 festival, which had a festive Halloween theme. It also describes the music and arts present in Sarasota, which has earned the area the reputation as the "Cultural Coast" of Florida. It also presents information about many of the attractive Sarasota beaches has on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This catalogue has been available at each festival since its publication and is available at the festival offices throughout the year. 

==Sarasota Chalk Festival History==

As president of the Burns Square Property Owners Association, Inc., in 2007, Kowal founded a nonprofit corporation, the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival, a street painting festival held on South Pineapple Avenue in the downtown Sarasota historic area known as [[Owen Burns|Burns Square]]. Only twenty-two artists participated in this first festival. Lori Escalera, a leading modern [[Madonnari]] from the USA was the only professional street painter who participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20071110/NEWS/711100467?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar|title= Blood, toil, tears and chalk|author= Hutchinson, Bill|date= November 10, 2007|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= A1|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the second Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival was held with approximately one hundred street painters participating, who were drawn from all over the USA, and more than two hundred local stage performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090429/BREAKING/904299959|title= Artists will use Pineapple Street as their canvas|author=  Weingarten, Abby|date= April 29, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090430/ARTICLE/904301029|title= Art in a race against time|author=  Hendricks, Joe|date= April 30, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page=E6|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090506/OPINION/905061013|title= Art on the street|date= May 6, 2009|work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|page= A8|accessdate= December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Burns Square Property Owners Association relinquished the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival to the Avenida de Colores nonprofit corporation. The street painting festival was renamed the Sarasota Chalk Festival and has grown into one of the most important street painting festivals in the world. The festival expanded several blocks in Burns Square to accommodate the two hundred and fifty street painters who participated, being drawn from all over the world, which made the Sarasota Chalk Festival the first international street painting festival in the United States. 

The festival has been relocated to [[Venice, Florida|Venice]] (also in Sarasota County) where more space is available to accommodate the large crowds attracted to the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20874">'''Babies switched at birth''' are [[infant|babies]] who, because of either error or malice, are interchanged with each other at [[childbirth|birth]] or very soon thereafter, leading to the babies being unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological [[parent]]s. The occurrence is not unknown but rarely discovered in real life{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, but is much more common as a [[plot device]] in novels and films, such as the TV series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'' and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''.

==As a literary plot device==
The [[plot device]] of babies who are switched at birth, or in their cradles, has been a common one in American fiction since the 18th century.  It is one of the several identifiable characteristics of [[melodrama]] that are plot devices dealing with situations that are highly improbable in real life.&lt;ref name=Merish&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion To American Fiction 1780-1865|editor=Shirley Samuels|page=192|author=Lori Merish|chapter=Melodrama and American Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of this common theme has continued ever since.  The device was used a number of times by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]]s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.  In both cases, well-born babies were switched with commoners.  [[Mark Twain]] later used this plot device in ''[[The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1893), where two babies, one white and one black, are switched at birth, resulting in both [[passing (racial identity)|passing]] for races that they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race, Citizenship, and Law in American Literature|editor=Ross Posnock|pages=174&amp;ndash;182|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-01093-4|chapter=The positivist alternative|author=Gregg Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the themes that [[television film]]s regularly exploited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television|author=Kerry Segrave|page=139|year=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp;amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0654-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a popular theme in the 1990s and 21st century with (for examples) it being employed as a plot device in ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' (the characters [[Cindy "Mac" Mackenzie]] and [[Madison Sinclair]]), in ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the characters [[Bree Timmins]] and [[Anne Baxter (Neighbours)|Anne Baxter]]), ''[[Night and Day (TV series)|Night and Day]]'' (the characters Jane Harper and Della Wells) and in ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (children of [[Lauren Fenmore Baldwin]] and [[Sheila Carter]]).  A non-human example occurs in the ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise, when the son of intelligent apes Zira and Cornelius is swapped with a 20th-century circus ape's infant, in order to assure the survival of the offspring that can become sentient. In ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' the characters [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]] and [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Grace Sanchez|Grace Sanchez]] were switched at birth by a nurse named Teresa Pruitt. In the Philippine television series, ''[[Mara Clara]]'', the characters Mara [[Mara Clara|Davis]]/[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|David]] and Clara [[Mara Clara|del]] [[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Valle]] were switched at birth by Gary for revenge after his former lover was married to another man. On the [[ABC Family]] series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', the characters Bay and Daphne were switched at birth.

Baby switching storylines are a staple of daytime drama, as in the case of ''The Young and the Restless'' mentioned above. Other notable switched-at-birth storylines on American soaps include ''[[One Life to Live]]''{{-'}}s story, begun in 1979, in which prostitute Katrina Karr, who had planned to put her child up for adoption as soon as it was born, and former nun Jenny Vernon both gave birth to girls at the same hospital, at the same time. Jenny's baby died in the maternity ward as Karen Wolek and Marco Dane (posing as a doctor) visited the child. As they knew Katrina had planned to give up her baby girl, Karen and Marco switched the newborns. It was not until 1982 that the truth came out and Jenny tearfully gave baby Mary back to Katrina.

In 2008, another ''One Life to Live'' storyline saw Starr Manning pregnant with Cole Thornhart's baby. Her cousin Jessica Brennan was also pregnant with her late husband's baby. Starr went into labor as her father Todd Manning (later revealed to be his twin brother Victor) planned to kidnap his grandchild and raise the baby secretly with Cole's amnesiac mother Marty Saybrooke. Tess, one of Jessica's alter personalities, had taken control of Jessica's life and went into premature labor. Starr, with the help of the baby's adoptive mother Marcie McBain and Starr's mother Blair Manning, gave birth to a healthy girl, whom she named Hope. Tess's child, named Chloe, was stillborn. The trauma of Chloe's death resulted in the emergence of another alter, Bess, who took Jessica's deceased baby to the hospital and switched her with Starr's healthy child. Seven months later, Jessica realized what had happened and told the truth to her cousin.

Possibly the most complex storyline involving the switched-at-birth plot device ran simultaneously on ''[[All My Children]]'' and ''One Life to Live''.&lt;ref&gt;http://onelifetolive.about.com/library/news/blbaby_switch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Involved were ''All My Children''{{-'}}s Bianca Montgomery and Babe Chandler, and ''One Life to Live''{{-'}}s Kelly Cramer Buchanan, as well as many other characters.

In [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, the baby Aegon Targaryen was switched with a commoner's baby at some point prior to the Sack of King's Landing in order to save him from being killed during the rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. After the commoner's baby is killed, everyone believes that Aegon is dead when in fact he is preparing to take back his grandfather's throne.

In the 1971 manga/anime ''[[Wandering Sun]] / Nozomi in the Sun'' (''Sasurai no Taiyou''), Miki and Nozomi are two girls who were switched at birth by the nurse Michiko Nohara, who holds a personal grudge against one of the families involved. Miki should've been raised as the daughter of the poor but loving Mine family but instead is taken in by the rich and snobbish Kouda clan, and Nozomi the opposite. The deceit isn't properly revealed until almost the end of the series.

In the ''[[Umineko no naku koro ni]]'' visual novels, Rudolf Ushiromiya's wife Asumu and mistress/later second wife Kyrie were pregnant and gave birth at roughly the same time. Rudolf had the children switched when Asumu's child was stillborn so the affair wouldn't be uncovered, and after Asumu's death from an illness, he married Kyrie. The surviving child grows into the protagonist of the games, Battler Ushiromiya, who believes himself to be Asumu and Rudolf's son until later in the story.

In the game ''[[Tales of the Abyss]]'', Princess Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear died few after birth so her nanny Maggie switched her with her also newborn granddaughter, Meryl Oakland. This causes Meryl's mother Sylvia (Maggie's own daughter) to commit suicide out of grief, and her father Badaq soon became the enemy general Largo the Black Lion. Meryl, now Natalia, is raised as the Princess and doesn't find out the truth until she's a teenager.

==In reality==

In real life, such a switch occurs rarely.&lt;ref name=Merish /&gt; Since many cases of babies switched at birth are likely undocumented or unknown, the following is presumably not an exhaustive list.

*In 1931, at the [[Leiden University Medical Center]], female babies Agnes van Vegten and Lenie van Duyn were switched. Suspicions did not rise until two decades later, when the girls met at a wedding and wondered at their mutual likeness to each other's family.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (1955, December 28). "CHANGELING" SUES PARENTS :Dutch Case Ruled Inadmissible. The Manchester Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, at a hospital in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the babies of Mary Miller and Kay McDonald were accidentally switched. Mary Miller immediately suspected that a switch had occurred, as the baby she received weighed a full two pounds less than at the hospital. Mary Miller knew Kay McDonald, and assumed that it was their baby she had taken home.  However, a series of circumstances kept Mary Miller from actively pursuing her suspicion for 43 years, when she revealed to the now grown girls, Sue McDonald and Martha Miller, what she suspected of their births. Genetic tests later confirmed that a switch did in fact occur. The story was featured on an episode of the radio show ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1496358/public_radio_to_air_story_of_pdc_babies_switched_at/ View - redOrbit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1253 2011 | Archive | This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1953, at Pioneer Memorial Hospital in [[Heppner, Oregon]], two babies were switched. In May 2009, the women discovered they were switched. DeeAnn Angell of Fossil and Kay Rene Reed of Condon learned about the mistake from an 86-year-old woman who was a former neighbor. The former neighbor said that one of the girls' mothers, Marjorie Angell, insisted back in 1953 that she had been given the wrong baby after nurses returned from bathing them. But her concerns were ignored. With both sets of parents dead, the Reed and Angell siblings compared notes and family stories, learning that rumors of a mix-up had been around for years. Kay Rene Reed decided to get their DNA tested, and that confirmed the mistake. They both say they just have to move forward with their lives now, and they celebrated their latest birthday together.
*In March 1953, at San-Ikukai Hospital in Tokyo's Sumida Ward, hospital staff mistook a baby boy for another baby boy born 13 minutes later. This story was referred to as the tale of the Japanese "prince and pauper." Sixty years later, a 60-year-old Japanese truck driver discovered he was switched at birth after being born to a rich family. The man was raised by a single mother in a 100-square-foot apartment. The boy who was raised in his place by the rich family became the president of a real estate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/29/247807768/japanese-prince-switched-at-birth-was-raised-a-pauper | title=Japanese 'Prince' Switched At Birth Was Raised A Pauper | publisher=NPR| date=Nov 29, 2013 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Calamur, Krishnadev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Man born to wealthy parents lived in poverty after being switched at birth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc1tOM6Qn5Y|website=YouTube|publisher=Global Report News|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg were switched at birth as a result of a [[medical error]] in a hospital in [[Wauchula, Florida]];&lt;ref name=Guggenheim&gt;{{cite book|title=What's Wrong With Children's Rights?|author=Martin Guggenheim|page=56|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the events surrounding their case were subsequently dramatized as the made-for-TV movie ''[[Switched at Birth (film)|Switched at Birth]]''.
*In 1975, at least two known cases occurred in [[Norway House]], [[Manitoba]] of babies being switched at birth at the Norway House Hospital: Luke Monias and Norman Barkman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-men-switched-at-birth-1.3317638 "2 Manitoba men switched at birth dealing with 'stolen identity'"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], November 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leon Swanson and David Tait Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/switched-birth-first-nation-hospital-manitoba-1.3736933 "Manitoba men weep after learning they were switched at birth 41 years ago"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], August 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Both pairs of boys were from the same small communities, and had been lifelong friends of their switch-mates before learning of the switches only in the mid-2010s.
*The Mixed-Up Brothers of [[Bogotá]] refers to two sets of [[identical twins]] that got separated at birth in 1988 and were raised as [[nonidentical twins]]. The twins reunited in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DOMINUS|first1=SUSAN|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chai|first1=Carmen|title=Watch: A tale of two sets of identical twins, mixed up at birth|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2117243/watch-a-tale-of-two-sets-of-identical-twins-mixed-up-at-birth/|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Global News|publisher=Global News|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where are the 'Mixed up brothers of Bogota' now?|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4432849113001/where-are-the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota-now/?#sp=show-clips|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Fox News|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=http://imgur.com/gallery/bIo6A|website=imgur|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The sons of two [[South Africa]]n women, Margaret Clinton-Parker and Sandra Dawkins, were accidentally switched at birth in 1989; the women sued in the [[High Court of South Africa]] in [[Johannesburg]] in 1995, demanding damages of [[South African rand|ZAR]]120,000 each from the government of the province of [[Gauteng]] for the error.&lt;ref name ="old"&gt;''Clinton-Parker v. Administrator, Transvaal''; ''Dawkins v. Administrator, Transvaal'' 1996 (2) SA 37 (W)&lt;/ref&gt; They were later that year awarded damages to cover medical expenses and the future projected costs of visiting their biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Deseret News]]|date=1995-08-22|title=2 MOMS SUING OVER SONS SWITCHED AT BIRTH|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DSNB/lib00497,0F360DC14A813699.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Damages awarded after babies switched|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=1995-10-22|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/KC/lib00144,0EAF4234676AD331.html|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each family kept the child they had been living with, though, and raised them as their own even after learning of the switch. That was until one of the boys, Robin, at the age of 15, decided to leave Sandy Dawkins to go and live with his biological mother, Margaret Clinton-Parker. The boys spent the remainder of their childhood living as brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=267887 Switched at birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, it was discovered that Canadians Brent Tremblay and Marcus Holmes had been switched at birth 21 years earlier. The error was discovered when Brent and his twin, George Holmes, met each other at Carleton University in Ottawa.  The Children's Aid Society of Ontario later settled with the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/switched.asp snopes.com: Twins Switched at Birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, it was discovered that Callie Johnson and Rebecca Chittum had been switched at birth in 1995 in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The switch was discovered when a DNA test of Callie Johnson to determine paternity for [[child support]] found that she was not biologically related to either her purported father, Carlton Conley, or her purported mother, Paula Johnson. In a tragic coincidence, Callie's biological parents Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a car accident the day after Paula Johnson learned of the results of the DNA test. Five others also died in the car accident, but Rebecca Chittum, Johnson's three-year-old biological daughter whom the deceased couple had been raising as their child, was at home with her supposed grandparents at the time of the accident. Over the next decade, Paula Johnson repeatedly grappled with Rebecca's purported grandparents for custody and visitation rights, until a judge determined that the two girls were old enough to express their own wishes with regard to seeing their biological relatives. In 2001, Carlton Conley married the sister of his biological daughter Rebecca's deceased adoptive father Kevin Chittum. Rebecca Chittum lived with the couple as of 2008 but had limited contact with her biological mother, while Callie lived with Paula Johnson and occasionally visited her biological relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/168155 Two families, 10 years later - Roanoke.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, it was reported that a 35-year-old woman from the [[Canary Islands]] had discovered that she was one of a set of [[identical twins]] and that she had been accidentally switched at birth with another girl. She grew up as an only child, until a friend of her twin mistook her for being that twin. But the person was shocked by the striking similarity in appearance and summoned them together. They took a DNA test, which proved they were identical twins. The twin who had grown up thinking that another girl was her twin said that the girl she thought was her twin looked nothing like her. Since the women were born in a state hospital, they sued the government for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7422635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain twins sue over birth mix-up | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 9, 2006, two newborn girls were switched in a hospital in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] town of Trebic. The families did not find out until September 2007, when a couple of friends of one of the fathers made fun of him for not being the biological father of the baby. DNA tests proved that the girl was indeed switched. After days of investigation, the other family was found. The babies were gradually introduced to their biological parents and returned to their birth homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://czechdaily.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/babies-switched-at-birth-verdict-hospital-to-pay-33m// Switched At Birth Verdict: Hospital to Pay « The Czech Daily Word&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 10, 2011, it was discovered that two [[Russia]]n newborn girls were switched 12 years beforehand in a town in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The truth emerged after the ex-husband of one of the mothers refused to pay alimony for the child on the basis that she looked nothing like him. DNA tests proved that the child was neither's biological daughter. The other family was discovered across town with the biological daughter. The children will stay with their adoptive parents, and both families are demanding 5 million [[rubles]] in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15244382 Russian families sue child mix-up hospital ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moses Cushworth, the son of U.K. citizen Rich Cushworth and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes "Mercy" Casanalles, was switched with another baby at a Salvadoran hospital in May 2015. Getting Moses out of El Salvador became a nine-month process requiring the help of U.K. Ambassador [[Bernhard Garside]] in obtaining a passport for the boy, due to the problems with the birth certificate.

==Anti-switch techniques==
Some hospitals take fingerprints, foot prints, or palm prints of newborns to prevent babies from being mixed up.  Nurses also double check with the mother, checking the identity of that person as well, in order to prevent errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Obstetrics for Nurses|author=Joseph Bolivar De Lee|publisher=W. B. Saunders|location=London and Philadelphia|year=1966|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Childhood and Adolescence: A Psychology of the Growing Person|author=Lawrence Joseph Stone and Joseph Church|year=1973|publisher=Random House UK Ltd|isbn=0-394-31723-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many hospitals also have policies in which a medical record number is assigned to an infant at birth, and bands with this number as well as the last name of the mother of the infant, the sex of the infant, and the date and time of birth are placed on the infant and the mother immediately after [[parturition]] before the mother and child are separated.  A band may also be placed on the father (or other person chosen by the mother) at the time of birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Chinese folklore''' encompasses the folklore of [[China]], and includes songs, poetry, dances, puppetry, and tales. It often tells stories of [[human nature]], historical or legendary events, love, and the supernatural, or stories explaining natural phenomena and distinctive landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Giskin, Howard.  ''Chinese Folktales.''  (NTC Publishing Group, Chicago, 1997).  {{ISBN|0-8442-5927-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Chinese mythology]] it forms an important element in [[Chinese popular religion]].

==Folktales==
[[File:Niulang and Zhinv (Long Corridor).JPG|thumb|The reunion of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]''. Artwork in the [[Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]].]]

The main influences on Chinese folk tales have been [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Some folktales may have arrived from Germany; others have no known western counterparts, but are widespread throughout East Asia.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China"&gt;Eberhard, Wolfram, ''Folktales of China.''(1965). University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1965. University of Congress Catalog Card Number: 65-25440&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folktales include a vast variety of forms such as myths, legends, fables, etc. A number of collections of such tales, such as [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', now remain popular. 

Chinese folklore contains many symbolic folk meanings for the objects and animals within the folktales. One example of this is the symbolic meaning behind frogs and toads. In the "Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, Chang E", frogs and toads are a symbol of wealth and prosperity as well as symbolize fertility, regeneration, yin, and immortality. Each Chinese folktale includes this kind of representation of various objects and animals and uses symbolic messages through its characters and usually strives to convey a message that instills the reader with some sort of virtuous insight. These messages are vital to Chinese culture and through these folktales, they will be passed down to future generations to also learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Shanshan, Y. (2016). Frogs and Toads in Chinese Myths, Legends, and Folklore. Chinese America: History &amp; Perspectives, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of folklore on other media==

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for Chinese writers and poets for centuries. Folk songs which were originally partnered with dance and other styles of performing arts, provided inspiration for courtly poetry. Classical fiction began in the [[Han Dynasty]] and was modeled after oral traditions, while [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era dramatic plays were influenced by folk plays.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for visual imagery by Chinese weavers, painters and watercolorists, florists. One of the most striking examples is a silk funerary banner (circa 168 BC) that contains a number of stories from early China.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=cuddgTWyx50C&amp;dq=hare+and+toad+on+the+moon&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Chinese Myths, by Anne Birrell. University of Texas Press, Sep 15, 2000 - Literary Criticism - 80 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern iterations of traditional Chinese stories can be found internationally as well as in native Chinese literature.  [[Laurence Yep]]'s ''[[The Magic Paintbrush]]'', [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]'s ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' all borrow from Chinese folklore traditions.

==Study of Chinese folklore==
The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', the earliest known Chinese collection of poetry, contains 160 folk songs in addition to courtly songs and hymns. One tradition holds that [[Confucius]] himself collected these songs, while another says that an emperor compiled them as a means to gauge the mood of the people and the effectiveness of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in the ''Classic of Poetry'', helping to secure the ''Classic of Poetry'''s place among the ''[[Five Classics]]''. After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confucius's endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1910s, Chinese folklore began to gain popularity as an area of study with the beginnings of the movement to formally adopt [[Vernacular Chinese]] as the language of education and literature. Because Vernacular Chinese was the dialect in which most folklore was created, this movement brought to scholars' attention the influences that Vernacular Chinese folklore had upon classical literature. [[Hu Shih]] of the [[Peking University]], who had published several articles in support of the adoption of Vernacular Chinese, concluded that when Chinese writers drew their inspiration from folk traditions such as traditional tales and songs, Chinese literature experienced a renaissance. When writers neglected these sources, they lost touch with the people of the nation. A new emphasis on the study of folklore, Hu concluded, could therefore usher in a new renaissance of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

The Folksong Studies Movement became a key contributor to establishing Chinese Folklore as a modern academic discipline. This movement was founded by students and professors at Peking University in 1918. They were successful in creating a field of study that focused on literature pertaining to Chinese folklore and attempted to bring to light the early traditions and culture of Chinese folklore in order to reestablish China's national spirit.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A rising sense of national identity was also partially responsible for spurring the new interest in traditional folklore.  The first issue of the ''Folk-Song Weekly'', a publication issued by the Folk-Song Research Society, stated that "Based on the folk songs, on the real feeling of the nation, a kind of new national poetry may be produced."&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Some folklore enthusiasts also hoped to further social reforms by their work. To help improve the condition of the Chinese people, it was believed, it was necessary to understand their ideas, beliefs, and customs.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt; After China emerged from the [[Maoism|Maoist]] period in the late 1970s, the state had an increasingly more accepting position toward academic research on China’s cultural traditions and folklore. Forbidden traditions and practices in early Chinese history were at this point in time becoming more relevant and accepted within the Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Communist and Communist thinkers were especially energetic in this belief. In the time leading up to the founding of the [[Communist Party of China]], many folk songs and stories were collected by Communist thinkers and scholars. Often, they were reinvented and reinterpreted to emphasize such themes as the virtue of the working commoner and the evil of aristocracy, while stories that expressed praise for the emperor were frequently left out of Communist collections. Some folk tales and folk plays that exist today may in fact have been deliberately written by Communist authors to emphasize particular social morals.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

'''African cinema''' is film production in [[Africa]]. It dates back to the early 20th century, when film reels were the primary cinematic technology in use. During the colonial era, African life was shown only by the work of white, colonial, Western filmmakers, who depicted blacks in a negative fashion, as exotic "others".&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 426-442"&gt;Hayward, Susan.

==History==
===Colonial era===
{{See also |Annees folles |Negritude}}
During the colonial era, Africa was represented exclusively by Western filmmakers. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Western filmmakers made films that depicted black Africans as "exoticized", "submissive workers" or as "savage or cannibalistic". For example, see ''Kings of the Cannibal Islands'' in 1909, ''Voodoo Vengeance'' (1913) and ''[[Congorilla]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 426-442"/&gt; Colonial era films portrayed Africa as exotic, without history or culture. Examples abound and include jungle epics based on the [[Tarzan]] character created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and the [[adventure film]] ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), and various adaptations of [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885).&lt;ref name="authentic"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Murphskirty, David| title=Africans Filming Africa: Questioning Theories of an Authentic African Cinema| journal=Journal of African Cultural Studies| year=2000| volume=13| issue=2| pages=239–249| doi=10.1080/713674315| jstor=1771833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much early ethnography "focused on highlighting the differences between indigenous people and the white civilised man, thus reinforcing colonial propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinefiliaritrovata.it/the-anti-colonial-gaze-in-ethnographic-cinema-voyage-au-congo-e-marquis-de-wavrin/ |title=The anti-colonial gaze in ethnographic cinema: “Voyage au Congo” e “Marquis de Wavrin” |date=July 1, 2018| access-date=October 18, 2018| publisher=Cinefilia ritrovata }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Allégret]]'s first film,''Voyage au Congo'' (1927) respectfully portrayed the [[Masa people]], in particular a young African entertaining his little brother with a baby crocodile on a string. Yet the Africans were portrayed as human but not equals; a dialogue card for example referred to the movements of a traditional dance as naive. His lover, writer [[André Gide]], accompanied Allégret and wrote a book also titled ''Voyage au Congo''. Allégret later made ''[[Zouzou (film)|Zouzou]]'', starring [[Josephine Baker]], the first major film starring a black woman. Baker had caused a sensation in the Paris arts scene by dancing in the {{ILL|Revue Nègre|fr}} clad only in a string of bananas.

Vieyra was trained in filmmaking at the [[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]] (IDHEC) in Paris, and despite the ban on filmmaking in Africa, was granted permission to make a film in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Diawara (1992), ''African Cinema'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the first film directed by a black African, ''Afrique Sur Seine'' explores the difficulties of being an African in 1950s France.&lt;ref&gt;Gugler, Josef (2003).

Portuguese colonies came to independence with no film production facilities at all, since the colonial government there restricted film-making to colonialist propaganda, emphasizing the inferiority of indigenous populations. Therefore little thought was given until independence to developing authentic African voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=234| volume=1|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought

In the mid-1930s, the [[Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment]] was conducted in an attempt to "educate the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], mosstly about hygiene. Only three films from the this project survive; they are kept at the British Film Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Notcutt, L. A., and G. C. Latham, ''The African and the Cinema: An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937'', London: Edinburgh House Press, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the colonies' independence, few anti-colonial films were produced. Examples included [[Statues Also Die]] (''Les statues meurent aussi'') by [[Chris Marker]] and [[Alain Resnais]], about European theft of African art. The second part of this film was for 10 years banned in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. Frank Ukadike|Ukadike, Nwachukwu Frank]] (1994), ''Black African Cinema''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;) ''[[Afrique 50]]'' by [[René Vautier]], showed anti-colonial riots in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and in Upper Volta (now [[Burkina Faso]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Thackway (2003). ''Africa Shoots Back: Alternative Perspectives in Sub-Saharan Francophone African Film''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34349-9}}, pp. 7 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also doing film work in Africa at this time was French ethnographic filmmaker [[Jean Rouch]], controversial with both French and African audiences. Film documentaries such as ''Jaguar'' (1955), ''[[Les Maîtres Fous|Les maitres fous]]'' (1955), ''[[Moi, un noir]]'' (1958) and ''La pyramide humaine'' (1959). Rouch's documentaries were not explicitly anti-colonial, but did challenge perceptions of colonial Africa and give a new voice to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Rouch's work, see Steven Feld (ed.), ''Cine-Ethnography'' (1994), and Paul Henley, ''The Adventure of the Real: Jean Rouch and the Craft of Ethnographic Cinema'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rouch was accused by [[Ousmane Sembene]] and others&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Nwachukwu Frank Ukadike, ''Black African Cinema'' (1994), pp. 48–58.&lt;/ref&gt; of seeing Africans "[http://maitres-fous.net/Sembene.html as if they are insects]," Rouch was an important figure in the developing field of African film and was the first person to work with Africans, of whom many had important careers in African cinema ([[Oumarou Ganda]], [[Safi Faye]] and [[Moustapha Alassane]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;Diawara (1992). ''African Cinema'', pp. 23–24. See also Henley, Paul (2010), ''The Adventure of the Real: Jean Rouch and the Craft of Ethnographic Cinema'', Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], pp. 310–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most films made prior to independence were egregiously racist in nature, African filmmakers of the independence era{{spaced ndash}} such as Ousmane Sembene and Oumarou Ganda, among others{{spaced ndash}} saw filmmaking as an important political tool for rectifying the erroneous image of Africans put forward by Western filmmakers and for reclaiming the image of Africa for Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Thackway (2003). ''Africa Shoots Back'', pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence and 1970s===

The first African film to win international recognition was [[Sembène Ousmane]]'s ''La Noire de...'' also known as ''[[Black Girl (1966 film)|Black Girl]]''. It showed the despair of an African woman who has to work as a maid in France. It won the [[Prix Jean Vigo]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/02/how-ousmane-sembene-invented-african-cinema.html |work= Vulture |date=November 5, 2015|title=The Story of Sembene!: How Ousmane Sembene Invented African Cinema
|author=Bilge Ebiri |access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a writer, Sembène had turned to cinema to reach a wider audience. He is still considered the "father of African cinema".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McLellan, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/14/local/me-sembene14 "Ousmane Sembene, 84; Sengalese hailed as 'the father of African film'" (obituary)], ''Los Angeles Times'', June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sembène's native [[Senegal]] continued to be the most important place of African film production for more than a decade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

With the creation of the African film festival [[FESPACO]] in [[Burkina Faso]] in 1969, African film created its own forum. FESPACO now takes place every two years in alternation with the [[Carthago]] film festival in [[Tunisia]].

The [[Pan African Federation of Filmmakers]] (Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes, or FEPACI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fepaci.org/congress1 FEPACI.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226111448/http://www.fepaci.org/congress1/ |date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 1969 to promote African film industries in terms of production, distribution and exhibition. From its inception, FEPACI was seen as a critical partner organization to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), now the [[African Union]]. FEPACI looks at the role of film in the politico-economic and cultural development of African states and the continent as a whole.

[[Med Hondo]]'s ''[[Soleil O]]'', shot in 1969, was immediately recognized. No less politically engaged than Sembène, he chose a more controversial filmic language to show what it means to be a stranger in France with the "wrong" skin colour.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===1980s and 1990s===
[[Souleymane Cissé]]'s ''[[Yeelen]]'' (Mali, 1987) was the first film made by a Black African to compete at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/africa/1282690/african-filmmakers-in-cannes-2018-want-to-take-back-control-from-european-producers/ |title=In Cannes, African filmmakers are plotting to take back control from European producers | author=Nadia Neophytou |work=QuartzAfrica |date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cheick Oumar Sissoko]]'s ''[[Guimba the Tyrant|Guimba]]'' (Mali, 1995) was also well received in the west. Some critics criticized the filmmakers for adapting to the [[exoticism|exotic]] tastes of western audiences.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Many films of the 1990s, including ''Quartier Mozart'' by [[Jean-Pierre Bekolo]] (Cameroon, 1992), are situated in the globalized African metropolis.

[[Nigerian cinema]] experienced a large growth in the [[Video film era|1990s]] with the increasing availability of home video cameras in Nigeria, and soon put [[Nollywood]] in the nexus for [[West Africa]]n English-language films. Nollywood produced 1844 movies in 2013 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/24/nollywood-movie-industry/ |title=Meet 'Nollywood': The second largest movie industry in the world |author=Jake Bright |date=June 24, 2015 |access-date=October 28, 2018|publisher=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first [[African Film Summit]] took place in [[South Africa]] in 2006. It was followed by FEPACI 9th Congress.

The [[African Movie Academy Awards]] were launched in 2004, marking the growth of local film industries like that of Nigeria as well as the development and spread of the film industry culture in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Themes==
[[File:AIRSCREEN Africa.jpg|thumb|right|An Open-Air-Cinema in [[Johannesburg]] with an [[inflatable movie screen]] (2010).]]
African cinema focuses on social and political themes rather than any commercial interests, and explores the conflicts between the traditional past and modern times. The political approach of African filmmakers is clearly evident in the [[Charte du cinéaste africain]] (Charter of the African cinéaste), which the [[Pan African Federation of Filmmakers]] (FEPACI) adopted in Algiers in 1975. The filmmakers start by recalling the [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] condition of African societies. "The situation contemporary African societies live in is one in which they are dominated on several levels: politically, economically and culturally."{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} African filmmakers stressed their solidarity with progressive filmmakers in other parts of the world. African cinema is often seen a part of [[Third Cinema]].

Some African filmmakers, for example [[Ousmane Sembène]], try to give African history back to African people by remembering the resistance to European and Islamic domination.

The African filmmaker is often compared to the traditional [[griot]]. Like griots, filmmakers' task is to express and reflect communal experiences. Patterns of African [[oral literature]] often recur in African films. African film has also been influenced by traditions from other continents, such as [[Italian neorealism]], [[Brazil]]ian [[Cinema Novo]] and the theatre of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

==Women directors==
Senegalese ethnologist and filmmaker [[Safi Faye]] was the first African woman film director to gain international recognition.

In 1972, [[Sarah Maldoror]] shot her film ''[[Sambizanga (film)|Sambizanga]]'' about the [[Portuguese Colonial War|1961–74 war]] in [[Angola]]. Surviving African women of this war are the subject of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Les Oubliées]]'' (The forgotten women), made by [[Anne-Laure Folly]] 20 years later.  

In 1995, [[Wanjiru Kinyanjui]] made the feature film ''The Battle of the Sacred Tree'' in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfilm.org/films/1996/the-battle-of-the-sacred-tree |title=THE BATTLE OF THE SACRED TREE|publisher=Cleaveland International Film Festival|author=G. Cahill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Manouchka Kelly Labouba]] became the first woman in the history of [[Gabon]]ese cinema to direct a fictional film. Her short film ''Le Divorce'' addresses the impact of modern and [[traditional values]] on the divorce of a young Gabonese couple.

[[Kemi Adetiba]], hitherto a [[music video]] director, made her directorial debut in 2016 with ''[[The Wedding Party (2016 film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, about the events involved in the celebration of an aristocratic wedding, would go on to become the most successful [[Nollywood]] film in the history of her native [[Nigeria]].

'''Cleo Madison''' (March 26, 1883 – March 11, 1964) was a theatrical and silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director who worked heavily in early Hollywood in a career spanning from the late 1910s to the mid-1920s.

Madison began her career on the stage. By 1910, she had begun performing as part of a theatre troupe known as the Santa Barbara Stock Company in California. In 1913, she was contracted by the [[Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] to begin appearing in feature films. Madison established a name for herself as an actress with performances in films such as ''[[The Trey o' Hearts]]'' (1914). She is also considered a pioneering female director with a number of shorts and two feature films, ''A Soul Enslaved'' (1916) and ''[[Her Bitter Cup]]'' (1916), to her credit.

She made several efforts to set up a production company before leaving show business in 1924. She died from a heart-attack in 1964 at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Cleo Madison was born '''Lulu Bailey''' in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]&lt;ref name=Photoplay_316/&gt; on March 26, 1883.&lt;ref name=Cooper2013/&gt; She attended [[Illinois State University#History|Illinois State Normal University]] (which became Illinois State University in 1965) in Normal, Illinois. After completing her education, she moved to California in order to pursue her dream of performing professionally.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Early career==
She began her acting career on stage with the Santa Barbara Stock Company.&lt;ref name=Foster1995/&gt; She made her first professional appearances on the stages of the [[Burbank, California#Early history|Burbank Theatre]] and the [[David Belasco#Theatres|Belasco]] in 1911. She played the role of the mother in ''Captain Swift''. In March 1912 she debuted as the leading female player in Ernest Shipman's stock company in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; her first production was ''When We Were Twenty-One''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  She toured on [[vaudeville]] briefly.&lt;ref name=Photoplay_116 /&gt;

In 1913 Madison signed with [[Universal Pictures]] and achieved star status the following year in ''[[The Trey o' Hearts]]'' (1914), a 15-episode [[film serial]] for Universal.&lt;ref name=Cooper2013 /&gt; Madison played three roles in the serial, portraying both the protagonist, Judith Trine, and the villain, her evil twin Rose, as well as the twins' mother.&lt;ref name=filmdirectors/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soister2012/&gt;

=== Acting style ===
Madison's performances were based on an acting style she developed during her time as a vaudeville performer, relying on large gestures and melodramatic facial expressions. She did not avoid physical exertion in pursuit of convincing portrayal, as demonstrated in ''The Trey of Hearts'' (1914) in which her character endured a number of physical challenges such as being in a car crash, being shot at, and escaping a forest fire.&lt;ref name=filmdirectors/&gt; Her characters often defied stereotypical roles of women in film and encompassed heroines, free-thinkers, villains, temptresses, and adventurers. Madison's acting style employed her total commitment and passion to each role, and her performances were often acclaimed as such. Journalist [[Bill Henry (Los Angeles Times)|William M. Henry]], writing for ''[[Photoplay]]'', highlighted her skill by contrasting her emotional performances with her calculating and business-like persona in real-life: "... to see Madison in pictures tells you absolutely nothing about her character.  Before the camera she smiles and weeps with the wonderful sympathy of which only a woman is capable."

By 1915, Madison had become well known as one of the foremost women working in Hollywood, and she began to seek new challenges within the industry such as screenwriting, producing, and directing.

=== Directorial career ===
In 1915, Madison became one of the few women in Hollywood to begin directing her own short and feature films. Madison was among the unprecedented wave of female directors employed by Universal that included [[Grace Cunard]], [[Jeanie MacPherson]] and [[Lois Weber]]. Madison, known for her progressive views, was eager to begin work and was confident in her own ability. She was quoted in ''Photoplay'' magazine:

{{quote|One of these days, men are going to get over the fool idea that women have no brains, and quit getting insulted at the thought that a skirt-wearer can do their work quite as well as they can. And I don't believe that day is very far off.&lt;ref name=Photoplay_116/&gt;}}

Madison directed sixteen shorts and two feature-length films in a directorial career lasting only one year. Her most notable credits included the short films ''Her Defiance'' (1916), ''Eleanor's Catch'' (1916), and ''Triumph of Truth'' (1916). ''Eleanor's Catch'' was notable from a directorial perspective as one of the first films to use the twist ending;{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} in it, Madison as the heroine is ultimately revealed to be an undercover government agent.&lt;ref name=Soister2012/&gt;

Both of Madison's feature film efforts have been praised in recent history by film historians;{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} ''Her Bitter Cup'' (1916) is the underdog tale of unionized workers led by Madison's character staging a protest against their oppressive boss.&lt;ref name=AFIBitter/&gt; ''A Soul Enslaved'' (1916) features a desperate heroine becoming a rich man's mistress to escape poverty, and afterward suffering the consequences of her actions in a later, conventional relationship.&lt;ref name=AFISoul/&gt;

[[File:Cleo Madison The Blue Book of the Screen.jpg|thumb|An undated photo of Cleo Madison.]]

Madison's role as director allowed her to incorporate themes previously ignored by mainstream Hollywood{{clarify|reason=In 1915 there was hardly a mainstream Hollywood and very little previous|date=June 2015}} such as oppression, sexuality, and power from a female perspective.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} She believed being female positively influenced her directing style, remarking once that each of her directed pieces had to have a certain "feminine touch".&lt;ref name=silentaera/&gt;

Madison's directorial credits end after 1916 for unknown reasons, although film historians have speculated that her status and workload led to a nervous breakdown that forced her into an early retirement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Later career===
Reports in 1916–1917 indicated she was forming a production company with [[Isadore Bernstein]] which ultimately failed to materialize;&lt;ref name=Cooper2013/&gt; in 1919 she was again reported to be forming her own production studio.&lt;ref name=MPW1919/&gt; During these years she continued to act in films such as ''[[Black Orchids (film)|Black Orchids]]'' (1917), ''[[The Romance of Tarzan]]'' (1918), ''The Girl From Nowhere'' (1919) and ''[[The Great Radium Mystery]]'' (1919).

By the early 1920s, Madison's career had been steadily declining. Although she remained active with bit parts in several Universal shorts, she no longer possessed the star power necessary to inhabit lead roles. Many film historians{{who|date=June 2015}} point to her enormous output of work throughout the mid-1910s as a cause of exhaustion and exasperation for Madison.

She was rumored to have suffered a nervous breakdown in 1922, attempted a career-comeback in 1923, and by 1924 had permanently withdrawn from the film industry.

== Personal life ==
She was enthusiastic about cars and driving. Madison purchased a 1915 auto manufactured by the [[Haynes Automobile Company]] in December 1914. In her work for the Universal Gold Seal Company she occasionally drove a car.

Many accounts that go into detail about Madison's life don't note her November 1916 marriage to Don Peake of [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-cleo-madison/|title=Cleo Madison – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was western sales manager of the Briscoe Motor Corporation.&lt;ref name=Cooper2013/&gt; The marriage certificate lists the bride as Lulu Bailey, and evidence points to Lulu Bailey being Madison's birth name. Her sister's name was Helen Bailey, and the divorce certificate lists Bailey as an actress.&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"/&gt; Before her marriage she resided with her sister, Helen, in a [[bungalow]] in [[Hollywood]]. Helen, nicknamed "Sunshine" for her bright disposition, was disabled and used a wheelchair. By 1916 she had been an invalid for eight years. Madison was especially devoted to her care.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Death ==
After leaving the film industry, she lived her remaining years in California with her husband, Don Peake. In 1964, Madison suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 80. She is buried in Glendale's Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.

The '''Coventry Sallet''' is a 15th-century helmet now on display at [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].&lt;ref name=Shaffery /&gt; English [[sallet]]s have been considered both rare and important.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], 13 August 1927: Arms And Armour. New Exhibits At Victoria And Albert Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Herbert Art Gallery and Museum - Coventry Sallet.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Sallet seen from the front]]
The Sallet is 11 inches (27.9&amp;nbsp;cm) in height, 12.25 inches (31.1&amp;nbsp;cm) from front to back and is 7.75 inches (17.9&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.&lt;ref name=Shaffery&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter Baron|last1=Shaffery |year=1982 |title=Early English helmets Part II |journal=Guns, weapons &amp; Militaria |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=24–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It weighs 5.25 pounds (2.4&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Shaffery /&gt; It has a short tail and a jawbone type [[visor]] with a brow reinforcing.&lt;ref name=blair&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blair |first1=C |year=1955 |title=The Blithfield Sallet |journal=Archaeological Journal |volume=CXI  |pages=162–163|doi=10.1080/00665983.1954.10854081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, it is termed a "high crowned" helmet, different from the style usually seen in Italy or Germany.&lt;ref name="Gravett 2001"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gravett |first=Christopher |year=2001 |title=English Medieval Knight 1400-1500 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-1-84176-146-6|page =29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plume holder was added to the helmet at some time after its manufacture.&lt;ref name=blair /&gt;

==History==

The helmet was made around 1460, during the period of English civil conflict known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], and the armourer's marks suggest that it was made by an artisan originating from Italy.&lt;ref name=ShafferyGravett&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter Baron|last1=Shaffery |year=1982 |title=Early English helmets Part II |journal=Guns, weapons &amp; Militaria |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=24–28 }} {{Citation |last=Gravett |first=Christopher |year=2001 |title=English Medieval Knight 1400-1500 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-1-84176-146-6|page =29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century it was used in Coventry’s [[Godiva Procession]].&lt;ref name=Shaffery /&gt; For a period it was kept on display at St Mary's Hall, Coventry, and is now shown at the city's [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].&lt;ref name=Shaffery /&gt;

Very few pieces of English-made armour survive from this period; the Coventry Sallet is believed to be the only example of its type in England.&lt;ref name="Gravett 2001"/&gt;

'''Creative Time''' is a New York-based nonprofit arts organization. It was founded in 1973 to support the creation of innovative, site-specific, socially engaged artworks in the public realm, particularly in vacant spaces of historical and architectural interest. 

== History ==
Creative Time came to life amidst the deterioration of New York City's infrastructure and social fabric, combined with the mission of the newly established [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to promote the role of artists in democratic society and introduce new audiences to contemporary art. Artists in the late 1960s and early 70s were already experimenting with new media and new forms of art that could exist in the public sphere, outside the purview conventional art galleries and museums.

Early Creative Time programs took over abandoned storefronts and neglected public spaces, such as the Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage and the Great Hall of the Chamber of Commerce in Lower Manhattan. Both landmarks had been unused for years before Creative Time reinvigorated them, through programs like ''Art in the Anchorage'' (1983-2001) and ''Projects at the Chamber'' (1982).

Creative Time initially gained widespread recognition for organizing ‘’Art on the Beach,’’ a project which brought together practitioners of many mediums and allowed for the creation of large scale public works in [[Battery Park City]] between 1978 and 1985.  For three months each summer ‘’Art on the Beach’’ offered site-specific sculpture and performances that were open to the public and free of cost.

Throughout the duration of ‘’Art on the Beach”, Creative Time was led by co-founder Anita Contini, who served as director until Cee Scott Brown took over in 1987.  [[Anne Pasternak]] took the reins as director from 1993 to September, 2015.  Taking her place as the current director is Katie Hollander.  To this day, Creative Time continues to grow and prosper, each year giving both emerging and established artists unmatched opportunities to broaden their repertoires and explore the practice of art in the public realm. With these artists’ creations, Creative Time also allows millions of people of all ages and backgrounds to come in contact with contemporary art, enlivening the city around them&lt;ref&gt;“About Creative Time.” ''Creative Time'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://creativetime.org/about/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt;.  Since its founding, Creative Time has collaborated with over 2000 artists, producing more than 335 public art projects&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Time Releases Recommendations for Fostering the Arts in Dallas - SMU''. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.smu.edu/News/2011/meadows-prize-report-01feb2011&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Mission ==
Creative Time produces, presents, and sponsors programs in the visual and performing arts that encourage dialogue between artists and communities. Creative Time's projects expand the definition of [[public art]] by employing artists concerned with enhancing the viewer's perception of a particular environment, sharing the creative process with the public, and using densely populated locations lacking in cultural amenities.

Instead of having a readily identifiable home, Creative Time focuses on having a well-defined programming philosophy, which requires that it move around to take advantage of the city's richness of resources. As defined on Creative Time’s website, Creative Time aims to promote three core values in the artworld: “art matters, artists’ voices are important in shaping society, and public spaces are places for creative and free expression”&lt;ref&gt;“About Creative Time.” ''Creative Time'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://creativetime.org/about/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Reception and Notable Projects ==
In recent years, Creative Time has taken charge of many noted initiatives in the art world. In collaboration with the Dallas art community, Creative Time took part in a yearlong study to better understand the strengths and areas of growth within the Dallas art scene. In this study, members of Creative Time met with various figures within the art community including artists, curators, philanthropists and collectors over the course of three week long visits to the city in 2010&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Time - Start a Movement - Meadows School of the Arts - SMU''. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.smu.edu/Meadows/TheMovement/MeadowsPrize/2010-CreativeTime&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; . Following these meetings, Creative Time produced a study detailing suggestions to help bolster the art scene in Dallas, identifying 13 key elements to help the community thrive listed as follows:

* A sustainable artist community and opportunities for live/work space
* Cultural institutions with international reach, innovative programs and historically relevant collections
* Great patrons who support the creation, presentation and acquisition of art
* Mid-sized and small art spaces that support the creation of new and experimental work by local and international artists
* Skilled and visionary arts leaders in institutions big and small
* Excellent contemporary art galleries with international reach
* Residency programs for national and international artists to create in Dallas
* Master of Fine Arts programs to train and attract artists
* Arts education in Dallas public schools
* Public art to engage broad audiences and activate public spaces
* Engaged audiences
* Experienced art writers featured daily in primary news media
* Civic championing of the arts through policies and urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Time Releases Recommendations for Fostering the Arts in Dallas - SMU''. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.smu.edu/News/2011/meadows-prize-report-01feb2011&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the large number of Creative Time projects, it is impossible to exhaustively list the organization’s accomplishment, which range from art installations at the 2008 Art Basel in Miami&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Time Partners with Art Basel Miami Beach to Redesign Oceanfront''. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://artdaily.com/news/33855/Creative-Time-Partners-with-Art-Basel-Miami-Beach-to-Redesign-Oceanfront&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. to the opening of a gallery under the Brooklyn Bridge in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. “Art: Brooklyn Bridge Unveils Its Own Gallery.” ''The New York Times'', 27 May 1983. ''NYTimes.com'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/27/arts/art-brooklyn-bridge-unveils-its-own-gallery.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The inclusion of these more specific examples is intended to illustrate Creative Time’s diverse role in the art world from the organizations founding in 1974 to present day &lt;ref&gt;''Creative Time - Start a Movement - Meadows School of the Arts - SMU''. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.smu.edu/Meadows/TheMovement/MeadowsPrize/2010-CreativeTime&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The vast array of projects in recent years include skywriting over Manhattan in ‘’[http://creativetime.org/projects/clouds/ Clouds]’’ (a 2001 collaboration with [[Vik Muniz]]), [[Tribute in Light]] (2002), and [[Kara Walker]]'s ''[[A Subtlety]]'' (2014). Creative Time has also collaborated with such artists as [[Vito Acconci]], [[Diller + Scofidio]], [[David Byrne]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Red Grooms]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Shirin Neshat]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Elizabeth Streb]], [[Tania Bruguera]], [[Temporary Services]], [[Marc Horowitz]] and [[Superflex]], among thousands more.

In addition to these artists, Creative Time often partners with other cultural institutions in New York City and elsewhere, like the [[Dia Art Foundation]], the [[Queens Museum of Art]], [[Lincoln Center]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

'''''Dancing Through Life''''' is a [[public art]] work by artist [[Schomer Lichtner]]. It is installed on the  [[Milwaukee Riverwalk|Riverwalk]] in Pere Marquette Park in downtown [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

==Description==
The steel sculpture depicts a [[ballerina]] "poised prettily" on a [[cow]].&lt;ref name=Auer&gt;{{cite news|last=Auer|first=James|title=Whimsy marked Lichtner's long artistic career|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow is painted green, purple, blue and yellow, with a black face, white triangular nose and red horns. The ballerina bends one knee to rest on the back of the cow and kicks her other leg overhead. She wears a red and white [[polka dot|polka-dotted]] [[leotard]], white [[ballet tutu|tutu]] and red [[ballet slippers]]. Both arms extend aloft, and she holds a blue fan above her head in one hand. The entire composition incorporates folds and [[assemblage art|assemblage]] to create a sense of angularity and dynamism.

==Location==
''Dancing Through Life'' occupies a prominent location at the southern entrance to Pere Marquette Park. Lichtner collaborated with the Riverwalk District BID to contribute to its [[RiverSculpture!]] program by placing the sculpture at this location.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams-Ng|first=Stacey|title=Milwaukee artists Grotenrath, Lichtner were the power couple of brush and easel|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/119956394.html#!page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denver’s Art District on Santa Fe''' (ADSF) is a nationally known arts and cultural district, encompassing hundreds of artists, galleries, studios, theaters, and creative businesses along Santa Fe Drive in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. ADSF is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit membership organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/56-2403574|title=Denver's Art District on Santa Fe - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Denver's Art District on Santa Fe.JPG|275px|thumb|right|The Arts District, looking north along Santa Fe Drive from 8th Avenue.]]
The organization formed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/BusinessEntityDetail.do?quitButtonDestination=BusinessEntityResults&amp;nameTyp=ENT&amp;entityId2=20031303408&amp;srchTyp=ENTITY&amp;fileId=20131736400&amp;masterFileId=20031303408|title=Colorado Secretary of State - Summary|website=www.sos.state.co.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the first Certified Creative Districts in the state of Colorado in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/03/09/santa-fe-drive-salida-named-colorado.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Denver's Art District on Santa Fe spans from 13th Street on the North to Alameda Avenue on the South, and Kalamath Street on the West to Inca Street on the East. It is primarily located in the La Alma-[[Lincoln Park, Denver|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood in Denver, but it also overlaps the [[Baker, Denver|Baker]] neighborhood. The stretch of Santa Fe was once a [[American bison|buffalo]] migration route, and the first settlers arrived in the mid-1800s. The area was home to waves of immigrants, initially from Europe and Russia, followed by Mexicans fleeing the [[Revolution of 1910]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnparkneighborhood.org/history/|title=La Alma-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association  » History|website=www.lincolnparkneighborhood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to significant entertainment and cultural pillars such as:

'''Diane Kurys''' ({{IPA-fr|djan kyʁis|lang}}; born 3 December 1948) is a French [[filmmaker]] and [[actress]]. She was born in [[Lyon]], [[Rhône]], France, the younger of two daughters born to Russian-Jewish parents who divorced when she was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of her films as director are semi-autobiographical.

==Personal life==
Like many of her film's characters, Kurys had a difficult relationship with her parents, and her traumatic childhood became a subject in many of her films.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her mother after their divorce in 1954, at one point running away to join her father at age sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In her adolescence, she was radicalized in the spirit of [[Events of May 1968 in France|May of '68]], but became somewhat disillusioned in the aftermath, calling it a "revolution bourgeois" in an interview with Jean-Luc Wachthausen &lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Tarr 1999 pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; She first met her partner and fellow filmmaker Alexandre Arcady, when she was fifteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; They have been a couple since the 1960s, have two production companies together as well as a son born in 1991, Yasha,&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; an author who writes under the name of  Sacha Sperling [[:fr:Sacha Sperling|fr]].

==Acting career==
She began as an actress with [[Jean-Louis Barrault]]'s company. She acted in theater, film, and television for eight years, but felt unable to express herself under "the director or any kind of authority or control."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to her transitioning into writing and film making.

==Film directing==
With a government grant, she made her first film as director, ''Diabolo menthe'' (1977) (aka ''[[Peppermint Soda]]''), which explored her life as a child of divorced parents, and focused on her relationship with her sister, to whom she dedicated the movie. ''[[Cocktail Molotov (film)|Cocktail Molotov]]'' (1980) was her next film. In ''Coup de Foudre'' (1983) (a.k.a. ''[[Entre Nous (film)|Entre Nous]]''), the divorce issue is revisited, with [[Isabelle Huppert]] playing the heroine's mother.

Kurys made her first English-language film, ''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'', in 1987 starring [[Peter Coyote]] and [[Greta Scacchi]]. At the film's conclusion, Scacchi's character gives up acting to become a writer; echoing Kurys's own transition in life.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[C'est la vie (1990 film)|C'est la vie]]'' (a.k.a. ''La Baule-les-Pins'') (1990) returned to her alter-ego leading character's adolescent years.  Huppert also appeared in ''Après l'amour'' (1992) (aka ''[[Love After Love (1992 film)|Love After Love]]''). ''[[À la folie]]'' (aka ''Six Days, Six Nights'') (1994) examined the relationship between two adult sisters. She also directed the period film ''[[Les Enfants du Siècle (1999 film)|Children of the Century]]'' which (1999) and the 2008 [[biopic]] about [[Françoise Sagan]] called ''[[Sagan (film)|Sagan]]''. Her latest film is ''[[Pour une femme]]'', released in 2013, which stars [[Benoît Magimel]], [[Mélanie Thierry]] and [[Nicolas Duvauchelle]].

=== Critical reception ===
Although Kurys' work as a filmmaker in the 1980s helped bring women's filmmaking into the mainstream of its time, her commercial successes have played a part in keeping her from being granted [[auteur]] status by many critics.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2008, pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Her harsher critics have called her films conventional, polished, and not challenging to cinema's status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1995, pg. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, her ambivalence toward feminism and dislike of the "woman director" or "women's cinema" label has played a part in her lack of feminist film study scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1995, pg. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2008, pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In a section on Kurys for ''French Film: texts and contexts''&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 2000, pgs. 240-252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first book-length study of Kurys work, film scholar Carrie Tarr argues that her work is firmly within the [[auteur]]ist tradition, "a coherent body of work with a recognizable style".&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 2000, pg. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Kurys' use of her own life story, her inclusion of a stand-in for herself in most films, the recurring character types and situations from her memories and concerns in her present, all create a body of work specifically centered on a unique female voice. Tarr theorizes that Kurys' signature contains two voices,&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; one which reflect her rebellion against the male-centric world she meant to escape by turning from acting to filmmaking, and the other which collaborates with the patriarchal structure she still must operate within to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pgs. 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production companies==
The first, Alexandre Films was formed in 1977 with [[Alexandre Arcady]] prior to the release of ''[[Peppermint Soda]]''. The company co-produced her first six films, as well as a number of Arcady's, whose name it bears.&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair formed a second company, New Light Films, in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;Tarr 1999, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; which produces films in both French and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandre Films/New Light Films|url=http://www.alexandre-films.com|website=Alexandre Films/New Light Films|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa''' ({{lang-pt|Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa}}) is a royal palace in Portugal, located in the [[freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Vila Viçosa)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição]], in the [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Vila Viçosa Municipality|Vila Viçosa]], in the [[Alentejo]], situated about 150 km (93 miles) east of the capital [[Lisbon]]. It was for many centuries the seat of [[House of Braganza]], one of the most important noble houses in Portugal which was the ruling house of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] from 1640 until 1910 when King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], titular head of the family, was deposed in the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] which brought in a Republican government.

[[Vila Viçosa]] became a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Dukes of Braganza]] when [[Fernando I of Braganza]] succeeded his father [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza]], and received the title of [[Count of Arraiolos]] from his grandfather, [[Nuno Alvares Pereira]]. Fernando I established his seat at the primitive [[Castelo de Vila Viçosa|Vila Viçosa Castle]]. However, following the 1483 execution of his son, [[Fernando II of Braganza|Fernando II, 3rd Duke of Braganza]], for treason by order of King [[John II of Portugal]], the family was exiled to the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Returning in 1498 (after the death of King John II in 1495), the family regained its ancestral lands, although [[Jaime, Duke of Braganza|Jaime, 4th Duke of Braganza]] (Fernando II's successor), declined to live in the Castle of Vila Viçosa, owing to its association with his father's betrayal and murder.

Construction of the ducal palace of the Dukes of Braganza began during the tenure of Duke Jaime of Braganza, between 1501–1502.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2750 |title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa (v.PT040714030009) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|first=Castro |last=Nunes|year=1993 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa|editor=IGESPAR|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=2006|location=Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico|language=Portuguese|first=Catherine|last=Oliveira|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416224802/http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was situated in the ''Horta do Reguengo'' outside the walls of the nearby medieval village, in an area that was ''"characterized by extensive olive orchards and an abundance of water"'', presenting some similarities to the feudal residences of the region, such as the ''Sempre Noiva'' or ''Paço de Alvito''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Teixeira (1997), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Braganza regained much of its power and wealth over time due to Duke Jaime's close kinship with the royal family (he being the nephew of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]) and his actions in reconciling relations between the nobles. Duke Jaime of Braganza commanded the victorious expedition to Azamor in 1513, and having secured a pardon expanded the wealth of the House of Braganza, and contributed to the growth of the ducal palace.

In 1535 [[Teodósio I, 5th Duke of Braganza]] was appointed ''Constable of the Kingdom''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; He managed to negotiate the marriage of his sister, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimarães|Isabella of Braganza]], with  [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimarães]] (a brother of King [[John III of Portugal]]), securing a closer association with the royal family.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;  Following the need to expand the palace for the celebrations of the royal marriage, Teodósio I began the construction of the imposing facade,{{clarify|date=April 2018|which facade?}} faced with marble in the Italianate-style, and in 1558 began the installation of the ''Sala de Música'' (''Hall of Music'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; As Rafael Moreira (1997) indicated, the first building was a designed and decorated in the [[Manueline]] style, and was remodelled in classical lines, along with the adjacent buildings and the expansion of the square in front of the building.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the profile of the [[Ribeira Palace]] in Lisbon.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive remodeling later occurred in 1566, during the tenure of [[João I, Duke of Braganza|João I, 6th Duke of Braganza]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

It was the 7th Duke, [[Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza|Teodósio II]], who in 1583 began the grand works of the classical facade, completed in 1635 during the regency of King [[John IV of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; formerly Duke of Braganza. In 1602, Teodósio II married the Spanish noblewoman [[Ana de Velasco y Girón]], hoping to produce heirs. In commemoration of the marriage a composition of [[azulejo]] tiles by Fernando Loyaza, known as the ''Talavera de la Reina'', was installed in the ''Sala Grande'' (''Great Hall'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"&gt;José Teixeira (1997), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The ''Talavera de la Reina'' azulejos in the Great Hall are the only ones of the type to survive in their original setting, after the destruction of [[Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], in 1937 during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole project of the classical facade was firstly executed by Nicolau de Frias, royal architect, but was later supplemented by Pedro Vaz Pereira and Manuel Pereira Alvenéo.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"/&gt;  The monumental facade was completed in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style, consisting of two floors, one with Tuscan capitals, the other with Ionic capitals. Later, in 1610, construction began of an additional third floor.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;
In about 1611 the fireplace in the ''Sala de Medusa'' (''Medusa's Hall'') was designed and constructed by Pêro Vaz Pereira.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Following the 1640  ascension of [[John V of Portugal|João II, 8th Duke of Braganza]] to the throne of Portugal as King John IV, the palace lost its importance as the permanent residence of the Dukes of Braganza.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first new remodelling to the Palace occurred in the 18th century, with the installation of an organ in the chapel. In 1716 King John V began minor renovations. Later, in 1762 under Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; the construction began of the main tower fronting the Duchess's Garden (or ''Forest Garden'') and of a new wing, formally designated as the ''Quartos Novos'' (''New Quarters''). This included the ''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall''), which along with the other works, was finally completed under her successor, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] in 1770.

During the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the Portuguese royal family fled to [[Brazil]], and the palace was closed.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Long after the return of the royal family to Portugal, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his wife [[Amélie of Orleans]] began the renovations of the ''New Quarters'', to the designs of the Frenchman Negrier, in order to serve as their residence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; After a period of living in these quarters as his semi-official residence, on 1 February 1908 King Carlos I returned with his family to Lisbon, where he was later [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

On [[5 October 1910 Revolution|5 October 1910]] a revolution, instigated by Republican sympathizers, caused the royal family to flee to England and the residences of the monarchy were closed to the public.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

In 1932, whilst in exile, King [[Manuel II of Portugal]] died from an abnormal swelling in the throat. His will ordered the creation of a foundation to safeguard the royal estate, which led to the creation of the ''Fundação da Casa de Bragança'' (''House of Braganza Foundation'').&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; As part of this process, a systematic inventory and assessment was undertaken of the contents of the Palace by the DGEMN (''Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais'', "General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments") completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1945 and 1952 the DGMEN initiated public works to restore the Palace after years of neglect, supplemented by repairs to the roof in 1963.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

It was not until 18 May 1984 that the palace was opened to the public, including  one of the largest and most varied permanent expositions of carriages in Europe.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A re-tiling of the central wing was completed in 1985–1986, followed in 1989 by a similar project in the ''Ala dos Moços'' ("Children's Wing") in 1989.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

[[File:Vila Viçosa September 2013-25a.jpg|thumb|800px|centre|The completed horizontal profile of the Ducal Palace of the Braganzas. On the right, the tower of the Royal Chapel]]

==Architecture==
Located in the urban context of Vila Viçosa, the palace is situated on a stable plain at the foot of the castle hill. Rising {{convert|395|m|ft}} above this context, on a grand space, it fronts other historical buildings, including the Church of the Augustine Friars ({{lang-pt|Igreja dos Agostinhos}}), the Episcopal Palace ({{lang-pt|Paço do Bispo|links=no}}) and Convent of the Stigmata ({{lang-pt|Convento das Chagas|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The building consists of a grand rectangular profile, extending east to west, with three floors, and an irregular trapezoid structure to the north-south, with the roofing differently tiled above each of the spaces.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The principal facade is fully lined with [[ashlar]] masonry and pink Estremoz marble, corresponding to the three respective floors and central pediment broken by two main doorways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The rest of the facades are broken by a series of rectangular windows, that harmoniously divide the surface in a rhythmic classic pattern, some with semi-circular pediments and framed cornices. [[Pilaster]]s and [[architrave]]s define the horizontal and vertical frames of many of the windows, giving the whole composition great sobriety and classicism.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Lady's Garden'' occupies a comparable space by the residence, consisting of symmetrical patterns interspersed with sculptures of ancient shells and royal cavalry.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Interior===
Access to the residence is made across the [[Lobby (room)|vestibule]]. From this space is the main marble staircase and marble walls, as well as a painted mural fresco representing the ''Tomada de Azamor'' (''Taking of Azamor'') in northern Africa in 1513 by Portuguese troops, commanded by James, Duke of Braganza. On the left-side is the disembarkation ({{lang-pt|Desembarque}}), to the centre the preparations of the encirclement ({{lang-pt|Preparativos do Cerco|links=no}}) and to the right the conquest of the fortress ({{lang-pt|Conquista da Praça|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In the first years of the 17th century, the palace received a decorative palette, considered "one of the richest group of fresco mural paintings encountered in Portuguese art".&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms in the Palace extend along the horizontal plane, with a single corridor linking the spaces, including the ''Sala das Tapeçarias'' (''Tapestry Hall''), with [[sillar]] covered in 17th-century polychromtic blue-and-white azulejo tile, white marble fireplace, tile floor, and vaulted ceiling with phytomorphic painting.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Several of the main rooms include spaces with painted fresco ceilings, and 17th-century blue-and-white/yellow azulejo tile, such as the ''Sala do Gigante'' (''Hall of the Giant''), with 16th-century fresco depicting the biblical episode between [[David and Goliath]], which is framed by the arms of the Dukes of Braganza; the ''Oratório da Duquesa'' (''Duchess' Oratory''); and''Sala de Medusa'' (''Hall of Medusa''), with a painted fresco representing the battle between [[Medusa]] and [[Perseus]]. These group of paintings were''"largely faithful to the aesthetic canons of the Italianate Mannerists"''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The compositions are replent in Moorish-influenced motifs executed between 1600 and 1640 by different painters: Tomás Luís, famous Lisbon painter, was attributed to the ''"two notable mural [ceiling] decorations"'' in the ''Hall of Medusa'' and the gallery of Duchess Catherine and José de Avelar Rebelo painted the ceilings of the ''Music Pavilion''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
The remainder of these rooms extend laterally through the accessway: the ''Sala de D. Duarte'' (''Edwards' Hall''), with a painted ceiling, with anthropomorphic elements and tiled floor; the ''Sala dos Duques'' (''Hall of the Dukes'') or ''Sala dos Tudescos'' is a noble salon and largest room in the building, decorated with frames of 17 Dukes of Braganza, from [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]: the ''Sala das Virtues'' (''Hall of Virtues'') has an artesnal ceiling comprising framed paintings showing the seven theological virtues and morals, among them: ''Fé'' (''Faith''), ''Esperança'' (''Hope''), ''Caridade'' (''Charity''),''Prudência'' (''Prudence''), ''Justiça'' (''Justice''), ''Forteleza'' (''Strength''), ''Temperança'' (''Temperance'') and ''Sapiência'' (''Wisdom''); and the''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall'') there is a similarly paneled ceiling with medallions, decorated in classical and mythological motifs. The rooms five doorways give access to the ''Jardim das Damas'' (''Lady's Garden'').

A chapel, referred to as the ''Sala dos Paramento/Órgãos'' (''Hall of the Vestments/Organ'') is covered in a vaulted ceiling with comparably painted roof frames.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Pavilhão da Música'' (''Music Pavilion'') is an exceptional example: it consists of a painted wood ceiling, sillar with 17th-century azulejo tile depicting figures in panchromatic tiles in yellow, blue, green and red, representing the history of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] ({{lang-pt|Tobiãs}}) with the coat-of-arms of the Dukes of Braganza, and signed FIAB.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In addition, there are several other "named" rooms in palace, including the ''Sala D. Duarte'' (''[[Edward of Portugal|D. Durate's Hall]]''), ''Sala D. Fernando II'' (''[[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand's Hall]]''), ''Sala do Século 17'' (''17th-century Hall''), ''Sala da Restauração'' (''Restoration Hall''), ''Sala de Hércules'' (''Hall of Hercules''), ''Sala Dourada ou da Duquesa'' (''Golden Hall'' or ''Duchess Hall''), named for [[Catherine of Portugal|Catherine]] wife of the 6th Duke, the ''Sala da Cabra Cega'' (''Hall of the Blind Goat''); ''Sala Indo-Portuguesa'' (''Portuguese-India Hall''); ''Sala das Loiças'' (''Hall of Dishware''); ''Sala dos Vidros'' (''Hall of Glass''); ''Sala dos Reis'' (''Kings' Hall''); the armory; and the famous wing of the ''New Quarters'', named for the fact that it acted as the residence and studies for the King, with diverse antechambers, and corridors.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Near the kitchen are the ovens, wine cellars, avery and storage spaces.

====Azulejos====
There are two panels (1558) made by Flemish [[Joan Boagerts]] in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.ve/books?id=i3Od9bcGus0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA468&amp;lpg=RA1-PA468&amp;dq=Jan+Bogaerts+Pa%C3%A7o+Ducal++Vila+Vi%C3%A7osa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wlsdRrGhYV&amp;sig=5WHjYGBE61nk9z9iF3n9Cyfp0GM&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo64uL2KbaAhWOu1MKHURfCWsQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Bogaerts%20Pa%C3%A7o%20Ducal%20%20Vila%20Vi%C3%A7osa&amp;f=false|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts: Aalto to Kyoto pottery|author=Gordon Campbell|volume=I|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the historical [[azulejo]]s (17th-century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.cm-vilavicosa.pt/pt/site-visitar/oquevisitar/Paginas/Palacio.aspx|title=Palácio|author=City Council of VILA VIÇOSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that has the Ducal Palace are located in the Sala do Gigante and were made by Spanish [[Talavera de la Reina pottery]], are of the very few of the kind still implanted in the place where they were designed, after the destruction of the historic center of [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2750|title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa|author=Information System for Architectural Heritage - Government of Portugal|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The catalyst for Europeana was a letter sent by [[Jacques Chirac]], President of France, together with the premiers of [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]] to the President of the European Commission, [[Jose Manuel Durao Barroso|José Manuel Durão Barroso]], in April 2005. The letter recommended the creation of a virtual European library, to make Europe's cultural heritage accessible for all.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/timeline-digitisation-and-online-accessibility-cultural-heritage Timeline of digitisation and online accessibility of cultural heritage]" (23 July 2014). European Commission, ''Digital Agenda for Europe''. The letter, written in French, was dated 28 April 2005 (see under that date in timeline): [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=5978 ec.europa.eu]. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter added resonance to the work that the [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (European Commission)|Information Society and Media Directorate]] had been engaged in for over a decade, with programmes such as Telematics for Libraries. It gave strong political endorsement to the Directorate's strategy, i2010: communication on digital libraries, which was published on 30 September 2005. The strategy announced the intention to promote and support the creation of a European [[digital library]], as a goal within the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (30 September 2005). Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. ''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52005DC0465&amp;from=EN i2010: Digital Libraries]''  p. 3. Retrieved 2015-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to foster growth in the information society and media industries.

The project that began the building of Europeana was called the European Digital Library Network (EDLnet) and was aimed at building a prototype of a cross-border, cross-domain, user-centred service. It was funded by the European Commission under its eContentplus programme, one of the research and development funding streams of i2010.

The prototype was launched on 20 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |title=Background |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate= 10 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122000251/http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_background.html |archivedate=January 22, 2011 |quote=2008 Europeana's prototype is launched on November 20th by Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, and the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its beta launch, the site gave access to 4.5 million digital objects – more than double the initial target – from over 1,000 contributing organisations, including world-famous national library, gallery and museum collections from the capitals of Europe. Due to an unexpected user surge (peaking at an estimated 10 million hits an hour), the servers were unable to cope with the massive load. The site was temporarily taken down, and after series of technical upgrades went up again in December 2008.
In February 2009, the successor of EDLnet – Europeana version 1.0 – began. This 30-month project was to develop the prototype into a fully operational service. In 2010, the project accomplished its objective of giving access to over 10 million digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |title=Europeana Version 1 project |publisher=Europeana Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710051622/http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0 |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2011, new features on the site included a translation tool and the ability to expand on information by automatically transferring the search term to Wikipedia and other services.

== Function ==
Europeana gives access to different types of content from different types of heritage institutions. The digital objects that users can find in Europeana are not stored on a central computer, but remain with the cultural institution and are hosted on their networks. Europeana collects contextual information – or [[metadata]] – about the items, including a small picture. Users search this contextual information. Once they find what they are looking for, if they want to access the full content of the item, they can click through to the original site that holds the content.

Different types of cultural heritage organisations – libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections – catalogue their content in different ways and to different standards. Approaches also vary in different countries. To make the information searchable, it has to be mapped to a single common standard, known as the Europeana Semantic Elements. This metadata standard at present takes a lowest common denominator approach to the integration of different types of digital content. In 2010 the ''Europeana Data Model'', a richer metadata standard, was introduced to help give users more and better information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Data Model Documentation|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation|website=pro.europeana|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeana accepts metadata about digital objects, it does not make any decisions about digitisation. The decision about which objects are digitised lies with the organisation that holds the material.

== Strategy ==
In its Strategic Plan for 2011–2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |title=Strategic Plan 2011–2015 |publisher=Europeana.eu |accessdate=10 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121132654/http://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602 |archivedate=21 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in January 2011, Europeana outlines four strategic tracks that will shape its further development:
# Aggregate – to build the open trusted source for European cultural and scientific heritage content;
# Facilitate – to support the cultural and scientific heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy;
# Distribute – to make heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it;
# Engage – to cultivate new ways for users to participate in their cultural and scientific heritage.

The current strategy is for the period 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana Strategy 2015-2020|url=http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/|website=strategy2020.europeana.eu|publisher=Europeana|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Europeana Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pro.europeana.eu/foundation |title=The Europeana Foundation |publisher= Pro.europeana.eu |accessdate= 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the governing body of the Europeana service. Its members are the presidents and chairs of European associations for cultural heritage and information associations.

The Foundation promotes collaboration between museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries so that users can have integrated access to their content through Europeana and other services.

The Foundation is incorporated under Dutch law as '''Stichting Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;Stichting Europeana, [[Kamer van Koophandel|Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce, Netherlands)]] (KvK) number 27307531, located at Prins Willem-Alexanderhof 5, 's-Gravenhage (The Hague).&lt;/ref&gt; and is housed within the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]], the national library of the Netherlands. It provides a legal framework for the governance of Europeana, employing the staff, bidding for funding and enabling the sustainability of the service.

The executive director of the Europeana Foundation is Harry Verwayen.

== Europeana projects ==
There are a number of projects – the Europeana Group – that are contributing technology solutions and content to Europeana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://group.europeana.eu |title=Europeana Group |accessdate= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects are run by different cultural heritage institutions, and are part-funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[EContentplus|eContentplus programme]] and the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">'''Film analysis''' is the process in which a [[film]] is analyzed in terms of [[mise-en-scène]], [[cinematography]], [[sound]], and [[editing]].  One way of analyzing films is by the shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes. Film analysis is closely connected to [[film theory]].

Different authors suggest various approaches to film analysis. [[Jacques Aumont]] and [[Michel Marie]] in their publication Analysis of Film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L’Analyse des films/Analysis of Film|year=1988|publisher=Nathan|author=Aumont Jacques|author2=Michele Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose several key points regarding film analysis. (1) There is general method of film analysis, (2) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and (3) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis. They recognize various types of approaches: (1) Text-based film analysis (structural approach), (2) topic based analysis (narrative approach), (3) picture and sound approach (iconic analysis), (4) psychoanalytical approach and (5) historical approach.

Another methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in their publication Introduction to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest viewer can observe following elements: (1) analysis of film space, (2) analysis of film time and (3) film sound. As they focus mainly on iconic aspects of film they further propose additional elements: the image, tone, composition and movement.

==Iconic analysis==
Iconic analysis basically deals with [[image]] or [[picture]] (and sometimes also film sound). In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film. There are several examples in [[film history]] where image was even more than just key element of film (i.e. pre WWII avant-garde films, [[Italian neorealism]], [[film noir]], etc.). However today in most narrative films ([[Fictional film]]) we try to hide [[pictorial elements]] from [[audience]] and mask them behind the [[Narrative|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such films it is usually difficult (if not event pointless) to analyze image as such. We therefore more often tend to observe various other elements like light, camera movement (see [[Cinematography]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] etc. and try to understand how these elements influence or cross-reference other elements of film, like story, mood etc. As iconic analysis derives from single image and it is closely related to techniques of film production thus demanding at least brief understanding of these technical elements of film it is mostly useful method of research for film schools and other educational institutions. Film critics tend not use this method as a “stand alone” approach, but they rather use it as a part of other analysis method.

==Semiotic analysis==
Semiotics (also called semiotic studies and in the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called semiology) is the study of meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes ([[semiosis]]), indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of [[linguistics]], which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of [[language]] more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign systems]]. Semiotics often is divided into three branches:
[[Semantics]] is the relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. [[Syntax|Syntactics]] is relations among signs in formal structures. [[Pragmatics]] is the relation between signs and sign-using agents.

==Psychoanalytical approach==
Ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"&lt;ref&gt;Love, Page 53, By Wikipedians&lt;/ref&gt; as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shot by shot analysis==
This is a written description of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots.  According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, we also need to elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), [[cinematography]] ([[close-up]], [[medium shot]] and [[long shot]], pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing ([[montage (filmmaking)|montage]], [[eyeline match]], etc.), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael, and Melissa Lenos.

==Recent developments from internet-based film analysts==
A number of varied film analysis approaches have emerged and gained popularity on the internet such as those by [[Red Letter Media]] and Rob Ager.&lt;ref&gt;Quercia, Jacopo Della. "Six pop culture mysteries that were solved by fans" http://www.cracked.com/article_19684_6-pop-culture-mysteries-that-were-solved-by-fans.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wook, Kim. Time Entertainment. "29 movie head-scratchers explained" http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/13/hollywood-mystery-solved-29-movie-head-scratchers-explained/slide/the-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[Room 237]], a documentary showcasing a variety of such interpretations of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s horror film [[The Shining (film)|The Shining]], was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and generated wide media coverage followed by a distribution deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Leffler | first=Rebecca | title=Cannes 2012: Michel Gondry’s 'The We &amp; The I' to Open Director's Fortnight | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michel-gondry-cannes-film-festival-directors-fortnight-314985 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate=2012-04-25 | date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Selection |url=http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |work=[[Directors' Fortnight]] |publisher=quinzaine-realisateurs.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426224019/http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has since generated considerable comment and debate from film critics and film communities.&lt;ref&gt;Vanairsdale, S.T.

The editors of Flash Me Magazine believe flash fiction [[author]]s aren't recognized often enough, and choose to showcase one author each quarter as its Feature Story. They also annually nominate authors for the Pushcart Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pushcartprize.com/|title=Welcome to The Pushcart Prize: Nomination process|work=pushcartprize.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The '''Gypsy Robe''' is a tradition in which a chorus member with the most Broadway credits receives a robe on the opening night of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]]. The title of the robe was changed to the '''Legacy Robe''' in July 2018.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/07/13/actors-equitys-new-name-for-the-gypsy-robe-the-legacy-robe/ "Actors’ Equity’s New Name for the Gypsy Robe: The ‘Legacy Robe’"] ''American Theatre'', July 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ritual ==
Before curtain on the opening night of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]], actors, stage managers, crew, and everyone associated with the play gather onstage for the Gypsy Robe ceremony. At the center of the stage will be a representative of [[Actors' Equity Association]] and a recently honored gypsy. The honored gypsy wears the robe that's decorated with mementos and drawings from past shows. The Equity representative tells the history of the ritual and announces the newest recipient from the company. The new recipient puts on the robe, and circles the stage counter-clockwise three times as everyone touches the robe for good luck. The Gypsy Robe recipient then makes their way throughout the theatre to continue bringing good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org/aboutequity/gypsyrobe/gypsyrobehome.asp "Gypsy Robe"] actorsequity.org&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Pincus-Roth, Zachary. [http://www.playbill.com/features/article/113564-ASK-PLAYBILLCOM-The-Gypsy-Robe "Ask Playbill. The Gypsy Robe"] Playbill, December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules of the Ritual==
According to [[Actors' Equity Association]], the following are the rules of the Gypsy Robe:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org/aboutequity/gypsyrobe/gypsyrules.asp "Gypsy Rules"] actorsequity.org&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Gypsy Robe goes only to Broadway musicals with a chorus.
# Robe goes to a chorus member only, with the most number of Broadway chorus credits.
# It must be delivered by 1/2 hour on opening night to the member selected.
# New recipient must put on Robe and circle the stage 3 times, while cast members reach out and touch Robe for good luck; new recipient visits each dressing room while wearing the Robe.
# New recipient supervises the addition of an application from that show to the Robe. Important rules for adding mementos: For wearability, durability, and longevity, add-ons must be lightweight, sturdy, and reasonably sized so each Robe can represent a full season.
# Opening night date and the recipient's name are written on or near the memento and cast members are to sign only that section of Robe.
# Recipient will attend the next Broadway musical opening and will present the Robe to the next "Gypsy" in that show.

== History ==
The ritual dates to 1950, when Florence Baum, a chorus member in [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'']], entered the men's dressing room wearing a robe, pale pink with white feathers.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/theater/bill-bradley-73-created-the-gypsy-robe.html "Gypsy Robe"] ''The New York Times'', February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/CBS-SUNDAY-MORNING-to-Feature-Segment-on-Broadway-Gypsy-Robe-610-20120609 "CBS Sunday Morning features segment on Broadway Gypsy Robe"] Broadway World.com&lt;/ref&gt; The men took turns trying it on. Fellow chorus member, Bill Bradley, sent a dressing gown from one of his fellow performers to his friend performing in ''[[Call Me Madam]]''.  A feathered rose from [[Ethel Merman|Ethel Merman's]] costume was attached to the robe, and it was then given to a chorus member in ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The robe continued to be passed from one show to another, each time with a memento added on.

The ritual has become more formal, with rules about how it is presented, worn, and displayed.  When robes are full of artifacts, a new robe is started.  Retired robes are kept at the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]], at the [[Smithsonian]], and at [[Actors' Equity]].

In 2005, Brynn Williams from the Broadway cast of ''In My Life'' became the youngest recipient of the Gypsy Robe at age 12.

On April 18, 2018, Actors Equity announced that the name of robe would be changed at the end of the current theater season. A poll was opened to union members to vote on a new name.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Ryan.

The '''Horrea Galbae''' were warehouses (''[[Horreum|horrea]]'') in the southern part of ancient [[Rome]], located between the southern end of the [[Aventine Hill]] and the waste dump of [[Monte Testaccio]]. They ran for a substantial distance, possibly extending as far as the [[Porta Ostensis]] in the east and the [[Porticus Aemilia]] on the banks of the [[Tiber]]. The horrea were probably built on the site of a suburban [[Roman villa|villa]] owned by the [[Galba_(cognomen)|Sulpicii Galbae]], a distinguished noble family of whom the 1st century AD [[Roman Emperor]] [[Galba]] was a member. (There are many alternative spellings of the name: ''Galbana'', ''Galbiana'', ''Galbes'' and so on.)&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', p. 193. JHU Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8018-4300-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb of [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 108 BC)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]] (probably the consul of 108 BC, rather than his [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|better-known father]] of the same name) stood in front of the warehouse complex. It is not clear when the horrea were founded, but presumably it was some time after the tomb was built. The complex was probably originally known as the Horrea Sulpicia, after the [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] of the [[Sulpicia (gens)|gens Sulpicia]], but acquired its later name during the time of the emperor Galba.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt; 

Archaeological excavations and the remains of the [[Forma Urbis Romae]] show that the Horrea Galbae comprised three long rectangular courtyards set out in parallel, each surrounded by colonnades or arcades of [[taberna]]e, with a single entrance positioned on the axis at a short end. They were used to store the ''annona publica'' (the public grain supply) as well as olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing and even marble.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt; The size of the Horrea Galbae was enormous, even by modern standards; the horrea contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m²).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;David Stone Potter, D. J. Mattingly, ''Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire'', p. 180. University of Michigan Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-472-08568-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is thought that Monte Testaccio, the giant mound of broken [[amphora]]e that lay behind the Horrea Galbae, was associated with the complex. Olive oil imported from far-away [[Baetica]] (in modern [[Spain]]) was emptied into bulk containers, probably in the horrea, and the original import vessels were smashed and dumped on Monte Testaccio. The scale of the imports can be judged by the fact that Monte Testaccio is estimated to contain the remains of at least 53 million [[olive oil]] amphorae, in which some 6 billion litres (1.58 billion gallons) of oil were imported.&lt;ref name="Ward-Perkins"&gt;Bryan Ward-Perkins, ''The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization'', pp. 91-92. Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280728-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little now remains of the Horrea Galbae. Walls and brickwork, dating probably from the 1st century AD, have been discovered  by archaeologists along with large lead pipes bearing inscriptions from [[Hadrian]]'s reign in the following century.&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

'''Ingeborg Møller''' (29 December 1878 &amp;ndash; 18 February 1964) was a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] teacher, playwright, novelist and biographer.
&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Ingeborg_M%C3%B8ller |title=Ingeborg Møller|publisher = lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ingeborg Møller  was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. Her parents were Thorvald Fredrik Møller (1821-1879) and Nathalie Munch (1836-1904). Her  father died  one year after she was born. When Ingeborg was about five years old, her mother had a serious mental disorder and others took care of her. Part of her childhood was spent in [[Fredrikstad]]. During the 1890s, she spent  two years at Olaf Berg's school of education (''Olaf Bergs lærerinneskole''). From 1915 she was involved in  public-high school teaching at [[Dovre]] and [[Sel]], where her teaching associates included  [[Olav Aukrust]] (1883–1929). In 1921 she was associated with a children's shelter at [[Lillehammer]]. &lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; 

She made her literary début with the play ''Fru Karen'', staged at [[Centralteatret]] in 1904. She wrote several novels during the 1920s. In 1948 she published a biography of scientist and philosopher [[Henrik Steffens]]. She was awarded the [[Gyldendal's Endowment]] (''Gyldendalprisen'') in 1948.

Jacaranda produces an annual classical music concert series, mostly of modern music and works written since 2000 as well as rare older classical music with potential interest for contemporary listeners. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/program-history/ |title=Program History|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacaranda has been based in [[Santa Monica]], California since 2003. In 2016, the series was named by ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' as the Best Contemporary Classical Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Payne |first1=John |title=Best Contemporary Classical Series |url=https://www.laweekly.com/best-of/2016/music-and-nightlife/best-rapper-7407206 |website=Best of L.A. |publisher=L.A.

Throughout its 16 seasons, Jacaranda has presented the compositions of [[Philip Glass]], [[John Cage]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Dylan Mattingly]], [[Mark Grey]], [[Florence Price]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Julius Eastman]], [[Frederic Rzewski]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Horatiu Radulescu]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[George Enescu]], among many others. Musicians have included [[Grammy]] and [[Emmy]] winner [[Gloria Cheng]], [[Anonymous 4]], Quatuor Diotima, Scott Dunn, [[Kathleen Supové]], [[Christopher Taylor (pianist)|Christopher Taylor]], and [[Billy Childs]].
Jacaranda's concerts have been reviewed by several publications, including the [[LA Times]], [[Classical Voice North America]], and [[BBC Music Magazine]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/news/ |title=News|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, The ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' said of Jacaranda: "To actually curate a concert is an art. It is one of the qualities that sets apart the Los Angeles music series Jacaranda. For more than 10 years… Jacaranda's concerts have been conceived as musical journeys of discovery…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=A Flock of Oiseaux exotiques Reveals Jacaranda's Charms |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/jacaranda/a-flock-of-oiseaux-exotiques-reveals-jacarandas-charms |website=San Francisco Classical Voice |publisher=San Francisco Classical Voice |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[LA Times]]'' has said of Jacaranda that it "is known for imaginative programs of challenging contemporary music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schultz |first1=Rick |title=15 ways to hear chamber music magic in L.A. this spring |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-spring-preview-chamber-20180325-htmlstory.html |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Los Angeles Times'' music critic Mark Swed said of Jacaranda in 2013, "With demanding pieces by [[Péter Eötvös|Eötvös]] and the famed late Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]], "Fierce Beauty" was the most ambitious undertaking so far and by far for Jacaranda.…With this concert, Jacaranda grew up, moving beyond local to national significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swed |first1=Mark |title=Review: Jacaranda gives an important concert featuring Peter Eotvos |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/entertainment/la-et-cm-jacaranda-etvs-review-20130114 |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former dean of American music critics [[Alan Rich]] regularly wrote about Jacaranda, saying that they produce, "a kind of personalized programming so that you leave each event with the sense of having visited some very smart programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rich |first1=Alan |title=DUTCH TREAT: SPHERES AND COOKIES |url=http://www.soiveheard.com/ |website=So I've Heard |publisher=Alan Rich |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lake with Dead Trees''''', also known as '''''Catskill''''', is an oil on canvas painting completed in 1825 by [[Thomas Cole]]. Depicting a scene in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in southeastern New York State, this work is one of five of Cole's 1825 landscapes to found the mid-19th century American art movement known as the [[Hudson River School]].

==Artist's Background==
Tom Christopher wrote that “[Thomas] Cole’s greatest artistic asset proved to be his untutored eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole emigrated to [[America]] with his family in the spring of 1819 at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, ''The Life and Works of Thomas Cole'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, his surroundings were of [[Lancashire]], [[England]], an area known to be an epicenter of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]’s primarily industrial region.  Because of this, Cole was granted an additional clarity of and sensitivity to the vibrancy of American landscapes awash with color, a stark contrast to the bleak and subdued landscapes of the country he left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Great Northern Catskills of Greene County. “Hudson River School of Art,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==''Lake with Dead Trees'' and The Hudson River School==
When Cole emerged from the Catskill mountains in 1825, not only would he bring with him some of the first renderings of the Catskills in his first five landscape paintings, but in those paintings, he brought a new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Accessed October 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This style would come to be known as the [[Hudson River School]], a style that would sweep across the United States in celebration of one of America’s most prized attributes, our natural resources and wildernesses.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum, [[H. Barbara Weinberg]] described the style as, “[[Plantation era|Antebellum]] encounters with barely tamed nature, lovingly recorded in meticulous botanical detail and overwhelming in scale in comparison with those who enjoy its pleasures…”.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, “Late-Nineteenth-Century American Painting” 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial value==
Among those five paintings, the first of their kind, stands ''Lake with Dead Trees''. The oil on canvas painting was sold originally for twenty-five dollars in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allowing for 191 years of inflation, the sum’s equivalent would now be $537.86.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. “The Inflation Calculator”.&lt;/ref&gt;  While that was considered a respectable price and sale at the time, another work by [[Thomas Cole]], ''[[Part of the Ruins of Kenilworth Castle]]'', was recently put up to be auctioned with an appraisal of the painting estimated to be $200,000 to $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Invaluable. “Thomas Cole Auction Price Results”. &lt;/ref&gt;  A style that began nearly two hundred years ago is still viable and commercially successful. Currently, the original resides at the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] of [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], as it has since its donation in 1904 by [[Charles F. Olney]].&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual Analysis and Composition==
Simply named, ''Lake with Dead Trees'' exemplifies the typical stylistic traits of the [[Hudson River School]] art movement. The viewer’s eye is drawn first to the stand of snags foremost, which is highlighted starkly by warm morning light. They are skeletal, stripped of leaves, of bark, of any branch that would not bend. They embody death and they are surrounded by life. 

The trees are twisted splintering apart at the core as if by some great ravaging storm. The exposed raw wood shines sun-bleached in shades of pale yellow, white, and gray, the only darker pigments used to define shadows cast by light from the upper right side of the painting. Following vibrant trees along the lakeside, and along the bottom of the painting, there is further evidence of a great storm; downed and fallen trees lie by ample water, sunlight, and nutrient rich soil, conditions in which the surrounding trees thrive. 

The 27 x 33 3/4 in. dimensions of ''Lake with Dead Trees'' make it reminiscent of a picture window offering a portal to the Catskill mountains in southeastern [[New York State]]. The painting does not present a specific moment in time, rather it exists. It seems to indicate that within the delicate balance of beauty and life, there is also a strength that will slowly rise and reclaim where ruin has set foot. 

As the viewer’s gaze sweeps from the bottom left of the painting, a scene of destruction evokes emotions of loss and regret. Moving up to the right side of the painting and across the sky, sentiments shift with the change in light. From left to right, the sky clears from a ruminating storm to the respite of a clearing sky. On the left of the painting, the dead trees are prominent, as evident by their size and proximity. As the scene moves right, the dead trees become smaller; they decrease in importance, fade, and give way to living trees and new life. 

Each of these transitions, from left to right, are smooth, natural motions across realistic spectrums of extremes, until the viewer’s eye is caught and disrupted by the two deer crossing the painting. Captured in the pristine and graceful scene, the deer appeared overly poised, lacking the fluidity found elsewhere. In 1825, an unnamed contemporary viewer noted Cole might easily have omitted the two deer, as they “detracted from [the] foreground.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influence==
The introduction of Thomas Cole’s works at the emergence of the Hudson River School style, gave voice to conservation, an idea that was just beginning to develop. It was at nearly the same time that ''Lake with Dead Trees'' was sold, as were the other four paintings, and Thomas Cole’s name was starting to become familiar as a noteworthy artist, that the [[Erie Canal]] officially opened across upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of this major transportation system, second worldwide only to the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in [[China]], swept the nation up in a surge of patriotism and celebration of the innovations of this great country. In this outpouring of nationalism, Thomas Cole was wholeheartedly embraced and became championed as the "American Adam of landscape painting.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole is considered to be one of the pioneers of American environmentalism, for his concern for the impending destruction by “Copper-hearted barbarians … pushing a railroad up through his valley to exploit its natural resources – through mining, quarrying, and logging” and in his effort to inform the public, Thomas Cole’s labors are among those that motivated the creation of the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catskill Park]] was established in 1904 to protect thousands of acres, incredible vistas, and mountain ranges including thirty-three [[Catskill’s high peaks]], a natural inheritance that will remain forever wild, an event that without Thomas Cole, and ''Lake with Dead Trees'', likely would not have transpired.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{American and British English differences}}

This page lists '''works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States'''. Categories of such works include [[edition (book)#Co-edition|co-editions of books]] and foreign releases of films. Unless otherwise noted, [[United Kingdom|UK]] titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that [[Canada]] generally uses [[United States|US]] titles. [[Australia]] will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to [[American and British English spelling differences]]; for example, the American film ''[[Rumor Has It...]]'' is titled ''Rumour Has It...'' in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.

Legend:
*An [[asterisk]] (*) indicates which of the two countries the work originated in. If a work originated in a third country, this is covered in the Notes column. 
*[c] indicates cases where Canada follows UK usage.

| The UK title is also used in Australia and Japan. The two editions are not exactly the same, as when the book was first published, the working title was ''Anne of Windy Willows'', but Montgomery's publisher wanted to change it because of its purported similarity to [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The same publisher also requested some scenes to be cut out for perceived gory or terrifying content, to which Montgomery complied. Montgomery's UK publisher, however, did not see the need for any of these changes, and published the unedited book under the title ''Anne of Windy Willows''.

It is roughly bound by [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|North 36 St (US 27)]] to the south, North 43rd Street to the north, West First Avenue to the west and [[Biscayne Boulevard]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/pdf/MDDLocatorMap.pdf|title=District Design Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design District was made up primarily of old [[low-rise]] [[warehouse]]s that have been converted into retail spaces, art galleries, restaurants and cafés, but now includes a large amount of new construction, primarily for high-end retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/biz-monday/article1955427.html|title=Miami Design District’s transformation into a luxury shopping destination is underway|last=Cordle|first=Ina Paiva|date=2013-09-23|website=Miami Herald|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy [[Wynwood]] neighborhood to the south, Lemon City ([[Little Haiti]]) and the historic 1920s [[Buena Vista (Miami)|Buena Vista]] neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy [[Upper East Side (Miami)|Upper East Side]] neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling to [[urban decay]], the Design District has risen to fame as a destination for the arts, [[design]], and [[fashion]].

It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, [[architecture firm]]s, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/browse.php|title=Directory of Fashion, Furniture &amp; Watch Stores {{!}} Miami Design District|website=www.miamidesigndistrict.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-end brands like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Christian Dior SE|Dior]], [[Prada]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Saint Laurent]] and [[Hermès|Hermes]] are located in the Design District as well as restaurants from award-winning chefs like Michael Schwartz and celebrities like [[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]] and [[Emilio Estefan]]; a public art collection with works from Buckminster Fuller, Marc Newsom and Urs Fischer as well as museums and galleries like the Institute for Contemporary Art, Miami, The [[De la Cruz Collection|de la Cruz Collection of Contemporary Art]] and Locust Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/what-to-do-in-the-miami-design-district|title=What to Do in the Miami Design District: Our Guide|last=Wood|first=Sara Liss,Jennifer M.|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area of land that is now the Design District was once a pineapple farm in a neighborhood referred to as Buena Vista. Farm owner, T.V. Moore, built the historic Moore Building in the 1920’s for his family furniture business. The Moore Furniture Building was one of the first stores in the U.S. dedicated strictly to furniture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/2011%20designation%20reports%20updates/Buena_Vista_Post_Office_Designation_Report.pdf |title=Buena Vista Post Office Designation Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic Preservation Miami|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today the area today known as the Design District. Signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen to [[urban decay]], and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began opening up in the Design District. Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/fashion/shopping/bal-harbour-shops-vs-design-district|title=Bal Harbour Shops vs. the Design District|last=Gross|first=Michael|date=2014-09-24|website=Departures|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credited to starting the district is [[Craig Robins]], who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, [[Holly Hunt]] and Peter Page to relocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oceandrive.com/style/articles/craig-robins-jump-starts-the-design-district|title=Craig Robins Jump-Starts the Design District|last=McGee|first=Suzanne|date=2012-12-03|work=Ocean Drive|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2016, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, [[Wynwood]], and [[Midtown Miami]] areas to avoid getting the [[Zika virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniel Chang|author2=Emily Cochrane|title=With 10 new Zika cases in Miami, CDC advises pregnant women to avoid Wynwood|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article93057392.html|website=miamiherald.com|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=1 August 2016|quote=The advisory extends to all expectant mothers, and women planning on becoming pregnant who have traveled to a one-square-mile area north of downtown Miami — including Wynwood, Midtown and the Design District — on or after June 15, said CDC Director Tom Frieden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cdc_zika'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html |title=Advice for people living in or traveling to Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, FL |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Rick Scott lifted the area’s “Zika Zone” designation on September 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2017/06/28/wynwood-businesses-lost-as-much-as-40-in-revenue-due-to-zika-report/|title=Wynwood businesses lost as much as 40% of their revenue due to Zika: report|date=2017-06-28|work=The Real Deal Miami|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopping==
The District is home to many flagship luxury stores including [[Hermès]], [[Tom Ford]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Christian Louboutin]], [[Prada]], [[Celine]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/fashion/in-miami-luxury-know-no-limits.html|title=In Miami, Luxury Knows No Limits|last=Madigan|first=Nick|date=2014-12-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are over 70 stores open in the District, with another 60 set to open by mid-2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article19334178.html|title=Redesign of the Design District: New boutiques and restaurants arriving|last=Nehamas|first=Nicholas|date=2015-04-23|work=miamiherald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the first luxury retailer opened in the Design District, [[Christian Louboutin]], marking a new era for the Design District. Later that year, [[Yohji Yamamoto]] opened in the Design District. In 2011, [[Louis Vuitton]] announced plans to open a Louis Vuitton store in the neighborhood by 2014 after announcing its closure of its [[Bal Harbour Shops]] store (the first Louis Vuitton store to open outside of [[New York City]]), along with opening other brands from the [[LVMH]] company in the Design District, including stores such as [[Sephora]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Fendi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Vuitton moving to Aventura Mall, Design District |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-03-28/business/mh-louis-vuitton-20110328_1_aventura-mall-miami-design-district-miami-s-design-district |author=Walker, Elaine |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Hermes]], [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]] and [[Dior]] announced plans to move their stores from [[Bal Harbour Shops]] to the Design District in late 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="hermes"&gt;{{cite news |title = Hermes moving to Miami Design District|url = http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/10/06/2442328/hermes-moving-to-miami-design.html|author = Walker, Elaine|newspaper = The Miami Herald|date = October 7, 2011|accessdate = October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design Within Reach opened an 11,000-square foot design store in the district on Feb 1st, 2013.

'''''Myojakdo''''' (literally, "Painting of Cats and Sparrows") is a [[Korean painting]] depicting two cats and sparrows on an old tree, drawn by [[Byeon Sang-byeok]] during the late period of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). It is regarded as a representative [[animal painting]] (''yeongmohwa'') and is painted on silk with light coloring over the [[ink and wash painting]] (''sumukhwa''). The Myojakdo is 93.7&amp;nbsp;cm in height and 42.9&amp;nbsp;cm in width.  It forms part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=139066&amp;v=44 |script-title=ko:묘작도 猫雀圖 |trans-title=Myojakdo |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]]/ [[Britannica]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=253618&amp;v=44 |script-title=ko:묘작도 猫雀圖 |trans-title=Myojakdo |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]]/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to as the nicknames, "Byeon goyangi" (literally Byeon cat),&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Hong-jun, [http://sjeas.skku.edu/upload/200605/06_Yu%20Hong-jun.pdf ''An Approach through the theory on Art to theory on Painting of Scholars of the Korean Practical Science"], Sungkyun Journal of East Asian Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2004, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; and "Byeon dak" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. The ''myojakdo'' backs up the record in which Byeon favored cats and devoted to cat paintings.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

Cats and sparrows were often subjects for Korean paintings drawn to celebrate the joy of longevity because of their similar pronunciations with other words that have auspicious meanings. The pronunciation of ''myo'' ({{linktext|猫}}; cat) and ''jak'' ({{linktext|雀}}, sparrow) in [[hanja]] word, or [[Sino-Korean words]] are respectively linked with ''mo'' ({{linktext|耄}}; old person) which refers to 80 or 90 years old, and ''jak'' ({{linktext|鵲}}) which indicates [[Korean magpie|magpie]] having been regarded as an auspicious bird in [[History of Korea|Korean society]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; 

In this painting, cats and sparrows are depicted realistically in a simple and dynamic composition. The depiction of a group of chirping sparrows on twigs are illustrated precisely with very detailed brushstrokes. Byeon's mastered drawing techniques are also noted with the lively facial expressions and moves of the two cats. One cat clinging to the side of an old tree exchanges glances with the other on the ground in the diagonal composition as if they communicated with each other. On the other hand, the body of the old tree is drawn with rather wild brushstrokes, which represents the meager texture and the distorted shape having formed for a long time. The stark contrast between the way the animals and trees are applied gives a strong feeling of movement to the picture.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

A '''parallel projection''' is a projection of an object in three-dimensional space onto a fixed [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], known as the ''[[projection plane]]'' or ''image plane'', where the ''rays'', known as ''lines of sight'' or ''projection lines'', are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other. It is a basic tool in [[descriptive geometry]]. The projection is called ''[[orthographic projection|orthographic]]'' if the rays are perpendicular (orthogonal) to the image plane, and ''[[oblique projection|oblique]]'' or ''skew'' if they are not.

==Overview==
[[File:Parallel-proj-def.svg|thumb|Parallel projection terminology and notations. The two blue parallel line segments to the right remain parallel when projected onto the image plane to the left.]]
A parallel projection is a particular case of ''[[projection (mathematics)|projection]]'' in [[mathematics]] and ''[[graphical projection]]'' in [[technical drawing]].  Parallel projections can be seen as the limit of a [[central projection|central]] or [[perspective projection]], in which the rays pass through a fixed point called the ''center'' or ''viewpoint'', as this point is moved towards infinity. Put differently, a parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with an infinite [[focal length]] (the distance between the lens and the focal point in [[photography]]) or "[[Zooming (filmmaking)|zoom]]". In parallel projections, lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space remain parallel in the two-dimensional projected image.

A perspective projection of an object is often considered more realistic than a parallel projection, since it more closely resembles [[human vision]] and [[photography]]. However, parallel projections are popular in technical applications, since the parallelism of an object's lines and faces is preserved, and direct measurements can be taken from the image. Among parallel projections, orthographic projections are the most realistic, and are commonly used by engineers. On the other hand, certain types of oblique projections (for example [[Axonometry#Special axonometries|cavalier projection]], [[Axonometry#Special axonometries|military projection]]) are very simple to implement, and are used to create quick and informal pictorials of objects.

The term ''parallel projection'' is used in the literature to describe both the ''procedure itself'' (a mathematical mapping function) as well as the resulting image ''produced by the procedure''.

== Properties ==
[[File:Cube-parallel-proj-s.svg|300px|thumb|Two parallel projections of a cube. In an orthographic projection (at left), the projection lines are perpendicular to the image plane (pink). In an oblique projection (at right), the projection lines are at a skew angle to the image plane.]]
Every parallel projection has the following properties.
* It is uniquely defined by its projection plane ''Π'' and the direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; of the (parallel) projection lines. The direction must not be parallel to the projection plane.
* Any point of the space has a unique image in the projection plane ''Π'', and the points of ''Π'' are fixed.
* Any line not parallel to direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is mapped onto a line; any line parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is mapped onto a point.
* Parallel lines are mapped on parallel lines, or on a pair of points (if they are parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;). 
* The [[ratio]] of the length of two line segments on a line stays unchanged.  As a special case, [[midpoint]]s are mapped on midpoints. 
* The [[Length measurement|length]] of a line segment parallel to the projection plane remains unchanged. The length of any line segment is shortened if the projection is an orthographic one.{{clarify|This appears to contradict the first sentence!|date=April 2017}} 
* Any [[circle]] that lies in a plane parallel to the projection plane is mapped onto a circle with the same radius. Any other circle is mapped onto an [[ellipse]] or a line segment (if direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the circle's plane).
* [[Angles]] in general are not preserved. But [[right angle]]s with one line parallel to the projection plane remain unchanged. 
* Any [[rectangle]] is mapped onto a [[parallelogram]] or a line segment (if &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the rectangle's plane).
* Any figure in a plane that is parallel to the image plane is congruent to its image.

== Orthographic projection ==
{{main|Orthographic projection|Multiview projection|Axonometric projection}}
[[File:Camera focal length distance house animation.gif|thumb|right|A parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with a hypothetical viewpoint; i.e. one where the camera lies an infinite distance away from the object and has an infinite focal length, or "zoom".]]
[[File:Various projections of cube above plane.svg|thumb|Various projections and how they are produced]]
Orthographic projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]], and is a type of parallel projection where the projection rays are perpendicular to the projection plane. It is the projection type of choice for [[Plan (drawing)|working drawings]].

The term ''orthographic'' is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are parallel with the projection plane (or the paper on which the orthographic or parallel projection is drawn). However, the term [[multiview projection]] is also used. In ''multiview projections'', up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes. Sub-types of multiview orthographic projections include ''plans'', ''elevations'' and ''sections''.

When the principal planes or axes of an object are ''not'' parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to some degree to reveal multiple sides of the object, it is called an [[axonometric projection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = William |author2=Malcolm McCullough | title = Digital design media | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1994 | pages = 169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZoGgQEhKkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-471-28666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Axonometric projection'' (not to be confused with the closely related ''[[axonometry|principle of axonometry]]'', as described in [[Pohlke's theorem]]) is further subdivided into three groups: ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wqg9m-MaKI&amp;sig=xZ9MEJ8JjFcg28YefGxBW4zcZ2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Tjj2SvO_CM-n8AaI8bTzCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBQ#v=twopage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression|last=Maynard|first=Patric|last2=|first2=|date=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0-8014-7280-6|location=|pages=22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4eYq7-2YhYC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Advanced graphics programming using openGL|last=McReynolds|first=Tom|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-55860-659-9|pages=502|author2=David Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic of axonometric pictorials is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

==Oblique projection==
{{main|Oblique projection}}
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]]. The presence of one or more 90&amp;deg; angles is usually a good indication that the perspective is ''oblique''.]]
In an oblique projection, the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees.&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt; In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings.  In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections include ''military'', ''cavalier'' and ''cabinet projection''.&lt;ref name="desai"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQiIj8ZS0IoC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Computer Graphics|last=Desai|first=Apurva A.|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=81-203-3524-4|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytic representation ==
If the image plane is given by equation &lt;math&gt;\Pi:~\vec{n}\cdot\vec{x}-d=0&lt;/math&gt; and the direction of projection by &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;, then the projection line through the point &lt;math&gt;P:~\vec p&lt;/math&gt; is parametrized by
:: &lt;math&gt;g:~\vec x = \vec p+t\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
The image &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of line &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;; it is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;P':~\vec{p}' = \vec p + \frac{d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n}}{\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}}\;\vec{v} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In several cases, these formulas can be simplified.

(S1) If one can choose the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the image simplifies to
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p + (d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{v}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(S2) In an orthographic projection, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; are parallel.  In this case, one can choose &lt;math&gt;\vec v = \vec n ,\; |\vec n|=1&lt;/math&gt; and one gets 
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p + (d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{n}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(S3) If one can choose the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and if the image plane contains the origin, one has &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt; and the parallel projection is a [[linear mapping]]:
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p - (\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{v}=\vec p-(\vec v\otimes \vec n)~\vec p = (I_3-\vec v\otimes \vec n)\;\vec p \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(Here &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; the [[outer product]].)

From this analytic representation of a parallel projection one can deduce most of the properties stated in the previous sections.

A '''proverb''' (from {{lang-la|proverbium}}) is a simple, concrete, traditional [[saying]] that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often [[metaphor]]ical and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent:  one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the "major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''.  New England Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.

== Definitions ==
What is a proverb?  [[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a "proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many."&lt;ref&gt;p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; But giving the word "proverb" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific "definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics. 

More constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, "A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3-40. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Norrick created a table of [[distinctive feature]]s to distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc.&lt;ref&gt;p. 73. Neil Norrick. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, "True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: "A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change".&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari &amp; Hayat Ameri. "Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as "proverbs", such as weather sayings. [[Alan Dundes]], however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: "Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 45. Alan Dundes. 1984. On whether weather 'proverbs' are proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 1:39-46. Also, 1989, in ''Folklore Matters'' edited by Alan Dundes, 92-97. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "proverb" has also changed over the years.  For example, the following was labeled "A Yorkshire proverb" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, "as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth".&lt;ref&gt;A Yorkshire proverb. 1883. ''The Academy''. July 14, no. 584. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of the definition of "proverb" is also noted in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Ezgi Ulusoy Aranyosi. 2010. "Atasözü neydi, ne oldu?" ["What was, and what now is, a 'proverb'?"]. ''Millî Folklor: International and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Studies'' 11.88: 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other languages and cultures, the definition of "proverb" also differs from English. In the [[Chumburung language]] of Ghana, "''aŋase'' are literal proverbs and ''akpare'' are metaphoric ones".&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Gillian Hansford. 2003. Understanding Chumburung proverbs. ''Journal of West African Languages'' 30.1:57-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate "proverb": ''ere, ivbe'', and ''itan''. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was "linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse".&lt;ref&gt;p. 4,5. Daniel Ben-Amos. Introduction: Folklore in African Society. ''Forms of Folklore in Africa'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, pp. 1-36. Austin: University of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Balochi language|Balochi]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word ''batal'' for ordinary proverbs and ''bassīttuks'' for "proverbs with background stories".&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Sabir Badalkhan. 2000. "Ropes break at the weakest point": Some examples of Balochi proverbs with background stories. ''Proverbium'' 17:43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label "proverb riddles".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger, Jr. Anang Proverb-Riddles. The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 73, No. 289 (July - September 1960), pp. 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 418. Finnegan, Ruth. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. The Saylor Foundation, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umoh, S. J. 2007. The Ibibio Proverb—Riddles and Language Pedagogy. ''International Journal of Linguistics and Communication'' 11(2), 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conseil Tenu par les Rats.jpg|thumb|"Who will bell the cat?", comes from the end of a story.]]

Proverbs come from a variety of sources. Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by [[Confucius]], [[Plato]], [[Baltasar Gracián]], etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Korosh Hadissi. 2010. A Socio-Historical Approach to Poetic Origins of Persian Proverbs. ''Iranian Studies'' 43.5: 599-605.&lt;/ref&gt; stories,&lt;ref&gt;Thamen, Hla. 2000. ''Myanmar Proverbs in Myanmar and English''. Yangon: Pattamya Ngamank Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles Clay, Wolfgang Mieder, [[Fred R. Shapiro]]. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are also based on stories, often the end of a story.  For example, the proverb "[[Belling the cat|Who will bell the cat]]?" is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such a [[J.R.R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"/&gt; and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society, such as the bumper sticker pictured below. Similarly, C.S. Lewis' created proverb about a lobster in a pot, from the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', has also gained currency.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth. 2014. A created proverb in a novel becomes broadly used in society: "‛Easily in but not easily out', as the lobster said in his lobster pot." ''Crossroads: A Journal of English Studies'' [http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ online access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526192406/http://www.crossroads.uwb.edu.pl/category/issue-22014/page/2/ |date=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases like this, deliberately created proverbs for fictional societies have become proverbs in real societies. In a fictional story set in a real society, the movie ''Forrest Gump'' introduced "Life is like a box of chocolates" into broad society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 70, Winick, Stephen. 1998. ''The Proverb Process: Intertextuality and Proverbial Innovation in Popular Culture.'' University of Pennsylvania: PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case, at appears that a proverb deliberately created by one writer has been naively picked up and used by another who assumed it to be an established Chinese proverb, [[Ford Madox Ford]] having picked up a proverb from [[Ernest Bramah]], "It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House."&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorn, Jeremy, ‘Ernest Bramah: Source of Ford Madox Ford’s Chinese Proverb?’ Notes and Queries, 63.2 (2016), 286-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb with "a longer history than any other recorded proverb in the world", going back to "around 1800 BC"&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Alster, Bendt. 1979. An Akkadian and a Greek proverb. A comparative study. ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; is in a Sumerian clay tablet, "The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind".&lt;ref&gt;p. 17. Moran, William L. 1978a. An Assyriological gloss on the new Archilochus fragment. ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 82. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Though many proverbs are ancient, they were all newly created at some point by somebody.  Sometimes it is easy to detect that a proverb is newly coined by a reference to something recent, such as the Haitian proverb "The fish that is being microwaved doesn't fear the lightning".&lt;ref&gt;p. 325, Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999. Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: A study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 16:325-350.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is a recent [[Maltese language|Maltese]] proverb, ''wil-muturi, ferh u duluri'' "Women and motorcycles are joys and griefs"; the proverb is clearly new, but still formed as a traditional style couplet with rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;p. 125. Aquilina, Joseph. 1972. ''A Comparative Dictionary of Maltese Proverbs.'' Malta: Royal University of Malta.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a proverb in the [[Kafa language]] of Ethiopia that refers to the forced military conscription of the 1980s, "...the one who hid himself lived to have children."&lt;ref&gt;Mesfin Wodajo. 2012. ''Functions and Formal and Stylistic Features of Kafa Proverbs''. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mongolian proverb also shows evidence of recent origin, "A beggar who sits on gold; Foam rubber piled on edge."&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, Janice Raymond. ''Mongolian Proverbs: A window into their world.'' San Diego: Alethinos Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  A political candidate in Kenya popularised a new proverb in his 1995 campaign, ''Chuth ber'' "Immediacy is best". "The proverb has since been used in other contexts to prompt quick action."&lt;ref&gt;p. 68. Okumba Miruka. 2001. ''Oral Literature of the Luo''. Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,400 new English proverbs are said to have been coined and gained currency in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, Fred R. Shapiro. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.''  Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of creating proverbs is always ongoing, so that possible new proverbs are being created constantly. Those sayings that are adopted and used by an adequate number of people become proverbs in that society.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2017. Futuristic Paremiography and Paremiology: A Plea for the Collection and Study of Modern Proverbs.

== Interpretations ==
Interpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context.&lt;ref&gt;Jesenšek, Vida. 2014. Pragmatic and stylistic aspects of proverbs. ''Introduction to Paremiology: A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 133-161. Warsaw &amp; Berlin: DeGruyter Open.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb "[[A rolling stone gathers no moss]]." Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.&lt;ref&gt;p. 224,225. Flavell, Linda and roger Flavell. 1993. ''The Dictionary of Proverbs and Their Origins''. London: Kyle Cathie.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among [[Tajik language|Tajik]] speakers, the proverb "One hand cannot clap" has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people.&lt;ref&gt;p. 158. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given.&lt;ref&gt;Sjaak van der Geest. 1996. The Elder and His Elbow: Twelve Interpretations of an Akan Proverb. ''Research in African Literatures'' Vol. 27, No. 3: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, "A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation."&lt;ref name="Michael Kiang 2007"&gt;Michael Kiang, et al, Cognitive, neurophysiological, and functional correlates of proverb interpretation abnormalities in schizophrenia. ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society'' (2007), 13, 653–663.[Futuristic paremiography and paremiology: a plea for the collection and study of modern proverbs. Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Grammatical structures===
Proverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures.&lt;ref&gt;See Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95-136.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):
* Imperative, negative - Don't beat a dead horse.
* Imperative, positive - Look before you leap.
* Parallel phrases - Garbage in, garbage out.
* Rhetorical question - Is the Pope Catholic?
* Declarative sentence - Birds of a feather flock together.

However, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. "All is fair" instead of "All is fair in love and war", and "A rolling stone" for "A rolling stone gathers no moss."

The grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:
* Shor/Khkas (SW Siberia): "They asked the camel, 'Why is your neck crooked?' The camel laughed roaringly, 'What of me is straight?'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 176. Roos, Marti, Hans Nugteren, Zinaida Waibel. 2006. Khakas and Shor proverbs and proverbial sayings. In ''Exploring the Eastern Frontiers of Turkic'', ed by Marcel Erdal and Irina Nevskaya, pp. 157-192. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: "They asked the wine, 'Have you built or destroyed more?' It said, 'I do not know of building; of destroying I know a lot.'"&lt;ref&gt;p. 135. Sakayan, Dora. 1999. Reported and direct speech in proverbs: On Armenian dialogue proverbs. Proverbium 16: 303-324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bakgatla [a.k.a. [[Tswana language|Tswana]]:  "The thukhui jackal said, 'I can run fast.' But the sands said, 'We are wide.'" ([[Botswana]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 246.

===Conservative language===
[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb overdoorway in Netherlands: "No one attacks me with impunity"]]
Because many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. In English, for example, "betwixt" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb "There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic,&lt;ref&gt;p. 691. Michael Ahland. 2009. From topic to subject: Grammatical change in the Amharic possessive construction. ''Studies in Language'' 33.3 pp. 685-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek,&lt;ref&gt;p. 72. Nikolaos Lazaridis. 2007. ''Wisdom in Loose Form: The Language of Egyptian and Greek Proverbs in Collections of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods.'' Brill&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nsenga language|Nsenga]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 64. Christopher J. Pluger. 2014. ''Translating New Testament proverb-like sayings in the style of Nsenga proverbs.'' Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, Grzegorz. 2001. Archaic lexis in Polish Proverbs. In Władysław Witalisz (ed.), ''"And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche": Studies on Language and Literature in Honour of Professor Dr. Karl Heinz Göller'', pp. 187-193. Kraków 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. "C'est la vie" from French and "[[Carpe diem]]" from Latin. 

Proverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, "many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters."&lt;ref&gt;p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.'' Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society.&lt;ref&gt;Issa O. Sanusi and R.K. Omoloso. The role of Yoruba proverbs in preserving archaic lexical items and expressions in Yoruba.

Shepard (2016) “Sufferance fait ease en temps”: word as image at St Michael-le-Belfrey, York. ''Word &amp; Image'' 32:2, 218-234. DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowing and spread===
[[File:The-Blind-Leading-the-Blind-xx-Sebastian-Vrancx.JPG|thumb|"[[The blind leading the blind]]", a saying that has spread across Europe, found in the ''Upanishads'' and the ''Bible'']]
Proverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. "There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity."&lt;ref&gt;p. ii. Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time.  For example, a proverb of the approximate form "No flies enter a mouth that is shut" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between.  It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors.  However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is "A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam", found in Peshai of Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; and Orma of Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012. Wisdom from Orma, Kenya proverbs and wise sayings. Nairobi: African Proverbs Working Group. http://www.afriprov.org/images/afriprov/books/wisdomofOrmaproverbs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably places in between.

Proverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia,&lt;ref&gt;Kamil V. Zvelebil. 1987. The Sound of the One Hand.  Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dari in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, Edward Zellem. 2012. Zarbul Masalha: 151 Aghan Dari proverbs.&lt;/ref&gt; to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;p. 164. Philip B. Yampolsky, (trans.). 1977.  The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected Writings. New York, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach. 1981. Indian Wisdom and Its Spread beyond India. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 101, No. 1,  pp. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Kuusi; Marje Joalaid; Elsa Kokare; Arvo Krikmann; Kari Laukkanen; Pentti Leino; Vaina Mālk; Ingrid Sarv. Proverbia Septentrionalia. ''900 Balto-Finnic Proverb Types with Russian, Baltic, German and Scandinavian Parallels''. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for [[Esperanto]], where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, Sabine. 1999. Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb "Of mothers and water, there is none evil." It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:
* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''
* Amharic: ''Käənnatənna wəha, kəfu yälläm.''
* Alaaba" ''Wiihaa ʔamaataa hiilu yoosebaʔa''&lt;ref&gt;p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''Máakuti t'awá shuultáa: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.

However, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.&lt;ref&gt;Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and Tīmoti Sam Kāretu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. "there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: "While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all."&lt;ref&gt;p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not. &lt;ref&gt;Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. "Proverbs - A Universal Genre?", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, p. 299-316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===In conversation===
Proverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"&gt;Tadesse Jaleta Jirata. 2009. A contextual study of the social functions of Guji-Oromo proverbs. Saabruecken: DVM Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
[[File:Not all who wander are lost.png|thumb|[http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm Created proverb] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'' on a bumper sticker.]]

Many authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics,&lt;ref&gt;Yuldybaeva, G.V. 2013. On Research of the Style of the Bashkir Folk Epic "Ural-Batyr" pp. 121-122. ''ETHNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF SHAMANISM AND OTHER INDIGENOUS SPIRITUAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES'', Vol. 15, part 2, pp. 121,122. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsaaior, James Tar (2010), "Webbed words: masked meanings: proverbiality and narrative/discursive strategies in D. T. Niane's Sundiata: An Epic of Mali". ''Proverbium'' 27: 319–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adjandeh, Evelyn Aku. 2014. ''A study of Proverbs in "Things Fall Apart" and "Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali (Sundiata)''.&lt;/ref&gt; novels,&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Obiechina. Culture, tradition and society in the West African novel. Vol. 14. CUP Archive, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; poems,&lt;ref&gt;Renker, Elizabeth. 2014. “Melville and the Worlds of Civil War Poetry.” ''Leviathan'' 16 (2014): 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt;, short stories.&lt;ref&gt;2017. Peter Unseth and Georgi Kapchits. Hemingway’s Somali proverb confirmed. ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews'' 30(4):253-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"&gt;Michael Stanton. 1996. Advice is a dangerous gift. ''Proverbium'' 13: 331-345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga. 2003.

''The proverbs of Middle-Earth'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Melville]] is noted for creating proverbs in [[Moby Dick]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 30. Hayes, Kevin. Melville’s Folk Roots. Kent: Kent State UP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2015. The Source of Melville’s Iroquois Proverb. ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews'' 28:3-4, 182-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 141. Renker, Elizabeth. 2014. Mellville and the Worlds of Civil War Poetry. ''Leviathan'' 16: 135–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[C. S. Lewis]] created a dozen proverbs in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mercedes Lackey]] created dozens for her invented [[Shin'a'in]] and Tale'edras cultures;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs from Velgarth - http://www.dragonlordsnet.com/danp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lackey's proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia - e.g. "Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn't follow that you are wrong" is like to "Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes." These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among medieval literary texts, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Troilus and Criseyde]] plays a special role because Chaucer's usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Sic et Non'': Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer," ''Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung'' 2.2 (1997), 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabelais]] used proverbs to write an entire chapter of [[Gargantua]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 903. Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902-905. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls.&lt;/ref&gt;

The patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of "classical Chinese novels" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in ''Water Margin'' (''Sui-hu chuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hercules &amp; Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|"Hercules and the Wagoner", illustration for children's book]]
Proverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell.  Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''When life gives you lululemons,''&lt;ref&gt;Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr &amp; Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''&lt;/ref&gt; The twisted proveb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], "I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'"

Some books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having "governing proverbs" where "the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying."&lt;ref&gt;p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. "Advice is a dangerous gift": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331-346.&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as "A stitch in time saves nine" at the beginning of "Kitty's Class Day", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as "[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbs have also been used strategically by poets.&lt;ref&gt;Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''"So many heads, so many wits": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as "A bird in the bush" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and "[[The blind leading the blind]]" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s "Symposium", which begins "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time..." The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as "Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune."&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,
&lt;br /&gt;"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo
&lt;br /&gt;They forget that wisdom is greater than power"&lt;ref&gt;p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo
Mosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into "It's no good crying over spilt potion" and [[Dumbledore]]
advises Harry not to "count your owls before they are delivered".&lt;ref&gt;Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards—and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. "The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs. ''What Goes Around Comes Around: The Circulation of Proverbs in Contemporary Life'', Kimberly J. Lau, Peter Tokofsky, Stephen D. Winick, (eds.), pp. 152-170. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=usupress_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%3A%20Circulation%20Proverbs%20Contemporary%20Life%2C%22 digitalcommons.usu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier than O'Brian's Aubrey, [[Beatrice Grimshaw]] also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'', such as "The proof of the pudding sweeps clean" (p.&amp;nbsp;109) and "A stitch in time is as good as a mile" (p.&amp;nbsp;97).&lt;ref&gt;Grimshaw, Beatrice. 1914. ''The Sorcerer’s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary "You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream" (p.&amp;nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.&lt;ref&gt;p. 49, Jennifer Speake. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatha Christie]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''. Bern: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;George B. Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1994. ''The Proverbial Bernard Shaw: An Index to Proverbs in the Works of George Bernard Shaw''. Heinemann Educational Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cervantes]],&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2006. Tilting at Windmills History &amp; Meaning of a Proverbial Allusion to Cervantes Don Quixote. Burlington: University of Vermont. {{ISBN|0977073130}}    {{ISBN|9780977073139}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2017. ''"Stringing proverbs together'': The proverbial language in Miugel Cervantes's "Don Quixote"''.  (Supplement series to Provebium, 38.)

Friedrich Nietzsches sprichwörtliche Sprache. Broschu.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: "All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence"&lt;ref&gt;Connable, Ben. (2009). All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence. Military Review, March–April: 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Should Rolling Stones Worry About Gathering Moss?"&lt;ref&gt;MUNISHWAR NATH GUPTA. 2017. ''Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy'' 83 No. 4: 741-743.&lt;/ref&gt;, "Between a Rock and a Soft Place".&lt;ref&gt;Denig, Stephen J. Between a Rock and a Soft Place. ''Christian Higher Education'' 11.1 (2012): 44-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been noted as common in subtitles of articles&lt;ref&gt;p. 154. ''Introduction to Paremiology. A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'' edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga. Berlin: De Gruyter Open. Online: [http://www.degruyter.com/viewbooktoc/product/449649 Open Access version].&lt;/ref&gt; such as "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'."&lt;ref&gt;Cope, Lida. 2006. "Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'." ''Southern Journal of Linguistics'' 30(2):1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the reverse is found with a proverb (complete or partial) as the title, then an explanatory subtitle, "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections".&lt;ref&gt;Norpoth, Helmut. 2012. "To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' Volume 42, Issue 2: 324–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. "'If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time' Somali proverb" in an article on peacemaking in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Ismail I. Ahmed and Reginald H. Green. 1999. The heritage of war and state collapse in Somalia and Somaliland. ''Third World Quarterly'' 20.1:113-127.&lt;/ref&gt; An article about research among the [[Māori people|Māori]] used a Māori proverb as a title, then began the article with the Māori form of the proverb as an epigram "Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up", followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context.&lt;ref&gt;Pia Pohatu and Tui Aroha Warmenhoven. 2007. Set the overgrowth alight and the new shoots will spring forth: New directions in community based research. ''AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Scholarship'', Special supplement, 109-127.&lt;/ref&gt; A British proverb has even been used as the title for a doctoral dissertation: ''Where there is muck there is brass''.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Tony. 2016. ''Where there’s muck there’s brass! Coinage in the Northumbrian landscape and economy, c.575-c.867.'' Leeds University: Doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In drama and film===

Similarly to other forms of literature, proverbs have also been used as important units of language in drama and films. This is true from the days of classical Greek works&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Joseph. 1983. The Poetics of the Ancient Greek Proverb. ''Journal of Folklore Research''
Vol. 20, No. 2/3, pp. 121-130&lt;/ref&gt; to [[old French]]&lt;ref&gt;Wandelt, Oswin. 1887. Sprichwörter und Sentenzen des altfranzösischen Dramas (1100-1400. Dissertation at Marburg Fr. Sömmering.&lt;/ref&gt; to Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F.P. 1981. The proverbial wisdom of Shakespeare. In ''The Wisdom of Many: Essays on the Proverb'', ed. by Wolfgang Mieder and Alan Dundes, p. 174-189. New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; to 19th Century Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Cazal. 2012.

The use of proverbs in drama and film today is still found in languages around the world, such as [[Yoruba language|Yorùbá]].&lt;ref&gt;Akíntúndé Akínyemi. 2007. The use of Yorùbá proverbs in Alin Isola's historical drama ''Madam Tinubu: Terror in Lagos''. ''Proverbium'' 24:17-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

A film that makes rich use of proverbs is ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', known for both using and creating proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 1998. "The proverb process: Intertextuality and proverbial innovation in popular culture". University of Pennsylvania dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen David Winick. 2013. Proverb is as proverb does. ''Proverbium''30:377-428.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of the use of proverbs in film include work by Kevin McKenna on the Russian film ''[[Aleksandr Nevsky]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McKenna. 2009. "Proverbs and the Folk Tale in the Russian Cinema: The Case of Sergei Eisenstein's Film Classic Aleksandr Nevsky." ''The Proverbial «Pied Piper» A Festschrift Volume of Essays in Honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the Occasion of His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', ed. by Kevin McKenna, pp. 277-292.

Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aboneh Ashagrie on ''[[The Athlete (2009 film)|The Athlete]]'' (a movie in Amharic about [[Abebe Bikila]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aboneh Ashagrie. 2013. The Athlete: a movie about the Ethiopian barefooted Olympic champion. ''Journal of African Cultural Studies'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the screenplay by [[Eric Roth]] had more proverbs than the novel by [[Winston Groom]], but for ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by [[Michael Thelwell]] has many more proverbs than the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Coteus, Stephen. 2011. "Trouble never sets like rain": Proverb (in)direction in Michael Thelwell's ''The Harder They Come''. ''Proverbium'' 28:1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Éric Rohmer]], the French film director, directed a series of films, the "Comedies and Proverbs", where each film was based on a proverb: ''[[The Aviator's Wife]]'', ''[[Le Beau mariage|The Perfect Marriage]]'', ''[[Pauline at the Beach]]'', ''[[Full Moon in Paris]]'' (the film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: "The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind."), ''[[The Green Ray]]'', ''[[Boyfriends and Girlfriends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pym, John. 1986/1987. Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.

They have also been used as the titles of plays:&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, George. 2002. Proverbial titles of dramas. ''Proverbium'' 19:65-74.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater|Baby with the Bathwater]]'' by [[Christopher Durang]], ''Dog Eat Dog'' by [[Mary Gallagher]], and ''[[The Dog in the Manger]]'' by [[Charles Hale Hoyt]]. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]].  Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinova, Anna. 2012. Proverbs in an American musical: A cognitive-discursive study of "The Full Monty". ''Proverbium'' 29:67-93.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, "All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All's well that ends with me."

===In Music===

Proverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in other languages, such as the [[Akan language]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 95 ff. Kwesi Yankah. 1989. ''The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric.'' Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Igede language]],&lt;ref&gt;Ode S. Ogede. 1993. Proverb usage in the praise songs of Igede: ''Adiyah'' poet Micah Ichegbeh.  ''Proverbium'' 10:237-256.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Raúl Eduardo GONZÁLEZ HERNÁNDEZ. Refranes en las canciones de [[Chava Flores]]. ''Paremia'' 20: 2011, pp. 139-148. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/13.GONZALEZ.pdf Electronic access]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), [[If the shoe fits (disambiguation)|If the shoe fits]] has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, Geoerge. 2001.  An unfinished List of Anglo-American Proverb Songs. ''Proverbium'' 18:15-56.&lt;/ref&gt; include [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''Easy come, easy go'', Harold Robe's ''Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream'', Arthur Gillespie's ''Absence makes the heart grow fonder'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''Like a rolling stone'', [[Cher]]'s ''Apples don't fall far from the tree''. [[Lynn Anderson]] made famous a song full of proverbs, ''[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|I never promised you a rose garden]]'' (written by [[Joe South]]). In choral music, we find [[Michael Torke]]'s ''Proverbs'' for female voice and ensemble. A number of [[Blues]] musicians have also used proverbs extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Michael. 1994. Proverbs in the Blues. ''Proverbium'' 12: 227-258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prahlad, Sw. Anand. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. See pp. 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Folsom. 1993. ''A discography of American Country music hits employing proverb: Covering the years 1986-1992. Proceedings for the 1993.'' Conference of the Southwest/Texas Popular Culture Association, ed. by Sue Poor, pp. 31-42. Stillwater, Oklahoma: The Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florian Gutman. 2007. "Because you're mine, I walk the line" Sprichwörliches in auswegewählten Liedern von Johnny Cash." ''Sprichwörter sind Goldes Wert'', ed. by Wolfgang Mieder, pp. 177-194. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 25). Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reggae]] artist Jahdan Blakkamoore has recorded a piece titled ''Proverbs Remix''. The opera ''Maldobrìe'' contains careful use of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;V. Dezeljin. 1997. Funzioni testuali dei proverbi nel testo di ''Maldobrìe''. Linguistica (Ljubljana) 37: 89-97.&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by [[Bruce Springsteen]], "My best was never good enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqJeHXifgLk |title=Bruce Springsteen - My Best Was Never Good Enough - Live 2005 (opening night) video |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Mighty Diamonds]] recorded a song called simply "Proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyO2Chjy4LM Mighty Diamonds doing "Proverbs"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Fleet Foxes]] used the proverb painting [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] for the cover of their eponymous album [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes.]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan. "Why I judge albums by their covers." Wednesday 25 February 2009. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Bad Company]], [[The Mothers of Invention]], Feast or Famine, [[Of Mice and Men (band)|Of Mice and Men]]. There have been at least two groups that called themselves "The Proverbs", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as "Proverb".  In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as ''Spilt milk'' (a title used by [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] and also [[Kristina Train]]), ''The more things change'' by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], ''Silk purse'' by [[Linda Ronstadt]], ''Another day, another dollar'' by DJ Scream Roccett, ''[[The blind leading the naked]]'' by [[Violent Femmes]], ''What's good for the goose is good for the gander'' by [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], ''Resistance is Futile'' by [[Steve Coleman]], ''Murder will out'' by [[Fan the Fury]]. The proverb ''Feast or famine'' has been used as an album title by [[Feast or Famine (Chuck Ragan album)|Chuck Ragan]], [[Feast or Famine (Reef the Lost Cauze album)|Reef the Lost Cauze]], Indiginus, and DaVinci. [[Whitehorse (band)|Whitehorse]] mixed two proverbs for the name of their album ''Leave no bridge unburned''. The band Splinter Group released an album titled ''[[When in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome]], Eat Lions''. The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, ''[[Come and take it]]''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 10. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publihsers.&lt;/ref&gt;

From ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form.  This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Khachan. 2012. Courtroom proverbial murals in Lebanon: a semiotic reconstruction of justice. ''Social Semiotics'' DOI:10.1080/10350330.2012.665262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Charlot. 2007. ''Local Traffic Only: Proverbs Hawaiian Style.'' Watermark Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kanga (African garment)|kangas]] (East African women's wraps),&lt;ref&gt;Rose Marie Beck. 2000. Aesthetics of Communication: Texts on Textiles (Leso) from the East African Coast (Swahili). ''Research in African Literatures'' 31.4: 104-124)&lt;/ref&gt; [[quilt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell, Marsha and Wolfgang Mieder. "'When Life Hands You Scraps, Make a Quilt': Quiltmakers and the Tradition of Proverbial Inscriptions." ''Proverbium'' 27 (2010), 113-172.&lt;/ref&gt; a stained glass window,&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Reilly &amp; Mary B. Shepard (2016) “Sufferance fait ease en temps”: word as image at St Michael-le-Belfrey, York. ''Word &amp; Image'' 32:2, 218-234. DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.&lt;/ref&gt; and graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Szpila, G. (2012). Regulating the reality? Proverbs in Polish graffiti, Estonia and Poland. ''Creativity and Tradition in Cultural Communication'' 1, 269-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. [[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/|title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.&lt;ref&gt;Corey Barksdale. 2011. ''Art &amp; Inspirational Proverbs''. Lulu.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The British artist [[Chris Gollon]] has painted a major work entitled "Big Fish Eat Little Fish", a title echoing Bruegel's painting Big Fishes Eat Little Fishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |title=Gollon's painting |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220155210/http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |archive-date=2017-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oliver Pelton - Benjamin Franklin - Poor Richard's Almanac Illustrated.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing proverbs from Ben Franklin]]
[[File:Three wise monkeys figure.JPG|thumb|[[Three wise monkeys]], invoking a proverb, with no text.]]
Sometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the [[three wise monkeys]] who remind us "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil". When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[Ōmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb "Flowers on a dead tree" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;p. 426. Yoko Mori. 2012. Review of  ''Dictionary of Japanese Illustrated Proverbs''. ''Proverbium'' 29:435-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, Wango. ''Use of Visual Illustration in the Interpretation of Proverbs in Secondary Schools in Kikuyu District, Kiambu County, Kenya''. Kenyatta University PhD dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 203-213. Richard Honeck. 1997. ''A Proverb in Mind''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  "If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 Article on Maltese proverb sculptures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils ‘Kif Jgħid Il-Malti’ public art installations - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557|title=Arts &amp; Entertainment|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cartoons===
Cartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.&lt;ref&gt;Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999."Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden": Ursprung, Überlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen. ''Proverbium'' 16: 351-380&lt;/ref&gt; An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, "Two early bird specials... here ya go."&lt;ref&gt;The Argyle Sweater, May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[Three wise monkeys]] were depicted in [[Bizarro]] with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign "See and speak evil", the one with eyes covered bore the sign "See and hear evil", etc. The caption at the bottom read "The power of positive thinking."&lt;ref&gt;June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, "I'll have an ounce of prevention."&lt;ref&gt;p. 126. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic strip [[The Argyle Sweater]] showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption "A fool and his mummy are soon parted."&lt;ref&gt;Aug 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic [[One Big Happy (comic strip)|One Big Happy]] showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as "Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers."&lt;ref&gt;July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Editorial cartoon]]s can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraut, Edward James. 1999. "Michel und Mauer": Post-Unification Germany as seen through Editorial Cartoons. Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled "Congress" telling a black kettle labeled "[[General Services Administration|GSA]]", "Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!"&lt;ref&gt;Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.

Cartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption "[[In vino veritas]]".&lt;ref&gt;p. 389. Wolfgang Mieder. 2013. ''Neues von Sisyphus: Sprichwörtliche Mythen der Anike in moderner Literatur, Medien und Karikaturen.'' Bonn: Praesens.&lt;/ref&gt;

One cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper ''The Water Tower'', under the title "Proverb place".&lt;ref&gt;Brienne Toomey. 2013. Old wisdom reimagined: Proverbial cartoons for university students. ''Proverbium'' 30: 333-346.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Good things come to those who dont wait.JPG|thumb|''[[Anti-proverb]]'' used in advertising [[Chick-Fil-A]]]]
===In advertising===
[[File:Glass half full kind of day.JPG|left|thumb|''Anti-proverb'' used in [[advertising]]]]
Proverbs are frequently used in advertising, often in slightly modified form.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder and Barbara Mieder. 1977. Tradition and innovation: Proverbs in advertising. ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 11: 308-319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Winick. 2011. Fall into the (intertextual) gap: Proverbs, advertisements, and intertextual strategies. ''Proverbium'' 28:339-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Anne Audber de Baubeta. 2000. Bread, the staff of advertising. ''Paremia'' 9: 103-110. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/P9-12.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ford once advertised its Thunderbird with, "One drive is worth a thousand words" (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, "One picture is worth a thousand words," was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).

A few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:
* "Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])
* "At D &amp; D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks" (D &amp; D Dogs)
* "If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment" ([[John Deere]])
* "A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned." ([[Volkswagen]])
* "Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder." ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])
* "Where Hogs fly" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team
* "Waste not. Read a lot." ([[Half Price Books]])

The [[GEICO]] company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScDoJ2wnug |title=GEICO Commercial - Bird in Hand |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The pen is mightier than the sword",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZd-ql7t1I |title=Is the Pen Mightier? - GEICO Commercial |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pigs may fly/[[Flying pig|When pigs fly]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-r4Z1K_LDc |title=When pigs fly |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If a tree falls in the forest...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pW2bE61Z9U|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Words can never hurt you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCysb4_-4jU|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, "When pigs fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo0TfuueaY|title=When Pigs Fly - Doritos Crash the Super Bowl 2015 WINNER OFFICAL [sic]|first=|last=Nelson Talbot|date=9 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, "Think outside the shoebox." 
Use of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Seda Başer Çoban. 2010. Sözlü Gelenekten Sözün. Geleneksizliğine: Atasözü Ve Reklam [From Oral Tradition to the Traditionless of Speech: Proverb and Advertisement]. ''Millî Folklor''. pp. 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples "both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals". When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, "Going fast does not assure safe arrival".&lt;ref&gt;p. 233. Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
===Counter proverbs===
There are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as "Look before you leap" and "He who hesitates is lost", or "Many hands make light work" and "Too many cooks spoil the broth". These have been labeled "counter proverbs"&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"&gt;Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs. In ''Doing proverbs and other kinds of folklore'', by Charles Clay Doyle, 32-40. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 33.) Burlington: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; or "antonymous proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Furnham. 1987. The Proverbial Truth: Contextually Reconciling and the Truthfulness of Antonymous Proverbs. ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'' 6. 1:49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth.&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldberg, Ragnar. 1965. Ordsprak som poesi. ''Ord och Bild'' 74:564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "counter proverb" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, "A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother" and "Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother..."&lt;ref&gt;p. 425, 421. Mercy Bobuafor. 2013. ''The Grammar of Tafi.'' University of Leiden doctoral dissertation.  [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20916/bookpart.pdf?sequence=23 link to dissertation]&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: "Religion is victorious and sin erodes" and "Religion erodes and sin is victorious".&lt;ref&gt;p. 378. Valerie Inchley. 2010. ''Sitting in my house dreaming of Nepal.'' Kathmandu: EKTA.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: "It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow" and "The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead".&lt;ref&gt;p. 52, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory,&lt;ref&gt;p. 157-171, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt; such as "One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death" countered by "If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of "counter proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection "a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens, and curses.'' Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Korean proverbs, "when you compare two proverbs, often they will be contradictory." They are used for "a particular situation".&lt;ref&gt;p. 76. Jeyseon Lee. 2006. "Korean proverbs." In ''Korean language in culture and society,'' ed. by Ho-min Sohn, 74-85. University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Counter proverbs" are not the same as a "paradoxical proverb", a proverb that contains a seeming paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Bendt Alster. 1975. Paradoxical Proverbs and Satire in Sumerian Literature.  ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'' 27.4: 201-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaproverbs===
In many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, "metaproverbs". The most famous one is from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] of Nigeria, "Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it," used by [[Wole Soyinka]] in ''Death and the King's Horsemen''.  In Mieder's bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs.&lt;ref&gt;p. 1050. Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Other metaproverbs include:

There is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. On the negative side, this was deliberately done by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 1982. Proverbs in Nazi Germany: The Promulgation of Anti-Semitism and Stereotypes Through Folklore. ''The Journal of American Folklore'' 95, No. 378, pp. 435–464.&lt;/ref&gt; On the more positive side, proverbs have also been used for constructive purposes. For example, proverbs have been used for teaching foreign languages at various levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, April. 2004. Good Proverbs Make Good Students: Using Proverbs to Teach German Quickly.

Studia Anglica Posnaniensia: An International Review of English Studies 37: 173-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, proverbs have been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb "Mother's milk is sweet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724213805/http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html |date=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Leo and Rosetta Hendricks. 1994.

The most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where [[Joseph G. Healey]] and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the [[Paremiography|collection of proverbs]] from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections&lt;ref&gt;Atido , George Pirwoth. 2011. Insights from Proverbs of the Alur in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  In Collaboration with African Proverb Saying and Stories, www.afriprov.org. Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriprov.org/ |title=African Proverbs, Sayings and Stories |publisher=Afriprov.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Jay. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture'' (American Society of Missiology Monograph, 5). Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This attention to proverbs by those in Christian ministries is not new, many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers.&lt;ref&gt;Christaller, Johann. 1879.

U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]] pioneered the use of [[Afghan proverbs]] as a positive relationship-building tool during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]], and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=''Afghan Proverbs Illustrated''|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}, now also available with translations into German, French, and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; of Afghan proverbs in [[Dari Persian|Dari]] and English, part of an effort of nationbuilding, followed by a volume of [[Pashto]] proverbs in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Zellem. 2014.

===Cultural values===
[[File:Study proverb.PNG|thumb|250x|Chinese proverb. It says, "Learn till old, live till old, and there is still three-tenths not learned," meaning that no matter how old you are, there is still more learning or studying left to do.]]
[[File:Better a monk.JPG|thumb|Thai proverb depicted visually at a temple, "Better a monk"]]
There is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kanlisi Awedoba.  2000. University Press Of America&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs,&lt;ref&gt;Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999. Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs.

Proverbiality and Worldview in Maltese and Arabic Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 18:247–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalistic traits in Finnish proverbs,&lt;ref&gt;Maati Kuusi. 1994. Fatalistic Traits in Finnish Proverbs.

Understanding culture through proverbs. University of Amsterdam MA thesis. [http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=346423 Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed "proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time",&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be "counter proverbs", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface&lt;ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"/&gt; (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel "one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs".&lt;ref&gt;p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;Niemeyer, Larry L., "Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886&lt;/ref&gt; These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grauberg, Walter. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? In ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Bartlett J. 1994.

Seeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.&lt;ref&gt;p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus "Consistently illustrate Tajik values" and "The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values" discerned in the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;p. 139 &amp; 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref&gt;p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.&lt;ref&gt;Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov.  ISSN 2414-6862. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature "is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater".&lt;ref&gt;p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299-306.&lt;/ref&gt; But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero español y jordano. Estudio de Paremiología comparada. España: Sociedad Española de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: "The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them."&lt;ref&gt;p. 173.Sheila K.  Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173-184.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.

It is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.&lt;ref&gt;p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont&lt;/ref&gt; These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. "Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms" and "A good harvest is had only by a collective farm." They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced "newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]

===Religion===
Many proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:&lt;ref&gt;p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; "In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?"

Clearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the Badaga of India (Sahivite Hindus), there is a traditional proverb "Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself]."&lt;ref&gt;p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.&lt;ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"/&gt; The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.&lt;ref&gt;Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios árabes extraidos del ''Corán'': recopilación, traducción,  y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129-138.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many quote "Be sure your sin will find you out" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).

Not all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, "Do as the mullah says, not as he does."&lt;ref&gt;p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, MA thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, note the Italian proverb, "One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, "[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama".&lt;ref&gt;p. 16, P. R. Gurdon. 1895. ''Some Assamese proverbs.'' Shillong, India: Assam Secretariat Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. "If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas."&lt;ref&gt;p. 142. August Francke. 1901. A collection of Ladakhi proverbs. ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 2: 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Unseth (2017). Review of ''Warm Hearts and Sharp Tongues: Life in 555 Proverbs from the Zagros Mountains of Iran''. ''Iranian Studies'' 50:1, 163-167, DOI:10.1080/00210862.2017.1269451&lt;/ref&gt;

Dammann thought "The influence of Islam manifests itself in African proverbs... Christian influences, on the contrary, are rare."&lt;ref&gt;p. 46. Ernst Dammann. 1972. Die Religion in Afrikanischen Sprichwörter und Rätseln. ''Anthropos'' 67:36-48. Quotation in English, from summary at end of article.&lt;/ref&gt;  If widely true in Africa, this is likely due to the longer presence of Islam in many parts of Africa. Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;Sharab, Moayad; Sbaihat, Ahlam; Al Duweiri, Hussein (2013).

===Psychology===
Though much proverb scholarship is done by literary scholars, those studying the human mind have used proverbs in a variety of studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. "The use of proverbs in psychological testing." ''Journal of the Folklore Institute'' 15.1 (1978): 45-55.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest studies in this field is the ''Proverbs Test'' by Gorham, developed in 1956. A similar test is being prepared in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/neuropsy/testsE/sprichwort.html |title=Institut für Kognitive Neurowissenschaft |publisher=Ruhr-uni-bochum.de |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proverbs have been used to evaluate [[dementia]],&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Haruyasu; Yohko Maki, Tomoharu Yamaguchi. 2011.

==Paremiology==
{{main article|Paremiology}}
The study of proverbs is called '''paremiology''' which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[folklore]]. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences

===Paremiological minimum===
Grigorii Permjakov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.arnes.si/~bridges/proverb_wisdom.htm|title=Photo and Web page about Permjakov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the "paremiological minimum" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with "Birds of a feather flock together", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know "Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed "every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches".&lt;ref&gt;p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

===Sources for proverb study===
[[File:Books on proverb study.jpg|thumb|A sample of books used in the study of proverbs.]]

A seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor's ''The Proverb'' (1931), later republished by [[Wolfgang Mieder]] with Taylor's Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, John. 2002. The African proverbs project and after. ''Lexikos'', 12(1): 256-263.&lt;/ref&gt; Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). Mieder edits an academic journal of proverb study, ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium]]'' ({{ISSN|0743-782X}}), many back issues of which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://https//catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006930797|title=Proverbium.|first1=|last1=Universiṭah ha-ʻIvrit bi-Yerushalayim.|first2=|last2=University of Vermont.|first3=|last3=Ohio State University.|date=29 November 1984|publisher=|pages=v.|via=Hathi Trust}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and [[Alan Dundes]] (1994/1981). ''Paremia'' is a Spanish-language journal on proverbs, with articles available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/paremia/ Web access to ''Paremia'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are also papers on proverbs published in conference proceedings volumes from the annual Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colloquium-proverbs.org/icp/en/ |title=Conference website |publisher=Colloquium-proverbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], Portugal. Mieder has published a two-volume ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology'', with a topical, language, and author index.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 2008. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Mieder has published a bibliography of collections of proverbs from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mieder, Wolfgang. 2011.

===Noteworthy proverb scholars (paremiologists and paremiographers)===
The study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466 – 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, Desiderius. Adages in Collected Works of Erasmus. Trans. R.A.B Mynors et al. Volumes 31–36. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Mal Lara]] was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 ''Philosophia vulgar'', the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings.

From the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a “pioneering paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf|title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013. The Matti Kuusi International Database of Proverbs. ''Oral Tradition'' 28/2 (2013): 217–222. ([http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/28ii/06_28.2.pdf Article on his Proverb Type System.])&lt;/ref&gt; With encouragement from [[Archer Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;Lauhakangas, Outi. 2014. Categorization of proverbs, p. 59. ''Introduction to Paremiology'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 49–67. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; he founded the journal ''Proverbium: Bulletin d'Information sur les Recherches Parémiologiques'', published from 1965 to 1975 by the Society for Finnish Literature, which was later restarted as ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium: International Yearbook of Proverb Scholarship]]''. Archer Taylor was a 20th century American scholar, best known for his "magisterial"&lt;ref&gt;p. xiv, Mieder, Wolfgang. ''Proverbs: A handbook''. Westport, CT: Grenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; book ''The Proverb''.&lt;ref&gt;1931. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitrios Loukatos]] was a 20th century Greek proverb scholar, author of such works as ''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs'' (Ermis: Athens, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arvo Krikmann]] (1939 – 2017) was an Estonian proverb scholar, whom Wolfgang Mieder called “one of the leading paremiologists in the world”&lt;ref&gt;p. vi. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009. Editor’s Preface. ''Proverb semantics: Studies in structure, logic, and metaphor'', edited by Wolfgang Mieder, pp. v-viii. (Supplement Series to ''Proverbium'', 29.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; and “master folklorist and paremiologist”.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. Arvo Krikmann: Master folklorist and paremiologist. ''Proverbium'' 31: 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisabeth Piirainen]] was a German scholar with 50 proverb-related publications.&lt;ref&gt;p. 640-646. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009 ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Current proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs. [[Claude Buridant]] is a century French scholar whose work has concentrated on [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;1976. Nature and function of proverbs in jeux-partis. ''Revue des sciences humaines'' 163.3 (1976): 377-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galit Hasan-Rokem]] is an Israeli scholar, associate editor of ''Proverbium: The yearbook of international proverb scholarship'', since 1984. She has written on proverbs in Jewish traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan-Rokem, Galit. Web of life: Folklore and Midrash in Rabbinic literature. Stanford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph G. Healey]] is an American Catholic missionary in Kenya who has led a movement to sponsor African proverb scholars to collect proverbs from their own language communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afriprov.org/index.php/meetings/624-minutes-of-the-meeting-of-the-african-proverbs-working-group-saturday-28-april-2012-.html ''Minutes of the Meeting of the African Proverbs Working Group,'' ''Christ the Teacher Parish, Kenyatta University'' Nairobi, Kenya, Saturday, 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This led Wolfgang Mieder to dedicate the "International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections" section of ''Proverbium'' 32 to Healey.&lt;ref&gt;p. 457. International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections. ''Proverbium'' 32: 457-466.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] is a scholar of Jewish history and folklore, including proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Barbara. "Toward a theory of proverb meaning." ''Proverbium'' 22 (1973): 821-827.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wolfgang Mieder]] is a German-born proverb scholar who has worked his entire academic career in the USA. He is the editor of ‘’Proverbium’’ and the author of the two volume ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''.&lt;ref&gt;2009 ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''.

Founded by cabinet maker Jacques Saoutchik (born Iakov Savtchuk in [[Russian Empire]] in 1880), '''Saoutchik''' was a top-class French coachbuilding company founded in 1906. In the 1930s the company became famous for their high quality and often extravagant designs. After Jacques died in 1955, the company passed into the hands of his son Pierre. With the great French luxury car manufacturers all going out of business, the market for the ostentatious Saoutchik designs evaporated and the company ceased trading in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Coachbuilders from past to present:  Saoutchik | publisher = Coachbuild.com | url = http://www.coachbuild.com/index.php?option=com_gallery2&amp;Itemid=50&amp;g2_itemId=28052 | accessdate = 2010-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was known for designing flamboyant and expensive automobile bodies for classic brands such as [[Bugatti]], [[Delahaye]], [[Pegaso]], and others.

'''Somali architecture''' is the [[engineering]] and [[designing]] of multiple different [[construction]] types such as stone cities, [[castles]], [[citadel]]s, [[fortresses]], [[mosques]], [[temples]], [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[lighthouses]], towers and [[tombs]] during the ancient, [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods in [[Somalia]] and other regions inhabited by Somalis, as well as the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Western designs in [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.

==Ancient==

===Walled settlements, temples and tombs===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Ancient [[cairn]]s in [[Qa’ableh]].]]
Some of the oldest known structures in the territory of modern-day Somalia consist of burial [[cairn]]s (''taalo'').&lt;ref name="Mheah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodd|first=Michael|title=East African Handbook|year=1994|publisher=Trade &amp; Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-8442-8983-0|page=640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bL8tAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although found throughout the country and the larger [[Horn of Africa]] region, northern Somalia in particular is home to numerous such archaeological structures, with many similar edifices found at [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[El Ayo]], [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]], [[Maydh]] and [[Heis (town)|Heis]] among other towns. However, many of these ancient structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.&lt;ref name="Mheah"/&gt;

Houses were constructed of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of [[courtyard]]s and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the [[Wargaade Wall]].
[[File:Darod2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti|Sheikh Darod]]'s tomb in the ancient town of [[Haylaan]].]]
Near [[Bosaso]], at the end of the Baladi valley, lies a 2&amp;nbsp;km to 3&amp;nbsp;km long [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]].&lt;ref name="Mheah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Ismail Mohamed|title=Somalia Today: General Information|year=1970|publisher=Ministry of Information and National Guidance, Somali Democratic Republic|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMVAAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local tradition recounts that the massive embankment marks the grave of a community matriarch. It is the largest such structure in the wider Horn region.&lt;ref name="Astgi"/&gt;

In addition, old temples situated in the northwestern town of [[Sheikh, Somalia|Sheekh]] are reportedly similar to those in the [[Deccan Plateau]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Sgmsaos"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Some account of Somaliland: With Notes on Journeys Through the Gadabürsi and Western Ogaden countries, 1896–1897 | journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine | year=1898 | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=57–73 | doi=10.1080/00369229808732974|last1 = Pease|first1 = Alfred E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist several ancient [[necropolis]]es in Somalia. One such structured area is found on the country's northeastern tip, in the [[Ras Hafun|Hafun peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Nrsctw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Somalia Calling the World|author=National Review|year=1965|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll4MAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Booco]] in the [[Aluula District]] contains a number of ancient structures. Two of these are enclosed platform monuments set together, which are surrounded by small [[stone circle]]s. The circles of stone are believed to mark associated graves.&lt;ref name="Tpficss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somali Studies International Association|first1=Hussein Mohamed Adam, Charles Lee Geshekter (ed.)|title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies|date=1992|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=978-0891306580|pages=37 &amp; 40|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mudun]] is situated in the Wadi valley of the [[Iskushuban District]]. The area features a number of ruins, which local tradition holds belong to an ancient, large town. Among the old structures are around 2,000 tombs, which possess high towers and are dome-shaped.&lt;ref name="Mheah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi" /&gt;

[[Port Dunford]] in the southern [[Lower Juba]] province contains a number of ancient ruins, including several [[pillar tomb]]s. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region.&lt;ref name="Adam106"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hussein Mohamed Adam, Charles Lee Geshekter (ed.)|title=The Proceedings of the First International Congress of Somali Studies|date=1992|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=978-0891306580|page=106|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mM8tAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is believed to correspond with the ancient emporium of [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]], which is described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar311"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokhtar|first1=G.|title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520066977|page=311|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=aDxMF-6UdCQC|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern town of [[Hannassa]], ruins of houses with archways and [[courtyard]]s have been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb.&lt;ref name="Arotssc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanseverino|first1=Hilary Costa|title=Archaeological Remains on the Southern Somali Coast|journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa|date=1983|volume=18|issue=1|pages=151–164|doi=10.1080/00672708309511319|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00672708309511319#.VGJ0To938jg|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, various pillar tombs exist in the southeastern Marca area. Local tradition holds that these were built in the 16th century, when the [[Ajuran Sultanate]]'s [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|naa'ibs]] governed the district.&lt;ref name="Cassanelli97"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassanelli|first1=Lee V.|title=The Shaping of Somali Society: Reconstructing the History of a Pastoral People, 1600 to 1900|date=1982|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0812278323|page=97|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mlhyAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menhirs and dolmens===
{{Somali Architecture|image=}}
On the coastal plain 20&amp;nbsp;km to [[Alula, Somalia|Alula]]'s east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular [[dry stone]] wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 200 stone monuments (''taalos'') are found in the northeastern [[Botiala]] site, most of which consist of [[cairn]]s. The bigger cairns are covered in shingles and tend to be more sturdily constructed. There are a number of rows of standing stones ([[menhir]]s) on the eastern side of the structures, which are similar to those at [[Salweyn]], a great cairn-held situated close to [[Heis (town)|Heis]]. Besides cairns, the Botiala area also features a few other drystone monuments. These include disc monuments with circular, ground-level features, as well as low, rectangular platform monuments.&lt;ref name="Ncnsaa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chittick|first1=Neville|title=Newsletter of the Society of Africanist Archaeologists, Issues 24-32|date=1984|publisher=Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=lgnxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern town of Aw Barkhadle, named in honour of the 13th century scholar and saint [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn]] (Aw Barkhadle), is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are menhirs, burial mounds, and [[dolmen]]s.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-371-9|page=98|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stelae===
Near the ancient northwestern town of [[Amud]], whenever an old site had the prefix ''Aw'' in its name (such as the ruins of ''Aw Bare'' and ''[[Aw Bube]]''&lt;ref name="Lewis90"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Saints and Somalis: Popular Islam in a Clan-based Society|page=90|publisher=The Red Sea Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5AZyEhMtbkC&amp;pg=PA89|isbn=978-1-56902-103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint.&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B. Huntingford, "The Town of Amud, Somalia", ''Azania'', '''13''' (1978), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys by A.T. Curle in 1934 on several of these important ruined cities recovered various [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], such as [[pottery]] and [[coin]]s, which point to a medieval period of activity at the tail end of the [[Adal Sultanate]]'s reign.&lt;ref name="Lewis90"/&gt; Among these settlements, Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient [[stela]]e.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"/&gt; Burial sites near [[Burao]] likewise feature old stelae.&lt;ref name="Shaanm"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums|url=http://www.somaliheritage.org/museums.php|publisher=Somali Heritage and Archaeology|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
[[File:Zayla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of the [[Sultanate of Adal]] in [[Zeila]].]]
The introduction of [[Islam]] in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Persia]]. This stimulated a shift from drystone and other related materials in construction to coral stone, [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi2"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone cities===
[[File:Marka,Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Whitewash]]ed coral stone city of [[Merca]].]]
The lucrative [[commerce|commercial networks]] of successive medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[empire]]s and [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] such as the [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], and the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] saw the establishment of several dozen stone cities in the interior of Somalia as well as the coastal regions. [[Ibn Battuta]] visiting [[Mogadishu]] in the early 14th century called it a town ''endless in size'' &lt;ref&gt;The Archaeology of Islam in Sub Saharan Africa pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vasco Da Gama]] who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its centre&lt;ref&gt;Da Gama's First Voyage pg.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali merchants were an integral part of a long distance caravan trade network connecting major Somali cities, such as Mogadishu, [[Merca]], [[Zeila]], [[Barawa]] and [[Qandala]], with other business centers in the Horn of Africa. The numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia can be explained as the remains of a once booming inland trade dating back to the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali Society - Lee Cassanelli pg.149&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goan Bogame]], situated in the [[Las Anod District]], contains the ruins of a large ancient city with around two hundred buildings. The structures were built in an architectural style similar to that of the edifices in Mogadishu's old Hamar Weine and Shangani districts.&lt;ref name="Mheah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Astgi" /&gt;

===Castles and fortresses===

Throughout the [[medieval]] era, castles and fortresses known as ''Qalcads'' were built by Somali [[Sultans]] for protection against both foreign and domestic threats. The major medieval Somali power engaging in castle building was the [[Ajuran Sultanate]], and many of the hundreds of ruined fortifications dotting the landscapes of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran [[engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaping of Somali Society pg 101&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingosmanbargaalcast.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Ruins of the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] King [[Osman Mahamuud]]'s castle in [[Bargal]], built in 1878.]]
Other castle building powers were the Warsangali Sultanate and the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari Sultanate]]. The many castles and fortresses such as the Sha'a Castle, the Bandar Qassim Castles and the [[Botiala]] Fortress Complex and dozens of others in towns such as Qandala, [[Bosaso]] and [[Las Khorey]] were built under their rule.

The [[Dervish State]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century was another prolific fortress building power in the [[Somali Peninsula]]. In 1913, after the British withdrawal to the coast, the permanent capital and headquarters of the Dervishes was constructed at [[Taleh]], a large walled town with fourteen fortresses. The main fortress, ''Silsilat'', included a walled garden and a guard house. It became the residence of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], his wives, family, prominent Somali military leaders, and also hosted several [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], [[Yemen]]i and German [[dignitary|dignitaries]], architects, [[masonry|masons]] and [[Weapons|arms]] [[manufacturers]].&lt;ref&gt;Taleh W. A. MacFadyen The Geographical Journal, Vol. 78, No. 2 (Aug., 1931), pp. 125-128&lt;/ref&gt; Several dozen other fortresses were built in ''Illig'', [[Eyl]], [[Shimbiris]] and other parts of the [[Horn of Africa]].

===Citadels and city walls===
[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe]].]]
[[City walls]] were established around the coastal cities of Merca, [[Barawa]] and Mogadishu to defend the cities against powers such as the [[Portuguese Empire]]. During the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal Age]], many of the inland cities such as [[Amud]] and [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] in the northern part of Somalia were built on hills high above [[sea level]] with large defensive stone walls enclosing them. The Bardera [[Insurgent|militants]] during their struggle with the Geledi Sultanate had their main headquarters in the walled city of [[Bardera]] that was reinforced by a large fortress overseeing the [[Jubba]] river. In the early 19th century the citadel of Bardera was sacked by [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] and the city became a [[ghost town]].

Somali city walls also acted as a barrier against the proliferation of [[Weapons|arms]] usually carried by the Somali and Horn African [[nomads]] entering the cities with their [[camel train|caravan trains]]. They had to leave behind their weapons at the [[city gate]] before they could enter the markets with their goods and trade with the urban [[Somalis]], [[Middle Easterners]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] [[merchants]].&lt;ref&gt;Tales which persist on the Tongue - Scott S. Reese pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosques and shrines===
[[File:Hafun, Somalia.jpg|thumb|200px|right|17th-century mosque in [[Hafun]], Somalia.]]
Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the Horn of Africa region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were [[minaret]]s.
[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|13th century [[Fakr ad-Din mosque]] built by Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu|Mogadishu Sultanate]].]]
For centuries, [[Arba'a Rukun Mosque|Arba'a Rukun]] (1269), the Friday mosque of [[Merca]] (1609) and [[Fakr ad-Din]] (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in East Africa to have minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370&lt;/ref&gt; Arba Rukun's massive round coral tower of about 13 and a half meters high and over four meters in diameter at its base has a doorway that is narrow and surrounded by a multiple ordered recessed arch, which may be the first example of the recessed arch that was to become a prototype for the local mihrab style.

Constructed by and named after the first Sultan of the Mogadishu Sultanate, the Fakr-ad Din mosque dates back to the 1269. Built with [[marble]] and [[coral]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] on a compact rectangular plan, it features a domed [[mihrab]] central azis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. In addition, the masjid is characterized by a system of composite beams, alongside two main columns. This well-planned, sophisticated design is not replicated in mosques further south outside the Horn region.&lt;ref name="Garlake"&gt;Peter S. Garlake, ''Early art and architecture of Africa'', (Oxford University Press US: 2002), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th century ''Al Gami University'' consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the [[Islamic world]].
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Almnara Tower in Mogadishu.]]
[[Shrines]] erected to house and honor Somali [[patriarchs]] and forefathers evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. Such tombs, which are predominantly found in northern Somalia (the suggested point of origin of the Somalia's majority Somali ethnic group), feature structures mainly consisting of [[domes]] and square plans.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Somalia, the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the [[pillar tomb]]-style.

A number of ancient burial sites dated from the pre-Islamic period sit atop the peak of [[Buur Heybe]], a granitic inselberg in the southern Doi belt. They serve as a center of annual pilgrimage (''siyaro''). These burial sites on the mountain's summit were later made into Muslim holy sites in the ensuing Islamic period, including the Owol Qaasing (derived from the Arabic "Abul Qaasim", one of the names of Prophet [[Muhammad]]) and [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|Sheikh Abdulqadir al-Jilaani]] (named for the founder of the [[Qadiriyya]] order).&lt;ref name="Mukhtar60"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mukhtar|first1=Mohamed Haji|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810866041|page=60|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Towers and lighthouses===
Somalia's historical strategic location within the world's oldest and busiest [[Ocean|sealanes]] encouraged the construction of [[lighthouse]]s to co-ordinate shipping and to ensure the safe entrance of commercial vessels in the nation's many [[port city|port cities]]. In times of weak central authority the [[History of Somalia|Somali civilizational]] matrix of interior cities and port cities was based on a clan formula that saw various clans in fierce competition over natural resources that led to chronic feuding between neighbours. Towers provided the merchant class and the urban population protection against potential raids from the nomadic regions. [[Tower house|Stone towers]] such as the 15th century Almnara tower in Mogadishu and the Jamia tower of Merca were also built for defence. The ''Dar Ilalo'' stone towers though initially constructed to defend the fortress of [[Taleex]] were also used as [[Granary|granaries]] for the [[Dervish State]].

==Early modern==
[[File:QandalaCastleTown.jpg|thumb|right|350px|19th century [[castle town]] of [[Qandala]].]]
The early modern period saw a continuation in the use of materials such as coral stone, [[mud-brick|sundried brick]]s and [[limestone]] in Somali architecture which with the increasing European influence on the Somali peninsula was now being complemented by new construction materials such as [[cement]]. The period was characterised by [[military architecture]] in the form of multi-purpose forts, and the construction of new ports. The [[Sultan]]s of [[Aluula]] in the northern part of the country and the [[Geledi Sultanate]] in the south were at their peak during this period, and many of the castles, palaces and forts found in various Somali cities originate from that era.

==1990s to present==

In the modern period, several Somali cities such as [[Mogadishu]], [[Hargeisa]] and [[Garowe]] received large projects, which saw construction in new styles that harmoniously blended in with the existing old architecture. Due to [[Italy|Italian]] influence, parts of Mogadishu are built in the [[Classical architecture|classical style]]. The Somali government continued upon that legacy, while also opening the door to [[Germans|German]], [[United States|American]] and [[China|Chinese]] designers.

As a departure from the prevailing Somali architectural style, the [[National Theatre of Somalia|National Theatre]] in Mogadishu was completely built from a Chinese perspective. The town-hall was constructed in the [[Moroccan style]]. Much of the new architecture also continued upon ancient tradition, the ''Al-Uruba Hotel'', the pre-eminent hotel in Somalia and an iconic feature of Mogadishu's waterfront was entirely designed and constructed by Somalis in the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] style.

In recent times, due to the civil war and the subsequent decentralization, many cities across the country have rapidly developed into urban hubs and have adopted their own architectural styles independently. In the cities of [[Garowe]], [[Bosaso]] and Hargeisa, construction firms have built hotels, government facilities, airports and residential neighbourhoods in a [[Modern architecture|modernist style]], often utilizing [[Chromium|chrome]], [[steel]] and [[glass]] materials.

[[File:Roman - Trulla with Duck Head Finial - Walters 572103 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|A complete ''trulla'' in silver]]

The '''Staffordshire Moorlands Pan''', sometimes known as the '''Ilam Pan''', is a 2nd-century AD [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] bronze ''[[trulla]]'' with an [[inscription]] relating to the forts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].  It was found in June 2003 in [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]] parish, Staffordshire, by metal-detectorists, and, in 2005, was bought jointly by the [[Tullie House Museum]] in [[Carlisle]], the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Potteries Museum]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and London's [[British Museum]], with the help of a grant of £112,200 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It is a find of great national and international significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treasurehunting.tv/?p=74  The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan Article and Photos]&lt;/ref&gt;  The pan rotates between a number of locations, including the joint owning museums and another museum on Hadrian's Wall.

==Description==
The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, although lacking its handle and base, is an extremely well preserved enamelled and inscribed bronze (strictly speaking, "copper alloy") vessel for cooking and serving food, decorated in a [[Celtic art|Celtic]] style. (The Celtic peoples of the Roman period made more use of enamel on metal than other parts of the Empire.) It weighs 132.5&amp;nbsp;g, and is 47&amp;nbsp;mm high with a maximum diameter of 94&amp;nbsp;mm, and is 54&amp;nbsp;mm around the outside of the base.&lt;ref&gt;BM collection database"&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration consists of "eight roundels, with eight pairs of intervening hollow-sided triangles. Each roundel encloses a swirling six-armed whirligig centred on a three-petalled device inlaid with red, blue, turquoise and yellow-coloured enamel."&lt;ref&gt;BM collection database"&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that in addition to its functional role it may have been a 'souvenir' of Hadrian's Wall, made for a soldier who had served there. It may have been made as a decorative pan and was then customised by having an inscription added later (using an engraved, rather than relief-cast, inscription as in other enamelled objects of this type).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 2012, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription round the rim is engraved and then filled with enamel. It names forts on the wall: MAIS ([[Bowness-on-Solway]]), COGGABATA ([[Drumburgh]]), VXELODVNVM ([[Stanwix]]), CAMMOGLANNA ([[Camboglanna|Castlesteads]]).  The final part: RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS, is more elusive in meaning, but refers to the wall VALI, and probably a soldier DRACO. AELI may be part of his name, but was also [[Hadrian]]'s family name, so may go with VALI, indicating that the Romans called the wall the "Aelian Wall".

There are other comparable ''trulli'', and two with inscriptions relating to the wall; the inscription means this piece was almost certainly manufactured locally. Judging by these other finds, the handle would have been flat, with enamel decoration on the upper surface.  The [[Rudge Cup]] has a different shape, but also names forts on the wall (see that article for the "Amiens Skillet", another vessel with inscribed fort names).

'''Mary Louise Cecilia "Texas" Guinan''' (January 12, 1884 – November 5, 1933) was an American actress, producer and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. Born in Texas to Irish immigrant parents, she decided at an early age to become an entertainer. After becoming a star on the New York stage, the repercussions of her involvement in a weight loss scam motivated her to switch careers to the film business. Spending several years in California appearing in numerous productions, she eventually formed her own company.

What she is most remembered for are the [[speakeasy]] clubs she managed during [[Prohibition]]. Her clubs catered to the rich and famous, as well as to aspiring talent. After being arrested and indicted during a law enforcement sweep of speakeasy clubs, she was acquitted during her trial.

==Personal life and early career==
Guinan was one of four siblings born in [[Waco, Texas]], to immigrants Michael and Bessie (née Duffy) Guinan, who had immigrated separately as adults, meeting and marrying in Colorado{{refn|group=FN|Sources conflict as to point of origin. Some say both parents immigrated from Dublin, Ireland. Some say one or both of them had been born in Canada to immigrants from Ireland}}. Both parents were of Irish ancestry. They initially operated a wholesale grocery business. Relocating to Texas, they ran a horse and cattle ranch. As a child, she was nicknamed "Mamie", and attended parochial school at the Loretta Convent in Waco. Growing up on a ranch provided her with basic cowboy skills, and she honed her marksmanship at a local shooting gallery. In 1898, her parents were successful in securing her a two-year scholarship to the [[American Conservatory of Music]] offered by Chicago businessman [[Marshall Field]].{{sfn|Shirley|1989|pp=1-3}} After developing her soprano vocal talents, and finishing her studies, she joined a touring acting troupe that featured [[American frontier|American "Wild West"]] entertainment.&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cottrell|first1=Debbie Mauldin|title=Mary Louise (Texas) Guinan|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fgu21|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1904 using the name Marie Guinan, she married newspaper cartoonist John Moynahan on December 2. Two years later, Moynahan took a job in Boston. The couple eventually divorced, and Guinan moved to New York to pursue a career as a singer in the entertainment business.{{sfn|Shirley|1989|pp=4–5}}&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anthony|first1=Walter|title=Miss Guinan says she's a lonesome star from Texas|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1910-12-11/ed-1/seq-39/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The San Francisco Call|date=December 11, 1910|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, she claimed she had been born with the name Texas, and never let facts stand in the way of her narrative. In a full-page 1910 interview in ''The San Francisco Call'', she stated her father "was the first white child seen in Waco", although he had been a married adult when he arrived, and white settlers had been there since the early to mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conger|first1=Roger N.|title=Waco, Tx|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HDW01|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=April 3, 2018|language=en|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walter/&gt;

Theatre critic and ''[[Photoplay]]'' editor Julian Johnson was her companion for a decade, and was influential in the creation of her public persona. Many erroneously believed them to be married.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2007|p=465}}{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=52}} Her 1933 obituaries mention Johnson as her second husband, and millionaire George E. Townley as a third husband. Lacking any verification that the latter two marriages took place, Moynahan is now believed to have been her only husband.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Beckons "Texas" Guinan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/380493077/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com |date=November 6, 1933|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's connection is thought to have led to a poem carrying her byline being printed in ''Photoplay''.{{sfn|Slide|2010|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guinan|first1=Texas|title=Modern Cinderella|journal=Photoplay Magazine|date=April 1915|url=https://archive.org/stream/PhotoplayMagazineApril1915/Photoplay0415#page/n127/mode/2up/search/Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|via=[[Internet Archive]]|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alleged connection to the U.S. Senator from Texas, [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], evolved over time from a nonspecific tie to her family, to Guinan's being the senator's niece. The niece relationship seems implausible, since her parents were born and raised in a different country than either Senator Bailey or his wife. Mentions of him coincide with the timeline of her association with Julian Johnson. While he was editor at ''Photoplay'', an article written by then-staff journalist [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]] remarked that Guinan, " ... bore a distinct resemblance to her uncle, Senator Joe Bailey of Texas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Guinan Visits Pres.

Initially finding work as a chorus girl, she adopted the stage name Texas Guinan to give herself an edge in the competitive marketplaces of [[vaudeville]] and New York theatre productions.{{sfn|Sizer|2008|p=82}} Within a year, she had the female lead in a stage production of ''Simple Simon Simple'', during which she accidentally shot herself on stage with a loaded gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theatrical Chatter|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325642773/?terms=Texas+Guinan+what+the+rose+said|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Buffalo Enquirer  |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=December 13, 1907|page=2, col. 4}}; {{cite news|title=Actress Shoots Herself|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/186332982/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Green Bay Press-Gazette |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=October 12, 1907|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, she received favorable notices for her performance in ''The [[Gibson Girl]] Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poli's Promises Big Attractions: Texas Guinan and "The Gibson Girl Review"|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/369110944/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Hartford Courant |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=October 17, 1908|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she placed an advertisement in newspapers offering $1,000 to any songwriter who provided her with a song of equal popularity to the [[Gus Edwards]]–penned "That's What the Rose Said to Me"&lt;ref name=Song&gt;{{cite news|title=$1.000 for a Song That Will Make a Hit|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/142127396/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Pittsburgh Press |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=January 19, 1908|page=35. col. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared as a soprano vocalist in many productions, including ''The Gay Musician'', ''The Hoyden'' and ''The Lone Star''.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Texas Guinan|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045396/1909-11-18/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=18 November 1909|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had achieved a degree of national stardom by 1910. John P. Slocum managed her when she appeared in his multiyear touring production of ''The Kissing Girl''.&lt;ref name=Walter/&gt; When [[Ned Wayburn]] rolled out his production of ''The Passing Show'' on a national tour in 1913, Guinan was one of the headliners. Coinciding with the publicity for the tour, Guinan licensed her name and image to be used by W. C. Cunningham for a weight-loss plan. The advertisements that appeared in media across the country claimed Guinan had lost 70 pounds on the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous Actress Loses 70 Lbs.

A subsequent investigation by the postal service revealed it to be a swindle. United States Postmaster General [[Albert S. Burleson]] quickly acted to prohibit Guinan from receiving mail through the postal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actress Quack Plays "Fat Lady" To Get The Money|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/355078303/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=December 17, 1913|page=15}}; {{cite news|title=Mails Are Closed To Texas Guinan Under Fraud Order|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/355154619/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=January 20, 1914|page=13. col. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she continued on the stage, the incident damaged her career, and was a motivating factor in expanding her [[repertoire]] by trying her hand in the California film business.{{sfn|Shirley|1989|p=3}}

Guinan appeared as Zaza in the variety show ''[[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]]'', based on a French fairytale of the same name. The show opened at the [[Manhattan Center|Manhattan Opera House]] November 26, 1913, and closed January 1, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hop o' My Thumb|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/hop-o-my-thumb-7742#opennightcredit|website=IBDB|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She toured the United States with the ''Whirl of the World'' musical comedy in 1915.

She appeared in the musical ''Gay Paree'' that opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (New York City)|Shubert Theatre]] on August 18, 1925 and closed on January 30, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Paree|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/gay-paree-1925-7835|website=IBDB|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinan was part of the cast of the musical ''Padlocks of 1927'', also at the Shubert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Padlocks of 1927|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/padlocks-of-1927-10337|website=IBDB|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
In a film career that began in 1917 and continued through 1933, she was part of the vanguard of women filmmakers in the United States. Her later claims of being in France in 1917 entertaining the troops, and being decorated with a bronze medal by France field marshall [[Joseph Joffre]], has been proven false by the timeline and California location of her prolific film-making.{{sfn|Hoefling|2010|p=71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Troesser|first1=John|title=Texas Guinan|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/FallingBehind/Texas-Guinan.htm|website=Texas Escapes|publisher=Blueprints For Travel, LLC.|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Triangle Film Corporation]], founded in 1915 by Harry and Roy Aitken, featured Guinan in four two-reel shorts between 1917 and 1918, ''The Fuel of Life'', ''The Stainless Barrier'', ''[[The Gun Woman]]'' and ''The Love Brokers''. Unlike the musical genre she was known for on stage, she was now moving towards the [[Western (genre)|Western]] movie genre, and on her dressing room door appeared a map of the state of Texas, rather than her name. Triangle began billing her as "the female [[William S. Hart|Bill Hart]]" in reference to the industry's first Western star who at that time topped fandom popularity polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Name Not Enough So She Added Face|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86069873/1917-12-25/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Bourbon News|date=December 25, 1917|page=3, col. 4}}; {{cite news|title=Fourth of July at the Lyceum|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058396/1919-07-03/ed-1/seq-5/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Ogden Standard|date=July 3, 1919|page=5, col. 3}}; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Motion Picture Hall of Fame |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturemag152moti#page/6/mode/2up |journal=[[Motion Picture Magazine]] |location=Chicago |publisher=Brewster Publications |date=July 1918 |access-date=April 3, 2018|p=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frohman Brothers were Broadway producers. In 1918, brother Daniel Frohman and partner William L. Sherrill formed the Frohman Amusement Corporation for the express purpose of engaging in the motion picture business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Right To Use The Name of Frohman|journal=Theatre Magazine|date=1918|volume=27|page=394|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007979487|issn=0749-8829}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made more than a dozen films with Guinan in 1918, including ''[[The Boss of the Rancho]]'' and ''The Heart of Texas''.

During her years with Bull's Eye Productions/Reelcraft, she began to expand towards the production end of film-making, as a unit department head on the films ''Outwitted'', ''The Lady of the Law'', ''The Girl of the Rancho'', ''The Desert Vulture'', and at least five other productions. She created Texas Guinan Productions in 1921 to produce ''Code of the West'', ''Spitfire'' and ''Texas of the Mounted''.&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt; After ''I Am the Woman'' and ''The Stampede'' for Victor Kremer Film Features, she returned to New York.{{sfn|Shirley|1989|p=44}}

Guinan was again seen on the screen with two sound pictures, playing slightly fictionalized versions of herself as a speakeasy proprietress in ''[[Queen of the Night Clubs]]'' (1929) and then ''[[Broadway Thru a Keyhole]]'' (1933, written by [[Walter Winchell]]) shortly before her death.&lt;ref name=WFPP/&gt;

==Queen of the night clubs==
The 1920 [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] put [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] into effect, making sales or transport of alcoholic beverages illegal. While it ruined legitimate businesses, people continued drinking alcohol. Those who transported and sold it were known as "bootleggers". Thus began the establishment of the [[speakeasy]] private clubs, a cultural phenomenon in which Guinan excelled. Her introduction into the business was when speakeasy partners Emil Gervasini and John Levi of the Beaux Arts club hired Guinan in 1923 as a singer, for which she was paid $50,000.&lt;ref name=Dorman&gt;{{cite news|last=Dorman|first=Marjorie|title=Texas Guinan Tells How She Makes $100,000 A Year, Never Takes A Drink, And Says Folks Don't Go To Night Clubs To Imbibe Booze|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/59870697/?terms=texas+guinan+never+drinks|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=December 18, 1927|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoefling|2010|pp=70–71}}

Guinan's give-and-take dialogue with the customers inspired producer [[Nils Granlund]] to put together a full floor show with Guinan presiding as emcee for [[Ziegfeld Follies]] chorus girls. Bootleg huckster [[Larry Fay]] struck a deal with them to feature the show at his El Fey Club on West 47th Street in Manhattan. There, she became known for her catchphrase, "Hello, Sucker! Come on in and leave your wallet on the bar." In return for being the draw to attract wealthy and powerful clientele, Guinan received 50% of the profits. [[Ruby Keeler]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[George Raft]] were discovered by talent scouts while working as dancers at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corcoran|first1=Michael|title=Texas Guinan|date=May 1988|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22Texas+Guinan%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Texas%20Guinan%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Emmis Communications|journal=Texas Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sizer|2008|p=95}}{{sfn|Hoefling|2010|pp=72–74}} After being shut down by the police, she opened the Texas Guinan Club at 117 West 48th Street, also closed by the police. She and Fay later opened the Del-Fey Club in Miami the same year. By her own account, they once took in $700,000 in less than a year.&lt;ref name=Dorman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Guinan Again Clashes With Law Over Rum Selling|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/150102297/?terms=Texas+Guinan+Club|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Pittsburgh Press |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=June 10, 1925|page=12}};{{cite news|title=Texas Guinan, Laughing At Padlocks, "Arrives"|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/302549557/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Miami News |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=November 25, 1925|page=21, col. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
When Guinan returned to New York in January 1926, as hostess of the 300 Club at 151 W. [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], the opening night's event was the marriage ceremony for actress [[Wilda Bennett]] and Argentine dancer Abraham "Peppy" de Albrew. Other celebrities who visited her club were [[Al Jolson]], Scottish operatic soprano [[Mary Garden]], [[Jack Dempsey]], American operatic soprano [[Geraldine Farrar]], and [[Edward VIII|the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=Dorman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wilda Bennett Weds Her Dancing Partner|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/144142061/?terms=Texas+Guinan%27s+300+club|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Asbury Park Press |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date= January 20, 1926|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1926, the 300 Club was raided by the police, who seized bottles of liquor and arrested two people for "violation of the section of the penal code forbidding suggestive dances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police, Dry Agent Raid Night Club Of Texas Guinan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/247717335/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=July 3, 1926|work=Palladium-Item |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last week of June 1928, Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[Mabel Walker Willebrandt]] ordered a raid of speakeasy clubs in New York. Guinan, [[Helen Morgan]] (hostess of Chez Helen Morgan), Nils Granlund, and 104 others were arrested, and indicted by a federal grand jury. Guinan, Morgan and Granlund faced two years in prison, with a $10,000 maximum fine, if convicted. The others indicted were employees and patrons, who faced lesser penalties.

== Final years and death==
During the [[Great Depression]], she took her show on the road. She attempted to move to Europe, but [[Scotland Yard]] threatened to board her ship if she tried to land in England, where she was on their list of "barred aliens". The show was banned from France under labor technicalities. Guinan had a contract with a Paris club, but French employment laws dissuaded non-citizens from working in France. She turned this to her advantage by launching the satirical revue ''Too Hot for Paris'' upon her return to the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Guinan Defies British To Bar Her When She Tries To Land Land|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/135325514/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Democrat and Chronicle |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=May 23, 1931|page=1, col. 6}}; {{cite news|title=Texas Can't Alight to See Paris, France Rules|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/79520955/?terms=Texas+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Macon Chronicle-Herald |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=May 29, 1931|page=1, col. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1933Trib&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Guinan, Night Club Queen, Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/355254838|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=Chicago Tribne |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=November 6, 1933|pages=1, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the road with ''Too Hot for Paris'', she contracted [[Amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]] in Chicago, Illinois, during the epidemic in the Congress Hotel. She fell ill in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and died there on November 5, 1933, age 49, exactly one month before Prohibition was repealed; 7,500 people attended her funeral. Bandleader [[Paul Whiteman]] was a pallbearer along with two of her former lawyers and writer [[Heywood Broun]].{{sfn|Sizer|2008|p=103}}

Guinan is interred at the [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York]]. Her family donated a tabernacle in her name to St. Patrick's Church in Vancouver in recognition of Father Louis Forget's attentions during her last hours. When the original church was demolished in 2004, the tabernacle was preserved for the new church built on the site. She was survived by both of her parents. Her mother died at age 101 in 1959. Her father was 81 years old at his death on May 14, 1935. The newspaper obituary listed his place of birth as [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec, Canada, and his profession as a wholesale grocer. Her brothers Tommy and William P., as well as her sister Mrs. George C. Smith, also survived her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Guinan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52841160/?terms=Michael+Guinan|accessdate=April 3, 2018|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |subscription=yes |via=Newspapers.com|date=May 15, 1935|page=19, col. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's cinema''' is a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film.  This can include women filling behind the scene roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays.

Renowned female directors include [[Kathryn Bigelow]], who is the only woman to receive an academy award for best director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director|title=Kathryn Bigelow makes history as first woman to win best director Oscar|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=2010-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with many other women directors from around the world such as [[Mary Harron]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Sofia Coppola]], and [[Catherine Hardwicke]].  Many successful cinematographers are also women, including [[Maryse Alberti]], [[Reed Morano]] and Zoe White. 

Women's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well.  Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=9781903364277|location=|pages=1–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction", Alison Butler explains.  The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of be associated with marginalization and ideological controversy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Famous women in film history==

===Silent films===
[[Alice Guy-Blaché]] was a film pioneer and likely the first female director. Working for the [[Gaumont Film Company]] in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created ''[[La Fée aux Choux]]'' (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but ''La Fée aux Choux'' may well be the first narrative film ever released.&lt;ref name="Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of [[silent film]]s in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/alice-guy-blache/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American-born director, [[Lois Weber]] was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/lois-weber/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber is well known for her films [[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|''Hypocrites'']] (1915), ''[[The Blot]]'' (1921), and ''[[Suspense (1913 film)|Suspense]]'' (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film ''[[Where Are My Children?]] (1916)'' addresses the controversial issues of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].

[[Mabel Normand]] was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts [[Charlie Chaplin]] did as [[The Tramp]] at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/212-Chaplin-at-Keystone-The-Tramp-is-Born|title=Charlie Chaplin : Chaplin at Keystone: The Tramp is Born|website=www.charliechaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harper Fussell| first = Betty| authorlink = Betty Fussell| publisher = Limelight Editions| edition=   Illustrated| year= 1992| title = Mabel: Hollywood's First I-Don't-Care Girl| isbn = 978-0-87910-158-9| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pd4nAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780879101589| accessdate = July 29, 2010| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema. [[Frances Marion]], [[Anita Loos]], and [[June Mathis]] all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in [[Hollywood]].

In Sweden, [[Anna Hofman-Uddgren]] was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film ''[[Stockholmsfrestelser]]'' in 1911. She also acted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marika V. Lagercrantz |chapter-url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-20370 |chapter=En oavslutad berättelse.

===Classical Hollywood===
As the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the [[Hays Code]] in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo. [[Dorothy Arzner]] was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite av media|title=The Women Who Run Hollywood|author=Clara Kuperberg, Julia Kuperberg|year=2016|work= Wichita Films|format=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics find her film, ''[[Dance, Girl, Dance]]'', about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]], it was noted that "The dancers, played by [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Lucille Ball]], strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead [[Louis Hayward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2007.html Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007], from the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond ''Dance, Girl, Dance'', Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' (1933) and [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937).

===Experimental and avant-garde cinema===
The experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=1903364272|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pam Cook]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share "a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Palgrave|year=1989|isbn=9780333445297|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre. [[Germaine Dulac]] was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41086659|title=The St. James women filmmakers encyclopedia : women on the other side of the camera|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|others=Unterburger, Amy L.|year=|isbn=9781578590926|location=Detroit|pages=122–124|oclc=41086659}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Maya Deren]]'s visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45888927|title=Maya Deren and the American avant-garde|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|others=Nichols, Bill, 1942-|isbn=0520224442|location=Berkeley|oclc=45888927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Shirley Clarke]] was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=After the New American Cinema: Shirley Clarke's Video Work as Performance and Document|url=|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|publication-date=Spring–Summer 2012|volume=64|pages=57–64|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries. [[Joyce Wieland]] was a Canadian [[experimental film]] maker. The [[National Film Board of Canada]] allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like [[Valie Export]] were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of [[video]]s.

== Impact on society ==

===Impact of second-wave feminism===
In the late sixties, when the second wave of [[feminism]] started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like [[Newsreel]], but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. A first masterpiece was ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'' by [[Barbara Loden]], one of the most poignant portraits of alienation ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENELOW|first=SHONNI|date=September–October 2017|title=STRONGER TOGETHER|url=|journal=Film Comment|volume=53|pages=50–55|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of "sisterhoods" in movies, a good example of which is ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism, Femininity and Popular Culture|last=Hollows|first=Joanne|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|isbn=0719043956|location=Manchester, U.K. ; New York, N.Y.|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema Book 3rd rev. edition|last=Cook|first=Pam (ed.)|last2=Anneke M.|first2=Smelik|publisher=London: British Film Institute|year=2007|isbn=9781844571925|location=London, U.K.|pages=492|chapter=Feminist Film Theory|chapter-url=https://repository.ubn.ru.nl//bitstream/handle/2066/44160/44160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as [[Sally Potter]]'s ''Thriller'' in 1979.

===Representing sexuality===
Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of [[second-wave feminism]]. [[Abortion]] was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality ([[lesbianism]], [[sado-masochism]]) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.
[[Birgit Hein]], [[Elfi Mikesch]], [[Nelly Kaplan]], [[Catherine Breillat]] and [[Barbara Hammer]] are some of the directors to be remembered.

A film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is Lizzie Borden's ''[[Working Girls (1986 film)|Working Girls]]'' (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her "johns" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Glynis, Alexandra Devon, and Catehrina Tammaro. [http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/video/review/lizzie_borden.html "Anarcha-Filmmaker: An Interview with Lizzie Borden."] ''[[Kick It Over]]'' 18 (Spring 1987). Web. 30 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who can't obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The [[Bechdel test]] for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The 3 factors tested are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma &amp; Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'' or ''[[I Don't Know How She Does It]]''. Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and Furiosa in ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''. These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs  compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jocelyn Nicole, "The role of women in film: Supporting the men -- An analysis of how culture influences the changing discourse on gender representations in film" (2015). ''Journalism Undergraduate Honors Theses.'' Paper 2. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=jouruht&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fear of entering cinematography ===
Many women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handy|first=Jocelyn|last2=Rowlands|first2=Lorraine|date=2016-07-21|title=The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and defensive organizational practices within the New Zealand film industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726716651690|journal=Human Relations|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=312–338|doi=10.1177/0018726716651690|issn=0018-7267}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wing-Fai|first=Leung|last2=Gill|first2=Rosalind|last3=Randle|first3=Keith|date=May 2015|title=Getting in, Getting on, Getting out? Women as Career Scramblers in the UK film and Television Industries|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12240|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=50–65|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12240|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wing-Fai, 2015). These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.

However, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there is not many women in senior positions in the industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Compared to the amount of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. “However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.

The way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women’s pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Deborah|last2=Pringle|first2=Judith K.|date=May 2015|title=Unmanageable Inequalities: Sexism in the Film Industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12239|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=37–49|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12239|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.

===Resisting violence and violent resistance===
Resisting patriarchal violence was a key concern of second-wave feminism during the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Pilar Rodriguez|date=November 2011|title=Feminism and Violence: The Hegemonic Second Wave’s Encounter with Rape and Domestic Abuse in USA (1970-1985)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0921374011430566|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=147–172|doi=10.1177/0921374011430566|issn=0921-3740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many feminists of the second wave have taken part in the peace movements of the eighties, as had their foremothers in the older pacifist movements. The effects that war conflict had on women following the cold war was often overlooked. Post cold-war conflicts resulted in women being subjected to increased forms of torture, rape, and violence.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Citation|last=El-Bushra|first=Judy|title=Feminism, Gender, and Women's Peace Activism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444306675.ch7|work=Gender Myths and Feminist Fables|pages=127–143|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|isbn=9781444306675|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in women’s peace organizations and initiatives to protest violence against women, resulting in more criticism of the patriarchal cliché of the 'peaceable' woman.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Women film directors documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist resistance movements. Inspired by the Hindu goddess Mother Kali--who is traditionally associated with sexuality, violence, and motherly-tenderness-- German filmmakers Birgit and Wilhelm Hein created their Kali Film, which depicts women as violent and threatening, the opposite of the innocent “caretaker” stereotype generally assigned to women characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bampfa.org/event/kali-film|title=Kali Film {{!}} BAMPFA|website=bampfa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers assembled found footage from 'trivial' genres, the only domain of cinema in which the portrayal of aggressive women was allowed. 

Filmmakers have also begun to take on representations of sexuality and gender in films directed specifically at college students. As campus sexual assault continues to pervade universities, filmmakers have started to create films that address these issues. In 2014 a group of students and faculty at Texas Tech University created the film series “Sexism | Cinema,” to provide education on violence against women and sexual abuse on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=John B.

=== Statistics ===
A study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters.  USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.

For the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian.  Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse.  Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dr. Stacy|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|year=2016|title=Inequality in 800 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, LGBT, and Disability from 2007-2015|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Dr%20Stacy%20L%20Smith%20Inequality%20in%20800%20Films%20FINAL.ashx|journal=USC Annenburg|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muriel Box]] was an English screenwriter and director, directing her first film in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/479374/|work=BFI Screenonline|title=Box, Muriel (1905-1991)|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arden went on to be the only British woman to gain a solo feature-directing credit for ''[[The Other Side of the Underneath]]'' (1972), a disturbing study of female madness shot mainly in South Wales.
