A novel strain of '''[[Escherichia coli O104:H4|''Escherichia coli'' O104:H4]] bacteria''' caused a serious outbreak of [[foodborne illness]] focused in northern Germany in May through June 2011.  The illness was characterized by bloody diarrhea, with a high frequency of serious complications, including [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), a condition that requires urgent treatment.  The outbreak was originally thought to have been caused by an [[enterohemorrhagic|enterohemorrhagic (EHEC)]] strain of ''E. coli'', but it was later shown to have been caused by an [[Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli|enteroaggregative ''E. coli'' (EAEC)]] strain that had acquired the genes to produce [[Shiga toxin]]s, present in [[organic food|organic]] [[fenugreek]] sprouts.

Epidemiological fieldwork suggested fresh vegetables were the source of infection.  The agriculture minister of [[Niedersachsen|Lower Saxony]] identified an [[organic farm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaertnerhof.org/ |title=Gärtnerhof Bienenbüttel |accessdate=13 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612212804/http://www.gaertnerhof.org/| archivedate= 12 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bienenbüttel]], Lower Saxony, Germany, which produces a variety of [[Sprouting|sprouted foods]], as the likely source of the ''E. coli'' outbreak.&lt;ref name="CNN0605"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/05/europe.e.coli/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 |title=German-grown food named likely culprit in deadly outbreak |publisher=CNN |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was shut down.&lt;ref name="CNN0605"/&gt; Although laboratories in Lower Saxony did not detect the bacterium in produce, a laboratory in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] later found the outbreak strain in a discarded package of sprouts from the suspect farm.&lt;ref name=thelocal110611&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110610-35583.html|title=Deadly E. coli found on bean sprouts|publisher=thelocal.de |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A control investigation confirmed the farm as the source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name="SZ116"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/ehec-epidemie-bahr-befuerchtet-weitere-todesfaelle-1.1107576|title=Bundesinstitut bestätigt Sprossen als Ehec-Quelle|publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=11 June 2010|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 30 June 2011, the German ''Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR)'' (Federal Institute for Risk Assessment), an institute of the German [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]], announced that seeds of organic&lt;ref name=cid&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=L.

==Background==
&lt;!--EHEC--&gt;
Enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'' has been linked to foodborne outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome around the world since at least the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Kaper2015&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 1: Overview and Historical Perspectives |vauthors=Kaper JB, O'Brien AD |doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.EHEC-0028-2014 |pmid=25590020 |pmc=4290666 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |title=Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Other Shiga Toxin-producing E. coli |journal=Microbiology Spectrum |volume=2 |issue=6 |veditors=Sperandio V, Hovde CJ |pages=3–14|year=2015 |isbn=9781555818784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of disease has been attributed to ''E. coli'' with the [[serotype]] [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]]; however, over 100 ''E. coli'' serotypes have been associated with human diarrheal disease.&lt;ref name=Hughes2006&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Emerging Clinical Importance of Non-O157 Shiga Toxin-Producing ''Escherichia coli'' |vauthors=Hughes JM, Wilson ME, Johnson KE, Thorpe CM, Sears CL |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=43 |issue=12 |date=2006 |pages=1587–1595 |doi=10.1086/509573|pmid=17109294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Diarrheal disease and EHEC in Germany--&gt;
In the five years before the outbreak (2006 to 2010) Germany experienced an [[median|average]] of 218 cases of EHEC gastroenteritis and 13 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome each year.&lt;ref name=KochReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Final presentation and evaluation of epidemiological findings in the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak - Germany 2011 |publisher=Robert Koch Institut |date=2011 |url=https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/outbreaks/EHEC_O104/EHEC_final_report.pdf?__blob=publicationFile |accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Geman National Reference Centre for ''Salmonella'' and Other Enteric Pathogens, the most common serotypes in those years were O157, O26, O103, and O91.&lt;ref name=Fruth2015&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular epidemiological view on Shiga toxin-producing ''Escherichia coli'' causing human disease in Germany: Diversity, prevalence and outbreaks |vauthors=Fruth A, Prager R, Tietze E, Rabsch W, Fliger A |doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2015.08.020 |pmid=26372529 |journal=International Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=305 |issue=7 |date=2015 |pages=697–704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotype O104 was relatively rare in Europe in the years preceding the outbreak, with just 11 reported cases in the EU and Norway between 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli'' (STEC) O104:H4 2011 outbreaks in Europe: Taking stock |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=9 |issue=10 |page=2390 |author=European Food Safety Authority |url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2390 |accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak==
===Cases===
Cases began as early as May 1, 2011 with a man in [[Aachen]] reporting bloody dirrahea.&lt;ref name=KochReport/&gt; Cases then rapidly increased, with over 100 cases of EHEC gastroenteritis and/or HUS were being reported each day by May 16th.&lt;ref name=KochReport/&gt; The outbreak centered on the five northern German states of Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen, Lower Saxony, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.&lt;ref name=KochReport/&gt; Cases would eventually be reported in all 16 German states; however most cases outside of the northern states were linked to travel in northern Germany.&lt;ref name=Frank2011/&gt; Additionally, a small number of cases were reported from other countries, although most of those ill had previously travelled to Germany. The most substantial outbreak outside of Germany was in Bordeaux, France where 15 cases of EHEC gastroenteritis were associated with the same strain of ''E. coli'' which caused the outbreak in Germany. The French cases had not previously travelled to Germany, suggesting they acquired the bacteria from contaminated sprouts grown in France.&lt;ref name=KochReport/&gt; Cases of EHEC HUS and gastroenteritis peaked on May 21 and 22 respectively.&lt;ref name=Frank2011/&gt; Cases then slowly decreased over the following month, with cases reported throughout the month of June and ending during July 2011. German authorities deemed the outbreak over in early July 2011.&lt;ref name=KochReport/&gt;

The outbreak disproportionately affected adults and the elderly. 88% of hemolytic-uremic syndrome patients were over 17 years of age, and the median age of hemolytic-uremic syndrome patients was 42 years.&lt;ref name=Frank2011/&gt; The median age of patients who died of gastroenteritis was 82 years, while the median age of patients who died from hemolytic-uremic syndrome was 74 years.&lt;ref name=Frank2011/&gt;

Most or all victims were believed to have become infected in Germany or France. Confirmed cases are listed below according to their location when diagnosed.

According to the head of the national ''E. coli'' lab at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the strain responsible for the outbreak has been circulating in Germany for 10 years, and in humans not cattle.

Canada and the United States reported cases of ''E. coli'' infection that had been acquired in Europe.

On 2 June, Canada brought in stricter anti ''E. coli''-related food inspections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthzone.ca/health/newsfeatures/article/1001705--canadian-experts-alarmed-at-spread-of-mutant-e-coli-in-europe?bn=1 |title=E. coli outbreak sparks beefed up Canadian food import inspections |publisher=Healthzone.ca |date=2 June 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 3 June the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] said no Canadians had been reported sick with the strain as of that date. The Canadian government also brought in heavier import and hygiene restrictions on EU cucumbers, lettuces, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20110603/canada-eurole-vegetables-coli-110603/ |title=Canadian inspectors testing Europe veggies for E. coli – CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that emerging strains of ''E. coli'' are a significant problem, but regulatory bodies in the US have concentrated on the more infamous ''E. coli'' O157 serotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolio104h4.com/e-coli-o104h4-responses-usa/ |title=''E. coli'' O104:H4 responses from the USA |publisher=Ecolio104h4.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710165737/http://ecolio104h4.com/e-coli-o104h4-responses-usa/ |archivedate=10 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-marler/e-coli-outbreak-exporting_b_867819.html |title=William Marler: '&amp;#39;E. coli'&amp;#39; Outbreak: Exporting Bill Marler to Germany or Japan |work=Huffington Post |date= 27 May 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA noted nearly all of America's fresh produce is grown in the US and areas of Central America, and the EU has not been a significant source of fresh produce for the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6365 |title=FDA STATEMENT ON E.

===Other countries===
Other countries, including Nigeria, Hong Kong, and Thailand, expressed concern regarding imported produce.

==Economics==
By 1 June, Italian, Austrian, and French cucumber sales had begun to decline sharply, but the Austrian Health Ministry official, Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, claimed Austrian customers were still safe.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/video/2011-06/01/c_13905346.htm |title=Cucumber sales plummet in Europe |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June, the governments of Spain, Portugal, and Germany said they would formally request EU agricultural aid for farmers affected by the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens |first=Laura |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303657404576362821286583788 |title=Europe's ''E. coli'' Cases Rise |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= 4 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day,  Russia also set up plans for new imports of cucumbers from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Turkey.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54726.html |title=Azerbaijan Business Center – Azerbaijan gets chance to increase sharply export of vegetables to Russia |publisher=Abc.az |accessdate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003222641/http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54726.html |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=russian-ban-may-support-turkish-exports-2011-06-02 |title=Russian ban may support Turkish exports – Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |work=Hurriyet Daily News |location=Turkey |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7 June, the EU's farmers had reported they had lost millions of dollars in exports during the outbreak, with Fepex, Spain's fruit and vegetable industry group, saying its growers had $256,000,000 in turnover.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; French, Swiss, Bulgarian, German, Dutch, Belgian, and Portuguese producers have also been similarly affected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

That day, the EU proposed issuing £135,000,000 in agricultural compensation to its farmers. The EU agriculture commissioner said the EU's farmers could get back up to 30% of the cost of vegetables they were unable to sell.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Walker, Adam Gabbatt and agencies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/ecoli-outbreak-farmers-compensation |title=E coli: European commissioner suggests £135m payout for farmers &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's health commissioner, John Dalli, had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for rushing out "premature conclusions" about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite web|last=Janicek |first=Karel |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43210195/ns/health-food_safety/t/e-coli-cucumbers-may-be-austria-hungary/ |title=E. coli cucumbers may be in Austria, Hungary |publisher=MSNBC |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dalli also told the EU parliament in Strasbourg that claims had to be scientifically sound, unbiased, and fool-proof in nature before it was publicised in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8561406/Germany-criticised-by-EU-health-chief-over-premature-E.coli-claims.html |title=Germany criticised by EU health chief over 'premature' E. coli claims |publisher=Telegraph |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain then rejected a €150,000,000/£135,000,000 the [[European Commission]]'s compensation deal for their farmers who were hit by the ''E. coli'' outbreak, on 8 June, saying it was too small.&lt;ref name="farmersguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Driver |first=Alistair |url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/spain-rejects-%E2%82%AC150m-e-coli-compensation/39517.article |title=Spain rejects €150m e. coli compensation &amp;#124; News |publisher=Farmers Guardian |accessdate=9 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221836/http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/spain-rejects-%E2%82%AC150m-e-coli-compensation/39517.article |archivedate=23 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; France, European Union's largest agricultural grower, said it would support the plan to compensate producers hurt by the outbreak, according to the French Agriculture Minister [[Bruno Le Maire]].&lt;ref name="connolly1"/&gt;

Ministers from both EU and Russia were scheduled to meet on 8 June over Russia's earlier decision to ban all its vegetable imports from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0608/russia.html |title=EU increases E coli compensation offer – RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June, the EU's  ''E. coli'' O104:H4 outbreak was estimated to have cost $2,840,000,000 in human losses (such as sick leave), regardless of material losses (such as dumped cucumbers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/german-e-coli-o104h4-outbreak---284-billion-in-human-damage/ |title=German E. coli O104:H4 Outbreak – $2.84 Billion in Human Damage : Food Poison Journal : Food Poisoning Lawyer &amp; Attorney : Bill Marler : Marler Clark |publisher=Food Poison Journal |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers across Europe were shunning fruit and vegetables ''en masse'' by 8 June, as the German government's edict against eating raw cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and sprouts remained on.  EU farmers claimed to have losses up to C$417,000,000 a week as ripe vegetables rotted in their fields and warehouses.&lt;ref name="EdmontonCTV110608"&gt;[http://edmonton.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110608/germany-e-coli-cases-110608?hub=EdmontonHome CTV Edmonton – Cucumbers suspected again in European E. coli outbreak – CTV News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June, The EU Farm Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said the EU had increased its offer of compensation to farmers for the losses caused by ''E. coli'' outbreak to C$210,000,000.&lt;ref name="EdmontonCTV110608"/&gt;

==Cause==
The outbreak was caused by a strain of ''E. coli'' of the serotype O104:H4, that was unusual for having characteristics of both enteroaggregative ''E. coli'' and enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli''.&lt;ref name=Navarro-Garcia2014&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.EHEC-0008-2013 |pmid=26104460 |title=Escherichia coli O104:H4 Pathogenesis: An Enteroaggregative E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26348">'''Abiotic stress''' is defined as the negative impact of non-living factors on the living organisms in a specific environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Abiotic_stress|title=Abiotic Stress|publisher=Biology Online|accessdate=2008-05-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613160443/http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Abiotic_stress| archivedate= 13 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The non-living variable must influence the environment beyond its normal range of variation to adversely affect the population performance or individual physiology of the organism in a significant way.&lt;ref name = "vine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinebrooke | first1 = Rolf D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2004 | title = Impacts of multiple stressors on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: the role of species co-tolerance | url = | journal = OIKOS | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 451–457 | doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13255.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a [[biotic stress]] would include living disturbances such as [[fungi]] or harmful insects, abiotic stress factors, or stressors, are naturally occurring, often intangible and inanimate factors such as intense sunlight, temperature or wind that may cause harm to the plants and animals in the area affected. Abiotic stress is essentially unavoidable.
Abiotic stress affects animals, but plants are especially dependent, if not solely dependent, on environmental factors, so it is particularly constraining.  Abiotic stress is the most harmful factor concerning the growth and [[Agricultural productivity|productivity of crops]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = Ji-Ping | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Understanding Abiotic Stress Tolerance Mechanisms: Recent Studies on Stress Response in Rice | url = | journal = Journal of Integrative Plant Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 742–750 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00495.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that abiotic stressors are at their most harmful when they occur together, in combinations of abiotic stress factors.&lt;ref name ="mitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mittler | first1 = Ron | year = 2006 | title = Abiotic stress, the field environment and stress combination | url = | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 15–19 | doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Abiotic stress comes in many forms.  The most common of the stressors are the easiest for people to identify, but there are many other, less recognizable abiotic stress factors which affect environments constantly.&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"&gt;Palta, Jiwan P. and Farag, Karim.  "Methohasds for enhancing plant health, protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stress related injuries and enhancing the recovery of plants injured as a result of such stresses."  United States Patent 7101828, September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most basic stressors include:  
* High [[winds]]&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;
* Extreme [[temperatures]]&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;
* [[Drought]]&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;
* [[Flood]]&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;
* Other natural disasters, such as [[tornado]]es and [[wildfires]].&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;

Lesser-known stressors generally occur on a smaller scale. They include: poor [[edaphic]] conditions like rock content and [[pH|pH levels]], high [[radiation]], compaction, contamination, and other, highly specific conditions like rapid [[tissue hydration|rehydration]] during [[seed germination]].&lt;ref name="Palta, Jiwan P 2006"/&gt;

==Effects==
Abiotic stress, as a natural part of every ecosystem, will affect organisms in a variety of ways.  Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have.  The higher the latitude of the area affected, the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area.  So, a [[taiga]] or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;Wolfe, A.  “Patterns of biodiversity.”  Ohio State University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
One example of  a situation where abiotic stress plays a constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires.  While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive.
Even though it is healthy for an ecosystem, a wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor, because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area.  Every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is a sign of the abiotic stress.  On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress.&lt;ref name="bruss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brussaard | first1 = Lijbert | last2 = de Ruiter | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Brown | first3 = George G. | year = 2007 | title = Soil biodiversity for agricultural sustainability | url = | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 121 | issue = | pages = 233–244 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way.  While a flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in a certain area, if there is rice there, it will thrive in the wet conditions.
Another example of this is in [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]].  The same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms.  They act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins, but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively, while the [[thermophilic]] zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature. The two may be living in the same environment, but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms.&lt;ref name = "vine"/&gt;

Lastly, abiotic stress has enabled species to grow, develop, and evolve, furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of a group of organisms.  Both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes.&lt;ref name="roel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roelofs | first1 = D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Functional ecological genomics to demonstrate general and specific responses to abiotic stress | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01312.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 8–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detriments===
The most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming.  It has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than 50% from their potential yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = W. | last2 = Vinocur | first2 = B. | last3 = Altman | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance | doi = 10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5 | journal = Planta | volume = 218 | issue = | pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because abiotic stress is widely considered a detrimental effect, the research on this branch of the issue is extensive. For more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress, see the sections below on plants and animals.

==In plants==
A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots.  If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.&lt;ref name="bruss"/&gt;

The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cramer|first=Grant R|last2=Urano|first2=Kaoru|last3=Delrot|first3=Serge|last4=Pezzotti|first4=Mario|last5=Shinozaki|first5=Kazuo|date=2011-11-17|year=|title=Effects of abiotic stress on plants: a systems biology perspective|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=11|pages=163|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-11-163|issn=1471-2229|pmc=3252258|pmid=22094046|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell.  High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions.  Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conde|first=Artur|year=2011|title=Membrane Transport, Sensing and Signaling in Plant Adaptation to Environmental Stress|url=http://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pcp/52/9/10.1093/pcp/pcr107/2/pcr107.pdf?Expires=1485797994&amp;Signature=Cemd6gLc-NOAT39G3-6uNqRUU6r97KGEAOyCNNn2uYjNVPelfxGYMUDxK660bIU6Afj6fNwTfB9pXf9DgOcCqz5CJOjC-bL3H19H1eFUe0Wsid8jnH9J4k30SaaF-arCEmbLrBsTJrWkrsq84THqi0ervfu-4hd~5arrd-ytItFSqkXje1frT3zWxJoosf3~Asfs-5qt50yGImSOXHjVk2LNgZeyD5FKqt7KZReojKLjZnZIUsdHLnDBD4RjF24ezB3mbbNtz8kq60eoiVUFMWlJhkYoD7NYwijrartby2612WMmS1vkKnZ3bT5emRl9qe8trQJarCUlQEKUYp6MDA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q|journal=Plant &amp; Cell Physiology|volume=52 | issue = 9 |pages=1583–1602|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcr107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment.  It is how plants work together.  In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well.  This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestre | first1 = Fernando T. | last2 = Cortina | first2 = Jordi | last3 = Bautista | first3 = Susana | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus halepensis and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation | doi = 10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03990.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 776–786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area.  When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely.  Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.&lt;ref name ="mitt"/&gt;

Rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]'') is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India.  Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied among several rice varieties with different genotypes using molecular markers.

Serpentine soils (media with low concentrations of nutrients and high concentrations of heavy metals) can be a source of abiotic stress. Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Palm, Brady |author2=Van Volkenburgh|date=2012|title=Serpentine tolerance in Mimuslus guttatus does not rely on exclusion of magnesium|url=|journal=Functional Plant Biology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savvides|first=Andreas|date=December 15, 2015|title=Chemical Priming of Plants Against Multiple Abiotic Stresses: Mission Possible?|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/abstract/S1360-1385(15)00283-6|journal=Trends in Plant Science|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2015.11.003|pmid=|access-date=March 10, 2016|hdl=10754/596020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salt stress in plants ===

Proceedings of the international salinity forum, Riverside, California, April 2005, 311–313.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the phenomenon threatens 19.5% of the world's irrigated agricultural land and 2.1% of the world's non-irrigated (dry-land) agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neto|first=Azevedo|last2=De|first2=André Dias|last3=Prisco|first3=José Tarquinio|last4=Enéas-Filho|first4=Joaquim|last5=Lacerda|first5=Claudivan Feitosa de|last6=Silva|first6=José Vieira|last7=Costa|first7=Paulo Henrique Alves da|last8=Gomes-Filho|first8=Enéas|date=2004-04-01|title=Effects of salt stress on plant growth, stomatal response and solute accumulation of different maize genotypes|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1677-04202004000100005&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=31–38|doi=10.1590/S1677-04202004000100005|issn=1677-0420}}&lt;/ref&gt; High [[soil salinity]] content can be harmful to plants because water-soluble salts can alter osmotic potential gradients and consequently inhibit many cellular functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, J.-K. (2001). Plant Salt Stress. eLS.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, high soil salinity content can inhibit the process of photosynthesis by limiting a plant's water uptake; high levels of water-soluble salts in the soil can decrease the osmotic potential of the soil and consequently decrease the difference in water potential between the soil and the plant's roots, thereby limiting electron flow from H2O to P680 in Photosystem II's reaction center.&lt;ref&gt;Lu. Congming, A. Vonshak. (2002). Effects of salinity stress on photosystem II function in cyanobacterial Spirulina platensis cells. Physiol. Plant 114 405-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over generations, many plants have mutated and built different mechanisms to counter salinity effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A good combatant of salinity in plants is the hormone ethylene. Ethylene is known for regulating plant growth and development and dealing with stress conditions. Many central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and can limit plant growth. The effects of salinity has been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1, ERS2, ETR1, ETR2 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is used to suppress any sensitivity to the salt stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Gang|last2=Shen|first2=Ming|last3=Li|first3=Zhi-Gang|last4=Zhang|first4=Bo|last5=Duan|first5=Kai-Xuan|last6=Wang|first6=Ning|last7=Cao|first7=Yang-Rong|last8=Zhang|first8=Wan-Ke|last9=Ma|first9=Biao|date=2011-10-01|title=EIN2 regulates salt stress response and interacts with a MA3 domain-containing protein ECIP1 in Arabidopsis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x/abstract|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|language=en|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1678–1692|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x|issn=1365-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phosphate starvation in plants ===

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and development, but most of the world's soil is limited in this important plant nutrient. Plants can utilize P mainly in the form if soluble inorganic phosphate (Pi) but are subjected to abiotic stress of P-limitation when there is not sufficient soluble PO4 available in the soil. Phosphorus forms insoluble complexes with Ca and Mg in alkaline soils and Al and Fe in acidic soils that makes it unavailable for plant roots. When there is limited bioavailable P in the soil, plants show extensive abiotic stress phenotype such as short primary roots and more lateral roots and root hairs to make more surface available for Pi absorption, exudation of organic acids and phosphatase to release Pi from complex P containing molecules and make it available for growing plants organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raghothama|first=K.

=== Drought Stress ===
Drought stress is one of the main causes of crop loss within the agricultural world. This is due to water's necessity in so many fundamental processes in plant growth.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González-Villagra|first=Jorge|last2=Rodrigues-Salvador|first2=Acácio|last3=Nunes-Nesi|first3=Adriano|last4=Cohen|first4=Jerry D.|last5=Reyes-Díaz|first5=Marjorie M.|date=March 2018|title=Age-related mechanism and its relationship with secondary metabolism and abscisic acid in  Aristotelia chilensis  plants subjected to drought stress|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.01.010|journal=Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|volume=124|pages=136–145|doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.01.010|issn=0981-9428}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become especially important in recent years to find a way to combat drought stress. A decrease in precipitation and subsequent increase in drought are extremely likely in the future due to an increase in global warming.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Plants have come up with many mechanisms and adaptations to try and deal with drought stress. One of the leading ways that plants combat drought stress is by closing their stomates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-20|title=Stoma|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stoma&amp;oldid=837425367|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key hormone regulating stomatal opening and closing is abscisic acid (ABA). Synthesis of ABA causes the ABA to bind to receptors. This binding then effects the opening of ion channels thereby decreasing turgor pressure in the stomata and causing them to close. Recent studies, by Gonzalez-Villagra, et al., showed how ABA levels increased in drought-stressed plants (2018). They showed that when plants were placed in a stressful situation they produced more ABA to try and conserve any water they had in their leaves.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  Another extremely important factor in dealing with drought stress and regulating the uptake and export of water is aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that make up channels. These channel's main job is the transport of water and other necessary solutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-10|title=Aquaporin|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aquaporin&amp;oldid=829746247|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; AQPs are both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally regulated by many different factors such as ABA, GA3, pH and Ca2+ and the specific levels of AQPs in certain parts of the plant, such as roots or leaves, helps to draw as much water into the plant as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zargar|first=Sajad Majeed|last2=Nagar|first2=Preeti|last3=Deshmukh|first3=Rupesh|last4=Nazir|first4=Muslima|last5=Wani|first5=Aijaz Ahmad|last6=Masoodi|first6=Khalid Zaffar|last7=Agrawal|first7=Ganesh Kumar|last8=Rakwal|first8=Randeep|date=October 2017|title=Aquaporins as potential drought tolerance inducing proteins: Towards instigating stress tolerance|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2017.04.010|journal=Journal of Proteomics|volume=169|pages=233–238|doi=10.1016/j.jprot.2017.04.010|issn=1874-3919}}&lt;/ref&gt; By understanding both the mechanism of AQPs and the hormone ABA, scientists will be better able to produce drought resistant plants in the future.

One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of "memory". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tombesi|first=Sergio|last2=Frioni|first2=Tommaso|last3=Poni|first3=Stefano|last4=Palliotti|first4=Alberto|date=June 2018|title=Effect of water stress "memory" on plant behavior during subsequent drought stress|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.03.009|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=150|pages=106–114|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.03.009|issn=0098-8472}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called "hydraulic safety margin" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In animals==
For animals, the most stressful of all the abiotic stressors is [[heat]].  This is because many species are unable to regulate their internal [[body temperature]].  Even in the species that are able to regulate their own [[temperature]], it is not always a completely accurate system.  Temperature determines [[metabolic rate]]s, [[heart rate]]s, and other very important factors within the bodies of animals, so an extreme temperature change can easily distress the animal's body.  Animals can respond to extreme heat, for example, through natural heat acclimation or by burrowing into the ground to find a cooler space.&lt;ref name="roel"/&gt;

It is also possible to see in animals that a high genetic diversity is beneficial in providing resiliency against harsh abiotic stressors.  This acts as a sort of stock room when a species is plagued by the perils of natural selection.  A variety of galling insects are among the most specialized and diverse herbivores on the planet, and their extensive protections against abiotic stress factors have helped the insect in gaining that position of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goncalves-Alvim | first1 = Silmary J. | last2 = Fernandez | first2 = G. Wilson | year = 2001 | title = Biodiversity of galling insects: historical, community and habitat effects in four neotropical savannas | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 79–98 | doi=10.1023/a:1016602213305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In endangered species==
[[Biodiversity]] is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress.  If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low.  If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.&lt;ref name="bruss"/&gt;

This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related.  It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases.&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt;  This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''Abortion in Paraguay''' is illegal except in case of the threat to the life of the woman.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/paraguay.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who performs an abortion can be sentenced to 15 to 30 months in prison. If the abortion is done without the consent of the woman, the punishment is increased to 2 to 5 years. If the death of the woman occurred as a result of the abortion, the person who did the procedure can be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison, and 5 to 10 years in cases in which she did not consent.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In Paraguay, 23 out of 100 deaths of young women are the result of illegal abortions.&lt;ref name="scienceblog.com"&gt;http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/L/1996/A/un960090.html&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning this death rate, Paraguay has one of the highest in the region.&lt;ref name="scienceblog.com"/&gt;

In April 2015, a story about a 10-year-old Paraguayan girl who was 22 weeks pregnant as a result of having allegedly been raped and impregnated by her stepfather came to light.&lt;ref name="Washingtonpost.com"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/14/denied-an-abortion-11-year-old-rape-victim-in-paraguay-gives-birth/&lt;/ref&gt; The pregnancy had been discovered that same month upon the girl’s mother having brought her to a local hospital in order to receive medical treatment for abdominal pain, which was found to have been related to the pregnancy. Calls from her mother as well as outraged members of the public throughout the world for permission to allow the girl the ability to undergo an abortion procedure were ultimately denied. The girl had given birth to the child via a caesarean section in a Red Cross hospital in Paraguay’s capital city of Asunción later that year.&lt;ref name="Washingtonpost.com"/&gt; The girl’s stepfather has since been prosecuted for the rape and her mother had also been charged with negligence for her alleged role in the circumstances surrounding the rape and pregnancy of her daughter. The high-profile nature of this case has led opposition leftist parties to push for less restrictive abortion laws in Paraguay, such as in cases of child pregnancies and in cases of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Despite these efforts and the international attention, current government officials have neglected to support or act on any proposed changes to Paraguayan abortion law. Following this case, Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes instead attempted to justify denying the 10-year-old legal access to an abortion, arguing that, “We did what our conscience dictated, what the Constitution commands, and what our religious convictions command”.&lt;ref name="www.lifesitenews.com"&gt;https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/paraguay-president-refuses-to-decriminalize-abortion&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has found that the maternal death rate is four times higher for girls under the age of 16 in Latin America.&lt;ref name="Washingtonpost.com"/&gt; The 10-year-old girl has reportedly survived the birth, and her mother and grandmother have both requested legal custody of the newborn child.&lt;ref name="Washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

'''Accredited social health activists''' ('''ASHAs''') are [[community health worker]]s instituted by the [[government of India]]'s [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] (MoHFW) as a part of the [[National Rural Health Mission]] (NRHM).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] (MoHFW) |date=2005 |title=ASHA |url=http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/asha.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422204352/http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/asha.htm |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission began in 2005; full implementation was targeted for 2012. Once fully implemented, there is to be "an ASHA in every village" in India, a target that translates into 250,000 ASHAs in 10 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/NRHM%20Mission%20Document.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|MoHFW]] |title=National Rural Health Mission 2005–2012: Mission Document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612060846/http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/NRHM%20Mission%20Document.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand total number of ASHAs in India was reported in July 2013 to be 870,089.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nhsrcindia.org |publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|MoHFW]] |title=Update on the ASHA programme |date=July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 859,331 ASHAs in 32 states and union territories as per the data provided by the states in December 2014. This excludes data from the states of Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Puducherry, and Chandigarh, since the selection of ASHA is under way in these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Update on the ASHA programme |publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.]] |date=January 2015 |url=http://ashavani.org/images/docs/Update-on-ASHA-Programme-January-2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and responsibilities==

ASHAs are local women trained to act as health educators and promoters in their communities. The Indian MoHFW describes them as:&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Health and Family Welfare. (2005) “Frequently Asked Questions on ASHA.” Government of India. Accessed April 23, 2007, from http://www.nihfw.org/ndc-nihfw/UploadedDocs/FrequentlyAskedQuestionsASHA.doc+accredited+social+health+activist&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
...health activist(s) in the community who will create awareness on health and its social determinants and mobilize the community towards local health planning and increased utilization and accountability of the existing health services.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Their tasks include motivating women to give birth in hospitals, bringing children to immunization clinics, encouraging family planning (e.g., surgical sterilization), treating basic illness and injury with first aid, keeping demographic records, and improving village sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). (2005c). ASHA.. Government of India. Accessed July 20, 2008, from {{cite web |url=http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/asha.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422204352/http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/asha.htm |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHAs are also meant to serve as a key communication mechanism between the healthcare system and rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).

Accessed July 1, 2008, from {{cite web|url=http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/NRHM%20Mission%20Document.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612060846/http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/NRHM%20Mission%20Document.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She will act as a depot holder for essential provisions being made available to all habitations like Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORS), Iron Folic Acid Tablet(IFA), chloroquine, Disposable Delivery Kits (DDK), Oral Pills &amp; Condoms, etc. from https://web.archive.org/web/20150708120224/http://nrhm.gov.in/communitisation/asha/about-asha.html

==Selection==

ASHAs must primarily be female residents of the village that they have been selected to serve, who are likely to remain in that village for the foreseeable future. Married, widowed or divorced women are preferred over women who have yet to marry since Indian cultural norms dictate that upon marriage a woman leaves her village and migrates to that of her husband. ASHAs preference for selection is they must have qualified up to the tenth grade, preferably be between the ages of 25 and 45, and are selected by and accountable to the [[gram panchayat]] (local government). If there is no suitable literate candidate, these criteria may be relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhm.gov.in/communitisation/asha/about-asha.html|title=About ASHA - Government of India|website=nhm.gov.in|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remuneration==
Although ASHAs are considered volunteers, they receive outcome-based remuneration and financial compensation for training days. For example, if an ASHA facilitates an institutional delivery she receives {{INRConvert|600}} and the mother receives {{INRConvert|1400}}. ASHAs also receive {{INRConvert|150}} for each child completing an immunization session and {{INRConvert|150}} for each individual who undergoes family planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] (MoHFW) |date=2005 |title=Reading Material for ASHA |url=http://mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/Module%201-%20Ring%201%20ASHA%20Reading%20Material%5B1%5D.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027115503/http://www.mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Documents/Module%201-%20Ring%201%20ASHA%20Reading%20Material%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=27 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHAs are expected to attend a Wednesday meeting at the local primary health centre (PHC); beyond this requirement, the time ASHAs spend on their CHW tasks is relatively flexible.

==Monitoring and Evaluation under National Rural Health Mission==
A baseline survey is to be taken at the district level. It is for fixing decentralized monitoring goals and indicators. The community monitoring would be at the village level.

'''Sir Alexander Haddow''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (1907-1976) was a Scottish physician and pathologist at the forefront of cancer research in the 1940s. He served as Director of the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] from 1946 to 1969. He was also President of the Universal Union Against Cancer.

His most important discovery was the '''Haddow Effect''', by which a carcinogenic compound can be used to arrest a cancer whose origin is an unrelated carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.wellcome.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(AltRefNo=%27pp/had%27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born on 18 January 1907 in [[Leven, Fife]] the eldest son of William Haddow (d.1928) of Newharthill in [[Glasgow]] and his wife, Margaret Docherty. His father and grandfather were coal-miners. The family moved to [[Broxburn, West Lothian]] where his father ran a small bar and hotel. Alexander fell very ill with [[scarlet fever]] aged ten and remained frail and introverted thereafter and at the age of 11 also suffered from appendicitis. He was much impressed by the family GP, Dr Alexander Scott, who treated him on both occasions and who became his role model. Dr Scott was known for his studies of skin cancers in the local mining population. 

Alexander was educated at Broxburn High School then [[Broxburn Academy]], winning the Dux Medal in the latter, and then studied medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] from 1924, graduating MB ChB in 1929. He went on to assist Prof [[Thomas Jones Mackie]] as a Houseman at [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]], also lecturing in bacteriology at the university, where he became a full Lecturer in 1932. The university granted him two doctorates (PhD 1937 and MD 1938).&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.wellcome.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(AltRefNo=%27pp/had%27)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he moved to [[London]] to join [[Ernest Kennaway]]'s team at the [[Royal Cancer Hospital]]. In 1946 he succeeded Kennaway as Director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute, later renamed the [[Institute of Cancer Research]].

In 1958 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] and in 1961 was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], where his proposers were [[Alan William Greenwood]], [[Robert Cruikshank]], [[Richard Swain]] and [[George Lightbody Montgomery]]. He was knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 he retired to [[Chalfont St Giles]]. By this time he was almost totally blind due to [[diabetes]], which also cost him the loss of his limbs.&lt;ref&gt;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/37/5/1584.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at [[Amersham]]  General Hospital on 21 January 1976 and was cremated.

==Family==

He married twice: firstly in 1932 to Lucia Lindsay Crosby Black (d.1968); secondly in 1970 to Feo Standing, a scientific photographer.
He had one son by his first marriage, William George Haddow (b.1934).  He had two step-children with his second marriage.

The '''Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988''' ({{USStatute|100|690|102|4181|1988|11|18}}, {{USBill|100|HR|5210}}) is a major law of the so-called "[[War on Drugs]]" passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] which did two significant things:
# Created the policy goal of a drug-free America; and
# Established the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/authorization-language |title=Authorizing Legislation |website=Authorizations Language |publisher=U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from the Act of 1986 to the Act of 1988 concerns the mandatory minimum penalties to drug trafficking conspiracies and attempts that previously were applicable only to substantive completed drug trafficking offenses.  The Act amended 21 U.S.C. 844 to make crack cocaine the only drug with a mandatory minimum penalty for a first offense of simple possession.  The Act made possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison.  The five year minimum penalty also applies to possession of more than three grams of cocaine base if the defendant has a prior conviction for crack cocaine possession, and to possession of more than one gram of crack if the defendant has two or more prior crack possession convictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ussc.gov/report-cocaine-and-federal-sentencing-policy-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 also offers several other amendments to the Act of 1986.  First, the organization and coordination of Federal drug control efforts.  Next, the reduction of drug demand through increased treatment and prevention efforts. Also, the reduction of illicit drug trafficking and production abroad. Lastly, sanctions designed to place added pressure on the drug user.  The ADAA projected budget for these amendments was $6.5 billion for the 1989 fiscal year”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=143053&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was not foreseen.  “After spending billions of dollars on law enforcement, doubling the number of arrests and incarcerations, and building prisons at a record pace, the system has failed to decrease the level of drug-related crime. Placing people in jail at increasing rates has had little long-term effect on the levels of crime”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217035034/http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H.R. 5210 [[legislation]] was passed by the 100th U.S. Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 18, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=35182 |title=Ronald Reagan: "Remarks on Signing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 ," November 18, 1988 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media campaign mentioned in the act later became the [[National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign]].

'''''Peumus boldus''''', the only [[species]] in the [[genus]] '''''Peumus''''', is commonly known as '''boldo''' (from the [[Mapudungun]] name '''''foḻo'''''). This tree of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Monimiaceae]] is natively [[endemism|endemic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innerpath.com.au/matmed/herbs/Peumus_boldus.htm|title=Peumus boldus, Peumus bolod, Boldo -Western-|last=Coop|first=Paul|website=www.innerpath.com.au|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} to the central region of [[Chile]], occurring from [[33rd parallel south|33°]] to [[40th parallel south|40° southern latitude]]. Boldo has also been introduced to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], though it is not often seen outside [[botanical garden]]s.

Together with ''litre'', [[Soap bark tree|''quillay'']], ''peumo'', ''bollén'' and other indigenous plants, it is a characteristic component of the [[sclerophyllous]] forest [[endemism|endemic]] to central Chile.  Its leaves, which have a strong, woody and slightly bitter flavor and [[camphor]]-like aroma, are used for culinary purposes, primarily in Latin America.  The leaves are used in a similar manner to [[bay leaf|bay leaves]] and also used as an [[herbal tea]], primarily in [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], [[Brazil]] and bordering countries in [[South America]].

==Growth==
Although not well known, boldo fruits, which appear between December and February, are very tasty, nutritious, small, green, edible spheres. Boldo's assertive flavor comes primarily from the presence of the chemical [[ascaridole]], which is also present in the ''[[epazote]]'' plant.

==Uses==
In Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay boldo is mixed with ''[[yerba mate]]'' or other teas to moderate its flavor. Some families keep a boldo plant at home for this purpose, although boldo [[teabag]]s are readily available in nearly all supermarkets.

Boldo and plants with similar properties are widely used as mild [[folk medicine]] in various South American countries in both urban and rural areas, even among people who do not usually drink [[herbal tea]]s other than [[yerba mate|mate beverage]]. Boldo is officially listed as phytotherapic plant as [[cholagogue]] and [[choleretic]], for treatment of mild [[dyspepsia]] in Brazilian [[pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária). 2011 [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/hotsite/farmacopeiabrasileira/conteudo/Formulario_de_Fitoterapicos_da_Farmacopeia_Brasileira.pdf  Formulario de Fitoterapicos da Farmacopeia Brasileira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002129/http://www.anvisa.gov.br/hotsite/farmacopeiabrasileira/conteudo/Formulario_de_Fitoterapicos_da_Farmacopeia_Brasileira.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}. Brasilia, Governo Federal do Brasil.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boldo is in the family [[Monimiaceae]], which is closely related to the family [[Lauraceae]] (which includes many other plants used for their aromatic leaves, such as [[cinnamon]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[bay laurel|bay leaf]], and [[Camphor Laurel|camphor laurel]].)

==Toxicity==
[[File:Boldine.svg|thumb|right|[[Boldine]]]]
In 2009, the European Medicines Agency assessed boldo as follows:

Boldo leaf contains the alkaloid [[boldine]]. Boldo leaf also contains 2-4% of volatile oil. Major constituents reported as: [[ascaridole]] (16-38%), [[1,8-cineole]] (11-39%) and [[p-Cymene]] (9-29%).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Ascaridole is highly toxic, and this raises concerns about the suitability of boldo leaf in traditional herbal medicinal products.

[[Abortifacient]] and [[teratogenic]] effects in rats were observed with very high doses (800&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) of a dry [[ethanolic]] extract of boldine in the first days of pregnancy, not present at lower doses.&lt;ref name="EMA2009"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Herbal_-_HMPC_assessment_report/2009/12/WC500018102.pdf | format = pdf | title = Assessment Report on ''Peumus boldus'' Molina, Folium | id = Doc. Ref.: EMEA/HMPC/591131/2007 | author = Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) | publisher = European Medicines Agency | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most investigations have been carried out using boldine. Limited information is available on herbal preparations of boldo leaf and where studies have been reported, details of the preparations are usually lacking. There are no reported genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies with herbal preparations of boldo leaf.

Boldo oil should not be used internally or externally. Where boldo leaf is used, the total exposure to ascaridole should be considered from a safety standpoint. The levels of ascaridole in herbal medicinal products should be quantified. In view of the low solubility of ascaridole in water the use of aqueous extracts including herbal teas could be accepted.{{medcn|date=May 2017}} The use of ethanolic extracts of boldo leaf is not considered acceptable for traditional herbal medicinal products in view of the potentially higher levels of the toxic ascaridole constituent.&lt;ref name="EMA2009" /&gt;

The '''British Society of Clinical Hypnosis''' (BSCH) is an organization composed of professional [[Hypnotherapy|hypnotherapists]].

The main objective the BSCH is to establish standards of training and ethical practice regarding the use of [[hypnosis]] and [[hypnotherapy]]; within the [[United Kingdom]] there are (2010) currently no statutory regulations regarding hypnosis. The society was created in the early 1980s and was originally called the Association of Clinical Hypnotherapists. This name was subsequently changed to the British Society of Clinical Hypnotherapists, until finally becoming the British Society of Clinical Hypnosis in 1996.

It is a non-profit organisation. Though predominantly a UK-based organisation, the society has members in several Commonwealth countries, particularly Malaysia and Singapore, but also members in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa as well as other EU countries including the Republic of Ireland, Portugal, France, Germany and Italy.

The society maintains a searchable database [http://www.hypnosisdatabase.co.uk] of therapists qualified to society standards and a helpline, which is open during office hours.

'''Edith Hirsch Luchins''' (21 December 1921 [[Brzeziny]], [[Poland]] – 18 November 2002 [[Suffern, New York]]) was a Polish-American [[mathematician]]. Her work focused on applying mathematical principles to problems in the philosophy of science and psychology, most notably in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gestalttheory.net/people/EHLuchins.html|title=Edith H. Luchins - eminent Gestalt psychologist and mathematician|website=gestalttheory.net|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Luchins and Luchins' Water Jar Experiment]] is named after her and psychologist [[Abraham S. Luchins]].

==Early life and education==
Edith Hirsch was born in 1921 in [[Poland]]. She emigrated to the United States at age six, settling with her family in [[New York City]]. In high school Hirsch excelled at mathematics, tutoring other students and assisting teachers with grading.  She earned her B.A from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1942 and her M.A. from [[NYU]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Luchins.html|title=Luchins biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She obtained her Ph.D. from [[University of Oregon]] in 1957 with her dissertation "''On Some Properties of Certain Banach Algebras."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=12487|title=Edith Luchins - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|website=www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1942 to 1943, Luchins worked for the government as an inspector of anti-aircraft equipment at [[Sperry Gyroscope]] during [[World War II]]. Luchins began her doctoral studies at NYU under [[Kurt Friedrichs]] and [[Richard Courant]] as she began her teaching career at [[Brooklyn College]]. She put her formal studies on hold for several years for personal reasons; however, she continued to conduct research and publish papers in educational mathematics alongside her academic husband.

After obtaining her doctorate in 1957, Luchins again pursued teaching, teaching for four years at the [[University of Miami]] before being appointed as an associate professor at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic]] in 1962. In 1970, she became the first female full professor at Rensselaer, where she remained until her retirement in 1992. Luchins remained active in research until her death.

Luchins was a member  of the [[Mathematical Association of America]], the [[American Mathematical Society]], the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], the [[American Education Research Association]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/702118874|title=American women of science since 1900|last=1968-|first=Wayne, Tiffany K.,|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841596|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=702118874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Achievements==
Luchins' success in teaching and advising students was recognized throughout her career by the Rensselaer Distinguished Teaching Award, the Darrin Counseling Award, the Martin Luther King Jr Award, and the Rensselaer Alumni Association Outstanding Faculty Award. In 1998, Luchins accepted an honorary membership in the [[Society for Gestalt Theory and its Applications]].

==Personal life==
In 1942 she married Abraham Luchins, an [[educational psychologist]].&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Tiffany K.|title=American women of science since 1900|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9781598841589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had five children together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15083">'''Enzyte''' is an herbal [[nutritional supplement]] originally manufactured by Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals.  The marketing of Enzyte resulted in a conviction and prison term for the company's owner and bankruptcy of the company. The product is now marketed by Vianda, LLC of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The manufacturer has claimed that Enzyte promotes "natural [[male enhancement]]," which is a [[euphemism]] for enhancing erectile function. However, its effectiveness has been called into doubt and the claims of the manufacturer have been under scrutiny from various state and federal organizations. Kenneth Goldberg, medical director of the Male Health Center at [[Baylor University]], says, "It makes no sense medically. There's no way that increasing blood flow to the penis, as Enzyte claims to do, will actually increase its size."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-04-18-enzyte.htm |title=Why is this man smiling |publisher=''[[USAToday]]'' |date=2002-04-18 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, following thousands of consumer complaints to the [[Better Business Bureau]], federal agents raided Berkeley facilities, gathering material that resulted in a 112-count [[indictment|criminal indictment]]. The company's founder and CEO, Steven M Warshak and his mother, Harriet Warshak, were found guilty of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[mail fraud]], [[bank fraud]], and [[money laundering]], and in September 2008 they were sentenced to prison and ordered to forfeit $500&amp;nbsp;million in assets.&lt;ref name="McKee"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convictions and fines forced the company into [[bankruptcy]], and in December 2008 its assets were sold for $2.75&amp;nbsp;million to investment company Pristine Bay, which continued operations.&lt;ref name="Pristine"&gt;[http://nutrition-de.com/progain-350-und-testinate-250/ "Testinate 250, ultimate testosterone booster" - January 15, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106143203/http://nutrition-de.com/progain-350-und-testinate-250/ |date=January 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzyte is widely advertised on U.S. television as "the once daily tablet for natural male enhancement." The commercials feature a character known as "Smilin' Bob," acted out by Canadian actor Andrew Olcott, who, in the commercials, always wears a smile that is implied to be caused by the enhancing effects of Enzyte; these advertisements feature [[double entendre]]s. Some such commercials also feature an equally smiling "Mrs. Bob." (Olcott, who was married and a father in real life, was also a visual artist, and he later owned and operated a small advertising firm.)

Because Enzyte is an herbal product, no testing is required by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]. An official of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] division that monitors advertising says the lack of scientific testing is "a red flag right away. There's no science behind these claims."&lt;ref name="Newsday"/&gt; The company has conceded that it has no scientific studies that substantiate any of its Enzyte claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43388-2004Sep22.html |title=TV Ads for Sex Supplement Challenged |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2004-09-23|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ira Sharlip, a spokesman for the [[American Urological Association]], has said, "There is no such thing as a penis pill that works. These are all things that are sold for profit. There's no science or substance behind them."&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/345405781.html?dids=345405781:345405781&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+10%2C+2003&amp;author=Dawn+Wotapka.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;desc=%27No+Science%27+Behind+Male+Pill%27s+Claims+%2F+Best+bet%3F+Deal+with+it&amp;pqatl=google 'No Science' Behind Male Pill's Claims / Best bet?

==Ingredients==
Enzyte's formulation was reportedly developed for Vianda by Marilyn Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barrett | first = Marilyn | title = Providing a Scientific Foundation for Herbal Medicine | publisher = Pharmacognosy.com | year = 2015 | url = http://pharmacognosy.com | accessdate = 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzyte is said to contain:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Supplements | first = Vianda | title = Enzyte - Official Enzyte 24/7, male enhancement and performance leader from Vianda | publisher = ViandaLife.com | year = 2015 | url = http://viandalife.com/prod-mens-enzyte-247.aspx#tabsINGREDIENTS | accessdate = 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asian Ginseng Root Extract
* Grape Seed Extract
* ''[[Epimedium]]'' (Horny Goat Weed)
* [[Zinc oxide]]
* [[Muira puama]]
* ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]''
* [[Niacin]]
* [[Copper]]

Most of the above ingredients are commonly available as [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] herbal or dietary supplements, and most have anecdotal reports, but marginal or unproven scientific evidence, of efficacy on various systems in the human body. Several of the herbal ingredients are included only in very low quantities.

One notable ingredient, [[yohimbe]], was included in the original formulation of Enzyte, produced until at least 2004; however, as yohimbe's legal status in Canada is unclear, Enzyte produced after 2004 no longer contains yohimbe extract.

Additionally, zinc is an ingredient in Enzyte. Some men who have low zinc levels in their body have had success using zinc supplements to treat erection problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rhodes |first=Monica |title=Erection Problems (Erectile Dysfunction) |publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center |year=2006 |url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/healthwise/article.html?hwid=hw112768 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823234649/http://www.med.nyu.edu/healthwise/article.html?hwid=hw112768 |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Currently, the effectiveness of Enzyte is unproven.

A civil lawsuit alleged Enzyte does not work as advertised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hagens-berman.com/files/enzytefaq1090006698639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite manufacturer claims that Enzyte will increase penis size, girth, and firmness and improve sexual performance, there exists no scientific evidence that Enzyte is capable of making good on these claims. In fact, Enzyte has never been scientifically tested by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] or other independent third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casewatch.org/cp/enzytecmp.pdf |title=Enzyte Complaint - Final Version (00009634.DOC;1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Enzyte is required by current U.S. law to be marketed as an [[herbal supplement]] and may not legally be called a drug. In keeping with FTC rulings, Enzyte is not allowed to claim these benefits in its advertising. However, as of June 2010, TV commercials for the product still use the phrase "natural male enhancement."

== Federal indictment and trial==
Thousands of consumer complaints were made to the [[Better Business Bureau]] about the company's business practices, especially the "autoship" program that repeatedly charged customers' credit cards for refills even after they canceled their orders. Federal agents raided Berkeley facilities in March 2005, gathering material that led to criminal charges. On September 21, 2006, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals; its owner and president, Steve Warshak; and five other individuals were indicted by the United States, Southern District of Ohio, U.S. Attorney Greg Lockhart, on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[money laundering]], and [[Mail fraud|mail]], wire, and bank fraud. The indictment alleged that the company defrauded consumers and banks of [[United States dollar|US$]]100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="McKee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxIndict"&gt;{{cite news |title='Natural Male Enhancement' Company Owner Indicted on Fraud, Other Charges |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215087,00.html?sPage=fnc.national/crime |work=FOXNews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], and other agencies participated in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In testimony during the trial, a former executive with Berkeley testified that the enhancements the company claimed were achieved by use of Enzyte were fabricated, and the company defrauded customers by continuing to charge them for additional shipments of the supplement. He further testified that company employees were instructed to make it as difficult as possible for unhappy customers to receive refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Conviction and sentencing ===
On February 22, 2008, Steven 
Warshak was found guilty of 93 counts of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering. On August 27, 2008, he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Arthur Spiegel to 25&amp;nbsp;years in prison and ordered to pay $93,000 in fines. Warshak was an inmate at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Elkton|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Elkton, Ohio]]. His company, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals, along with other defendants, was ordered to forfeit $500&amp;nbsp;million. His 75-year-old mother, Harriet Warshak, was sentenced to two years in prison&lt;ref&gt;New York Times "Ohio company owner gets 25&amp;nbsp;years in fraud case." https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Enzyte-Maker-Sentencing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Kinney |title=Ohio company owner gets 25 years in fraud case |work= |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but released on bond pending appeal after turning over her house, bank accounts, and other assets related to her crimes.&lt;ref name=grandmother&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2009/07/22/Smilin-Bob-grandmother-avoids-jail/UPI-82631248302461/ |title='Smilin' Bob' grandmother avoids jail |publisher=Upi.com |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Steven and Harriet Warshak appealed their convictions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in ''[[United States v. Warshak]]'' (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010) 631 F.3d 266, upheld Steven Warshak's convictions and all convictions against Harriet Warshak except for money laundering and vacated their sentences, remanding the sentencing to the lower court.

On September 21, 2011, Steven Warshak's sentence was reduced from 25 years to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[Warshak's 25-year sentence cut to 10 - Cincinnati.com http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20110920/NEWS010702/109210332/Warshak-s-25-year-sentence-cut-10]&lt;/ref&gt; With credit for time served, he could be out in five years. His mother's sentence was reduced from two years to one day, and she never served any time in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communitypress.cincinnati.com/article/AB/20110914/NEWS010702/109150312/Warshak-s-mom-has-sentence-cut-1-day Warshak's mom has sentence reduced - Cincinnati.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Factors in reducing the sentence were that the amount of total loss by customers may have been less than $400 million and that the sentences of co-defendants were only two years. Warshak was released from prison on June 14, 2017 according to the Federal Prison Inmate Locator system.

==Continued company operation==
The Warshaks' convictions and fines forced the company into [[bankruptcy]]. In December 2008, its assets were acquired from bankruptcy court for $2.75&amp;nbsp;million by investment company Pristine Bay, which is affiliated with Cincinnati developer Chuck Kubicki. Kubicki said he wanted to save the jobs of the company's 200&amp;nbsp;employees and retain a major tenant in one of his properties in suburban Cincinnati at [[Forest Park, Ohio]]. He said he would change the company name but would keep the brand.&lt;ref name="Pristine"/&gt; In March 2009, Hamilton County commissioners unanimously voted to give a $195,000 property tax break to the company based on projected jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[County gives 'Smilin Bob' tax break http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090325/NEWS0108/303250061/-1/today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Tax breaks keep Berkeley in Forest Park http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/03/23/daily34.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, the company name was changed to Vianda LLC. In a press release, the company announced plans to expand, hiring as many as 400 additional workers.&lt;ref name="Vianda"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|last=Bernard-Kuhn|first=Lisa|date=2009-06-27|title=Enzyte firm changes name, adding jobs|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20090626/BIZ01/906270333/Enzyte+firm+changes+name}} Link Missing/Removal&lt;/ref&gt; On December&amp;nbsp;14, 2009, Cincinnati Business Courier reported employment of 180, revision of sales projections of 400% growth to $120&amp;nbsp;million downward to an estimated 33% growth to $40&amp;nbsp;million, management team changes, and continued customer complaints of improper billing.&lt;ref&gt;[Cincinnati's Chuck Kubicki juggles lineup at Vianda http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/12/14/story1.html?page=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">An '''Exposure Action Value''' ('''EAV''') or '''Action Value''' ('''AV''') is a limit set on occupational exposure to noise where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels.  These levels are measured in [[decibels]].  The American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) set the EAV to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective [[hearing conservation program]].  The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the EAV is to ensure that employees are not suffering from high levels of noise exposure.  OSHA requires employers to take steps to reduce exposure levels when the TWA reaches 90 dB(A).  The EAV is to ensure that the exposure levels do not reach 90 dB(A) or more.  It is also to ensure that employees are not experiencing [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

== Use ==
A [[noise dosimeter]] is used to measure noise exposures to employees.  Dosimeters can be used to determine the TWA.  If it is determined that levels of noise exposure have reached the EAV, employers are required to implement a hearing conservation program.  The hearing conservation program consists of many different aspects.

The first aspect is monitoring.  The employer is required to monitor noise exposure for all of its employees who may be exposed at a TWA at or above 85 dB(A).  This is to identify employees for inclusion in the hearing conservation program and to enable the proper selection of hearing protectors.

The second aspect is the audiometric testing program.  Employees exposed to levels at or above the EAV will undergo audiometric testing.  The first test is called a baseline.  It provides a standard to compare future audiometric tests to.  If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard threshold shift) greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure.

The third aspect is the implementation of hearing protection.  Employers must make hearing protection available to all employees who are exposed to noise levels of 85 dB(A) or greater.  This is to be at no cost to employees.  Employees can pick whichever type of hearing protection they prefer.  This also requires an ongoing evaluation of the hearing protection.

The fourth aspect is a training program.  The training program must cover the effects of noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, and the purpose of audiometric testing.

The last aspect is record keeping.  Records of employee audiometric tests must be retained for two years.  This information must also be available to the employees.

== Vibration ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image: Hse-gov-uk-elv-values.JPG|thumb|550px|right|''EAV's'' and ''ELV's'' given by the Health and Safety Executive of the UK|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 6 September 2009}}]] --&gt;
Just like the Exposure Action Value or Action Value for noise, safety administrations across the world are publishing values for vibrations.  As of right now, The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not officially published a list of appropriate, time-weighted EAV guidelines for employers to follow.  However, companies in the United States are encouraged by the [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to follow the vibration limits set up by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]], which publishes a ''Threshold Limit Value'' or ''TLV'' in their annual book of TLVs and BEIs.  The goal is for employers to have these numbers in order to make a conscious effort to lower the amount of harmful exposure absorbed by their workers.  Since the link from physical vibration to damage caused by [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is less clearly defined between the EAV for noise and noise-induced hearing loss, an upper extreme limit ''Exposure Limit Value'' or ''ELV'' is provided as well to give a margin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1292">The '''Functional Approach''' is considered to be the second paradigm of psychology. This idea focuses on the function of the mental processes which involves consciousnesses. (Gordon, 1995) This approach was developed by William James in 1890. James was the first American Psychologist and wrote the first general textbook regarding psychology.  In this approach he reasoned that the mental act of consciousness must be an important biological function (Schacter et al., 2011) He also noted that it was a psychologist's job to understand these functions so they can discover how the mental process operates. This idea was an alternative approach to the structuralism, which was the first paradigm(Gordon, 1995). 

In second language acquisition (SLA) functional approaches are of similarities with Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG). Focus is on the use of language in real situations (performance), as well as underlying knowledge (competence).

'''GTx, Inc''' is a [[pharmaceutical company]] that is working on drugs in the [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM) and [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM) classes. Its drugs in development include [[enobosarm]] (ostarine) and [[GTx-758]].

The company was founded in Memphis in 1997 by Mitch Steiner and Marc S. Hanover.&lt;ref name=S1A/&gt;  The company was originally called Genotherapeutics, changed its name to GTx, Inc. in 2001, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2003.&lt;ref name=S1A&gt;{{cite web|title=GTX, INC. - FORM S-1/A|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1260990/000089161803006388/g85196a2sv1za.htm|publisher=Gtx via SEC Edgar|date=22 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company licensed [[toremifene]] from Orion Corporation, and licensed andarine, enobosarm and prostarine from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation; the SARM compounds from Tennessee had been invented by Karen Veverka and Michael Whitt and each later joined the company.&lt;ref name=S1A/&gt;  The company held its IPO in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pritchard|first1=Carolyn|title=GTX prices IPO of 5.4 mln shares at $14.50 each|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gtx-prices-ipo-of-54-mln-shares-at-1450-each|work=MarketWatch|date=2 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hennessey|first1=Raymond|title=With a Busy IPO Week Ahead,Mixed Reviews for 3 Offerings|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB107582803942119330|work=Wall Street Journal|date=4 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 GTx signed a partnership with [[Ipsen]] to develop toremifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulatorm to prevent prostate cancer and to prevent bone loss in men with prostate cancer; the FDA rejected the application to market the drug for this use in 2009, and Ipsen terminated the arrangement in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|title=GTx shares blitzed by FDA's toremifene rejection|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gtx-shares-blitzed-by-fda-s-toremifene-rejection|work=FierceBiotech|date=2 November 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|title=Ipsen bows out of troubled toremifene pact with GTx|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ipsen-bows-out-of-troubled-toremifene-pact-gtx|work=FierceBiotech|date=2 March 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 GTx sold its rights to toremifene to ProStrakan, a subsidiary of [[Kyowa Hakko Kirin]], for around $19 million, and terminated its agreement with Orion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: GTx Announces Sale of Fareston|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gtx-announces-sale-of-fareston%C2%AE|work=GTx via FierceBiotech|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007 enobosarm was in a Phase II trial, and that year Gtx signed an exclusive license agreement for its SARM program with Merck; Merck bought $30M in GtX stock, paid an upfront fee of $40M, and agreed to fund $15M in research over the next three years.  The agreement also included royalties on any product brought to market and around $400M in [[biodollars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagle|first1=Mike|title=Merck flexes muscle with GTx deal|url=https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2007/11/07/Merck-flexes-muscle-with-GTx-deal|work=Outsourcing Pharma|date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The companies ended the deal in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanekamp|first1=Kelsey|title=Merck And GTx Go Their Separate Ways|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/15/gtx-merck-pharma-markets-equities-drug-trial.html#14c838625e4b|work=Forbes|date=15 March 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 GTx began Phase II trials, to see if enosobarm might be effective to treat stress uninary incontinence in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GTx begins Phase II trial of enobosarm to treat women with stress urinary incontinence - Drug Development Technology|url=https://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/news/newsgtx-begins-phase-ii-trial-of-enobosarm-to-treat-women-with-stress-urinary-incontinence-4785216/|work=Drug Development Technology|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gamelan Council – Asia-Pacific Microfinance, Public Health &amp; Development Centre''' ('''Gamelan Council''') is an international non-governmental, non-profit initiative addressing the [[microfinance]], [[public health]], and [[international development]] needs of communities in, on, and around the [[Pacific Rim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/index.html Gamelan Council homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;  For these purposes, the Gamelan Council views the [[Asia-Pacific]] region quite broadly in line with [[APEC]]; the jurisdictions covered are claimed to account for approximately 65% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://gamelancouncil.org/Wherewework/wherewework.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘where we work’]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council’s activities, which include conducting research, making investments, and providing education and advice, are centrally coordinated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/whatwedo.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘what we do’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Gamelan Council is an offshoot of the Global Consulting Group (GCG), a non-profit, non-partisan consulting firm created under the aegis of Global Student Response (GSR) and focused on supporting [[international development]] efforts which has since been disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/history.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘history and background’]&lt;/ref&gt;  As GCG’s efforts became more geographically focused on the Asia-Pacific region and thematically focused on [[microfinance]] and [[public health]] developmental issues, the Gamelan Council formed to focus specifically on these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/history.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘history and background’]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization is a combination of the Indonesian word referring to a music ensemble, ‘[[Gamelan]],’ and an English word referring to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], community-fostering ritual, ‘Council’ (the same term used to refer commonly to a group of individuals providing advice and counsel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/history.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘history and background’]&lt;/ref&gt;  These two terms capture the Gamelan Council’s goal of harmoniously unifying the arrays of forces and ideas affecting the areas on which the Gamelan Council focuses its efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/history.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘history and background’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions addressed==
The Gamelan Council operates predominantly in 73 [[Sovereign state|states]] and [[Territory (administrative division)|territories]] on, near, and around the [[Pacific Rim]], including every jurisdiction with a coastline on the [[Pacific Ocean]] and several other, significant population centres adjacent to or closely linked to the Pacific Rim (e.g., [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]]).  In 2010, the Gamelan Council also commenced pilot projects in both (a) Central Asia (i.e., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and (b) South America (i.e., Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, and Suriname) which complement its other activities centered on the Pacific Rim.

These jurisdictions are divided into three main geographic groups and are listed below, organized generally by geography (i.e., Americas from north to south; [[Asia]] from west to north and then south; and [[Oceania]] from west to east):

==Key activities==
The Gamelan Council focuses on three main sets of activities addressing [[microfinance]], [[public health]], and [[international development]] issues.  These include (a) research (e.g., conducting targeted studies of trends in the [[microfinance]], [[public health]], and [[international development]] sectors); (b) investment (e.g., raising capital to support successful Asia-Pacific [[microfinance]] providers and assisting entrepreneurs developing new technologies addressing basic needs throughout the Asia-Pacific region); and (c) education and advice (e.g., developing seminars, providing consulting services to social entrepreneurs, and coordinating conferences on [[microfinance]], [[public health]], and [[international development]] in the Asia-Pacific region).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamelancouncil.org/whatwedo.html Gamelan Council website referencing ‘what we do’]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilbert Primrose''' (c.1535 -18 April 1616) was a Scottish surgeon who became  Surgeon to King James VI of Scots and moved with the court to London as [[Serjeant Surgeon|Serjeant-Surgeon]] to [[King James VI and I]] on the [[Union of the Crowns]]. He was [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh]] on three occasions.

==Early Life and education==
Gilbert Primrose was born c.1535, at [[Culross]], Fife, Scotland. He was the son of Duncan Primrose, of the Primroses of that Ilk and Helen  Primrose, and was a member of the family from which the  [[Earls of Rosebery]] are descended.&lt;ref name="geni.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Gilbert-Primrose-principal-surgeon-to-James-VI-of-Scotland/6000000027128379827|title=Gilbert Primrose, principal surgeon to James VI of Scotland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Robert.

Edinburgh : Printed by George Ramsay and Co. for Archibald Constable and Co., Edinburgh p575 https://archive.org/details/peerageofscotlan02douguoft&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 1558 he was admitted to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh]] as apprentice to Robert Henrysoun, one of the founder members of the Incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, J.D.  ''History of Scottish Medicine to 1860''. London, Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, 2nd ed, 1932 p 174 https://archive.org/details/b2045711x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surgical career==
The  name Gilbert Primrose first appears in the Edinburgh burgh records in 1558 when Scotland was threatened by an invasion from “the auld inemies of Ingland”.  The craft guilds were required to list those men who could be mustered in the event of an attack and Gilbert Primrose was one of the 27 nominated by the Incorporation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Extracts From the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1557-1571''. 10 June 1558. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/edinburgh-burgh-records/1557-71/pp15-26&lt;/ref&gt; Primrose went on to become Surgeon to King James VI of Scotland.  He was a friend of Dr [[Peter Lowe (surgeon)|Peter Lowe]], the co-founder of the [[Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], who dedicated the first edition (1597) of his surgical textbook ''The Whole course of Chirurgerie'' (which was renamed ''Discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie'' for the 2nd and 3rd editions)&lt;ref&gt;Lowe P. ''The whole course of chirurgerie'' ... Compiled by Peter Lowe Scotchman, Arellian, Doctor in the Facultie of Chirurgerie in Paris, and chirurgian ordinarie to the most victorious and christian King of Fraunce and Nauarre. London:Printed by [[Thomas Purfoot]]; 1597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, IML. ‘Peter Lowe’s Whole Course of Chirurgerie…1597’. Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. 2013;4:374-376 https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/Journal/peter-lowe%E2%80%99s-whole-course-chirurgerie%E2%80%A61597&lt;/ref&gt; to Gilbert Primrose.&lt;ref&gt;Dingwall, Helen. ''A famous and flourishing Society ; The History of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, 1505-2005''. Edinburgh, Edinburgh University press, 2005. p15 {{ISBN|978-0748615674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was subsequently elected [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon of the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers]] on no fewer than three occasions.  Whilst he was Deacon in 1581 the Surgeons became first in the order of precedence of the 14 crafts of the City of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cresswell, CH   ''The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; Historical Notes from 1505 to 1905'' . Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p 9&lt;/ref&gt; 
When he was elected Deacon for the third time in 1602 his status was such that he was able to impose considerable discipline on the Incorporation.  Under his leadership all members of the Incorporation swore that they would uphold all aspects of the Seal of Cause (the Charter of the Incorporation) and any violations were punished.&lt;ref&gt;Cresswell, CH   ''The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; Historical Notes from 1505 to 1905'' . Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Primrose was also responsible for passing new Laws which sought to maintain even higher standards within  the craft.  Admission and examination fees were established and each member of the Incorporation was required to pay a subscription.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Cresswell, CH   ''The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; Historical Notes from 1505 to 1905'' . Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926. p19&lt;/ref&gt; The Incorporation thrived under his leadership.  
As principal surgeon to King James VI he accompanied the Court to London on the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603. He became [[Serjeant-Surgeon]] or chief surgeon to the King, now [[James VI and I]] and Queen Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, J.D.  ''History of Scottish Medicine to 1860.'' London, Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, 2nd ed, 1932 p 175.https://archive.org/details/b2045711x&lt;/ref&gt;

==First name on Fellows’ Roll==
Whilst the names of the earliest members of the Incorporation appear in the Edinburgh Burgh records,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; the assignation of a roll number for Members and Fellows starts from 1581 when the Deacon of the Incorporation was Gilbert Primrose. His name is first in the Roll of Fellows which has continued in an uninterrupted sequence ever since.

[[File:Replica_of_Gilbert_Primrose_mortar.jpg|thumb|right|Repilca of Gilbert Primrose's mortar in Surgeons' Hall Museum, Edinburgh]]

==Primrose’s mortar==
[[Surgeons' Hall|Surgeons’ Hall]]  Museum has a treasured relic of Gilbert Primrose.  It is labelled “a replica of the mortar used by Gilbert Primrose, an ancestor of the Earl of Rosebery and a Deacon of the Chirurgeon-Barbers in 1581”.  This mortar was presented to the College by [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], a descendant of Gilbert Primrose in December 1909.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The original is held in the National Museums of Scotland.

==Family==
His  brother  Archibald Primrose became [[Laird of Burnbrae|1st Laird of Burnbrae]]. Other brothers included David Primrose,  Henry Primrose, Duncan Primrose and Peter Primrose.&lt;ref name="geni.com"/&gt;
He married Alison Graham. Their son [[Gilbert Primrose (minister)|Gilbert Primrose]] (c1580–1641) became a Calvinist pastor. Other children included Dame Marion Primrose (1566-1637), David Primrose and Robert Primrose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Dame-Marion-Primrose/6000000012109338496|title=Dame Marion Primrose|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Gilbert Primrose died at Westminster, London on April 18, 1616 but was buried in [[Greyfriars Churchyard]], Edinburgh where his monument stands to this day.  His grave carries the Latin inscription translated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;To Gilbert Primrose, Chief Surgeon to James and Anne, King and Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland. His heirs erected this monument. He lived happily 80 years.  To the end of his life he was Chief Surgeon to the King, and died, adorned with testimonials of public sorrow from Prince and people, in the year of our Lord 1616 on the 8th of April.
Great Gilbert Primrose shut his mortal eyes

Full fraught with honours as with length of days

My will and life to Christ I still resign'd

Hence neither life nor death did bitter find&lt;ref&gt;Monteith, Robert. ''Collection of Epitaphs and Monumental Inscriptions: Chiefly in Scotland''. Glasgow.

The '''GAHP (Global Alliance on Health and Pollution)''' is an international collaborative body working to help low- and middle-income countries deal with toxic hotspots and solve environmental health problems. These toxic locations suffer greatly from [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]. "The group will work with governments to clean-up toxic hotspots where children, especially, are being poisoned. It could also respond to emergencies such as a recent lead poisoning outbreak in Nigeria that killed hundreds of children." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Ben|title=Global Alliance to Fight Toxic Pollution|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-barber/global-alliance-to-fight-_b_1760855.html|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October, 19, 2017, GAHP in collaboration with [[The Lancet]] and the [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]], published the [https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/pollution-and-health?code=lancet-site Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health in The Lancet.] The aim of the Commission is to minimize air, soil and water pollution by communicating the substantial economic and health costs of pollution globally, providing realizable solutions to policy-makers.

"This is a larger problem than most people are aware of. Some of the research coming out now finds that the amount of health damage caused by chemicals in toxic hotspots is as significant as that of malaria or tuberculosis."—Richard Fuller, President, [[Pure Earth (Blacksmith Institute)]], Secretariat for the GAHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=September|first=Alphee|title=A Global Alliance for a Toxics-Free World|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/article/view/988/|work=The Global Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAHP is the first international alliance of its kind to respond to the threat of toxic pollution on a worldwide scale. The executive committee of the GAHP is based at the World Bank. [[Pure Earth]] (formerly known as the [[Blacksmith Institute]], an NGO that works on cleaning up some of the world's worst polluted sites, serves as Secretariat for the GAHP.

The GAHP is made up of an [http://www.gahp.net/new/what-is-gahp/members/ international alliance of members] that includes the [[World Bank]],UNEP, UNDP, UNIDO, [[Asian Development Bank]], the European Commission, the Ministries of Environment of several low- and middle-income countries, and other agencies.  All GAHP members have an interest in fighting pollution. By banding together, GAHP members offer access to multiple lines of support and resources like a one-stop shop for pollution solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One-Stop Shop for Pollution Solutions|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/blog/?p=1217%20one-stop%20shop%20for%20pollution%20solutions|work=The Pollution Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1989-1992 period, the healthcare has faced substantial problems after the transition from Communist monopoly market to competitive market. From the past top-down centralized government system, the newly elected administrators enacted reforms designed to expand patient choice. From 1990 to 1998, deaths under one year of age shrank from 10.8 to 5.2 per thousand. Statistically, the Czech Republic is one of the healthiest of the central and eastern European countries, though some data points lag behind other Western European nations. The Republic has been a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1995.&lt;ref name=primary&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1534002 | pmid=16902697 | volume=1 | title=Primary health care in the Czech Republic: brief history and current issues | journal=Int J Integr Care | page=e06 | last1 = Holcik | first1 = J | last2 = Koupilova | first2 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, professors of medicine Jan Holčík and Ilona Koupilová wrote for ''The International Journal of Integrated Care'',
{{quote|There is currently considerable interest in looking to Western Europe for inspiration and a certain degree of willingness to implement, what is usually described as, the European model of health care. The context of the situation in the Czech Republic, traditions with respect to social organisation and attitudes to health and health issues, and also the economic situation of the country, will all play an important role and pose many specific issues when trying to implement new concepts such as a family doctor. It remains to be seen how far these new concepts are effective and viable in the context of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=primary/&gt;}}

The Czech healthcare system has a great degree of decentralization and market forces used in it compared to other European systems. According to the 2016 [[Euro health consumer index]] the Czech health system is the 13th most successful in Europe, ranked behind [[Sweden]] and two positions ahead of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="EHCI 2016"/&gt;

In terms of administration, the healthcare system is based on a [[Health insurance mandate|compulsory insurance model]], with [[fee-for-service]] care funded by mandatory employment-related insurance plans since 1992.&lt;ref name=primary/&gt; User fees have subsequently been reduced by more recent governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech Republic HiT (2015)|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/partners/observatory/publications/health-system-reviews-hits/full-list-of-country-hits/czech-republic-hit-2015|website=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Keller International''' ('''HKI''') combats the causes and consequences of blindness and malnutrition by establishing programs based on evidence and research in vision, health and nutrition. Founded in 1915 by [[Helen Keller]] and George A. Kessler, the organization's mission is to save the sight and lives of the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] and disadvantaged.

George A. Kessler, also known as the "Champagne King," was a passenger on the {{RMS|Lusitania}} in 1915 when it [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|was torpedoed]] by a [[German U-boat]]. When he was fighting for his life in the cold waters of the Atlantic off the coast of Ireland, he vowed that if he survived, he would devote much of his time and substantial financial resources to a worthwhile cause.  The cause he chose was assisting Allied soldiers blinded in the service.  He later befriended Helen Keller and helped found the organization that became Helen Keller International.

HKI's two major areas of expertise are Eye Health and Nutrition.  Its Eye Health programs address the major causes of blindness in the world, including cataract, [[trachoma]] and [[onchocerciasis]], and treating [[refractive error]]. Its nutrition programs include vitamin A, iron/folate, and multi-micronutrient supplementation, fortification of commonly used foods, dietary diversification, community- and school-gardening as well as school health activities, the promotion of breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and nutritional surveillance to provide critical data to governments and other development partners. Each year, HKI's programs benefit millions of people.

Currently, HKI works in 21 countries around the world in Africa, Asia and the United States.  Global headquarters are located in New York City, and programs are also developed and administered through  regional offices, currently located in Senegal and [[Phnom Penh]], as well as through 19 country offices and an additional development office in Paris. HKI has country offices in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cameroon]], [[Cambodia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[China]], [[Guinea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mali]], [[Mozambique]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Philippines]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Vietnam]].

Helen Keller International has received the 2014 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Development Cooperation category for agricultural programs that help families and villages to raise their own nutritious foods. "Hunger and low dietary diversity reduce cognitive function, physical capacity, resistance to disease and quality of life and lifetime earnings. Heller Keller International champions Homestead Food Production, an innovative, interdisciplinary program that promotes improved agricultural and nutritional practices in a synergistic fashion. This approach is mostly applied to communities that have difficult access to labor and food markets," in the words of the jury's citation.

==Activities==
Helen Keller International has launched and completed several initiatives to combat malnutrition and blindness in Bangladesh.

===Nutrition Surveillance Project (NSP)===
This programme was started by HKI in 1990 to monitor the health impact of severe flooding in Bangladesh. It is a collaborative effort which involves the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), international and local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Security and Nutrition Surveillance Bulletin Report 2010 |url=http://www.hki.org/research/HKI%20Bulletin%20Bangladesh%20Sept%2010%20Food%20Security%20and%20Nutrition%20Surveillance.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526053358/http://www.hki.org/research/HKI%20Bulletin%20Bangladesh%20Sept%2010%20Food%20Security%20and%20Nutrition%20Surveillance.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme essentially provides up-to-date and dependable information on the prevalence of malnutrition and morbidity in children, household socioeconomic characteristics and food prices. Data are collected by authorities in selected rural districts and urban slums in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition Surveillance Bangladesh: A useful tool for policy planning at the local and national levels |url=http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl?a=d&amp;d=HASH22b8e1393d7f68a9224b1d.2.pp&amp;c=hdl&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906200517/http://www.greenstone.org/greenstone3/nzdl?a=d&amp;d=HASH22b8e1393d7f68a9224b1d.2.pp&amp;c=hdl&amp;sib=1&amp;dt=&amp;ec=&amp;et=&amp;p.a=b&amp;p.s=ClassifierBrowse&amp;p.sa= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSP data have also been used by the GOB to improve or develop nutrition and health programmes such as the national vitamin A capsule distribution program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutritional Surveillance Project Final Report, USAID Cooperative Agreement No. 388-A-00-99-00060-00 |url=http://www.pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABX780.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118132450/http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdabx780.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSP has proven to be an excellent tool to aid long-term planning in health policies, to provide input for programme management and evaluation and to give timely warning of the need for intervention to prevent critical deterioration in food consumption.

===Diabetic Retinopathy===
[[Diabetic retinopathy]] is a leading cause of blindness. Heller Keller International helps prepare health care systems to identify and treat Diabetic Retinopathy. In collaboration with Chittagong Eye Infirmary and Training Complex and the Diabetes Association of Bangladesh, HKI began a pilot project in 2009 to improve patients' access to sight-saving Diabetic Retinopathy treatment regardless of their ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabetic Retinopathy|url=http://www.hki.org/preventing-blindness/other-programs/diabetic-retinopathy-treatment/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homestead Food Production (HFP)===
This programme aims to reduce [[malnutrition]] and increase [[right to food|food availability]] through creation of home gardens and small farms for raising livestock. In collaboration with local NGOs, HKI provides the seedlings, chicks, start up materials and technical skills to communities. Varieties of fruits and vegetables are grown in these home gardens to provide supplies of nutrient rich foods all year round. The objectives are to increase participants' micro-nutritional intakes by consuming a wider variety of foods, develop communities and empower women.

HFP started in 1990 as a pilot project in Bangladesh with 1000 households participating. It includes nutrition education to complement home gardening. Following initial success, HKI launched the NGO Gardening and Nutrition Education Surveillance Project (NGNESP) which expanded the programme to communities across the country in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions fed: Proven successes in agricultural development |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch21.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228192751/http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch21.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, 900,000 households and 4.5 million people are participating in the project, with the help of 52 local NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HKI in Bangladesh |url=http://www.hki.org/working-worldwide/asia-pacific/bangladesh/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215202350/http://www.hki.org/working-worldwide/asia-pacific/bangladesh/ |archivedate=2012-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women organise 90% of the gardens.

A 2002 research shows that in a 3 months period, households participating in the HFP consumed had a daily per capita consumption of vegetables of 160g, more than double of the 71g for non-participating households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of a homestead gardening program on household food security and empowerment of women in Bangladesh |url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/nsinf/03795721/v26n1/s2.pdf?expires=1329377878&amp;id=67237629&amp;titleid=41000042&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=EEFB1BA8E8BE2A990DE161EAB6339BC6 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708143659/http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/nsinf/03795721/v26n1/s2.pdf?expires=1329377878&amp;id=67237629&amp;titleid=41000042&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=EEFB1BA8E8BE2A990DE161EAB6339BC6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamin A Supplementation===
[[Vitamin A deficiency]] causes blindness and increases mortality rate for young children and women. The deficiency can be prevented with two doses of high potency Vitamin A capsules every year. With the cost of providing the capsules at $1 per person per year, Vitamin A supplementation is a cost-efficient initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing Malnutrition: Vitamin A Supplementation|url=http://www.hki.org/reducing-malnutrition/vitamin-a-supplementation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HKI started the [[Vitamin A supplementation]] project in Bangladesh in 1978. Its partnership with the GOB began in 1982. The Bangladesh Nutritional Blindness Study was conducted, and it indicated that there was a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. By 2005, Vitamin A deficiency among children 12 to 59 months, as measured by prevalence of night blindness, has decreased to 0.04% from 3.76% in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitamin A |url=http://iphn.gov.bd/new/home/activities/vitamin-a |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521011703/http://iphn.gov.bd/new/home/activities/vitamin-a |archivedate=2012-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Kathy Spahn is President and Chief Executive Officer, joining in March 2005. Prior to HKI, Ms. Spahn was President and Executive Director of Orbis, a global non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention and treatment of blindness in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hki.org/kathy-spahn-president-ceo|title=Kathy Spahn, President &amp; CEO|work=Helen Keller International|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
Helen Keller International is a partner in [http://www.compact2025.org Compact2025], a partnership that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.

'''Hermes Juan Binner''' (born June 5, 1943) is an [[Argentine]] [[physician]] and a politician. He was elected [[Governor of Santa Fe]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="jura"&gt;[http://www.rosario3.com/noticias/noticias.aspx?idNot=22940 Binner ya es el primer gobernador socialista del país] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205052959/http://www.rosario3.com/noticias/noticias.aspx?idNot=22940 |date=2008-02-05 }}. ''Rosario3'', 11 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Binner is the first [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist]] to become the governor of an Argentine province, and the first non-[[Justicialism|Justicialist]] to rule Santa Fe since 1983.&lt;ref name=Clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/09/03/elpais/p-00315.htm Ganó Binner y el socialismo sacó al PJ de la Gobernación de Santa Fe], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', 3 September 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binner was previously a Deputy of the [[Civic and Social Progressive Front]], a Santa Fe party coalition including the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]], the [[Radical Civic Union]] and other left-wing parties, since the [[Argentine elections, 2005|parliamentary elections]] of October 23, 2005.

==Biography==

===Education and background===
Binner was born and raised in [[Rafaela]], [[Santa Fe Province]], to a [[Swiss Argentine]] family. He attended primary school at St. Joseph's College, and then attended high school at the Rafaela National College, where he began his [[Argentine politics|political activity]] through participation in the Student Center. At the time (1958) the need for public free [[State-Church relations in Argentina|non-religious education]] was being hotly debated in Argentina.

Binner moved to [[Rosario]] to study Medicine at the [[Universidad Nacional de Rosario]]. At 18 he became affiliated with the [[Argentine Socialist Party]] and continued to exercise an intense political activity, both as a member of the Student Center and at the institutional level in the Faculty of Medicine. After the [[Revolución Argentina|1966 coup d'état]], he participated in the movements resisting the military dictatorship of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], against a background of political and ideological persecution.

He graduated in 1970 and continued his militant activism as a Graduate Council Member at the University, as well as working as a union member at the Rosario Medical Association and the Physicians' College.

===Political trajectory===
[[Guillermo Estévez Boero]] and Binner co-founded the [[Popular Socialist Party (Argentina)|Popular Socialist Party]] (''Partido Socialist Popular'', PSP) in [[Buenos Aires]] on April 23, 1972, a merger of the [[Argentine Socialist Party]] (PSA) with other left-wing groups.&lt;ref name=bonfatti&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued exercising his profession, taking up specialties in [[anesthesiology]] and [[occupational medicine]], and starting studies in the field of [[public health]]. On the last account he obtained the posts of Sub-Director and Director of public hospitals.

Following the [[1989 riots in Argentina|1989 economic crisis]] that led to the early handover of power by President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] to President-elect [[Carlos Menem]], the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] Mayor of Rosario [[Horacio Usandizaga]] resigned in protest, forcing anticipated municipal elections to be held. The Socialist [[Héctor Cavallero]] was elected, and he appointed Binner to the office of Public Health Secretary.

After Cavallero's term, in 1993, Binner was elected ''concejal'' (member of the City Council) for the PSP. From this platform he developed a trajectory that led him to present himself as a candidate for the municipal elections of 1995.

===Mayor of Rosario===
Binner was elected Mayor of Rosario in 1995 and then re-elected in 1999, ending his second four-year term in 2003. He was candidate to the governorship of the province of Santa Fe, obtaining a larger percentage of the popular vote than any of the other candidates, but the controversial voting system in place at the time (''[[Ley de Lemas]]'') caused the Socialist Party to lose the election to the [[Peronist Party]].

The eight years of the Binner administration in Rosario were marked by several guidelines:

* [[Decentralization]] and emphasis on the citizen's rule: The city was divided into several large [[districts of Rosario|districts]], moving the bureaucratic structure from the Municipality to the peripheral ''[[barrio]]s'' (neighbourhoods), and implementing mechanisms of direct democracy.
* Emphasis on the public sphere (health, education, cultural activities) and public welfare. The administration's Health Plan was acknowledged by the Pan-American Health Organization as a model for the rest of [[Latin America]].
* Positioning of Rosario as a strategically placed metropolis with a vast area of economic and geopolitical influence. Binner was a Founding Member and Executive Secretary of ''Mercociudades'' (cities of the [[Mercosur]]), President of the Ibero-American Center for Urban Strategic Development (CIDEU), and President of the Argentine Municipalities Federation.

On December 8, 2003, months after the end of Binner's second term, the [[United Nations]] acknowledged the people and the government of Rosario as a model of democratic governance among 257 Latin American cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experienciarosario.org/ Experiencia Rosario]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermes Binner was succeeded in office by one of his former municipal officials, [[Miguel Lifschitz]], who has continued and developed the policies outlined above, and was re-elected in 2007.

===Other activities===
Binner is a member of the National Table of the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] and the Secretary General of the Santa Fe Federation for the same. He is also the director of the Rosario's Municipal and Provincial Studies Center, an institution for political and academic formation with professionals of diverse disciplines debating current issues and policies.

===National Deputy===
Binner was a candidate for a seat in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|National Chamber of Deputies]] (the Lower House of the Argentine Congress) for the [[Progressive, Civic and Social Front]], a Santa Fe political coalition (which includes the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] (PS), members of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), [[Support for an Egalitarian Republic]] (ARI), [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Communist Party of Argentina|Communist Party]] and [[Peronist]] dissident) in the [[Argentine elections, 2005|parliamentary elections of October 23, 2005]].&lt;ref name="Clarin" /&gt; He won the seat, together with other six candidates of the Progressive Front, by a 10% margin over the [[party list|list]] of candidates led by his closest competitor, the [[Justicialist Party]] candidate [[Agustín Rossi]].

===Governor of Santa Fe===
Binner ran for governor of Santa Fe in 2007, together with former Santa Fe City federal prosecutor [[Griselda Tessio]] as vice-governor, against former chancellor and national deputy for Buenos Aires City [[Rafael Bielsa]] (chosen in primaries by the Justicialist [[Front for Victory]]). He was supported by the left-wing opposition leader [[Elisa Carrió]], head of the ARI.&lt;ref name="BBCB"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2007/09/070903_argentinaprovinciais_pu.shtml Aliado de Kirchner perde eleição na 2ª província argentina], ''[[BBC]]'', 03 September 2007 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binner won the [[Argentine general election, 2007|provincial election of September 2, 2007]], by a significant margin (by 48% to 38%) over Bielsa. He was sworn in on December 11, becoming the first Socialist governor in the history of Argentina, and the first non-Justicialist to rule Santa Fe since 1983.&lt;ref name="jura"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosario3, 2 September 2007.

Despite his opposition to the Peronist candidate, who was strongly supported by then-President [[Néstor Kirchner]], Governor Binner maintained a fluid relationship with Kirchner and his wife and successor, President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]].&lt;ref name="Clarin" /&gt; Binner joined UCR Congressman [[Ricardo Alfonsín]] in the [[Civic and Social Agreement]] during the early stages of the [[Argentine general election, 2011|2011 general election]] campaign. Their alliance ended in May, however,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioregistrado.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=49873 |title=El socialismo ya descartó la fórmula Binner-Alfonsín |publisher=''Diario Registrado'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606003722/http://www.diarioregistrado.com/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=49873 |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 11, Binner formally announced his candidacy for [[President of Argentina]]. He nominated [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba Province]] Senator [[Norma Morandini]] as his running mate on their Progressive Front ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/69771/binner-officializes-presidential-candidacy-morandini-running-mate|title=Binner officializes presidential candidacy, Morandini running mate|publisher=''Buenos Aires Herald''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Bonfatti]], the Minister of Government and State Reform during Binner's tenure and a longtime friend and ally from their Medical School days, was elected to succeed Binner as Governor of Santa Fe in [[Argentine provincial elections, 2011#July 24|elections on July 24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elecciones.santafe.gov.ar/web-gral2011/index.html Provincia de Santa Fe 2011: Resultados generales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902002957/http://www.elecciones.santafe.gov.ar/web-gral2011/index.html |date=2011-09-02 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Candidate for Argentina's presidential election ===

On June 11, 2011, the Socialist Congress vote the candidature for presidential elections: Hermes Binner - Norma Morandini. That candidature is in representation of the Broad Progressive Front, a grouping launched in Buenos Aires in June 2011. In this new alliance participated the Socialist Party, with other parts of the called "democratic left": Civic Front, GEN, Buenos Aires for Everyone, Movement of the free people of the south, Popular Union.

On August 14, 2011, in the primary elections for the presidency he came fourth with 11% of the votes. On October 23, 2011, in the General elections for the presidency he came second with 17% of the votes, behind [[Cristina Fernández]].

'''Hiram Milliken Hiller Jr.''' (March 8, 1867 – August 8, 1921), was an American physician, medical missionary, explorer, and [[ethnographer]].  He traveled in [[Oceania]] and in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]], and [[East Asia]], returning with [[Archeology|archeological]], cultural, [[Zoology|zoological]], and [[Botany|botanical]] specimens and data for museums, lectures and publications.  His notes and collections provide valuable information about those regions and their people from the late 19th century.  In later life, he was involved in the study of [[polio]] during the epidemics that hit the United States in the early 20th century.

==Family and early life==
He was born on March 8, 1867, near [[Kahoka, Missouri]], to Colonel [[Hiram Milliken Hiller Sr.]] (1834–1895) and the former Sarah Fulton Bell (1837–1915), who were both from Pennsylvania.  He was the third of their six children who survived to adulthood.  The elder Hiller, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran and lawyer, was a prominent citizen of [[Clark County, Missouri]], and was instrumental in the success of [[Kahoka]] until his death in a [[railroad]] accident.&lt;ref name="WMHC"&gt;Western Historical Manuscript Collection - Columbia, [http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/invent/3856.pdf Hiller Family Papers, 1785-1993 (C3856)], State Historical Society of Missouri.

Hiller House|house]] in Kahoka is a registered [[historic landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Missouri, Counties C#Clark County]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Hiller attended [[Parsons College]] in Iowa, earning his B.S. in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;General Alumni Society, University of Pennsylvania, ''General Alumni Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania'', 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved to Philadelphia to attend medical school at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  While there, he met several other men of similar interests, including [[William Henry Furness III]] (1867–1920, the son of Shakespearean scholar [[Horace Howard Furness]] and nephew of architect [[Frank Furness]]), and Alfred Craven Harrison Jr. (1869–1925, nephew of [[Charles Custis Harrison]], Provost of the University of Pennsylvania from 1894 to 1911).  Hiller graduated in 1891 and served his residency at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and at nearby Blockley Hospital.&lt;ref name="PennLib"&gt;Finding Aid, [http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/d/ead/upenn_museum_PUMu1060 Furness, Harrison and Hiller expedition records, 1060], University of Pennsylvania Libraries.

Morse]], a Harvard zoologist, was giving lectures about Japan, then a subject of [[Japonism|great fascination]] in the West, throughout Boston; Hiller appears to have been inspired by these.&lt;ref name="TokEmb" /&gt;

==Expeditions==
[[File:Hiller-Furness.jpg|thumb|250px|Hiller (left), Furness, and Harrison, with Lewis Etzel, Furness' assistant. Photographed in Singapore, 1898.&lt;ref name="TokEmb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flickr, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/99933281@N00/2538452465/ Handsome Dead Men From Penn Museum].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Hiller, Furness, and Harrison embarked on a series of expeditions to [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. The three did not always travel together, and the records of their travels are fragmentary in places.  Their first two voyages are the best-documented; the last voyage the worst.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;

;First expedition (1895–1896)
In October 1895, Hiller, Furness, and Harrison left the United States, using their own money to search for the fabled [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[Headhunting|headhunters]] of [[Borneo]] to collect ethnological specimens for the new [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. On their way to the South Seas, they stopped at [[Yokohama]], [[Amami]], and [[Okinawa]], among other places in Japan, arriving in Borneo after seven months of travel from the United States.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TokEmb" /&gt; They spent four months traveling and collecting in Borneo,&lt;ref name="TokEmb" /&gt; although they did not always travel together. After leaving Borneo, they traveled to Singapore, Saigon, and China before returning to Japan, the [[Republic of Hawaii]], and the United States.  Hiller arrived in Kahoka on December 4, 1896.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;

;Second expedition (1897–1898)
Five months later (May 1897), they were off to Borneo again.  Traveling by way of Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Saigon, they returned to Singapore and used it as a base for a number of expeditions into such places as [[Kalimantan]], [[Sarawak]], [[British Malaya]], and Tambak before returning the way they came.  They returned in August or September 1898.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;

;Third Expedition (1899–1900)
Unlike their other expeditions, the third was an eastward journey.  They sailed for England on June 14, 1899, traveling from London to Paris and Marseilles before boarding the ''Ernest Simon'' for Asia.  The voyage took them through the [[Suez Canal]] and to [[Djibouti]] before arriving in [[Colombo, Ceylon]].  They traveled in Ceylon, [[British India|India]], [[Burma]], and [[Australia]] before sailing for [[Hawaii]] (recently [[Territory of Hawaii|annexed by the United States]]) and [[Vancouver]], circling the world before returning home in May 1900.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;

;Fourth expedition (1901)
Their last voyage may have been somewhat restricted by the realities of life (the three were all over 30 by this point).  Leaving Philadelphia in February 1901, they traveled to New Orleans and San Francisco before sailing for Honolulu and Yokohama aboard the ''Sir Coptic''.  They extensively toured Japan, particularly Hokkaido.&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;  Hiller met [[Jenichiro Oyabe]], a Japanese man who had been educated as a missionary at [[Yale University]] and [[Howard University]].  Oyabe served as a translator and a guide for a side-expedition to the [[Ainu people]], and consequently Hiller amassed a large collection of the objects of Ainu daily life&lt;ref name="PennMus"&gt;Alison Miner, [http://pennmuseumarchives.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-ainu-people-and-an-early-anthropological-friendship-across-an-ocean/ The Ainu People and an Early Anthropological Friendship Across an Ocean], PennMuseumArchives, February 28, 2009. Accessed 2010.06.20.&lt;/ref&gt; before proceeding to the [[East Indies]].&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;  Once Hiller returned home, he stayed in contact with Oyabe, who wrote him friendly letters encouraging him to “tell the world about my beloved Ainu people.”&lt;ref name="PennMus" /&gt;

==Later life==
Hiller married Blanche Hays, of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name = "FindAGrave" /&gt;  The wilds of the jungle were no place for a civilized woman; his exploring days were over.  Hiller managed a sugar plantation in Cuba for “a wealthy friend” (Harrison’s father was a sugar manufacturer, and Harrison entered his father’s business in 1902&lt;ref name="PennLib" /&gt;) from 1902 to about 1907 in order to make money to bankroll his return to Philadelphia and the establishment of a medical practice.&lt;ref name="WMHC" /&gt;

The Hillers settled in Rose Tree, at the north edge of [[Media, Pennsylvania]].  Hiller founded a clinic in nearby [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] for poor workers in the factories there.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, ‘‘The Pennsylvania Medical Journal’’, Volume 21, pp. 395, 705 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''General Alumni Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania'' (1917, p. 1068) gives his address as 522 W. 9th Street.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there, he encountered a [[History of poliomyelitis#Epidemics|devastating outbreak of a disease that spread rapidly and paralyzed its victims]], especially children.  A few physicians in other towns were experiencing similar outbreaks.  They communicated, shared experiences, and realized not only that they were dealing with the same disease ([[Poliomyelitis|“infantile paralysis”]]), but that it was a form of polio, which apparently had taken a more damaging, virulent, epidemic form. The Hillers had two daughters, Margaret Linn and Virginia (“Ginny”).&lt;ref name = "FindAGrave" /&gt;

==Death==
Hiller died on August 8, 1921, in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]], possibly from complications from polio.&lt;ref name="WMHC" /&gt;  He is buried in Union Cemetery in Bellefonte.&lt;ref name = FindAGrave&gt;Find A Grave, [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=hiller&amp;GSfn=hiram&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=112418839&amp;df=all&amp; Dr. Hiram M. Hiller]&lt;/ref&gt; His widow moved with her daughters to [[Lower Merion, Pennsylvania]], closer to Philadelphia, where she lived until her death in 1944.&lt;ref name = "FindAGrave" /&gt;

==Collections==
Thanks in significant part to Hiller, the University Museum’s collection of Ainu artifacts is one of the largest in any museum, so much so that The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC) borrowed a sizable portion of the collection to display in the Ainu Craft Exhibition 2008 at the Niigata Prefectural Museum of History in [[Nagaoka City]], Japan.&lt;ref name="PennMus" /&gt;  The University Museum also holds 57 artifacts and 3 diaries Furness and Hiller brought back from Amami and Okinawa,&lt;ref name="TokEmb" /&gt; and the university library has additional materials.&lt;ref name="PennMus" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Lipedema''' is a disorder where there is enlargement of both [[Human Legs|legs]] due to deposits of fat under the skin.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Typically it gets worse over time, pain may be present, and sufferers [[bruise]] easily.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; In severe cases the trunk and upper body may be involved.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Lipedema is commonly misdiagnosed.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856" /&gt; 

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown but is believed to involve genetics and hormonal factors.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; It often runs in families.&lt;ref name=GARD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipedema|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10542/lipedema|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include being [[overweight]] or [[obese]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Other conditions that may present similarly include obesity, [[lipohypertrophy]], [[chronic venous insufficiency]], and [[lymphedema]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
A number of treatments may be useful including [[physiotherapy]] and exercise.  Physiotherapy may help to preserve mobility for a little longer than would otherwise be the case.  Exercise, only as much as the patient is able to do without causing damage to the joints, may help with overall fitness but will not prevent progression of the disease.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; While surgery can remove fat tissue it can also damage [[lymphatic vessels]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Treatment does not typically result in complete resolution.&lt;ref name=War2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren Peled|first1=A|last2=Kappos|first2=EA|title=Lipedema: diagnostic and management challenges.|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|date=2016|volume=8|pages=389–95|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S106227|pmid=27570465|pmc=4986968}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to affect up to 11% of women.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Onset is typically during [[puberty]], [[pregnancy]], or [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

===Lymphedema===

Lipedema can be underdiagnosed due the difficulty in differentiating it from other edemas and obesity, or clinicians failing to make themselves aware of the disease. Trayes 2013 published some tools including tables and a flow chart that can be used to diagnose lipedema and other edemas.&lt;ref name="pmid23939641" /&gt;

Lipedema / [[Adiposis dolorosa|Dercum’s Disease]] Differentiation
These conditions may co-exist. Dercum’s Disease is characterized by painful lipomas around the body.&lt;ref&gt;http://fatdisorders.org/fat-disorders/diagram{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of treatments may be useful including [[physiotherapy]] and light exercise which does not put undue stress on the lymphatic system.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; While surgery can remove fat tissue it can also damage [[lymphatic vessels]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Treatment does not typically result in complete resolution.&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt;

The use of surgery to treat the condition is controversial.&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt; Options include [[liposuction]] and [[lipectomy]].&lt;ref name=War2016/&gt;

The studies of highest quality involve tumescent or super tumescent anesthesia and vibrating liposuction, powered, cannula used with lymph sparing techniques.&lt;ref name=pmid20087075&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.ASW.0000363503.92360.91 |pmid=20087075 |title=Lipedema |journal=Advances in Skin &amp; Wound Care |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |year=2010 |last1=Fife |first1=Caroline E. |last2=Maus |first2=Erik A. |last3=Carter |first3=Marissa J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19785610&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09413.x |pmid=19785610 |title=Lipoedema: From clinical presentation to therapy. A review of the literature |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=161 |issue=5 |pages=980–6 |year=2009 |last1=Langendoen |first1=S.I. |last2=Habbema |first2=L. |last3=Nijsten |first3=T.E.C. |last4=Neumann |first4=H.A.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of lipedema with tumescent liposuction requires multiple procedures. In the United States Health Insurance do not generally pay for liposuction for lipedema, making it expensive. Liposuction under general anesthesia, without tumescent anesthesia, can be damaging and is not recommended for the treatment.&lt;ref name=pmid25586162&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1758-8111.2012.00045.x |pmid=25586162 |title=Lipedema: An overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of the disproportional fatty deposition syndrome - systematic review |journal=Clinical Obesity |volume=2 |issue=3–4 |pages=86–95 |year=2012 |last1=Forner-Cordero |first1=I. |last2=Szolnoky |first2=G. |last3=Forner-Cordero |first3=A. |last4=Kemény |first4=L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Complications include depression, anxiety, and pain.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Estimates of the incidence of lipedema vary widely, and range as high as 11% of the post-pubertal female population, with estimates of 17 million women in the US, and 370 million women worldwide affected.&lt;ref name="Foldi Lipedema"/&gt; "11% of adult women" is often cited but that is unsubstantiated.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Although first identified in the [[United States]], at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1940, lipedema is barely known in that country – to physicians or to the patients who have the disease. Lipedema often is confused with [[obesity]], and a significant number of patients currently diagnosed as obese are believed to have lipedema, either instead of or in addition to obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid22301856"/&gt;

She became the second female member of the [[American Physiological Society]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appel|first1=Toby A.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Marie M.|last3=Tidball|first3=M.Elizabeth|title=History of the American Physiological Society|chapter=Women in Physiology|year=1987|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461475767|pages=381–390|chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-7576-7_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Mabel FitzGerald was born in 1872 in [[Preston Candover]] near [[Basingstoke]]. She was educated at home, as was typical for upper and middle class girls in her time. In 1895, both her parents died and Mabel moved to [[Oxford]] with her sisters in 1896.&lt;ref name="OxfordDNB" /&gt; She began to teach herself chemistry and biology from books, as well as attending classes at [[Oxford University]] between 1896 and 1899, even though women were not yet allowed to receive degrees.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie2000"/&gt; She continued her studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Ogilvie2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=450–451|isbn=0415920388|editor=Marilyn Ogilvie|editor2=Joy Harvey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmfyK0QtsRAC&amp;lpg=PA450&amp;dq=Mabel%20Purefoy%20FitzGerald%20Physiological%20Society&amp;pg=PA450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
FitzGerald began to work with [[Francis Gotch]] at the physiology department in Oxford. Gotch also helped her get a paper published by the [[Royal Society]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie2000" /&gt;

From 1904, FitzGerald worked with [[John Scott Haldane]] on measuring the [[carbon dioxide tension]] in the human lung. After studying the differences between healthy and ill people, the two continued to investigate the effects of altitude on respiration; it is this work that they are most famous for. FitzGerald's observations of the effects of full altitude acclimatization on carbon dioxide tension and [[haemoglobin]] remain accepted today.&lt;ref name="OxfordDNB" /&gt;

In 1907, FitzGerald was awarded a Rockefeller travelling scholarship, which allowed her to work in New York and Toronto.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie2000" /&gt;

In 1911 she participated, along with [[Claude Gordon Douglas|C. Gordon Douglas]] and several other scientists, in a Colorado expedition led by John Scott Haldane to investigate human respiration at high altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=West, John B.|title=Centenary of the Anglo-American high-altitude expedition to Pikes Peak|date=31 October 2011|journal=Experimental Physiology|doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2011.058776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1913 in North Carolina, she made measurements on the breathing and the blood of a total of 43 adult residents chosen from three different locations in the Southern Appalachian chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=FitzGerald, M. P.|year=1914|title=Further observations on the changes in the breathing and the blood at various high altitudes|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character|volume=88|issue=602|pages=248–258|jstor=80707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
FitzGerald returned to the UK in 1915 to serve as a clinical pathologist at the Edinburgh infirmary, a position that was empty because of [[World War I]]. She did not publish any more papers and remained out of contact with the physiology community even after her return to Oxford in 1930.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie2000" /&gt;

In 1961, on the centenary of Haldane's birth, her work was rediscovered. In 1972, at 100 years old, she received an honorary MA from Oxford University, 75 years after she had attended classes there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford Degree: 75 Years Later|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19721225&amp;id=tXFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dvoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7038,7804671|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=December 25, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also made a member of [[The Physiological Society]].&lt;ref name="OxfordDNB" /&gt;

== Nachlass ==
{{blockquote|After her death R. W. Torrance was asked to look at her scientific apparatus and papers in the house at 12 [[Crick Road]]. ... The apparatus formed the tools of her trade as a physiologist studying acclimatizations at high altitude, including an [[altimeter]], [[Wiktionary:haemoglobinometer|haemoglobinometer]], [[haemocytometer]], and the two hemi-Haldane apparatuses she had used in North Carolina. There was a trunk full of family diaries including her own and many letters including some about scientific work from Haldane, Douglas, Gotch, Mann, [[Yandell Henderson|Henderson]] and [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sherrington]]. This material is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. There was also correspondence with [[William Osler|Osler]] for whom she collected medical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O'Connor, W. J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrToAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111||year=1991|title=British Physiologists 1885–1914: A Biographical Dictionary|page=111}} Gustav Mann (1864–1921) worked with Gotch from 1894 to 1908 in Oxford and then in 1908 became Professor of Physiology at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Maslow's hierarchy of needs''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Abraham Maslow]] in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in ''[[Psychological Review]]''.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.H.|last=Maslow|authorlink=Abraham Maslow|year=1943|title=A theory of human motivation |journal=Psychological Review|volume=50|issue=4|pages=370–96 |via=psychclassics.yorku.ca| url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm|doi=10.1037/h0054346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human [[developmental psychology]], some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation: Biological, Psychological, and Environmental|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans partake in behavioral motivation intrinsically. Maslow used the terms "physiological," "safety," "belonging&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;love," "esteem," and "self-actualization" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level, each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves. Furthermore, this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The goal of Maslow's Theory is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857664345|title=Theoretical basis for nursing|last=M.,|first=Wills, Evelyn|isbn=9781451190311|oclc=857664345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow's theory was fully expressed in his 1954 book ''[[Motivation and Personality]].''&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=Motivation and personality|last=Maslow|first=A|publisher=Harper|year=1954|isbn=0-06-041987-3|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy remains a very popular framework in [[sociology]] research, management training&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kremer|first=William Kremer|title=Abraham Maslow and the pyramid that beguiled business|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23902918|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=BBC news magazine|date=31 August 2013|author2=Hammond, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] psychology instruction. Maslow's classification hierarchy has been revised over time. The original hierarchy states that a lower level must be completely satisfied and fulfilled before moving onto a higher pursuit. However, today scholars prefer to think of these levels as continuously overlapping each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the lower levels may take precedent back over the other levels at any point in time.

== Hierarchy ==
[[File:Dynamic hierarchy of needs - Maslow.svg|thumb|Alternative illustration as a dynamic hierarchy of needs with overlaps of different needs at the same time]]
Maslow's hierarchy of [[need]]s is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for [[self-actualization]] and transcendence at the top. In other words, The crux of the theory is that individuals’ most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher level needs.&lt;ref name=honolulu/&gt;&lt;ref name=steere&gt;{{cite book |title= Becoming an effective classroom manager: A resource for teachers. |author= Steere, B. F. |publisher= SUNY Press |location=Albany, NY|year= 1988 |isbn= 0-88706-620-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=S2cwd56VvOMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Maslow's+hierarchy+of+needs&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called "deficiency needs" or "d-needs": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these "deficiency needs" are not met – with the exception of the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Maslow's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher level needs. Maslow also coined the term "[[metamotivation]]" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Goble, F. (1970). ''The third force: The psychology of Abraham Maslow.'' Richmond, CA: Maurice Bassett Publishing. pp. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as "relative", "general", and "primarily". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need "dominates" the human organism.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt; Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met.

=== Physiological needs ===
Physiological need is a concept that was derived to explain and cultivate the foundation for motivation. This concept is the basic foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This term was coined to represent a similar premise as drive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs are considered the main physical requirements for human survival. This means that Physiological needs are universal human needs. Physiological needs are considered the first step in internal motivation according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory states that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first in order to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If these needs are not achieved, it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual. In return, when individuals feel this increase in displeasure, the motivation to decrease these discrepancies increases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs can be defined as both traits and a state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs as traits allude to long-term, unchanging demands that are required of basic human life. Physiological needs as a state allude to the unpleasant decrease in pleasure and the increase for an incentive to fulfill a necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up Maslow's hierarchy, Physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs, then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs include:

* Homeostasis
* Food
* Water
* Sleep
* Shelter
* Sex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html |website=simply psychology |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Five Levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs |url=https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760 |website=verywell mind |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety needs ===

Once a person's physiological needs are relatively satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, [[family violence]], [[childhood abuse]], etc. – people may (re-)experience [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] or [[transgenerational trauma]]. In the absence of economic safety – due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities – these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for [[job security]], grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe. Safety and security needs are about keeping us safe from harm. These include shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek to find safety before they attempt to meet any higher level of survival, but the need for safety is not as important as basic physiological needs.

Safety and Security needs include:

* [[Personal security]]
* [[Emotional security]]
* [[Economic security|Financial security]]
* [[Health]] and [[well-being]]
* Safety needs against accidents/illness and their adverse impacts

=== Social belonging ===

After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs are seen to be interpersonal and involves feelings of [[belongingness]]. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies within this level of Maslow's hierarchy – due to [[hospitalism]], [[neglect]], [[shunning]], [[ostracism]], etc. – can adversely affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general.

Social Belonging needs include:

* [[Friendships]]
* [[Intimacy]]
* [[Family]]

According to Maslow, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless whether [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|these groups are large or small]]. For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs, and online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Many people become susceptible to [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], and [[clinical depression]] in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure.

=== Esteem ===

Esteem needs are ego needs or status needs. People develop a concern with getting recognition, status, importance, and respect from others. Most humans have a need to feel respected; this includes the need to have [[self-esteem]] and self-respect. Esteem presents the typical human desire to be accepted and valued by others. People often engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. These activities give the person a sense of contribution or value. Low self-esteem or an [[inferiority complex]] may result from imbalances during this level in the hierarchy. People with low self-esteem often need respect from others; they may feel the need to seek fame or glory. However, fame or glory will not help the person to build their self-esteem until they accept who they are internally. Psychological imbalances such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can distract the person from obtaining a higher level of self-esteem.

Most people have a need for stable self-respect and self-esteem. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs: a "lower" version and a "higher" version. The "lower" version of esteem is the need for respect from others. This may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The "higher" version manifests itself as the need for self-respect. For example, the person may have a need for strength, competence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, mastery, [[self-confidence]], independence, and freedom. This "higher" version takes guidelines, the "hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated".&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt; This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.

=== Self-actualization ===
{{Main|Self-actualization}}

"What a man can be, he must be."&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|91}} This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have a strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|93}} As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can often be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation. Since all levels of Maslow's hierarchy must have been met in order to acquire this level, seeking to fulfill this form of satisfaction can be defined as an explicit motive. An explicit motive can be defined as a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically pursue certain values or goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Individuals who are motivated to pursue this level are seeking and understanding how their sense of self-partakes within their human behavior. Self-actualization can include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*Mate Acquisition
*Parenting 
*Utilizing Abilities 
*Utilizing Talents 
*Pursuing a goal 
*Seeking Happiness

=== Transcendence ===
{{Main|Transcendence}}
In his later years, Abraham Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1996). Critique of self-actualization theory. In: E. Hoffman (Ed.), ''Future visions: The unpublished papers of Abraham Maslow.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 26–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1969). The farther reaches of human nature. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' 1:1, pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1971). ''The farther reaches of human nature.'' New York: The Viking Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koltko-Rivera, Mark E. (2006). Rediscovering the later version of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: Self-transcendence and opportunities for theory, research, and unification, ''Review of General Psychology'' 10:4, pp. 302-317. [http://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/Readings%20595/Koltko-Rivera%2006%20trans%20self-act%20copy.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; By this later theory, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself — for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Romeu, Albert. (2010). Self-transcendence as a measurable transpersonal construct. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 421, p. 26-47 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Albert_Garcia-Romeu/publication/271706485_Self-transcendence_as_a_measurable_transpersonal_construct/links/5501b17d0cf2d60c0e5fdfeb.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the [[cosmos]]" (''Farther Reaches of Human Nature'', New York 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;269).

== Research ==

Recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, although the hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Villarica|first= H.|date=August 17, 2011|title= Maslow 2.0: A new and improved recipe for happiness|website=theatlantic.com|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/08/maslow-20-a-new-and-improved-recipe-for-happiness/243486/#.TkvKIRv8USE.facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tay | first1 = L. | last2 = Diener | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Needs and subjective well-being around the world | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 354–365 | doi = 10.1037/a0023779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], the unmet needs of homeless and orphaned children presented difficulties that were often addressed with the help of [[attachment theory]], which was initially based on Maslow and others'  developmental psychology work by [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref name="Bretherton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bretherton, I. |title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth |year=1992 |journal=Developmental Psychology |pages=759–775 |volume=28 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally dealing primarily with [[maternal deprivation]] and concordant losses of essential and primal needs, attachment theory has since been extended to provide explanations of nearly all the human needs in Maslow's hierarchy, from sustenance and mating to group membership and justice.&lt;ref name="Bugental"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bugental DB|year= 2000|title= Acquisition of the Algorithms of Social Life: A Domain-Based Approach|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume= 126|pages= 178–219|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.126.2.187|pmid=10748640|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Unlike most scientific theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs has widespread influence outside academia. As Uriel Abulof argues, "The continued resonance of Maslow's theory in popular imagination, however unscientific it may seem, is possibly the single most telling evidence of its significance: it explains human nature as something that most humans immediately recognize in themselves and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Introduction: Why We Need Maslow in the Twenty-First Century|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0198-6|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=508|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0198-6|issn=0147-2011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, academically, Maslow's theory is heavily contested.

=== Methodology ===
Maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and [[Frederick Douglass]] rather than [[mentally ill]] or [[neurosis|neurotic]] people, writing that "the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy."&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954" /&gt;{{rp|236}}
Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mittelman|first1=W.|year=1991|title=Maslow's study of self-actualization: A reinterpretation|url=|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=114–135|doi=10.1177/0022167891311010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ranking ===
==== Global ranking ====
In their extensive review of research based on Maslow's theory, Wahba and Bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahba | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Bridwell | first2 = L. G. | year = 1976 | title = Maslow reconsidered: A review of research on the need hierarchy theory | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Performance | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 212–240 | doi = 10.1016/0030-5073(76)90038-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order in which the hierarchy is arranged has been criticized as being ethnocentric by [[Geert Hofstede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = The cultural relativity of the quality of life concept | url = http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/Articles/The%20cultural%20relativity%20of%20the%20quality%20of%20life%20concept.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–398 | doi = 10.5465/amr.1984.4279653 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000247/http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/Articles/The%20cultural%20relativity%20of%20the%20quality%20of%20life%20concept.pdf | archivedate = 2014-11-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in [[Individualism|individualistic]] societies and those raised in [[Collectivism|collectivist]] societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cianci | first1 = R. | last2 = Gambrel | first2 = P. A. | year = 2003 | title = Maslow's hierarchy of needs: Does it apply in a collectivist culture | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Management and Entrepreneurship | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 143–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ranking of sex ====
The position and value of sex on the pyramid has also been a source of criticism regarding Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category along with food and breathing; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective. For example, sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers "higher" levels of motivation. Some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenrick|first= D. |date=May 19, 2010|title= Rebuilding Maslow's pyramid on an evolutionary foundation. |website= psychologytoday.com/|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201005/rebuilding-maslow-s-pyramid-evolutionary-foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

==== Changes to the hierarchy by circumstance ====

The higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs classification of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.

In one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = West | first2 = W. B. | year = 1997 | title = The importance of human needs during peacetime, retrospective peacetime, and the Persian Gulf War | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of the US citizens.

Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Importance of human needs during retrospective peacetime and the Persian Gulf War: Mid-eastern employees | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 25–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = A. H. | last3 = West | first3 = W. B. | year = 2002 | title = Effects of war-related stress on the satisfaction of human needs: The United States and the Middle East | url = | journal = International Journal of Management Theory and Practices | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 35–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goebel | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. R. | year = 1981 | title = Age differences in motivation related to Maslow's need hierarchy | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 809–815 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.17.6.809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.

=== Definition of terms ===
==== Self-actualization ====
The term "self-actualization" may not universally convey Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2018}} Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others, or "the greater good".{{Original research inline|date=April 2018}}

=== Human or non-human needs ===
Abulof argues that  while Maslow stresses that "motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric," his theory erects a largely animalistic pyramid, crowned with a human edge: "Man's higher nature rests upon man's lower nature, needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… Our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities." Abulof notes that "all animals seek survival and safety, and many animals, especially mammals, also invest efforts to belong and gain esteem... The first four of Maslow's classical five rungs feature nothing exceptionally human."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when it comes to "self-actualization," Abulof argues, it is unclear how distinctively human is the actualizing "self." After all, the latter, according to Maslow, constitutes "an inner, more biological, more instinctoid core of human nature," thus "the search for one's own intrinsic, authentic values" checks the human freedom of choice: "A musician must make music," so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

[[File:Metered-dose Inhaler.JPG|thumb|Metered-dose Inhaler]]
A '''metered-dose inhaler''' ('''MDI''') is a device that delivers a specific amount of medication to the [[lung]]s, in the form of a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. It is the most commonly used delivery system for treating [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. The medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a [[bronchodilator]], [[corticosteroid]] or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Other medications less commonly used but also administered by MDI are mast cell stabilizers, such as [[cromoglicate]] or [[nedocromil]].

== Description ==
[[File:MDI components.jpg|thumb|MDI canister and actuator components from H&amp;T Presspart]]

A metered-dose inhaler consists of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of [[deep drawing]], where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs.&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology'', ed. A. J. Hickey, 2nd edition, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="EoPT" /&gt; The formulation itself is made up of the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising [[excipients]]. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.

To use the inhaler the patient presses down on the top of the canister, with their thumb supporting the lower portion of the actuator. Actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant. Breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets, followed by rapid evaporation of these droplets, results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometer-sized medication particles that are then inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, W. H., ''The Mechanics of Inhaled Pharmaceutical Aerosols: An Introduction'', Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Metered-dose inhalers are only one type of [[inhaler]], but they are the most commonly used type. The replacement of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] propellants with [[hydrofluoroalkanes]] (HFA) resulted in the redesign of metered-dose inhalers in the 1990s. For one variety of [[beclomethasone]] inhaler, this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced, and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 2.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Busse W, Colice G, Hannon S | year = 1998 | title = CFC-BDP require 2.6 times the dose to achieve equivalent improvement in FEV1 as HFA-BDP | url = | journal = Am J Respir Crit Med | volume = 157 | issue = | page = A405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*''Asthma inhalers'' contain a [[asthma medication|medication]] that treats the symptoms of asthma.
*Metered-dose inhalers can be used to treat COPD, both in stable state and during lung attacks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011826.pub2/abstract|title=Bronchodilators delivered by nebuliser versus pMDI with spacer or DPI for exacerbations of COPD|last=van Geffen|first=Wouter H|last2=Douma|first2=W R|last3=Slebos|first3=Dirk Jan|last4=Kerstjens|first4=Huib AM|date=2016-08-29|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011826.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Dry powder inhaler]]s''  involve micronised powder often packaged in single dose quantities in [[Blister pack|blisters]] or gel capsules containing the powdered medication to be drawn into the [[lung]]s by the user's own breath. These systems tend to be more expensive than the MDI, and patients with severely compromised lung function, such as occurs during an asthma attack, may find it difficult to generate enough airflow to get good function from them.
*A ''nicotine inhaler'' allows [[cigarette]] smokers to get [[nicotine]] without using [[tobacco]], much like nicotine gum or a nicotine patch. The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved some nicotine inhaler product(s?) for [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref name=Drummond2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drummond|first1=MB|last2=Upson|first2=D|title=Electronic cigarettes. Potential harms and benefits.|journal=Annals of the American Thoracic Society|date=February 2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=236–42|pmid=24575993|doi=10.1513/annalsats.201311-391fr|pmc=5469426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine inhalers that are marketed as [[nicotine replacement therapy]] should not be confused with [[electronic cigarette]]s, which produce an aerosol, usually from a tobacco extract, using a heating coil, while nicotine inhalers produce a noncombusted nicotine aerosol.&lt;ref name=Drummond2014/&gt; A study found that "levels of carcinogens and toxins in e-cigarettes typically exceeded those measured in an FDA-approved nicotine inhaler".&lt;ref name=Drummond2014/&gt; Nicotine inhalers are also known by their nickname of “the puffer”. These devices are made of thin plastic, sometimes resembling a cigarette, or a cylinder shape. They contain a porous nicotine-filled plug, located in the base of the product. When you puff on the inhaler, nicotine aerosol is inhaled and absorbed in the mouth’s lining. Every inhaler delivers almost four hundred puffs of this nicotine vapor. The nicotine inhaler is also temperature sensitive. In cooler weather, less nicotine is delivered. The Nicotine Inhaler is considered easier to use than the electronic cigarette as it is usually disposable, and contains fewer parts than the electronic cigarette.

== History ==

Before the invention of the MDI, asthma medication was delivered using a squeeze bulb [[nebulizer]] which was fragile and unreliable.&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Purewal|first=Tol S.|author2=D. Grant|title=Metered Dose Inhaler Technology|publisher=Informa Health Care|year=1997|edition=Illustrated|isbn=1-57491-065-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large, too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs.&lt;ref name="EoPT"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd Illustrated| publisher = Informa Health Care| isbn = 0-8493-9394-9| pages = 1170| last = Swarbrick| first = James| title = Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless these nebulizers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the MDI.

MDIs were first developed in 1955 by Riker Laboratories, now a subsidiary of [[3M|3M Healthcare]].&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997" /&gt;  At that time MDIs represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] propellant and the Meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume.&lt;ref name="Clark 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/02786829408959755| volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 374–391| last = Clark| first = A. R| title = Medical Aerosol Inhalers: Past, Present, and Future| journal = Aerosol Science and Technology| year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial design by Riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience.&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997" /&gt;  By 1956 Riker had developed two MDI based products, the Medihaler-Ept containing [[epinephrine]] and the Medihaler-Iso containing [[Isoprenaline]].&lt;ref name="EoPT" /&gt;  Both products are [[agonist]]s which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by [[salbutamol]], which is more selective.

== Spacers ==
{{main|Asthma spacer}}
Metered-dose inhalers are sometimes used with add-on devices referred to as holding chambers or spacers, which are tubes attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce the speed at which the aerosol enters the mouth. They serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler. This makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air. With proper use, a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Togger D., Brenner P. | year = 2001 | title = Metered dose inhalers | url = | journal = American Journal of Nursing | volume = 101 | issue = 10| page = 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacers can be especially helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use. People who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine in their mouth, where [[Oral candidiasis|oral yeast infections]] and [[dysphonia]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;""Inhalation Aerosols: Physical and Biological Basis for Therapy"", ed. A. J. Hickey, 2nd edition, Informa Healthcare, NY, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifespan and replacement ==
The deposition of the content of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an MDI [[inhaler]]. Applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life. Over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the canister and valve to protect the contents from deposition and degradation.
Gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire MDI [[inhaler]] and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either Radio Frequency (RF) or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma. This coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the MD [[inhaler]] and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication, whilst also extending the product's shelf-life.

A metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of actuations (or "puffs") which is printed on the canister.  Even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. It is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. For this reason, several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator. Several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counter-actuator. Depending on the manufacturer and the product, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription.

== Propellants ==
[[File:Cipla inhaler.jpg|thumb|CFC-free Asthalin HFA inhaler]]
One of the most crucial components of a MDI is its propellant. The propellant provides the force to generate the aerosol cloud and is also the medium in which the active component must be suspended or dissolved. Propellants in MDIs typically make up more than 99% of the delivered dose,&lt;ref name=Noakes&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Noakes| first = T | title = Medical Aerosol Propellants  | journal = Journal of Fluorine Chemistry  | volume = 118  | issue = 1–2  | pages = 35–45  | year = 2002  | doi =   10.1016/S0022-1139(02)00191-4  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is the properties of the propellant that dominate more than any other individual factor.  This is often overlooked in literature and in industry because so few propellants are used and their contribution is often taken for granted.  Suitable propellants must pass a stringent set of criteria, they must:
* have a boiling point in the range -100 to +30&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipacmdi.com/documents/EPC.pdf|title=Ensuring Patient Care|author1=William Gore|author2=Ian Tansey|publisher=[[International Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium|IPAC]]|accessdate=2009-04-14|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041328/http://www.ipacmdi.com/documents/EPC.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have a density of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately that of the drug to be suspended or dissolved)&lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;
* have a [[vapour pressure]] of 40 to 80 psig &lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Leach| first = C L | title = Approaches and Challenges to Use Freon Propellant Replacements  | journal = Aerosol Science and Technology  | volume = 22  | issue = 4  | pages = 328–334  | date =   | year = 1995  | url =   | doi =   10.1080/02786829408959750| id =  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have no toxicity to the patient &lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;
* be non-flammable &lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;
* be able to dissolve common additives (active ingredients should be either fully soluble or fully insoluble)&lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;

=== Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) ===
In the early days of MDIs the most commonly used propellants were the [[chlorofluorocarbons]] [[CFC-11]], [[CFC-12]] and [[CFC-114]].

=== Transition to HFA (hydrofluoroalkane) propellants ===
In 2008 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] announced that inhalers using [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s as a propellant, such as [[Primatene Mist]], could no longer be manufactured or sold as of 2012.&lt;ref name="cnn2011"&gt;{{cite news| title= No more Primatene Mist in the U.S. after this year | date= September 22, 2011 | url= http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/22/no-more-primatene-mist-in-the-u-s-after-this-year/ | author = Saundra Young | work= The Chart (blog)| publisher= CNN | accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed from the U.S. decision to agree to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.&lt;ref name="CFCdiscontinued"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/gef/05/documents/publications/MontrealProtocol_WEB.pdf |title=The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227134139/http://www.undp.org/gef/05/documents/publications/MontrealProtocol_WEB.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surfactant lipids ==
[[Phospholipids]] are important natural [[surfactant]] lipids &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1658851A1.pdf Anti-asthmatic combinations comprising surface active phospholipids]&lt;/ref&gt; used in enhancing penetration and bioavailability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20120308617.pdf PHOSPHOLIPID-BASED INHALATION SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt; Phospholipids act by reducing the high [[surface tension]] forces at the air-water interface within the [[alveoli]], thereby reducing the pressure needed to expand the lungs, Thus, commercially available formulations of phospholipids have been designed to spread rapidly over an air-aqueous interface, thereby reducing what is otherwise a very high surface tension of water.

== Colours ==
For ease of identification, many MDI's are colour-coded

[[Image:Mision Vuelvan Caras.png|left|89px]]
'''Vuelvan Caras''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "About Face", in the sense of turning to face in another direction),&lt;ref&gt;The name derives from a famous expression said to have been used by [[José Antonio Páez]] at the [[Battle of Las Queseras del Medio]] (1819), ordering his troops to turn and face the Spanish cavalry.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the [[Bolivarian Missions]], a series of anti-poverty and social welfare programs implemented by [[Hugo Chávez]], current [[President of Venezuela]]. It has as its objective the transformation of the present [[Economy of Venezuela|Venezuelan economy]] to one that is oriented towards social, rather than fiscal and remunerative, goals. It seeks to facilitate increased involvement of ordinary citizens in programs of endogenous and sustainable social development, emphasizing in particular the involvement of traditionally marginalized or excluded Venezuelan social and economic sectors, including those participating in Venezuela's significant "informal" economy. The mission's ultimate goal, according to Hugo Chávez, is to foster an economy that brings "a quality and dignified life for all."

'''MyFitnessPal''' is a smartphone [[mobile app|app]] and [[website]] that tracks [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[exercise]] to determine optimal [[food calorie|caloric]] intake and [[nutrients]] for the users' goals and uses [[gamification]] elements to motivate users. Users can either scan the barcodes of various food items or manually add them in the database of over five million different foods. Working in conjunction with over 50 devices and apps including Fitbit and Garmin wearable devices users can synchronize their health data to third-party devices for easier mobility. In a ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' diet rating, the free version of MyFitnessPal was rated the best free program (with 83 points) in overall satisfaction, "maintenance, calorie awareness, and food variety".&lt;ref name=Montgomery&gt;{{cite web|title='My Fitness Pal' tops list on Consumer Reports' new diet ratings|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2013/01/my-entry-2/|magazine=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Reports Rates Diet Plans: MyFitnessPal, A Free App And Website, More Satisfying Than Weight Watchers|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumer-reports-rates-diet-plans-myfitnesspal-a-free-app-and-website-more-satisfying-than-weight-watchers-185440082.html|magazine=Consumer Reports|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{cite news|author=Bates, Claire|title=Desperate to beat the bulge?

==History==
In 2005, MyFitnessPal was founded by Albert Lee and Mike Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyFitnessPal company profile|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myfitnesspal|publisher=CrunchBase|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2015, MyFitnessPal was acquired by athletic apparel maker, [[Under Armour]], in a deal worth $475 million. MyFitnessPal had 80 million users at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Perez, Sarah|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/athletic-apparel-company-under-armour-snatches-up-health-and-fitness-trackers-endomondo-and-myfitnesspal/|title=Under Armour Snatches Up Health And Fitness Trackers Endomondo And MyFitnessPal|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=Feb 4, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2015, MyFitnessPal introduced a premium subscription tier for its applications. According to Mike Lee, the premium service allows subscribers "to make custom reports, to dig deeper into the nutrient density of the food, and to customize the measurements used to plan their meals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Popper, Ben|title=MyFitnessPal rolls out its first paid offering, a premium service for exercise buffs|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8542487/myfitnesspal-premium-paid-service-under-armour|work=[[The Verge]]|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Coffee Cup''' was a campaign conducted by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats']] plans to extend [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. As part of the plan, doctors' wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to [[United States Congress|Congress]] opposing the program. The operation received support from [[Ronald Reagan]], who in 1961 produced the [[LP record]] ''[[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine]]'' for the AMA, outlining arguments against what he called [[socialized medicine]]. This record would be played at the coffee meetings.

==Background==

The AMA had long opposed any government-run or subsidized provision of health care. Dr. Morris Fishbein, the AMA’s president, described the organization’s attitude as early as 1939:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...all forms of security, compulsory security, even against old age and unemployment, represent a beginning invasion by the state into the personal life of the individual, represent a taking away of individual responsibility, a weakening of national caliber, a definite step toward either communism or totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/operation-coffeecup-reaga_b_45444.html "Operation Coffeecup: Reagan, the AMA, And the First 'Viral Marketing' Campaign ... Against Medicare"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 25 May 2011. Retrieved on 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As John F. Kennedy took the presidency, one of his priorities was reform of the American health care system. To that end he sent a health care bill to Congress, HR 4222, known as the King-Anderson legislation after its sponsors (Senator Anderson and [[Cecil R. King|Rep. Cecil King]], of California). &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ssa.gov/history/corningchap4.html "Social Security History"], ''SocialSecurity.gov'', Retrieved on 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140331044617/http://texasbestgrok.mu.nu/archives/038360.php "TexasBestGrok: Operation Coffeecup"], 23 July 2004. Retrieved on 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill provisioned a significant expansion of the government’s role in caring for the elderly, including features of what would eventually become Medicare.

Former Alaskan Governor [[Sarah Palin]] quoted Ronald Reagan during the 2008 Vice-Presidential debate, "It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We don’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or we’re going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free." Paul Krugman of the ''New York Times'' incorrectly attributed this to the 1961 album,&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/raising-the-white-flag-of-surrender-to-medicare/?em ''NY Times'' attributes Palin's quote of Reagan to Operation Coffeecup] &lt;/ref&gt; but Reagan did not actually use the phrase "freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction" in this speech. That came in his address to the annual meeting of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, on 30 March 1961.

A '''phlegmon''' is a localized area of acute inflammation of the soft tissues. It is a descriptive term which may be used for inflammation related to a bacterial infection or non-infectious causes (e.g. pancreatitis). Most commonly, it is used in contradistinction to a "walled-off" [[pus]]-filled collection ([[abscess]]), although a phlegmon may progress to an abscess if untreated. A phlegmon can localize anywhere in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=William|date=April 17, 1830|title=Lectures on Surgery: Diseases of the Cellular System.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwgGunvjMnMC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=9H3Jwswdyi|journal=London Medical Gazette|volume=|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term ''phlegmōn'' is from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] ''φλέγω'' (phlégō, “burn”).

==Signs and symptoms==
As with any form of inflammation, phlegmon presents with inflammatory signs [[Pain|dolor]] (localized pain), [[Heat|calor]] (increase local tissue temperature), [[rubor]] (skin redness/hyperemia), [[Swelling (medical)|tumor]] (either clear or non-clear bordered tissue swelling), [[functio laesa]] (diminish affected function). There may be systemic signs of infection, such as fever, general fatigue, chills, sweating, headache, loss of appetite.

==Cause==
Commonly caused by bacterial infection, as in the case of [[cellulitis]] or [[diverticulitis]]. Non-infectious causes of phlegmon include [[acute pancreatitis]], where inflammation is caused by leaking of pancreatic digestive enzymes into the surrounding tissues.

Factors affecting the development of phlegmon are virulence of bacteria and immunity strength.

==Diagnosis==
In modern medicine, ''phlegmon'' is mostly used descriptively in the fields of surgery/[[surgical pathology]] and [[medical imaging]]. The ultrasound and CT imaging findings of phlegmon are those of focal tissue edema, with no loculated fluid collection to suggest the formation of an abscess.

==Treatment==
Since phlegmon describes an area of inflammation, and not a specific disease process, the treatment depends on the cause and severity of the inflammation. Bacterial infections such as cellulitis may be treated by antibiotic therapy, depending on the severity.

A '''playboy lifestyle''' is the [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of a wealthy man with ample time for [[leisure]], who demonstratively is a ''[[bon viveur|bon vivant]]'' that appreciates the pleasures of the world, especially women. The term "playboy" was popular in the early to mid-20th century and is sometimes used to describe a conspicuous [[wikt:womanizer|womanizer]].  

==Development==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="The Original Playboys relied upon a perfect storm of pleasurable circumstances: The world was at peace; airplanes began flying internationally; their parents were members of the 1920s [[café society]] and raised progressive, well-mannered, fashion-forward children; they possessed unparalleled wealth, there was no Internet – as a result, they will forever remain an inimitable breed of elite, professional pleasure seekers, the likes of which the world will never see again."&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt;}}
Initially the term was used in the eighteenth century for boys who performed in the theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Levy S., p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and later it appears in the 1888 Oxford Dictionary to characterize a person with money who is out to enjoy himself.&lt;ref name=dr&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/merkmal/145601/default.htm | title=Riviera-Nichtstuer - Geschichte der Playboys. | author=Schultz, Ole | publisher=Deutschlandradio Kultur | date=February 13, 2003 | accessdate=December 20, 2010 | language=German | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210213740/http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/merkmal/145601/default.htm | archivedate=February 10, 2013 | df= }} link broken June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the nineteenth century it also implied the connotations of "gambler" and "musician".&lt;ref&gt;Levy S., p.117&lt;/ref&gt; By 1907, in [[J. M. Synge]]'s comedy ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'',  the term had acquired the notion of a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]]. According to [[Shawn Anthony Levy|Shawn Levy]], the term reached its full meaning in the interwar years and early post WWII years. Postwar intercontinental travel allowed playboys to meet at international nightclubs and famous "playgrounds" such as the [[Riviera]] or [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] where they were trailed by [[paparazzi]] who supplied the [[Tabloid press|tabloids]] with material to be fed to an eager audience. Their sexual conquests were rich, beautiful, and famous. In 1953, [[Hugh Hefner]] caught the wave and created the ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Levy S., p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous playboys==
[[Porfirio Rubirosa]], who died in a car crash in 1965, is an example of someone who embodied the playboy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dr/&gt; The diplomat claimed to have no time to work, being busy spending time with women, getting married briefly and in sequence to the two richest women in the world, drinking and gambling with his friends, playing polo, racing cars, and flying his airplane from party to party. He was linked to other famous playboys of his days [[Aly Khan]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; "Baby" Francisco Pignatari,&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; and later, [[Gunther Sachs]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; his acolyte, who termed himself a ''[[homo ludens]]''.&lt;ref name=dr/&gt;

Other people who adopted the playboy lifestyle included [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Dan Bilzerian]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[George Best]], [[Imran Khan]], [[James Hunt]], [[Howard Hughes]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Averell Harriman]],&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; [[Errol Flynn]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Gianni Agnelli]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Silvio Berlusconi]], [[John F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Alessandro Ruspoli, 9th Prince of Cerveteri|Alessandro "Dado" Ruspoli]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Carlos de Beistegui]],&lt;ref name="kempt"/&gt; [[Theodore Zichy|Count Theodore Zichy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Theodore_Zichy Zichy on the 'Art &amp; Popular Culture' website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Frost]],&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/aug/01/theatre2| title= When the playboy met the liar| date= August 1, 2006| work= The Guardian | accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernard Cornfeld]].

Fictional playboys include [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] from the [[DC Comics]] ''Batman'' franchise, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] from [[Marvel Entertainment]], [[Jack Donaghy]] from ''[[30 Rock]]'', and [[Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Charlie Harper]] from ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14890">'''Psychiatric disorders of childbirth''' are [[mental disorders]] developed by the mother related to the delivery process itself. They overlap with the organic [[pregnancy|prepartum]] and [[postpartum]] psychoses and other psychiatric conditions associated with having children. Symptoms include rage, or in rare cases, [[neonaticide]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006), Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium.  Bredenbury, Eyry Press, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many distinct forms of [[psychosis]] which start during [[pregnancy]] (prepartum) or after delivery (postpartum).  In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], only one – polymorphic psychosis ([[postpartum psychosis]])– is commonly seen. Postpartum bipolar disorder, referred to in the DSM-5 as bipolar, peripartum onset, is a separate condition with no psychotic features. Historically, about one quarter of psychoses after childbirth were 'organic' and would now be classified as a form of delirium.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 323-325.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that a severe mental disturbance, usually in the form of [[delirium]], develops as a complication of a [[somatic illness]].&lt;ref&gt;Lishman W A (1997) Organic Psychiatry, 3rd edition. Oxford, Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)==
{{anchor|Postpartum PTSD}}
{{main|Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder}}
Postpartum PTSD was first described in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Bydlowski M, Raoul-Duval A (1978) Un avatar psychique méconnu de la puerperalité: la névrose traumatique post obstétricale.  Perspectives Psychiatriques 4: 321-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then over 60 papers have been published.  After excessively painful labours, or those with a disturbing loss of control, fear of [[stillbirth]] or complications requiring emergency Caesarean section, some mothers suffer [[nightmare]]s, and [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive images and memories]] ('[[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s'), similar to those occurring after other harrowing experiences.  They can last for months.&lt;ref&gt;Söderquist J, Wijma B, Wijma K (2006) The longitudinal course of post-traumatic stress after childbirth.  Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology 27: 113-119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some avoid further pregnancy (secondary tocophobia), and those who become pregnant again may experience a return of symptoms, especially in the last [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]].  Rates up to 5.9% of deliveries have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Adewuya A O, Ologun Y A, Ibigbami O S (2006)  Post-traumatic stress disorder after childbirth in Nigerian women: prevalence and risk factors.  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 113: 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence that early [[counseling]] reduces these symptoms.  Enduring symptoms require specific psychological treatment.

==Tocophobia==
{{main|Tocophobia}}
The word comes from the Greek ''tokos'', meaning parturition.  Early authors like Ideler&lt;ref&gt;Ideler K W (1856)  Über den Wahnsinn der Schwangeren. Charité-Annalen 7: 28-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote about this fear, and, in 1937, Binder&lt;ref&gt;Binder H (1937) Psychiatrische Untersuchungen über die Folgen der operativen Sterilisierung der Frau durch partielle Tubenresektion. Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie und Psychiatrie 40: 1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to a group of women who sought [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] because of tocophobia. In the last 40 years there have been a series of papers published mainly from [[Scandinavia]]. Tocophobia can be primary (before the first child is born) or secondary (typically after extremely traumatic deliveries). Elective [[Caesarean section]] is one solution, but [[psychotherapy]] can also help these women to give birth [[Vaginal childbirth|vaginally]].&lt;ref&gt;Nerum H, Halvorsen L, Sørile T, Øian P (2006) Maternal request for Cesarean section due to fear of birth: can it be changed through crisis-orientated counseling? Birth 33: 221-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delirium==
===Infective delirium===
Postpartum infective delirium was described by [[Hippocrates]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates (5th century BC) Epidemics, volume 1, and Aphorisms, volume 4, in the edition translated by W H S Jones (1931).  London, Heineman.&lt;/ref&gt; 8/17 female cases in the 1st and 3rd books of epidemics suffered from postpartum or post-abortion sepsis, all complicated by delirium.  In Europe and North America the foundation of the metropolitan maternity hospitals, together with instrumental deliveries and the practice of attending [[Necropsy|necropsies]], led to [[epidemic]]s of streptococcal puerperal fever, resulting in maternal mortality rates up to 10%.  The peak was about 1870, after which [[antisepsis]] and [[asepsis]] gradually brought them under control.  These severe infections were often complicated by delirium, but it was not until the [[Nosology|nosological]] advances of [[Chaslin]] &lt;ref&gt;Chaslin P (1895) Confusion Mentale Primitive, Stupidité, Démence aiguë, Stupeur Primitive. Paris, Harmattan.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bonhöffer &lt;ref&gt;Bonhöffer K (1910) Die symptomatischen Psychosen im Gefolge von akuten Infektionen und inneren Erkrankungen. Leipzig and Wien, Deutlicke.&lt;/ref&gt; that they could be distinguished from other causes of postpartum psychosis.  Infective delirium hardly ever starts during pregnancy, and usually begins in the first postpartum week.  The onset of [[sepsis]] and delirium are closely related, and the course parallels the infection, although about 20% of patients recover from the infection, but develop chronic confusional states.  Recurrences after another pregnancy are rare.

===Ethanol withdrawal===
Alcohol withdrawal states ([[delirium tremens]]) are recognized in addicts whose intake has been interrupted by trauma or surgery. This can occur after childbirth.

===Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis===
A severe mental disorder was described by Wernicke &lt;ref&gt;Wernicke C (1881) Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten für Äezte und Studirende, volume 2. Kassel &amp; Berlin, Fischer, pages 229-242.&lt;/ref&gt; and Korsakoff.&lt;ref&gt;Korsakow S S (1887) Über eine besonderer Form psychischer Störung. Archiv für Psychiatrie21: 671-704.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its most striking feature is [[Amnesia|loss of memory]], which can be permanent.  The cause is vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ([[thiamine]]) deficiency, usually found in severe [[alcoholic]]s.  It can also result from pernicious vomiting of pregnancy ([[hyperemesis gravidarum]]).  Over 125 cases have been reported in the world literature and, although thiamine treatment has been available since 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 23-49.&lt;/ref&gt; these cases still occur in countries with advanced medical services, due to rehydration without vitamin supplements.  A few patients have developed symptoms after the death of the [[foetus]], miscarriage, termination of pregnancy or delivery.

===Water intoxication===
[[Hyponatraemia]] (which leads to delirium) can complicate [[oxytocin]] treatment, usually when given to induce an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 287-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperammonaemia===
Inborn errors of the [[Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle]] lead to [[hyperammonaemia]].  In carriers and [[heterozygote]]s, [[encephalopathy]] can develop in pregnancy or the puerperium.  Cases have been described in [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1]], [[argino-succinate synthetase]] and [[ornithine carbamoyltransferase]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the form of postpartum psychosis most recently described.&lt;ref&gt;Yamada N, Fukui M, Ishii K, Shibata H, Okabe H, Ohomiya H, Matsunobu A, Nishizima M 1980) A case of adult form hypercitrullinemia with consciousness disturbance and marked hypertransaminasenemia after delivery. Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkae Zasshi 77: 1655-1660.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chorea gravidarum===
Before the advent of antibiotics, [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]] infections occasionally led to a condition called ''Chorea gravidarum''. Chorea gravidarum, a severe variant of Sydenham's chorea, can have a number of [[psychiatric]] complications – character change, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Tourette's syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;Sandras C M S, Bourgignon H (1860) Traité Pratique des Maladies Nerveuses. Paris, Germer-Baillière, pages 397-411.&lt;/ref&gt; hypnogogic hallucinations,&lt;ref&gt;Marcé L V (1860) L'État mental dans la chorée. Mémoirés de l'Académie de Médecine 24: 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; defect states and acute [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Breton A (1893) État mental dans la chorée. Thèse, Paris, no. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; But it still occurs as a result of systemic [[lupus]] or anti-phospholipid syndromes. Nevertheless, chorea psychoses are very rare, with only about 50 prepartum cases reported in the literature.  Occasionally, they can break out after delivery, or after a [[Abortion|termination of pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidental causes===
All the above causes have a specific connection with childbearing.  But diseases that have no such connection can fortuitously lead to postpartum psychosis, for example [[neurosyphilis]], [[encephalitis]], [[meningitis]], [[thyroid disease]] or [[ischaemic heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 301-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vascular problems==
===Cerebral venous thrombosis===
Puerperal women are liable to [[thrombosis]], especially [[thrombophlebitis]] of the leg and pelvic veins.  Aseptic thrombi can also form in the dural venous [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es and the cerebral veins draining into them.  Most patients present with [[headache]], vomiting, seizures and focal signs such as [[hemiplegia]] or [[dysphasia]], but a minority of cases have a psychiatric presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Kalbag R M, Woolf A L (1967) Cerebral Venous Thrombosis, with Special Reference to Primary Aseptic Thrombosis. Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Cumulative incidence|incidence]] is about 10/10,000 births in Europe and North America,&lt;ref&gt;Lanska D J, Kryscio R J (2000) Risk factors for peripartum and postpartum stroke and intracranial venous thrombosis. Stroke 31: 1274-1282.&lt;/ref&gt; but much higher in [[India]], where large series have been collected.&lt;ref&gt;Srinavasan K (1988) Puerperal cerebral venous and arterial thrombosis. Seminars in Neurology 8:222-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypopituitarism===
[[Pituatary gland|Pituitary]] necrosis following postpartum haemorrhage ([[Sheehan's syndrome]]) leads to failure and [[atrophy]] of the [[gonads]], [[adrenal]] and [[thyroid]].  Chronic psychoses can supervene many years later, based on [[myxoedema]], [[hypoglycaemia]] or [[Addisonian crisis]].  But these patients can also develop acute and recurrent psychoses, even as early as the puerperium.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 279-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other vascular disorders===
Arterial occlusion may be due to [[Thrombus|thrombi]], amniotic fragments or air [[embolism]].  Postpartum cerebral [[angiopathy]] is a transitory arterial spasm of medium caliber cerebral arteries; it was first described in [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]] addicts, but can also complicate [[ergot]] and [[bromocriptine]] prescribed to inhibit [[lactation]].   [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]] can occur after miscarriage or childbirth.  [[Epidural anaesthesia]] can, if the [[dura mater|dura]] is punctured, lead to leakage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and subdural [[haematoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack T M (1982) Post-partum intracranial subdural haematoma.  A possible complication of epidural analgesia.  British Medical Journal 285: 972 only.&lt;/ref&gt;  All these can occasionally present with psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 239-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epilepsy==
Women with a lifelong epileptic history are also liable to psychoses during labour in the [[puerperium]].  Women occasionally develop epilepsy for the first time in relation to their first pregnancy, and psychotic episodes have been described.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 271-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International perspective on organic psychoses==
With the great improvement in obstetric care, severe complications of pregnancy and childbirth have become rare. There is, however, a great contrast between Europe, North America, Australia, Japan and some other countries with advanced medical care, and the rest of the world. The wealthiest nations produce only 10 million children each year, from a total of 135 million. They have a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 6–20/100,000.  Some poorer nations with high birth rates have an MMR more than 100 times as high,&lt;ref&gt;Hill K, AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Estimates of maternal mortality for 1995.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 79: 182-192.&lt;/ref&gt; and, presumably, a corresponding prevalence of severe morbidity.  For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 21 nations, with a combined birth rate of over 14 millions, have an MMR &gt;1,000/100,000.  Only a minority of deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are attended by skilled personnel ([[Physician|doctors]], [[nurse]]s or [[midwive]]s).&lt;ref&gt;AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Maternal mortality at the end of the decade. Bulletin or the World Health Organization 79: 561-573.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Dar es Salaam]], the majority of postpartum psychoses are organic.&lt;ref&gt;Ndosi N K, Mtawali M L, 2002) The nature of puerperal psychosis at Muhimbili National Hospital: its physical co-morbidity, associated main obstetric and social factors. African Journal of Reproductive Health 6: 41-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, India &amp; South East Asia, and Latin America, these organic disorders may still be as important as they have been throughout human history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30483">The developmental life stage of dogs requires a specific intake of nutrients to ensure proper growth and development and to meet energy requirements. Despite the fact that [[puppies]] have different nutritional requirements compared to their adult counterparts, of the 652 breeders surveyed in the United States and Canada in 2012, 8.7% report feeding puppies commercial diets not intended for the developmental life stage of canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connolly|first=K.M.|last2=Heinze|first2=C.R.|last3=Freeman|first3=L.M.|year=2014|title=Feeding practices of dog breeders in the United States and Canada|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=245|pages=669–676|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.245.6.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large and small dog breeds have even more specific nutrient requirements during growth, such as adjusted calcium to phosphorus ratio, and as such should receive a breed specific growth formula.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobenecker|first=B.|year=2004|title=Apparent calcium absorption in growing dogs of two different sizes|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=134|pages=21515–21535|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding diets formulated by a nutritionist for specific breed and life stage differences in nutrient requirements ensures a growing puppy will receive the proper nutrition associated with appropriate skeletal, neurological and immune development. This includes nutrients such as protein, fibre, essential fatty acids, calcium and vitamin E.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zicker|first=S.C.|last2=Jewell|first2=D.|last3=Yamka|first3=R.|last4=Milgram|first4=N.|year=2012|title=Evaluation of cognitive learning, memory, psychomotor, immunologic, and retinal functions in healthy puppies fed foods fortified with docosahexaenoic acid-rich fish oil from 8 to 52 weeks of age|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=24|pages=583–594|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tryfonidou|first=M.A.|last2=van den Broek|first2=J.|last3=van den Brom|first3=W.E.|last4=Hazewinkel|first4=H.A.|year=2002|title=Intestinal calcium absorption in growing dogs is influenced by calcium intake and age but not by growth rate|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=132|pages=3363–3368|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/132.11.3363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khoo|first=C.|last2=Cunnick|first2=J.|last3=Friesen|first3=K.|last4=Gross|first4=K.L.|last5=Wedekind|first5=K.|last6=Jewell|first6=D.E.|year=2005|title=The role of supplementary dietary antioxidants on immune response in puppies|url=|journal=Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=6|pages=43–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to feed puppies a diet that meets the minimum and/or maximum requirements established by the National Research Council.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutritional Requirements of Dogs and Cats|last=|first=|publisher=National Academics Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutritional requirements determined by the NRC are based on scientific evidence and used as the basis for nutritional adequacy in cats and dogs. However, these values are based on the assumption that the availability and digestibility of the nutrients are not variable, although in reality, this is not the case.  The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) also has recommended nutrient levels, but their values serve primarily as regulatory guidance. AAFCO bases their recommendations on feeding trials and are not necessarily supported by scientific evidence; however their nutritional adequacy statement on pet food bags is considered an important part of the label because their recommendations account for ingredient variability. Other agencies involved in pet food regulations include the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the United States who directly regulates the sales of pet food, the FEDIAF in Europe and PFIAA in Australia who recommend regulatory requirements for the pet food industry, as well as others. When selecting puppy food, it is important to consult the labels and ensure products meet the standards of regulatory agencies of your respective country.

== Energy ==
Young growing dogs require greater amounts of [[Food energy|energy]] per unit body mass than fully grown adult dogs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=G.|last2=Grandjean|first2=D.|last3=Paragon|first3=B.|year=1998|title=Calculation of a dietary plan for puppies|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=80|pages=54–59|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.1998.tb00501.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time of weaning until the puppy reaches 40% of the adult body weight, the optimal energy intake per unit body weight is twice that of an adult dog of the same breed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 40% to 80% of adult body weight, energy requirements decrease to 1.6 times the adult requirement, and from 80% to the end of growth, this decreases further to 1.2 times the adult energy requirement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of this, it is important to ensure that puppy diets contain higher amounts of energy than adult dog foods. However, over nutrition associated with feeding ''ad libitum'' results in accelerated skeletal growth and weight gain leading to osteopenia, especially in large breed dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dammrich|first=K.|year=1991|title=Relationship between nutrition and bone growth in large and giant dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=114–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, appropriate energy requirements should be met, but not exceeded in the growing dog.

Owners and puppy raisers should monitor their puppy’s weight gain by referencing a 9-point body condition score scale which is easily accessible on the internet, regularly weighing the puppy, and consulting with their veterinarian. Owners should also be mindful as to the energy level of their puppy; high energy level puppies will require more energy and may need to be fed extra amounts of food, just as lower energy puppies may require less food. The 9 point body condition score has been shown to be an effective method for estimating percent body fat in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mawby|first=D.I.|last2=Bartges|first2=J.W.|last3=d'Avignon|first3=A.|last4=Laflamme|first4=D.P.|last5=Moyers|first5=T.D.|last6=Cottrell|first6=T.|year=2004|title=Comparison of various methods for estimating body fat in dogs|url=|journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association|volume=40|pages=109–114|via=|doi=10.5326/0400109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by adhering to the 9 point body condition scale, and adjusting food intake accordingly, owners will be able to maintain their puppy at an appropriate weight throughout its growth. In addition to visual estimates of body condition, physical [[palpation]] of the pet can provide insight on general health and weight. Speaking to a licensed veterinarian can be very beneficial, as they can help develop these dietary and weight monitoring skills.

== Calcium and Phosphorus ==
An important aspect of the composition of puppy food is the [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] content.

== Fats and Fatty Acids ==
Fat is a nutrient that provides more energy per gram than all other nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canine and Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Daristotle|first2=L.|last3=Hayek|first3=M.J.|last4=Raasch|first4=M.F.|publisher=Mosby|year=2000|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO, USA|pages=17–19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat provides 9.4kcal/g of gross energy (GE) compared to protein and carbohydrate which only provide 5.56 and 4.15 kcal/g respectively.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this greater energy concentration and the higher energy demand of puppies, the higher fat content of canine development diets helps reach these increased energy requirements while also providing the [[essential fatty acid]]s necessary for the growing dog. [[Omega-3 fatty acid|Omega-3]] (n-3) fatty acids are an important component of puppy diets. Multiple studies suggest brain and retinal function are dependent on the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acquired during in utero development and postnatal life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=J.E.|last2=Heinemann|first2=K.M.|last3=Lees|first3=G.E.|last4=Waldron|first4=M.K.|year=2006|title=Retinal functions of young dogs are improved and maternal plasma phospholipids are altered with diets containing long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during gestation, lactation, and after weaning|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1991–1994|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinemann|first=K.M.|last2=Bauer|first2=J.E.|year=2006|title=Docosahexaenoic acid and neurologic development in animals|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=228|pages=700–705|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.228.5.700}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] is the main n-3 fatty acid and can be obtained as DHA itself from dietary sources such as fish and fish oils, or as the DHA precursor linolenic acid.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a high DHA intake, plasma lipid DHA content increases, aiding neurological development, as demonstrated by increases in memory and learning ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other benefits of n-3 and DHA include promotion of neurogenesis, increased neuron size and phospholipid synthesis, as well as protection against cell death and peroxidative brain damage by damaging [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=P.C.|last2=O'Kusky|first2=J.R.|last3=Innis|first3=S.M.|year=2006|title=Maternal dietary (n-3) fatty acid deficiency alters neurogenesis in the embryonic rat brain.|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1570–1575|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/136.6.1570}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rodent model and presumably across the mammalian kingdom. A deficit of dietary n-3 fatty acids leads to a reduction in brain DHA content by 50-80%, leading to cognitive deficits and increased n-6 fatty acid level which increases inflammation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Adequate intake and recommended allowance levels of 85g/kg (DM) of total fat (8.5%), and 0.5g/kg (DM) of omega 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) are laid out by the NRC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both of these values are also laid out as recommendations by AAFCO. However, according to a study on the effects of supplementing DHA in puppy diets, diets containing 1.4% n-3 fatty acids, or 0.19% DHA resulted in optimal neurological function.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vitamin E ==
Along with DHA, [[vitamin E]] also supports the proper development of eyesight, reduces oxidative damage, and provides additional immune function support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During instances of immune system stimulation, such as vaccinations and infection, immune cells generate more tissue damaging free radicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These free radicals are reduced by the action of antioxidants such as vitamin E, which promote the formation and maintenance of healthy immune cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The adequate intake level laid out by the NRC consists of 24&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (36 IU/kg) of vitamin E, with a recommended allowance of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (45 IU/kg).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the regulatory guidance laid out by AAFCO states a vitamin E minimum recommendation of 50 IU/kg DM. Nonetheless, these values have been shown to be insufficient for immune protection; immune function is best optimized at a level of 500 IU/kg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to prevention of free radical damage, this higher level of vitamin E greatly increases the number of memory [[Memory T cell|CD4+ immune cells]], aiding in a greater and a longer response to infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to their still-developing immune system, puppies are more susceptible to infection than adult dogs, and proper levels of vitamin E, as indicated above, are needed in their diet.

== Fibre ==
Although young growing dogs have immature gastrointestinal tracts, they do contain [[Microbiota|microflora]] which can ferment [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] and generate [[Short-chain fatty acid|short chain fatty acids]] beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.|last2=Fahey|first2=G.|last3=Corbin|first3=J.|last4=Pugh|first4=J.|last5=Franklin|first5=R.|year=1981|title=Evaluation of byproduct feedstuffs as dietary ingredients for dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=53|pages=1538–1544|via=|doi=10.2527/jas1982.5361538x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvio|first=J.|last2=Harmon|first2=D.L.|last3=Gross|first3=K.L.|last4=McLeod|first4=K.R.|year=2000|title=Influence of fiber fermentability on nutrient digestion in the dog|url=|journal=Nutrition|volume=16|pages=289–295|via=|doi=10.1016/s0899-9007(99)00298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization and establishment of these bacterial populations happens over time, beginning immediately after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buddington|first=R.K.|year=2003|title=Postnatal changes in bacterial populations in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=64|pages=646–651|via=|doi=10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the ability for fermentation, addition of fibre to the diet should be done carefully, as fibre will dilute other nutrients in the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=C.B.|last2=Barrette|first2=D.|last3=Monean|first3=R.|last4=Lariviere|first4=R.|year=1985|title=The effect of dietary fibre on feed intake and growth in beagle puppies|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Comparative Medicine|volume=49|pages=278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different types of fibre, all are made of carbohydrates, and NRC classifies them into fermentable and non-fermentable carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fermentable carbohydrates are generally 3-10 monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic bonds which cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes and require the fermentation processes of intestinal microflora for proper degradation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-fermentable fibres are carbohydrate structures which are not fully fermented even by intestinal microflora. Little research has been done on non-fermentable fibre, however it is known that it causes fecal bulking and reduced intestinal transit time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been shown that addition of non-fermentable fibre in concentrations of 22% or greater of the total diet will reduce growth, feed intake and feed efficiency.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Fermentable fibre is more beneficial for growing puppies, and it is often considered a prebiotic, meaning it supports the growth of beneficial microflora species in the intestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=G.R.|last2=Roberfroid|first2=M.B.|year=1995|title=Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: Introducing the concept of prebiotics|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=125|pages=1401–1412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermentable fibre often contains [[Fructooligosaccharide|fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS) and [[Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements|mannanoligosaccharides]] (MOS), both of which greatly stimulate gut health.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=K.S.|last2=Grieshop|first2=C.M.|last3=Flickinger|first3=E.A.|last4=Healy|first4=H.P.|last5=Dawson|first5=K.A.|last6=Merchen|first6=N.R.|last7=Fahey Jr.|first7=G.C.|year=2002|title=Effects of supplemental fructooligosaccharides plus mannanoligosaccharides on immune function and ileal and fecal microbial populations in adult dogs|url=|journal=Archives of Animal Nutrition|volume=46|pages=309–318|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOS are fermented by beneficial bacteria such as [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]] promoting their growth, while most pathogenic bacterial strains such as E. coli, C. perfringens and Salmonella are unable to ferment it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS has been shown to stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Beet pulp is generally the standard fermentable fibre used in canine diets, however blends of fermentable fibre sources have been shown to be as effective at promoting gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelbos|first=I.S.|last2=Fastinger|first2=N.D.|last3=Fahey|first3=G.C.|year=2007|title=Evaluation of fermentable oligosaccharides in diets fed to dogs in comparison to fiber standards|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=85|pages=3033–3044|via=|doi=10.2527/jas.2007-0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fermentable fibre is extremely beneficial, it should still be added in moderate amounts as addition of fermentable fibre to a concentration of 14.1% or greater will result in lower digestibility of the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Protein ==
Growing puppies require higher levels of [[protein]] than adult dogs of the same breed to promote proper growth and development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Czarnecki-Maudlen|first2=G.L.|year=1990|title=Protein requirements of growing pups fed practical dry-type diets containing mixed-protein sources|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=51|pages=808–812|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein should account for at least 25% of energy; however protein requirements also depend on the digestibility of the protein and age of the puppy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Amino acid]] and nitrogen requirements decrease between 10–14 weeks, indicating that different protein levels are often beneficial before and after 14 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before 14 weeks of age, a protein level of 250 g/kg of diet (25% of the diet) containing 4.0 kcal ME/g will result in optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ontko|first=J.A.|last2=Wuthier|first2=R.E.|last3=Phillips|first3=P.H.|year=1957|title=The effect of increased dietary fat upon the protein requirement of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=62|pages=163–169|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/62.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 weeks of age, protein requirements decrease to 200 g/kg of diet (20% of the diet) for optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gessert|first=C.F.|last2=Phillips|first2=P.H.|year=1956|title=Protein in the nutrition of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=123|pages=610–625|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burns|first=R.A.|last2=Milner|first2=J.A.|year=1982|title=Threonine, tryptophan and histidine requirements of immature beagle dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=112|pages=447–452|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/112.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=S.J.|last2=Hill|first2=A.S.|last3=Backus|first3=R.C.|last4=Czarnecki-Maulden|first4=G.L.|last5=Rogers|first5=Q.R.|year=2001|title=Dietary crude protein concentration does not affect the leucine requirements of growing dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=85|pages=88–100|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0396.2001.00306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein in excess of these levels is metabolized and leads to an increase of the glomerular filtration rate, and increased [[urea]] excretion in the urine, with no evidence of damage to the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nap|first=R.C.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.A.|last3=Voorhout|first3=G.|last4=Van den Brom|first4=W.E.|last5=Goedegebuure|first5=S.A.|last6=Van'T Klooster|first6=A.T.|year=1991|title=Growth and skeletal development in Great Dane pups fed different levels of protein intake|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=107–113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, addition of protein past these requirements is not recommended, although the NRC has not quantified a safe upper limit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Considering that the energy density of protein is similar to that of carbohydrates, an excess of protein in the diet may lead to fat deposition and weight gain.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This excess weight can lead to abnormal joint development, potentially giving rise to joint issues in the future. Additionally, excess of some amino acids may also have detrimental impacts; for example, excess lysine will negatively antagonise arginine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=D.A|last2=Baker|first2=D.H.|year=1986|title=Lysine requirements of growing puppies fed practical and purified diets|url=|journal=Nutrition Research|volume=6|pages=527–538|via=|doi=10.1016/s0271-5317(86)80106-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimal requirement laid out by the NRC is 180g/kg (18%) DM of crude protein, with a recommended allowance of 225g/kg (22.5%) DM.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With this in mind, it is also important to consider the quality and digestibility of the protein used.

== Iodine ==
To date, there is little information available about minimum requirements of dietary iodine for developing puppies. However, literature suggests that overdosage of iodine in puppies has deleterious effects on the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Lalia|first2=J.C.|last3=Junco|first3=M.|last4=Sartorio|first4=G.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.|last6=Rodriguez|first6=M.S.|last7=Pisarev|first7=M.A.|year=2001|title=Changes in thyroid function in puppies fed a high iodine commercial diet|url=|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=161|issue=80-84|pages=|via=|doi=10.1053/tvjl.2000.0523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Pisarev|first2=M.A.|last3=Lalia|first3=J.C.|last4=Cabrini|first4=R.L.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.G.|year=2001|title=Nutrition: commercial diet induced hypothyroidism due to high iodine.

The NRC states an adequate intake and recommended allowance of 900 μg/kg (DM) which translates into 220μg/1000 kcal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These values have been shown in multiple studies to be the recommended maximum allowance of iodine that would result in no abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norris|first=W.|last2=Fritz|first2=T.|last3=Taylor|first3=J.A.|year=1970|title=Cycle of accommodation to restricted dietary iodine in thyroid gland of the beagle dog|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=31|pages=21–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belshaw|first=B.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Becker|first3=D.|year=1975|title=The iodine requirement and influence of iodine intake on iodine metabolism and thyroid function in the adult beagle|url=|journal=Endocrinology|volume=96|pages=1280–1291|via=|doi=10.1210/endo-96-5-1280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Canine development diets are designed specifically to meet the energy demands and nutritional requirements for healthy growth. Proper nutrition is imperative to support development of bones, joints, muscles, and the immune system, and includes the addition of nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, calcium, fibre, vitamin E, and others. Ensuring optimal energy intake allows the diet to meet the high energy demands of puppies while avoiding over nutrition, over-accelerated growth, and unhealthy weight gain. Dietary fats also help to meet these high energy demands and provide the essential fatty acids necessary for brain, neuron, and retinal development and function.  Since growing puppies require greater amounts of protein than their adult counterparts, it is important to include the appropriate amounts to support healthy development. Correct levels of both fermentable and non-fermentable fibre help to support GI and immune health. During growth, young dogs are more susceptible to infection, but the addition of proper levels of vitamin E to the diet reduces free radical oxidative damage and leads to an increase in immunity. Calcium and phosphorus, in the appropriate amounts and ratio, aid in proper bone and cartilage growth and maturation. It is imperative to be aware of the levels of other minerals as well, as the over-dosage of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and the delay in maturation and development of bones. It is therefore important to feed a diet that meets the nutrient minimum and/or maximum requirements established by the National Research Council in order to ensure optimal growth and development of young dogs of all breeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">A '''rate ratio''' (sometimes called an '''incidence density ratio''') in [[epidemiology]], is a relative difference measure used to compare the [[incidence rate]]s of events occurring at any given point in time.  A common application for this measure in analytic epidemiologic studies is in the search for a causal association between a certain [[risk factor]] and an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellan|first=Steve|title=Study Design and Analysis in Epidemiology: Where does modeling fit?|url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/getzlab/people/Bellan%20-%20Study%20Design%20and%20Analysis%20in%20Epidemiology.ppt|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where incidence rate is the occurrence of an event over person-time, for example person-years.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Incidence Rate} = \frac{\text{events}}{\text{person time}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Sanity Fair''' is a festival that takes place each year in the city of [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[England]]. The reason for the day is to tackle the issues of [[mental illness]], raise awareness, and celebrate [[emotional well-being]].

== Information ==
Sanity Fair began in 2001 as a small event held mainly indoors. Each year around 30 stores are placed around with information available. There is also a band that plays on the live stage that is placed at the bottom of Piccadilly, in which a parade marches through the streets of [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]].

'''Sedimentation''' is a physical [[water treatment]] process using [[gravity]] to remove [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] solids from water.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Solid particles entrained by the turbulence of moving water may be removed naturally by sedimentation in the still water of lakes and oceans.  [[Settling basin]]s are ponds constructed for the purpose of removing entrained solids by sedimentation.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; [[Clarifier]]s are tanks built with mechanical means for continuous removal of solids being deposited by sedimentation.&lt;ref name=b2/&gt; Clarification does not removed dissolved species.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

==Basics==
[[Suspended solids]] (or SS), is the mass of dry solids retained by a [[water filter|filter]] of a given [[porosity]] related to the volume of the water sample. This includes particles 10&amp;nbsp;μm and greater.

[[Colloid]]s are particles of a size between 0.001&amp;nbsp;µm and 1&amp;nbsp;µm depending on the method of quantification. Because of [[Brownian motion]] and [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] forces balancing the gravity, they are not likely to settle naturally.

The limit sedimentation velocity of a particle is its theoretical descending speed in clear and still water. In [[settling]] process theory, a particle will settle only if :-
#In a vertical ascending flow, the ascending water velocity is lower than the limit sedimentation velocity.
#In a longitudinal flow, the ratio of the length of the tank to the height of the tank is higher than the ratio of the water velocity to the limit sedimentation velocity.

Removal of suspended particles by sedimentation depends upon the size and [[specific gravity]] of those particles.  Suspended solids retained on a filter may remain in suspension if their specific gravity is similar to water while very dense particles passing through the filter may settle.  [[Settling#Settleable solids analysis|Settleable solids]] are measured as the visible volume accumulated at the bottom of an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour.&lt;ref name=Franson/&gt;

Gravitational theory is employed, alongside the derivation from [[Newton's second law]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

[[Stokes' law]] explains the relationship between the settling rate and the particle diameter. Under specific conditions, the particle settling rate is directly proportional to the square of particle diameter and inversely proportional to liquid viscosity.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Beatop (Zhuhai) Instruments Ltd., Zhuhai, China. [http://www.beatop.com/Articles/principle_sedimentation_PSA.pdf "The Technology and Application of Sedimentation Particle Size Measurement."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185205/http://www.beatop.com/Articles/principle_sedimentation_PSA.pdf |date=2013-10-29 }} Accessed 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settling velocity, defined as the residence time taken for the particles to settle in the tank, enables the calculation of tank volume. Precise design and operation of a sedimentation tank is of high importance in order to keep the amount of sediment entering the diversion system to a minimum threshold by maintaining the transport system and stream stability to remove the sediment diverted from the system. This is achieved by reducing stream velocity as low as possible for the longest period of time possible. This is feasible by widening the approach channel and lowering its floor to reduce flow velocity thus allowing sediment to settle out of suspension due to gravity. The settling behavior of heavier particulates is also affected by the turbulence.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Boeriu, P., Roelvink, J. A., Simanjuntak, T. D., "Consideration on The Sedimentation Process in a Settling Basin." ''J. Hydrol. Hydromech.'' 2009, pp. 16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==
[[File:Fig1SB.png|thumb|Figure 1. Different clarifier designs]]
Although sedimentation might occur in tanks of other shapes, removal of accumulated solids is easiest with [[conveyor belt]]s in rectangular tanks or with scrapers rotating around the central axis of circular tanks.&lt;ref name=Metcalf/&gt; Settling basins and clarifiers should be designed based on the settling velocity of the smallest particle to be theoretically 100% removed. The overflow rate is defined as:

:Overflow rate (V_o ) = Flow of water (Q (cubic metre per second)) /(Surface area of settling basin (A) )(m^2)

In many countries this value is named as surface loading in m3/h per m2. Overflow rate is often used for flow over an edge (for example a weir) in the unit m3/h per m.

The unit of overflow rate is usually meters (or feet) per second, a velocity. Any particle with settling velocity (''Vs'') greater than the overflow rate will settle out, while other particles will settle in the ratio Vs/Vo.
There are recommendations on the overflow rates for each design that ideally take into account the change in particle size as the solids move through the operation:
* Quiescent zones: {{convert|0.031|ft|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} per second
* Full-flow basins: {{convert|0.013|ft|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} per second
* Off-line basins: {{convert|0.0015|ft|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} per second&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;
However, factors such as flow surges, wind shear, scour, and turbulence reduce the effectiveness of settling. To compensate for these less than ideal conditions, it is recommended doubling the area calculated by the previous equation.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Western Regional Aquaculture Center, University of Washington. Seattle, WA (2001). "Settling Basin Design". WRAC Publication No. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also important to equalize flow distribution at each point across the cross-section of the basin. Poor inlet and outlet designs can produce extremely poor flow characteristics for sedimentation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Settling basins and clarifiers can be designed as long rectangles (Figure 1.a), that are hydraulically more stable and easier to control for large volumes. Circular clarifiers (Fig. 1.b) work as a common thickener (without the usage of rakes), or as upflow tanks (Fig. 1.c).

Sedimentation efficiency does not depend on the tank depth. If the forward velocity is low enough so that the settled material does not re-suspend from the tank floor, the area is still the main parameter when designing a settling basin or clarifier, taking care that the depth is not too low.

==Assessment of main process characteristics==
Settling basins and clarifiers are designed to retain water so that suspended solids can settle. By sedimentation principles, the suitable treatment technologies should be chosen depending on the specific gravity, size and shear resistance of particles. Depending on the size and density of particles, and physical properties of the solids, there are four types of sedimentation processes:
*Type 1 – Dilutes, non-[[flocculation|flocculent]], free-settling (every particle settles independently.)
*Type 2 – Dilute, flocculent (particles can flocculate as they settle).
*Type 3 – Concentrated suspensions, zone settling, hindered settling (sludge thickening).
*Type 4 – Concentrated suspensions, compression (sludge thickening).

Different factors control the sedimentation rate in each.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks. (1997): Guidelines for Assessing the Design, Size and Operation of Sediment Ponds Used in Mining; Pollution Prevention Branch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settling of discrete particles===
[[File:Fig2SB.png|thumb|Figure 2. The four functional zones of a continuous flow settling basin]]
Unhindered settling is a process that removes the discrete particles in a very low concentration without interference from nearby particles. In general, if the concentration of the solutions is lower than 500&amp;nbsp;mg/L total suspended solids, sedimentation will be considered discrete.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Department of Planning and Local Government, Adelaide, Australia (2010). "Water Sensitive Urban Design." ''Technical Manual for the Greater Adelaide Region.'' Government of South Australia, Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of raceway effluent total suspended solids (TSS) in the west are usually less than 5&amp;nbsp;mg/L net. TSS concentrations of off-line settling basin effluent are less than 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L net.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, Louisiana (2013). [http://www.swbno.org/history_water_purification.asp "The Water Purification Process at the Carrollton Plant."] Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The particles keep their size and shape during discrete settling, with an independent velocity. With such low concentrations of suspended particles, the probability of particle collisions is very low and consequently the rate of floculation is small enough to be neglected for most calculations. Thus the surface area of the settling basin becomes the main factor of sedimentation rate. All continuous flow settling basins are divided into four parts: inlet zone, settling zone, sludge zone and outlet zone (Figure 2).

In the inlet zone, flow is established in a same forward direction. Sedimentation occurs in the settling zone as the water flow towards to outlet zone. The clarified liquid is then flow out from outlet zone.
Sludge zone: settled will be collected here and usually we assume that it is removed from water flow once the particles arrives the sludge zone.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

In an ideal rectangular sedimentation tank, in the settling zone, the critical particle enters at the top of the settling zone, and the settle velocity would be the smallest value to reach the sludge zone, and at the end of outlet zone, the velocity component of this critical particle are Vs, the settling velocity in vertical direction and Vh in horizontal direction.

From Figure 1, the time needed for the particle to settle;

:t_o =H/V_p=L/Vs(3)

Since the surface area of the tank is WL, and Vs = Q/WL, Vh = Q/WH, where Q is the flow rate and W, L, H is the width, length, depth of the tank.

According to Eq. 1, this also is a basic factor that can control the sedimentation tank performance which called overflow rate.&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;[http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT-KANPUR/wasteWater/Lecture%206.htm "Sedimentation Tank Design."] Lecture notes from ''Waste &amp; Wastewater Engineering 2006,'' National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning, Chennai, India. Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eq. 2 also tell us that the depth of sedimentation tank is independent to the sedimentation efficiency, only if the forward velocity is low enough to make sure the settled mass would not suspended again from the tank floor.

===Settlement of flocculent particles===
In a horizontal sedimentation tank, some particles may not follow the diagonal line in Fig. 1, while settling faster as they grow. So this says that particles can grow and develop a higher settling velocity if a greater depth with longer retention time. However, the collision chance would be even greater if the same retention time were spread over a longer, shallower tank. In fact, in order to avoid hydraulic short-circuiting, tanks usually are made 3–6 m deep with retention times of a few hours.

===Zone-settling behaviour===
As the concentration of particles in a suspension is increased, a point is reached where particles are so close together that they no longer settle independently of one another and the velocity fields of the fluid displaced by adjacent particles, overlap.  There is also a net upward flow of liquid displaced by the settling particles.  This results in a reduced particle-settling velocity and the effect is known as hindered settling.

There is a common case for hindered settling occurs. the whole suspension tends to settle as a ‘blanket’ due to its extremely high particle concentration. This is known as zone settling, because it is easy to make a distinction between several different zones which separated by concentration discontinuities.  Fig. 3 represents a typical batch-settling column tests on a suspension exhibiting zone-settling characteristics. There is a clear interface near the top of the column would be formed to separating the settling sludge mass from the clarified supernatant as long as leaving such a suspension to stand in a settling column. As the suspension settles, this interface will move down at the same speed.  At the same time, there is an interface near the bottom between that settled suspension and the suspended blanket.  After settling of suspension is complete, the bottom interface would move upwards and meet the top interface which moves downwards.

===Compression settling===
[[File:Fig3SB.png|thumb|Figure3: Typical batch-settling column test on a suspension exhibiting zone-settling characteristics]]
The settling particles can contact each other and arise when approaching the floor of the sedimentation tanks at very high particle concentration. So that further settling will only occur in adjust matrix as the sedimentation rate decreasing. This is can be illustrated by the lower region of the zone-settling diagram (Figure 3).  In Compression zone, the settled solids are compressed by gravity (the weight of solids), as the settled solids are compressed under the weight of overlying solids, and water is squeezed out while the space gets smaller.

==Applications==

===Potable water treatment===
Sedimentation in [[water purification|potable water treatment]] generally follows a step of chemical coagulation and [[flocculation]], which allows grouping particles together into flocs of a bigger size. This increases the settling speed of suspended solids and allows settling colloids.

===Wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Wastewater treatment}}
Sedimentation has been used to treat wastewater for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Chatzakis, M.K., Lyrintzis, A.G., Mara, D.D., and Angelakis, A.N. (2006). "Sedimentation Tanks through the Ages." Proceedings of the 1st IWA International Symposium on Water and Wastewater Technologies in Ancient Civilizations, Iraklio, Greece, 28–30 October 2006, pp. 757–762.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|Primary treatment]] of [[sewage]] is removal of floating and settleable solids through sedimentation.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; ''Primary clarifiers'' reduce the content of suspended solids as well as the pollutant embedded in the suspended solids.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC (2004). [http://www.epa.gov/owm/primer.pdf "Primer for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–9}} Because of the large amount of [[reagent]] necessary to treat domestic wastewater, preliminary chemical coagulation and flocculation are generally not used, remaining suspended solids being reduced by following stages of the system. However, coagulation and flocculation can be used for building a compact treatment plant (also called a "package treatment plant"), or for further polishing of the treated water.&lt;ref name="EPA Package"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www.epa.gov/owm/mtb/package_plant.pdf "Package Plants."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-00-016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedimentation tanks called "secondary clarifiers" remove flocs of biological growth created in some methods of [[Sewage treatment#Secondary treatment|secondary treatment]] including [[activated sludge]], [[trickling filter]]s and [[rotating biological contactor]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2370">The '''standard person''' or '''reference person''' is a theoretical individual that has perfectly "normal" characteristics.  This model is used for much research into radiation safety.  For many years, the standard person was called '''reference man''' because the work assumed a healthy, young adult male.  In recent years, '''reference woman''' and '''reference child''' models have been created, along with variations on body size, age, sex, and race.&lt;ref name="pmid1704742"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis KJ |title=Reference man and woman more fully characterized. Variations on the basis of body size, age, sex, and race |journal=[[Biol Trace Elem Res]] |volume=26-27 |issue= |pages=385–400 |year=1990 |pmid=1704742 |doi= 10.1007/bf02992693|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, the model may be expanded to include selected plants and animals.&lt;ref name="pmid15063533"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pentreath RJ |title=Ethics, genetics and dynamics: an emerging systematic approach to radiation protection of the environment |journal=[[J Environ Radioact]] |volume=74 |issue=1–3 |pages=19–30 |year=2004 |pmid=15063533 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2004.01.024 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, for medical purposes, the concept may be replaced by effective attention to measuring the exposure of individual patients to radiation.&lt;ref name="pmid10850291"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stabin MG |title=Internal dosimetry in the use of radiopharmaceuticals in therapy--science at a crossroads? |journal=[[Cancer Biother.

==Official definition==
According to the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]]'s 1974 definition, “Reference man is defined as being between 20-30 years of age, weighing 70 kg, is 170 cm in height, and lives in a climate with an average temperature of from 10°C to 20°C. He is a Caucasian and is a Western European or North American in habitat and custom.”&lt;ref name="isbn0-08-017024-2"&gt;{{cite book |author= prepared by a task group of Committee 2 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.|title=Report of the Task Group on Reference Man: a report |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |year=1975 |pages= |isbn=0-08-017024-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sunao Tsuboi'''|坪井 直|Tsuboi Sunao, May 5, 1925}}&lt;ref name="Veterans"&gt;Sasha Maslov Photography [http://sashamaslov.com/veterans/sunao-tsuboi Veterans - Sunao Tsuboi] Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; is a Japanese anti-nuclear and anti-war activist and former teacher. He is a [[hibakusha]], a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and is the co-chair of [[Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations|Nihon Hidankyo]], a Japan-wide organisation of atomic and hydrogen bomb sufferers.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;Nihon Hidankyo website [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/hidankyo/nihon/english/about/about1-01.html About Us] Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was awarded the [[Kiyoshi Tanimoto]] peace prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/hpcf/heiwabunka/pce68/English/68_15E.html "Thinking about Peace" Experience Counts] ''Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum'' Retrieved September 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[Nishi-ku, Hiroshima]].

==Early life==
Born and raised in Hiroshima, as a child Tsuboi was interested in maths and science and wished to be an inventor. He was the fourth of five brothers. His two eldest brothers went to [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war in China]] and didn't return.&lt;ref name="Veterans" /&gt;

==Atomic bombing of Hiroshima==
 In 1945 he was a student of the Hiroshima Vocational School in Senda-machi. On the morning of August 6 he had just eaten breakfast at a dining hall named "Shima no Kaori" and was invited to have a second breakfast with some other students. He declined as he was concerned that the young woman behind the counter would think him a glutton. When the bomb exploded soon afterwards he was walking to school and he was badly burned. Everyone in the dining room was killed. ({{cite book |last=|first=|date= 2000|title= [[Hiroshima: In Memoriam and Today]] |url= |location= |publisher= HIMAT Group |pages=39–49|isbn=}})

The school was abandoned and catching fire, so he went to an aunt's house nearby. He was in shock and belatedly realized he was badly injured and didn't wish to be a burden to her, so he left. 
He went to the Miyuki bridge where he heard that there was an aid station. But the only assistance there was cooking oil being used to ease the pain from burns. Policemen were pouring it onto the skin of school children.&lt;ref name="The Man"&gt;McCurry, Justin [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/japan-atomic-bomb-survivors-nuclear-weapons-hiroshima-70th-anniversary The man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth'] ''[[The Guardian]]'' August 4, 2015, Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later taken to Ujina (Hiroshima port) by a truck and then to [[Ninoshima]] by barge. Only young men were being evacuated, as they were considered valuable for the war effort.&lt;ref name="Last Words"&gt;Okamoto, Gen [http://www.asahi.com/hibakusha/english/shimen/kikitakatta/kiki2014-07e.html Last Words at the Miyuki Bridge] ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' June 11, 2014, Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He asked a woman visiting to inform his family. He stayed on Ninoshima for several days cared for by a classmate who fed him. His classmate was then sent elsewhere.

His mother and uncle searched among the dead and dying for three days with no success. When her uncle suggested leaving and holding a funeral for him, his mother began running around screaming his name. He heard her and put up his hand and said "Here I am." He was taken to his home in Ando but was not conscious of this. When his aunt first saw him, she said he looked like a ghost.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;Chester, Rodney [http://www.couriermail.com.au/extras/ww2/sunaotsuboi.htm Under the mushroom cloud] ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He didn't know the war had ended and didn't believe it had when he was told.&lt;ref name="The Man"/&gt;

==Postwar medical treatment==
Tsuboi was cared for by his family. He developed [[aplastic anaemia]]. He received many blood transfusions and was hospitalized eleven times. Three times his condition became so bad that he was told he was about to die. He suffers from several illnesses including two cancer diagnoses. He receives intravenous transfusions for anemia every two weeks.&lt;ref name="My Life"&gt;Masuda, Sakiko [http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20130116105217326_en My Life: Interview with Sunao Tsuboi, Chairperson of the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, Part 1 January 26, 2013] Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar career==
Tsuboi became a teacher as the hours were not so demanding and teachers received a lot of days off.&lt;ref name="My Life"/&gt; He taught mathematics at a women's college and at other schools including Ondo-Cho Junior High School. Close to August 6 he would tell his story to his students. He was known as "Mr Pika-Don", or "Mr Flash Bang", referring to the atomic bombing. He became the principal of a Junior High School, and retired in 1986&lt;ref name="Under"/&gt; after serving as the principal of the Kamezaki and Jonan Junior High Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, Sakiko [http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/?p=24351 My Life: Interview with Sunao Tsuboi, Chairperson of the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, Part 10 January 30, 2013] ''Hiroshima Peace Media Center'' Retrieved September 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
When he was 26 years old teaching at a college for women Tsuboi met a student who he later married. Her parents objected as he was an atomic bomb survivor and they thought he would soon die and leave her a widow. They attempted to commit suicide together with sleeping pills, but didn't take a sufficient amount, so they both just went to sleep.&lt;ref name="Veterans" /&gt;

==Activism==
He was active with the [[Japan Teachers Union]] during his career as a teacher despite receiving punishments for this. The union has been well known for its critical stance against the government of Japan and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] on issues like use of the [[Flag of Japan#Public schools|Japanese flag]] and [[Kimigayo#Inside Japan|national anthem]] and [[Japanese history textbook controversies|issues involving censorship of textbooks]].

After retirement he became more involved in anti-nuclear and anti-war activism, participating in sit-ins, demonstrations and rallies. He is the co-chair of Nihon Hidankyo, a Japan-wide organisation of atomic and hydrogen bomb sufferers.&lt;ref name="About Us"/&gt;

In 2011 he was awarded the [[Kiyoshi Tanimoto]] peace prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/hpcf/heiwabunka/pce68/English/68_15E.html "Thinking about Peace" Experience Counts] Retrieved September 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made many speeches to students on school excursions to Hiroshima, foreign visitors, and many others. He has repeatedly stated that he wants nuclear weapons to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/04/14/national/history/hiroshima-hibakusha-81-plans-third-possibly-last-appeal-npt-meeting/ Hiroshima hibakusha, 81, plans third, possibly last, appeal at NPT meeting April 14, 2015] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He has criticised Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] for attacking Japan's postwar commitment to pacifism. In 2015 he and other atomic bomb survivors asked Abe to drop the unpopular [[2015 Japanese military legislation|security bills]] then being passed by Abe's administration.&lt;ref&gt;Okuma, Takashi [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201508060050 Atomic bomb survivors implore Abe to withdraw unpopular security bills August 6 , 2015] ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyberghien, Quentin and Nogi, Kazuhiro [https://news.yahoo.com/bells-toll-hiroshima-japan-marks-70-years-since-232703023.html Japan marks 70th anniversary of Hiroshima atomic bombing] ''[[Yahoo! News]]'' Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 he met US President [[Barack Obama]], who was the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/president-obama-historic-speech-visit-hiroshima-article-1.2651798 President Obama says we 'must pursue a world without' nuclear weapons in historic speech at Hiroshima May 27, 2016] ''[[New York Daily News]]'' Retrieved May 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wilhelm-Tietjen-Stiftung für Fertilisation Ltd.''' is a controversial fertility research group. Its critics have described it as a far-right extremist organization with links to [[Neo-Nazism]] and Nazi [[eugenics]] theories. 

Its proposed purchase of a hotel in the German town of [[Delmenhorst]] is the subject of great controversy, and campaigns by local people to keep it out of the town have made the national news in Germany and abroad.
