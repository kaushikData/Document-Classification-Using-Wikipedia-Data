'''Acultomancy''' (from acutomancy, the type of acultomancy described below, influenced by Latin acūleus, needle) is a form of [[divination]] that uses [[Sewing needle|needles]] for readings.  

Using needles comes from the olden days where [[Romani people]] used to read people and use needles as their pointers.  Readers use seven needles or up to twenty one needles in a somewhat shallow bowl with water in it.  Needles may also be dropped onto a flat surface that has been coated with powder or flour.  Readers then look for the designs that the needles make in the substance. 

Some of the main designs are lines.  They may be broken, parallel, vertical, or horizontal in some fashion.  The broken line may mean traveling or heading on a new journey.  The parallel lines may mean money in the future, either given or taken away.  The vertical lines are meant as guided roads to take.  The horizontal lines may mean what the fate will be.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

There is another type of acultomancy and that is called acutomancy.  This practice uses sharp objects or anything that is pointed.  Seven are dropped onto a table and the pattern is distinguished and read.  Another practice along with this one is Acutomanzia.  Acutomanzia employs thirteen pins.  Ten must be straight and three are bent at an angle.  They are also dropped into flour or powder of some sort to discern patterns.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

'''Ahir''' or '''Aheer''' is an ethnic group.The Ahirs are variously described as a [[caste]], a [[clan]], a [[community]], a [[Race (human classification)|race]] and a [[tribe]]. Members of this group identify as being of the Yadav community because they consider the two terms to be synonymous.&lt;ref name="Garg1992"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Gaṅga Ram |editor-last=Garg|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=2012-12-03|volume=1|year=1992|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-374-0|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "AHIR" is derived from "AABHIR" which means "FEARLESS".Gaṅga Ram Garg considers the Ahir to be a tribe descended from the ancient [[Abhira tribe|Abhira community]], whose precise location in India is the subject of various theories based mostly on interpretations of old texts such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the writings of [[Ptolemy]]. He believes the word ''Ahir'' to be the [[Prakrit]] form of the [[Sanskrit]] word, ''Abhira'', and he notes that the present term in the [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] languages is ''Abhir''.&lt;ref name="Garg1992"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Gaṅga Ram |editor-last=Garg|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=2012-12-03|volume=1|year=1992|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-374-0|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garg distinguishes a Brahmin community who use the ''Abhira'' name and are found in the present-day states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]]. That usage, he says, is because that division of Brahmins were priests to the Abhira tribe.&lt;ref name="Garg1992" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Asirgarh Fort1.jpg|thumb|[[Asirgarh Fort]], built by King Asa Ahir in [[Madhya Pradesh]] ]]

=== Early history ===
Theories regarding the origins of the ancient [[Abhira]]&amp;nbsp;— the putative ancestors of the Ahirs&amp;nbsp;— are varied for the same reasons as are the theories regarding their location; that is, there is a reliance on interpretation of linguistic and factual analysis of old texts that are known to be unreliable and ambiguous.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya1996p126"/&gt; [[S. D. S. Yadava]] describes how this situation impacts on theories of origin for the modern Ahir community because {{quote|Their origin is shrouded in mystery and is immersed in controversy, with many theories, most of which link the Ahirs to a people known to the ancients as the Abhiras.&lt;ref name="Yadava2006p1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Followers of Krishna: Yadavas of India |first=S. D. S. |last=Yadava |publisher=Lancer Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=9788170622161 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p69GMA226bgC |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some, such as A. P. Karmakar, consider the Abhira to be a [[Proto-Dravidian]] tribe who migrated to India and point to the ''[[Purana]]s'' as evidence. Others, such as Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya, dismiss this theory as anachronistic and say that the Abhira are recorded as being in India in the 1st-century CE work, the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''. Bhattacharya considers the Abhira of old to be a race rather than a tribe.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya1996p126"&gt;{{cite book |title=Krishna&amp;nbsp;— Cult In Indian Art |first=Sunil Kumar |last=Bhattacharya |publisher=M.D. Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9788175330016 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyyNIL7Ug2kC |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M. S. A. Rao]] and historians such as P. M. Chandorkar and T. Padmaja say that epigraphical and historical evidence exists for equating the Ahirs with the ancient [[Yadava]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Sumit | last = Guha |title=Environment and Ethnicity in India, 1200-1991| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GSa5blriOYcC&amp;pg=PA47|year = 2006| publisher = University of Cambridge|page=47|isbn=978-0-521-02870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = M.

Whether they were a race or a tribe, nomadic in tendency or displaced or part of a conquering wave, with origins in Indo-Scythia or Central Asia, Aryan or [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]]&amp;nbsp;— there is no academic consensus, and much in the differences of opinion relate to fundamental aspects of historiography, such as controversies regarding dating the writing of the ''Mahabharata'' and acceptance or otherwise of the [[Out of India theory|Aryan invasion theory]].&lt;ref name="Yadava2006p1" /&gt;

===Military involvements ===
The [[British Raj|British]] rulers of India classified the Ahirs as an "agricultural tribe" in the 1920s, which was at that time synonymous with being a "[[martial race]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rajit K. |last=Mazumder|title=The Indian army and the making of Punjab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G8COTxOUkgC&amp;pg=PA105|year=2003|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-7824-059-6|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been recruited into the army from 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the British raised four Ahir companies, two of which were in the [[95th Russell's Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.

During the [[1965 India-Pakistan War]], the 4 Kumaon Regiment, which is an Ahir company, played a key role. The Indian Army renamed Point 8667 to Yadav Hill in memory of the soldiers who were killed in capturing it from Pakistani forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SBWc27AVmwC&amp;pg=PA212| title=Combat Diary: An illustrated history of operations conducted by 4th Kumaon| publisher=Lancer Books |work=History |year=2010 |first=Jasbir |last=Singh |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwSqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84| title=Roar of the Tiger: Illustrated History of Operations in Kashmir  |publisher=VIJ BOOKS |year=2010 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Militant Hinduism ===
The Ahirs have been one of the more militant Hindu groups, including in the modern era. For example, in 1930, about 200 Ahirs marched towards the shrine of Trilochan and performed ''[[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' in response to Islamic ''tanzeem'' processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nandini |last=Gooptu |title=The Politics of the Urban Poor in Early Twentieth-Century India |page=307 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wZTLEEGmZfQC&amp;pg=PA307 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001}}quote: The Ahirs in particular who played an important role in militant Hinduism, retaliated strongly against the Tanzeem movement. In July,1930, about 200 Ahirs marched in procession to Trilochan, a sacred Hindu site and performed a religious ceremony in response to Tanzeem processions.&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the 1920s that some Ahirs began to adopt the name of ''Yadav'' and various [[mahasabha]]s were founded by ideologues such as Rajit Singh. Several caste histories and periodicals to trace a Kshatriya origin were written at the time, notably by Mannanlal Abhimanyu. These were part of the jostling among various castes for socio-economic status and ritual under the Raj and they invoked support for a zealous, martial Hindu ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nandini |last=Gooptu |title=The Politics of the Urban Poor in Early Twentieth-Century India |pages=205–210 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wZTLEEGmZfQC&amp;pg=PA205 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdivisions ==
Traditionally Ahirs are divided into subdivisions such as Yaduvanshi, Nandvanshi and Gwalvanshi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Dipankar|title=Caste in question identity or hierarchy?|date=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8-13210-345-5|pages=49, 58 |url=https://books. yugoogle.com/books?id=pviHAwAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have more than 20 sub-castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58G8PPAN48cC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Awareness in Weaker Section: Perspective Development and Prospects |publisher=M.

There are five main castes of Ahirs in [[Kutch]]: [[Pancholi]], [[Ahir Paratharia|Paratharia]], Machhoya, [[Ahir Boricha|Boricha]], and [[Ahir Sorathia|Sorathia]] and Vagadia. These communities are mainly of farmers who once sold milk and ghee but who now have diversified their businesses because of the irregularity of rain. The other community is the [[Bharwad]]s, some of whom in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] use Ahir as a surname and consider themselves to be [[Nandvanshi]] Ahirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sudipta |last=Mitra |title=Gir Forest and the saga of the Asiatic lion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0rME6RjC1sC&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2005 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-183-2 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Anthropologist [[Kumar Suresh Singh]] noted that the Rajasthani Ahir are non-vegetarian, though cooking their vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods on separate hearths. Though they eat mutton, chicken, and fish, they do not eat beef or pork. Their staple is wheat, they eat millet in the winters, and rice on festive occasions. They drink alcohol, smoke ''[[Beedi]]s'' and cigarettes, and chew [[betel]] leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqvloPNdEZgC&amp;pg=PA44 |title=The People of India: Rajasthan |editor1-first=Kumar Suresh |editor1-last=Singh |editor-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Maharashtra, however, Singh states that the Ahir there are largely vegetarian, also eating wheat as a staple along with pulses and tubers, and eschewed liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmBjoAFMfjoC&amp;pg=PA58 |title=The People of India: Maharashtra|editor1-first=Kumar Suresh |editor1-last=Singh |editor-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noor Mohammad noted that in Uttar Pradesh that most Ahirs there were vegetarian, with some exceptions who engaged in fishing and raising poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ln6_PodhWC0C&amp;pg=PA60 |title=New Dimensions in Agricultural ... |first=Noor |last=Mohammad |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gujarat, Rash Bihari Lal states that the Ahirs were largely vegetarian, ate Bajra and Jowar wheat with occasional rice, and that few drank alcohol, some smoked [[Beedi]]s, and some of the older generation smoked [[hookah]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Cy_-FXW9BQC&amp;pg=PA46 |title=Gujarat |first=Rash Bihari |last=Lal |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folklore ===
The oral epic of [[Veer Lorik]], a mythical Ahir hero, had been sung by folk singers in North India for generations. Mulla Daud, a [[Sufi Muslim]] retold the romantic story in writing in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100801/spectrum/art.htm |title=Spectrum |work=The Sunday Tribune |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ahir folk traditions include those related to [[Kajri]] and Biraha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415994047 |title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia |editor-first=Ellen |editor-last=Koskoff |isbn=978-0-41597-293-2 |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |page=1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alchornea floribunda''''' is a plant native to tropical Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is locally known as ''Niando''.&lt;ref name=DrDukes&gt;[https://phytochem.nal.usda.gov/phytochem/plants/show/79 Dr. Duke's Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Alchornea floribunda'' is a large, straggly shrub that grows into a bush about {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0}} tall.
&lt;ref name=UTP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Alchornea+floribunda |title=''Alchornea floribunda'' |work=Useful Tropical Plants |accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
This plant has many traditional uses. The leaves are sometimes cooked and eaten as a vegetable and may be eaten with meat or fish as an antidote to poison. They are also consumed as a remedy for ovarian problems and gastro-intestinal disorders. A decoction of the dried leaves is used to treat diarrhoea and the leaves are pulped to promote the healing of wounds. The dried leaves and fibrous root scrapings are used as a substitute for tobacco. The powdered rootbark is highly prized in traditional medicine as a stimulating intoxicant and aphrodisiac.&lt;ref name=UTP/&gt;

This plant is preferentially used by [[chimpanzee]]s in making tools for catching [[termite]]s in the [[Dja Faunal Reserve]] in south eastern Cameroon. The animals hunt through the forest for the shrub and make short poles out of it. Thicker poles about half a metre long are used to  dig into and disturb the termite mound, and thinner, flexible poles are inserted for the angry termites to climb onto. The chimpanzees then scoop the termites clinging to their fishing rods into their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deblauwe, Isra |author2=Guislain, Patrick |author3=Dupain, Jef |author4=Van Elsacker, Linda |year=2006 |title=Use of a tool-set by ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'' to obtain termites (''Macrotermes'') in the periphery of the Dja Biosphere Reserve, southeast Cameroon |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=68 |issue=12 |pages=1191–1196 |doi=10.1002/ajp.20318 |pmid=17096418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruno Alfred Döblin''' (10 August 1878 – 26 June 1957) was a German [[novelist]], [[essay]]ist, and doctor, best known for his novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1929). A prolific writer whose œuvre spans more than half a century and a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from [[historical novel]]s to [[science fiction]] to novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by [[dtv Verlagsgesellschaft|Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag]] and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, ''Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung'' (''[[The Three Leaps of Wang Lun]]''), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, ''Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende'' (''[[Tales of a Long Night]]'') was published in 1956, one year before his death.

Born in [[Stettin]], Germany (now [[Szczecin]], Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin moved with his mother and siblings to [[Berlin]] when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and [[Weimar culture|Weimar-era]] German cultural scene as [[Herwarth Walden]] and the circle of [[Expressionism|Expressionists]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Thomas Mann]]. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'', Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]]. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again at the start of the [[Second World War]]. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in [[Los Angeles]], where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to [[West Germany]] after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.

Despite the canonic status of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'', Döblin is often characterized as an under-recognized or even as a forgotten author;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=167ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) over the last few decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German novelists such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Günter Grass]] or [[Franz Kafka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamm|first=Oliver|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/saturday-review/review-berlin-alexanderplatz-by-alfred-doeblin-love-and-death-in-old-berlin-dgr2dxwn9|title=Review: Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Döblin — love and death in old Berlin|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 February 2018|accessdate=24 February 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
[[File:Alfred Doeblin-Bronzekopf-20150608-03.jpg|thumb|Alfred Döblin bronze bust, by Siegfried Wehrmeister]]
Bruno Alfred Döblin was born on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in [[Szczecin|Stettin (Szczecin)]], a port city in what was then the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth of five children born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from [[Poznań|Posen (Poznań)]], and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and Sophie's cool pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents' marriage dissolved in July 1888, when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander, a seamstress twenty years his junior, and moved to America to start a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin's childhood and would be formative for his later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, but when it came to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of being déclassé, along with rocky experiences at school, made this a difficult time for Döblin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=16}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had early been a good student, starting in his fourth year of ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' his performance tended toward the mediocre. Furthermore, his oppositional tendencies against the stern conventionality of the patriarchal, militaristic [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelminian]] educational system, which stood in contrast to his artistic inclinations and his free thought, earned him the status of a rebel among his teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his hatred for school, Döblin early became a passionate writer and reader, counting [[Spinoza]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Nietzsche]], as well as [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] among his most important early influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his first novel, ''Jagende Rosse'' (''Rushing Steeds''), before completing school and dedicated it to the "[[Manes]] of Hölderlin". He sent a copy to the prominent critic and philosopher [[Fritz Mauthner]] who returned it a few days later. However, wishing to hide his artistic inclinations from his mother, Döblin had sent the manuscript under a false name, and was not able to retrieve it at the post office; he thus had to rewrite it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900–1914: University years and early career===
After receiving his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1900, Döblin enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm University (now [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) and began studying general medicine. In May 1904 he moved to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] to continue his studies, concentrating on neurology and psychiatry. He began his dissertation ("Disturbances of memory in [[Korsakoff's syndrome|Korsakoff's Psychosis]]") in the winter semester of 1904–1905 at the Freiburg psychiatric clinic. His dissertation, completed in April 1905, was published that year by Berlin's Klett Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for assistantships in Berlin and in Stettin, where he was apparently turned down on account of his Jewish origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; before taking a short-lived position as assistant doctor at a regional asylum in [[Regensburg]]. On 15 October 1906 he took up a position at the Berlin psychiatric clinic in [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]] where he worked as an assistant doctor for nearly two years. He then transferred to the city hospital "Am Urban," where he dedicated himself to internal medicine with a renewed interest. He opened his first private practice in October 1911 at Blücherstrasse 18 in Berlin's [[Kreuzberg]] neighborhood, before moving the practice to [[Frankfurter Allee]] 184 in Berlin's working-class east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kirchner Stiftsfräulein und der Tod.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated title page of Döblin's novella "Das Stiftsfräulein und der Tod"; woodcut by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]]]
While working in Buch he met Friede Kunke, a 16-year-old nurse from a Protestant background with whom he became romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the spring of 1909 he began seeing the 21-year-old Erna Reiss, a medical student and daughter of a wealthy Jewish factory owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=37–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his continued involvement with Kunke, at the urging of his family he was reluctantly engaged to Reiss on 13 February 1911 and married her on 23 January 1912; his younger brother Hugo and [[Herwarth Walden]] served as best men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of his engagement to Reiss, he had been unaware that Kunke was pregnant: their son Bodo was born on 14 October 1911 and was raised by his grandmother, Elise Kunke, in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] following Friede's death from tuberculosis in 1918. Until the end of his life, Döblin maintained loose contact with Bodo, and his treatment of Friede became a lasting source of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's first son with Erna Reiss, Peter Döblin, was born on 27 October 1912, and was baptized a Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=26}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kirchner - Bildnis Dr Alfred Döblin.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]'s portrait of Alfred Döblin]]
During his studies in Berlin, Döblin had written his second novel, ''Der Schwarze Vorhang'' (''The Black Curtain'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=19}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel portrays the developing sexuality of its protagonist, Johannes, and explores the themes of love, hate, and sadism; in its use of literary montage, ''The Black Curtain'' already presages the radical techniques that Döblin would later pioneer in ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by a mutual acquaintance, Döblin met Georg Lewin, a music student better known as Herwarth Walden, who founded the Expressionist journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'' in 1910. ''Der Sturm'', modeled after [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]'s newspaper ''Die Fackel'' (''The Torch''), would soon count Döblin among its most involved contributors, and provided him with a venue for the publication of numerous literary and essayistic contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Walden Döblin made the acquaintance of poet [[Else Lasker-Schüler]]. At regular meetings at the Café des Westens on [[Kurfürstendamm]] or at the wine bar Dalbelli, Döblin got to know the circle of artists and intellectuals that would become central to the Expressionist movement in Berlin, including Peter Hille, [[Richard Dehmel]], [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Paul Scheerbart]], and [[Frank Wedekind]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1911 he met the painter [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], who painted several portraits of Döblin between 1912 and 1914 and illustrated some of Döblin's literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's early novel ''Der Schwarze Vorhang'' was published in ''Der Sturm'', and in November 1912 the Munich publishing house Georg Müller published his collection of novellas under the title ''Die Ermordung einer Butterblume und andere Erzählungen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1913, he completed his third novel ''[[The Three Leaps of Wang Lun]]'' (''Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun''). Published in 1916, this historical novel about political uprising in 18th-century China was a literary breakthrough for Döblin, earning him literary acclaim, public recognition, and the prestigious Fontane Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|p=159}}; {{Harvnb|Solbach|2007|pp=638–639}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing ''[[Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine]]'' (''Wadzek's Struggle with the Steam Turbine'') the following year, completing it by December 1914 although it was not published until 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=27,139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915–1933: The First World War and the Weimar years===
To avoid conscription, Döblin volunteered in December 1914 and was posted to [[Saargemünd]] (Sarreguemines) as a doctor. Despite sharing in the widespread early enthusiasm for the war among German intellectuals, he soon developed a pacifist disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son [[Wolfgang Doeblin|Wolfgang]] was born on 17 March 1915, followed by the births of Klaus on 20 May 1917 and Stefan on 7 December 1926. In Saargemünd the family lived in a small apartment at Neunkircherstraße 19; due to their financial situation they had to give up their Berlin apartment at the end of February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wang lun.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first edition of [[The Three Leaps of Wang Lun|''Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun'']]]]
At the end of August, 1916, Döblin was awarded the Fontane Prize (including a monetary award of 600 Marks) for ''The Three Leaps of Wang Lun'' (''Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this recognition, Döblin set himself to work on his historical novel ''[[Wallenstein (novel)|Wallenstein]]'', set during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at [[Heidelberg]] during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to [[Hagenau]] (Haguenau) in [[Alsace]], where the library of nearby [[Strassbourg]] helped complete ''Wallenstein'' by the beginning of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1919, Döblin moved into his new apartment and medical practice at [[Frankfurter Allee]] 340 in Berlin. The immediate postwar period was a turbulent time for him—his financial situation was dire, and the death of his sister Meta on 12 March 1919 as the result of an injury sustained during skirmishes between the [[Spartacus League|Spartacists]] and nationalist troops in Berlin showed how volatile the situation in Germany was in the aftermath of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=31}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=56–7}}; {{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The years during and immediately after the war also marked Döblin's growing politicization; although he never joined a party he identified with the political left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=51–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Döblin wrote a number of satirical and polemical political essays under the pseudonym "Linke Poot," a dialectical variation of "Linke Pfote" (Left Paw), eleven of which were published in 1921 in a volume called ''Der deutsche Maskenball'' (''The German Masked Ball'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=296}}; {{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|pp=231–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1921, he met the 21-year-old photographer Charlotte ("Yolla") Niclas; the close romantic relationship between the two was to last many years, despite their age difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=33}}; {{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|pp=236–9, 588–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel ''[[Berge Meere und Giganten]]'' (''Mountains Seas and Giants''), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (''Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller''), and in 1924 he became its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the ''[[Prager Tagblatt]]'', and in 1925 joined the ''Gruppe 1925'', a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Johannes R. Becher]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Hermann Kasack]], [[Rudolf Leonhard]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Robert Musil]], [[Joseph Roth]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Kurt Tucholsky]], and [[Ernst Weiß]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=65–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to [[Erwin Piscator]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=33,36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gedenktafel Kaiserdamm 28 (Westend) Alfred Döblin.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque on Döblin's Berlin residence]] At the end of September 1924, he set out on a two-month trip through Poland, subsidized by the [[Fischer Verlag]] and prompted in part by the anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s in Berlin's [[Scheunenviertel]] of 1923, an event that awakened Döblin's interest in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eggert|2003|p=23}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=63–4}}; {{Harvnb|Jelavich|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His description of his travels to [[Warsaw]], [[Vilnius]], [[Lviv]], and [[Kraków]], among other cities, was published in November 1925 under the title ''Reise in Polen'' (''Journey to Poland'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926 to 1927 Döblin worked on his free verse epic ''Manas'', about a figure from Indian mythology, which was published in May 1927. ''Manas'', like his philosophical tract ''Das Ich über der Natur'' published the same year, proved to be a failure with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus despite his continued rise to prominence within the intellectual world of the [[Weimar Republic]]—in 1928, for example, he was elected to the prestigious [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] with the persistent support of [[Thomas Mann]]—literary and economic success continued to elude Döblin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed with the October 1929 publication of his novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' which earned him national and global fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=88–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known appraisals of the novel is [[Walter Benjamin]]'s essay, "Die Krisis des Romans" ("The Crisis of the Novel") which sees in ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'''s radical use of montage a solution to the impasses of the traditional novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin soon began transforming ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' into a radio play and agreed to cowrite the screenplay for the [[Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931 film)|film version]] that premiered on 8 October 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study on the adaption of ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' across genres and media, see {{Harvnb|Jelavich|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1930s marked the high point of Döblin's fame. During this time he busied himself with lectures, readings, and the effort to contribute to a collective intellectual response to the growing power of the [[National Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a month after Hitler's ascension to power, Döblin left Germany, crossing into Switzerland on 2 March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief stay in [[Zürich]], the family moved to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's closest acquaintances during this time were [[Claire Goll|Claire]] and [[Yvan Goll]], [[Hermann Kesten]], [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Joseph Roth]], [[Hans Sahl]], and [[Manès Sperber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he also saw [[Robert Musil]], with whom he had kept up a sporadic relationship for over a decade, for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin finished his novel ''Babylonische Wandrung'' at the end of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he began work on his ''Amazon Trilogy'', which narrates the colonization and Christianization of South America and was published in 1937–1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also began work on his four-part novel project ''[[November 1918: A German Revolution|November 1918]]''  about the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|revolution in Germany]] at the end of the [[First World War]]. He acquired French nationality in October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1939, he briefly visited the United States to take part in a [[International PEN|PEN]] congress in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; With other writers, he met with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the White House, and saw his old Berlin acquaintance [[Ernst Toller]] again, who was suffering from severe depression and killed himself shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the start of the [[Second World War]] the family fled Paris; Döblin's manuscripts were able to be brought into safekeeping in the basement of the [[Sorbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the start of the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French [[German studies|Germanists]] and journalists, as well as artists like [[Frans Masereel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, aged 62, he was again uprooted by the German invasion of France, and spent weeks in a refugee camp in [[Mende, Lozère|Mende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=65}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he began attending mass at the [[Mende Cathedral|cathedral]] in Mende, a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 1940, Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the ''Nea Hellas'' in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin worked briefly for [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] writing screenplays for $100 a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] in Hollywood's [[Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, Hollywood|Blessed Sacrament Church]] on 30 November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buruma|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|pp=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Döblin completed work on ''November 1918'' in the spring of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the ''Nocturno'' episode from ''November 1918''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as [[Lion Feuchtwanger]] and Thomas Mann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of his 65th birthday, [[Helene Weigel]] organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, [[Franz Werfel]], Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. [[Heinrich Mann]] gave a speech, [[Fritz Kortner]], [[Peter Lorre]], and [[Alexander Granach]] read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Alfred Polgar]], among others. Compositions by [[Hanns Eisler]] were performed, and [[Blandine Ebinger]] sang Berlin [[chanson]]s. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Döblin Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Döblin's gravestone in [[Housseras]], France]]
In 1945, Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan was called up for military service in the French army. That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=64, 72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1945, Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the ''Argentine'' back to Europe. They first settled in [[Baden-Baden]], where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative for the office of public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as [[Ernst Jünger]] or [[Gottfried Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=76–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last novel, ''Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende'' (''[[Tales of a Long Night]]''), was published in 1956, and was favorably received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=95, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's remaining years were marked by poor health (he had [[Parkinson's disease]]) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his ''alma mater'', Freiburg University. Through the intervention of [[Theodor Heuss]] and Joachim Tiburtius, he was able to receive more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the [[Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur|Mainz Academy]] in the sum of 10,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] helped finance his growing medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Döblin died in the hospital in [[Emmendingen]] on 26 June 1957 and was buried two days later in the village cemetery at [[Housseras]] next to his son Wolfgang. Erna took her life on 15 September and was buried next to Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=98–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==

===''The Three Leaps of Wang Lun''===
{{main|The Three Leaps of Wang Lun}}
''Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun'' (''The Three Leaps of Wang Lun'') was Döblin's third novel (although it was the first to be published as a book), and garnered him the Fontane Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=29, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1916, (although back-dated to 1915), this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th-century China, and was favorably received by critics, who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=137}}; {{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wang Lun'' also had an influence on younger German writers, including [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Anna Seghers]], and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, ''Wang Lun'' provided an impulse for the development of the theory of [[epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In commercial sales, it is Döblin's most successful novel after ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoeller|2011|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine''===
{{Main|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine}}
[[File:Wadzek.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''[[Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine]]'']]
Döblin's 1918 comic novel has been seen, in its experimental narrative technique, its refusal to psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1981|p=418}}; {{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine'' (''Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine'') tells the story of Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the [[Fischer Verlag]]. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young [[Bertolt Brecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riley|1987|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wallenstein''===
{{Main|Wallenstein (novel)}}
Although Döblin's 1920 epic about the [[Thirty Years' War]] was in general favorably received by critics, he was disappointed with the reception because he felt he had created in ''Wallenstein'' a peerless work; as a consequence, he wrote a scathing critique of critics which he published in 1921 under the title ''Der Epiker, sein Stoff und die Kritik'' (''The Epic Poet, his Material, and Critique'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on the tension between [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his general, [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]; Wallenstein represents a new type of warfare characterized by ruthless ''Realpolitik'' and capitalist expansion while Ferdinand becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the course of events and gradually retreats from politics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=149–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin's approach to narrating the war differed from prevailing historiography in that, rather than interpreting the Thirty Years' War primarily as a religious conflict, he portrays it critically as the absurd consequence of a combination of national-political, financial, and individual psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Döblin saw a strong similarity between the Thirty Years' War and the [[First World War]], during which he wrote ''Wallenstein''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is counted among the most innovative and significant historical novels in the German literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Berge Meere und Giganten''===
{{Main|Berge Meere und Giganten}}
Döblin's 1924 [[science fiction]] novel recounts the course of human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global struggle between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. ''Berge Meere und Giganten'' (''Mountains Seas and Giants'') presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2006|pp=766–767}}; {{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically and structurally experimental, it was regarded as a difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2006|p=766}}; {{Harvnb|Dollinger|2003|p=95}}; {{Harvnb|Sander|2006|p=788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[Günter Grass]] has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2006|pp=792–793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central episode of the novel - the destruction of Iceland to provide heat to melt the Greenland icecap - has been translated into English at Beyond Alexanderplatz - Alfred Döblin's OTHER writings, in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Iceland-Greenland Venture |url=https://beyond-alexanderplatz.com/mountains-oceans-giants-part-6-iceland/ |website=Beyond Alexanderplatz |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Manas''===
This remarkable but almost totally neglected epic in free verse immediately preceded Döblin's best-known work ''Berlin Alexanderplatz''. That both works were closely associated in Döblin's mind is shown by a remark in his Afterword to the 1955 East German edition of his big-city masterpiece: it was ''Manas with a Berlin accent'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Döblin |first1=Alfred |title=Zwei Seelen in einer Brust: Schriften zu Leben und Werk |date=1993 |publisher=dtv |location=Munich |isbn=978-342-302-445-7 |page=463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praised on its publication by Robert Musil among others (''I assert with confidence that this work should have the greatest influence!'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schuster |first1=Ingrid |title=Alfred Döblin im Spiegel der zeitgenössischen Kritik |date=1973 |publisher=Francke |location=Bern |page=192 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has attracted strangely little attention from Döblin scholars. 
''Manas'' Part 1 tells the story of a war-hero suddenly struck with an existential realisation of Death. He demands to be taken to Shiva's Field of the Dead in the high Himalaya to commune with Souls on their way to dissolution. Having imbibed several dreadful life stories he falls unconscious, and his body is invaded by three demons who plan to use it to go down to the human world. Manas' guardian, Puto, attempting to drive out the demons, inadvertently kills the body, and Manas's soul wafts back onto the Field. Puto conveys the body back to Udaipur, then returns to the mountains to fight the demons. 
In Part 2, Savitri, Manas' wife, refuses to believe her husband is dead, and makes her arduous way up into the mountains to find him. Shiva becomes aware of her presence on his Field, and makes contact across their different dimensions. Savitri is able to couple with Manas' soul, and he is reborn into his body. Savitri, revealed now as the Universal Female, rejoins Shiva on Mount Kailash.
In Part 3, the reborn Manas rejoices in his physicality, but does not understand where he fits into the world. He comes upon Puto fighting the three demons, captures them, and is carried by them back down into the world. A village priest declares that Manas and the demons make up a single new terrible being: likely meaning a human no longer innocent but equipped with Id, Ego and Superego. When Manas destroys a temple, Shiva comes down to subdue him, but Manas' Ego calls out to the natural world, and Shiva has to release him, transforming the demons into sleek winged panthers on which Manas rides to connect Souls longing to return with humans tired of life. 
This powerful and sometimes puzzling story is told in a vigorous, direct and dramatic language, with constantly shifting moods and voices. In order to make it more accessible to English readers in the absence of any guidance from reviewers, the translator C D Godwin has adapted it as a Play for Voices, available for download at the website Beyond Alexanderplatz: Alfred Döblin's OTHER writings, in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manas: a Play for Voices |url=https://beyond-alexanderplatz.com/manas-a-himalayan-epic/ |website=Beyond Alexanderplatz |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Berlin Alexanderplatz''===
{{Main|Berlin Alexanderplatz}}
Generally considered Döblin's masterpiece, ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' has become an iconic text of the [[Weimar Republic]]. Published in 1929, its innovative use of literary montage as well as its panoramic portrayal of a modern metropolis have earned it a place among the key works of literary modernism. ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' tells the story of Franz Biberkopf, who as the novel opens has just been released from prison for killing his lover. Although he seeks to become respectable, he is quickly drawn into a struggle "with something that comes from without, that is unpredictable and looks like a destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Döblin|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biberkopf suffers a series of setbacks and catastrophes, including the murder of his lover and the loss of an arm. The novel earned Döblin global recognition and literary celebrity, and was translated into English in 1931 by [[Eugene Jolas]], a friend of James Joyce. It has been filmed twice, once in the 1931 ''[[Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931 film)|Berlin-Alexanderplatz]]'', directed by [[Phil Jutzi]] and starring [[Heinrich George]] as Biberkopf, and then again in [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 1980 14-part [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|television film]]. In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers from around the world, ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' was named among the top 100 books of all time.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,711520,00.html The top 100 books of all time], [[Guardian Unlimited]]'', May 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===''November 1918: A German Revolution''===
{{Main|November 1918: A German Revolution}}
''November 1918: A German Revolution'' (''November 1918, eine deutsche Revolution'') is a novel tetralogy about the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTV.de |url=http://www.dtv.de/buecher/november_59030.html |accessdate=3 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924183128/http://www.dtv.de/buecher/november_59030.html |archivedate=24 September 2011 }}; {{cite web|title=Fischerverlage.de |url=http://www.fischerverlage.de/suche?text=november+1918 |accessdate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The four volumes—Vol. I: ''Bürger und Soldaten'' (''Citizens and Soldiers''), Vol. II ''Verratenes Volk'' (''A People Betrayed''), Vol. III, ''Heimkehr der Fronttruppen'' (''Return of the Frontline Troops''), and Vol. IV, ''Karl und Rosa'' (''Karl and Rosa'')—together comprise the most significant work from Döblin's period of exile (1933–1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernhardt|2007|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was highly praised by figures such as Bertolt Brecht, and critic Gabriele Sander has described ''November 1918'' as representing the culmination of Döblin's work in the genre of the historical novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tales of a Long Night''===
{{Main|Tales of a Long Night}}
''Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende'' (''Tales of a Long Night'') (1956) was Döblin's last novel.  Set in England immediately after the [[Second World War]], the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison, an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war. Back among his family, Edward must deal with his war trauma, long buried family conflicts, and his destabilized sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel treats such themes as the search for the self, guilt and responsibility, the struggle between the sexes, war and violence, and religion, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946, although it was not published until a decade later. Upon its 1956 release by the [[East Berlin]] publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening, the novel was well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|pp=223–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin's reading of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s interpretation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Döblin is generally considered one of the most important German writers of the twentieth century; yet popular perception of his work rests almost exclusively on ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'', considered the canonical German novel of the modern metropolis ("''Großstadtroman''").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Sander|2001|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Schoeller|2011|pp=338–9}}; {{Harvnb|Eggert|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writing is characterized by an innovative use of montage and perspectival play, as well as what he dubbed in 1913 a "fantasy of fact" ("''Tatsachenphantasie''")—an interdisciplinary poetics that draws on modern discourses ranging from the psychiatric to the anthropological to the theological, in order to "register and articulate sensory experience and to open up his prose to new areas of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His engagement with such key movements of the European [[avant-garde]] as [[futurism]], [[expressionism]], [[dadaism]], and ''[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]'' has led critic Sabina Becker to call him "perhaps the most significant representative of literary modernism in Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggert|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1967 essay, [[Günter Grass]] declared: "Without the Futurist elements of Döblin's work from ''Wang Lun'' to ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'', my prose is inconceivable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grass|1987}}; on Döblin's influence on Grass, see {{Harvnb|Trappen|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döblin was also an influence on writers such as [[W.G. Sebald]] and Bertolt Brecht; as Brecht wrote in 1943, "I learned more about the essence of the epic from Döblin than from anyone else. His epic writing and even his theory about the epic strongly influenced my own dramatic art."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern, well-edited, critical volumes of almost the complete œuvre have been appearing in German since the 1980s, published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and, since 2008, by the Fischer Verlag; and the Internationale Alfred-Döblin Kolloquien have been held every two years since the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internationale Alfred Döblin Gesellschaft|url=http://www.alfred-doeblin.de/|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But only a handful of other works of fiction have ever appeared in English translations: ''The Three Leaps of Wang Lun'' (trans. C. D. Godwin, Chinese University Press, Hong Kong, 1991), and the ''November 1918'' trilogy: ''A People Betrayed'' (which also includes ''The Troops Return'') and ''Karl and Rosa'' (trans. John E. Woods, Fromm International, 1983 and 1987); ''Tales of a Long Night'' (trans John E Woods, From International, 1987; and the lesser-known big-city novel ''Men without Mercy'' (trans. Trevor and Phyllis Blewitt, Howard Fertig, 1976). Two works of autobiography have also been translated: ''[[Destiny's Journey]]'' (trans. Edna McCown, Paragon House, 1992), the harrowing account of Döblin's flight and exile in the 1940s; and the account of his mid-1920s ''Journey to Poland'' (trans [[Joachim Neugroschel|J. Neugroschel]], I. B. Tauris, 1991).

Döblin's papers and manuscripts are housed at the German Literature Archive in [[Marbach am Neckar]].

'''Bocheonism''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 보천교 ''Bocheongyo'' or ''Pochonkyo'', "religion of the vault of heaven/firmament") was one among more than 100 [[new religious movements]] of [[Korea]] of the family of religions called [[Jeungsanism]], rooted in [[Korean shamanism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and recognizing [[Gang Il-sun]] (Kang Jeungsan) as the incarnation of [[Sangje]], the Supreme God. It was founded by Cha Gyeong-seok (1880-1936) on Ibam Mountain in Daeheung-ri, Ibam-myeon, [[Jeongeup]], [[Jeollabuk-do]], in the year 1911. Today this site is part of [[Naejangsan]] National Park.
Cha Gyeong-seok was originally a [[Donghak]] ([[Cheondoist]]) priest, who converted to [[Jeungsanism]] after meeting [[Gang Il-Sun]]. After Gang's death, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” 1880-1935, although in Kang's circle there was more than one "Subu"), a female disciple of Kang Jeungsan, around September 1911 gathered around her a number of Kang's followers. Cha Gyeong-seok was Goh’s male cousin and became the leader of Goh's branch. Dissatisfied with this situation, Goh separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own new religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch'' 43 (1967): 28-66; Massimo Introvigne, [https://wrldrels.org/2017/02/26/daesoon-jinrihoe "Daesoon Jinrihoe"], World Religions and Spiritualities Project, Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cha continued under the name Bocheon-gyo, which was adopted in 1921, at a great ritual held in [[Hamyang County]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]].
Eventually, Bocheonism became the largest Korean new religious movement and possibly the largest religion in Korea, with some six million followers,&lt;ref&gt; Robert Pearson Flaherty, “Korean Millennial Movements,” in ''The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism'', edited by [[Catherine Wessinger]], Oxford: Oxford University Press 2016,{{ISBN|978-01-953010-5-2}}, 326-347 (335).&lt;/ref&gt; including leading activists in the [[Korean independence movements]]. Bocheonism, however, declined rapidly after Cha's death in 1936, and fragmented into several competing group, as did Goh's organization. The largest among these branches is [[Jeung San Do]].
Cha prophesied that the unification of the world would take place beginning in Korea. Branches of Bocheonism are also credited with encouraging local culture in the Jeongeup region, including the pungmulgut performance tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8360">The '''''Book of the Faiyum''''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian "local monograph" celebrating the [[Faiyum]] region of Egypt and its patron deity, the crocodile god [[Sobek]]. It has also been classified generically as a "cult topographical priestly manual."&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, 566.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is known from multiple sources dating to [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ægyptus|Roman Egypt]] (332 BCE – 359 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Beinlich, 15 – 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily functioned as a mythologized map of the Faiyum.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known copies==
The ''Book of the Faiyum'' exists in a variety of forms. The book enjoyed a vast amount of popularity in Roman Egypt and many fragments of the text have been found. These include both [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and [[hieratic]] (a cursive ancient Egyptian script) versions of the text. Of the hieroglyphic versions, there are both illustrated and un-illustrated forms. Some of the hieratic copies contain [[demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] notations, but no purely demotic form of the text has been found.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most primary sources for the text are un-illustrated hieratic copies on [[papyri]]. However, as aforementioned, other sources are available. The text is partially copied in hieroglyphs on the walls of the [[Temple of Kom Ombo]], located in [[Upper Egypt]], outside of the Faiyum. The sarcophagus of Ankhru from the Faiyum locality of [[Hawara]] also contains hieroglyphic excerpts and copied illustrations from the text.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 183 – 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egyptologist]] [[Horst Beinlich]] published a full and illustrated edition of the hieroglyphic versions of ''Book of the Faiyum'' in 1991, thus paving the road for further scholarly investigation of the text. This publication is entitled ''Das Buch vom Fayum: zum religiösen Eigenverständnis einer ägyptischen Landschaft.''

===The Boulaq/Hood/Amherst Papyrus===
The Boulaq/Hood/Amherst papyrus is named for the three modern collectors who once held its pieces after its division in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Beinlich, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best-known version of the text, as it is renowned for its exquisite illustrations and fine state of preservation. The complete text measures 7 m in length.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major parts of this papyrus are in American museum collections – the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] and the [[Walters Art Museum]] – and are being reunited in a traveling exhibition set to open at the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]] on October 6, 2013. The exhibition is entitled ''Egypt’s Mysterious Book of the Faiyum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt’s Mysterious Book of the Faiyum''. Press Release, The Walters Art Museum, 28-05-2013, http://thewalters.org/news/releases/pressdetail.aspx?e_id=426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and function==
The book, though a product of the Roman Period of Egyptian history, is rooted in the established canon of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religious]] thought. Influences from and references to religious texts that were common in pharaonic Egypt are seen throughout the entirety of the ''Book of the Faiyum,'' standing as a testament to the longevity of Egyptian religion. Among these references to earlier doctrine is an outline of the basic journey of the sun god, [[Ra|Re]], which is detailed in older texts, like the [[New Kingdom]] [[Amduat]] [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]]. Re was thought to grow old in the course of each day and then rejuvenate during the night so he would be reborn again at sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, 27 - 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is explored extensively in the ''Book of the Faiyum'', as Sobek is portrayed as a manifestation of Re. However, deviating from New Kingdom traditions, Sobek-Re’s journey through the day concludes not with his descent into the [[Duat]] (afterworld), but rather, [[Lake Moeris]], the lake that is central to the Faiyum oasis. It is through the lake, not the underworld, that Sobek-Re makes his nightly journey.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, 68, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also includes references to various [[Egyptian creation myths]]. These theologies were held simultaneously – not competitively – in ancient Egypt, so it is not unusual for a text to reference more than one creation myth.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 2 -7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] myth of [[Hermopolis]] is illustrated in the ''Book of the Faiyum'' with detailed drawings of the eight frog- and snake-headed primeval deities around which the myth centers.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation story of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] is also illustrated, as [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], the sky-goddess, is shown in her celestial form as a cow. She is depicted being held up by the sun god, just as [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], the god of air, holds her up in the Heliopolitan myth.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

This highly esoteric text was likely the product of a House of Life, or temple scriptorium. It seems that the text was meant as a high form of scholarly religious doctrine. Some scholars have suggested that the text was intended for Sobek himself, as no human could unroll the entire papyrus to see and interpret the fully illustrated map, perhaps suggesting that it was not meant for human eyes at all, but rather those of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor 75 – 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have suggested that the frequency with which the document was copied, coupled with its complexity, could likely make it a text that was used to test the prowess of young scribes completing their training in the House of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 201 – 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a map===
The ''Book of the Faiyum'' also doubles as a mythologized map of the [[Faiyum]] region. It contains extensive lists of deities directly paired with their cult places. The reader is ultimately led through the text with a narrative of localities, even though few of them are physically depicted. Rather, these Faiyum-specific localities and the cosmic localities that are referenced in the text are often depicted with encoded iconography.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective of Sobek is assumed by the reader in this narrative. First, the waterway which connects the [[Nile]] and the Faiyum, the [[Bahr Yusuf]], is depicted in the form of the goddess [[Mehet-Weret]], “the great flood.” Then the inundated lands surrounding the lake are depicted, followed by the lake itself. Sobek’s cult center, which the Greeks called [[Faiyum|Crocodilopolis]] (ancient Egyptian "Shedyet"), is rendered next. Then a less significant cult center, Ro-sehwy, is shown. Finally, the last and perhaps least significant cult center is depicted, being that of Sobek’s divine mother, [[Neith]]. A depiction of primeval gods and forces situates the Faiyum as a center of cosmic importance before the text concludes with another depiction of the Faiyum’s central lake, [[Lake Moeris]].&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, 70 – 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 188 – 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cecil Frederick Russell''' (1897–1987) was a 20th-century American occultist.  Russell was a member of the [[A∴A∴]] and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s O.T.O. magical order.   Russell later founded his own magical order, the G.B.G. (variously explained as "Great Brotherhood of God" or "Gnostic Body of God").

== Early life ==
Russell was born in Greenwood, Mass. on June 9, 1897;  His family later moved to Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref name="kaczynski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaczynski|first1=Richard|authorlink=Richard Kaczynski| title=Perdurabo, Revised and Expanded Edition|date=April 10, 2012|publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]]|isbn=978-1-58394-576-6|page=329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_A23t1hGFwUC&amp;pg=PA329#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family stayed in the Massachusetts/New Hampshire area he went to Florida by bicycle to join the navy.

From April 22, 1917 to December 12, 1918, Russell served in the US Navy, where he worked at a hospital attendant at the US Naval Academy Hospital.&lt;ref name="kaczynski" /&gt;  While serving as a Pharmacist Mate aboard the USS Reina Mercedes, Russell injected himself with cocaine, resulting in a dishonorable discharge from the US Navy.&lt;ref name="kaczynski" /&gt;

Russell disputes this in his Autobiography Znuz is Znees 2nd edition Page 157 - he pretended so as to be transferred to the medical facility &amp; was discharged with a medical discharge. The war was over &amp; he wanted to go join Crowley.

== Disciple of Crowley ==
[[File:Aleister Crowley, Golden Dawn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Crowley in [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] garb]]
In June 1918, Russell met Crowley in New York and was initiated into the third-degree of Crowley's magical order [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].  Russell took the magical name of 'Frater Genesthai'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iw4BG8TVzQUC&amp;pg=PA131|title=Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley|publisher=}}, Crowley, A., &amp; Skinner, S. (1996). The magical diaries of Aleister Crowley: Tunesia 1923. York Beach, ME: Weiser.&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 1920 to Autumn 1921, Russell lived at Crowley's 'abbey' in Cefalu, Sicily.&lt;ref name="google.com3" /&gt;  Crowley's diary records:&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, 1918 Diary (OTO Archives), cited in Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdKvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288|title=Do What Thou Wilt|publisher=}} Sutin, L. (2002). Do what thou wilt: A life of Aleister Crowley. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0-312-25243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C.F.R 's account of the magical working is in P.117-118 in Znuz is Znees volume 2.  The details of the working are far more interesting than Crowley's comment below. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now I'll shave and make up my face like the lowest kind of whore and rub on perfume and go after Genesthai [Russell] like a drunken two-bit prick-pit in old New Orleans. He disgusts me sexually, as I him, as I suspect…[T]he dirtier my deed, the dearer my darling will hold me; the grosser the act the greedier my arse to engulph him!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Founder of an order ==
In 1922, Russell founded the Choronzon Club, advertising it as a 'short cut to initiation" in the pages of ''Occult Digest''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM2DpIct1jsC&amp;pg=PA220&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931, the group changed its name to G.B.G (for "Great Brotherhood of God" or "Gnostic Body of God")&lt;ref name="google.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoybRLX4jqIC&amp;pg=PA244|title=Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic|publisher=}}, Chappell, V. (2010). Sexual outlaw, erotic mystic: The essential Ida Craddock. San Francisco, CA: Red Wheel/Weiser.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA12|title=The Complete Magick Curriculum of the Secret Order G.B.G.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially structured as a correspondence course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EWh1AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9 The Occult Mentors of Maria de Naglowska], {{ISBN|978-0-557-40475-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.B.G was headquartered in Chicago.&lt;ref name="google.com4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6dzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60|title=The Great Work of the Flesh|publisher=}}, Alexandrian, S. (2015). The great work of the flesh: Sexual magic East and West.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell received half of all initiation fees collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM2DpIct1jsC&amp;pg=PA223|title=The Unknown God|publisher=}}, Starr, M. P. (2003). The unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites. Bolingbrook, Ill: Teitan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_A23t1hGFwUC&amp;pg=PA486|title=Perdurabo, Revised and Expanded Edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees were used to support the neighborhoods.

Inspired by [[Ida Craddock]], Russell developed his own curriculum of [[sex magick]].&lt;ref name="google.com2" /&gt;  In the 1960s, disciple Louis T. Culling published these in two works entitled ''The Complete Magickal Curriculum of the Secret Order G.'.B.'.G.'.'' and ''Sex Magick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0-7387-1912-9|title=The Complete Magick Curriculum of the Secret Order G.B.G.: Being the Entire Study, Curriculum, Magick Rituals, and Initiatory Practices of the G.B.G (The Great Brotherhood of God)|author= Louis T. Culling, Carl Llewellyn Weschcke|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two degrees, "Alphaism and Dianism", reportedly draw upon Ida Craddock's work ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' &lt;ref name="google.com1" /&gt; Culling writes that Dianism is "sexual congress without bringing it to climax" and that each participant is to regard their partner not as a "known earthly personality" but as a "visible manifestation of one's [[Holy Guardian Angel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA127&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, Russell was visited by fellow Thelemite [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]], who would later head the O.T.O's California chapter, the [[Agape Lodge]].{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=125&amp;ndash;129}}  Many of Russell's followers would later join Smith's organization.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM2DpIct1jsC&amp;pg=PA220&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was denounced by OTO leader Crowley, who in a document dated April 15, 1934 described Russell as a "thief, swindler, and blackmailer".&lt;ref name="google.com3" /&gt;

In 1938, the GBG dissolved.&lt;ref name="google.com4" /&gt;

As Genesthai (Russell) continued separately for the rest of his 90 years of life to teach after establishing nearly 100 members across the United States under the name of the G.'.B.'.G.'. . He mostly taught logic, mathematics, projective geometry as a more robust way of attaining enlightenment without the tendency to go insane as sex magic tends to do. Volume 3 of Znuz is Znees describes most of his inventions in that area. He even taught Zen Art work with water colors hand painting the pages for the members of the time. He except for his last 6 months he would send out a page of instruction every week.

== Later life ==
In 1944, Russell published ''Provenance'', described as "the only twentieth century occult text to center around the subject of book-collecting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weiserantiquarian.com/cgi-bin/wab455/31292.html|title=Provenance.|author=Weiser Antiquarian Books|publisher=}} Russell, C. F., Schimmel, S. B., Schimmel, C. F., &amp; Frank W. Tober Collection. (1944). Provenance. Los Angeles: Bookhaven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970–72, Russell published his memoirs entitled "Znuz is Znees: Memoirs of a Magician".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6dzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60|title=The Great Work of the Flesh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell died in 1987.

The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]] to creation, at the same time.{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=5}} The Chinese idea of the universal [[God]] is expressed in different ways; there are many [[names of God]] from the different sources of Chinese tradition, reflecting a "hierarchic, multiperspective" observation of the supreme God.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}

Chinese scholars emphasise that the Chinese tradition contains two facets of the idea of God: one is the personified God of popular devotion, and the other one is the impersonal God of philosophical inquiry.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|pp=71–72}} Together they express an "integrated definition of the monistic world".{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=73}}

Interest in traditional Chinese theology has waxed and waned over the various periods of the [[history of China]]. For instance, the [[Great Leap Forward]] enacted in the mid-20th century involved the outright destruction of traditional temples in accordance with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. From the 1980s onwards, public revivals have taken place. The Chinese believe that [[Chinese gods and immortals|deities or stars]], are arranged in a "celestial bureaucracy" which influences earthly activities and is reflected by the hierarchy of the Chinese state itself. These beliefs have similarities with broader Asian shamanism. The alignment of earthly and heavenly forces is upheld through the practice of rites, for instance the ''jiao'' festivals in which [[sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]] of [[incense]] and other products are set up by local temples, participants hoping to renew the perceived alliance between community leaders and the gods.&lt;ref name=Stafford2013&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stafford|editor-first=Charles|title=Ordinary Ethics in China|date=2013|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]]|isbn=0857854607}} pp. 198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=Alexus|title=Astronomy in the Ancient World: Early and Modern Views on Celestial Events|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=3319236008}} pp. 89–90: "According to the Chinese view, the circumpolar stars represent the palace surrounding the emperor, who is the pole star, and the various members of the celestial bureaucracy.

{{Further information|Hundun|Qi}}
As explained by the scholar [[Stephan Feuchtwang]], in Chinese cosmology "the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy" (''[[hundun]]'' 混沌 and ''[[qi]]'' 氣), organising as the polarity of [[yin and yang]] which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''. Yin and yang are the invisible and the visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order).{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}} The gods themselves are divided in yin forces of contraction, 鬼 ''guǐ'' ("demons" or "ghosts") and yang forces of expansion 神 ''shén'' ("gods" or "spirits"); in the human being they are the [[hun and po|魂 ''hún'' and 魄 ''pò'']] (where ''hun'' is yang and ''po'' is yin; respectively the rational and emotional soul, or the ethereal and the corporeal soul). Together, 鬼神 ''guishen'' is another way to define the twofold operation of the God of Heaven, its resulting dynamism being called itself ''shen'', spirit.

By the words of the Neo-Confucian thinker [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]]:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=223}}
{{Quote|[Heaven] is called ... the ''gǔi-shén'' with respect to its operation, the ''shén'' with respect to its wonderful functioning.}}

Another Neo-Confucian, [[Zhu Xi]], says:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=215}}
{{Quote|The ''shén'' is expansion and the ''gǔi'' is contraction. As long as it is blowing wind, raining, thundering, or flashing, [we call it] ''shén'', while it stops, [we call it] ''gǔi''.}}

The [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] winding the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]] and slithering between the [[Ursa Minor|Little]] and [[Big Dipper]] (or Great Chariot), represents the "protean" primordial power, which embodies both yin and yang in unity,{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and therefore the awesome unlimited power (''qi'') of divinity.{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} In [[Han dynasty|Han-dynasty]] traditions, Draco is described as the spear of the supreme God.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=170–171, Vol. I}}

Heaven continuously begets—according to its own manifest model which is the starry vault revolving around the northern culmen (北極 ''Běijí'')—and reabsorbs, the temporal things and worlds. As explained in modern Confucian theology:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=118}}
{{Quote|... the historical Heaven, namely the generated Heaven, [is] one particular form or modification (marked by the emergence of celestial bodies) of the eternal Heaven. This eternal Heaven was embodied in pure ''qì'' before its historical form had been realized.}}

Rather than "creation" (造 ''zào''), which has a long Western connotation of creation ''ex nihilo'', modern Chinese theologians prefer to speak of "evolution" (化 ''huà'') to describe the begetting of the cosmos; even in modern Chinese language the two concepts are frequently held together, ''zàohuà'' ("creation-evolution").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=125–127}} Such ordering power, which belongs to deities but also to humans, expresses itself in rites (礼 ''lǐ''). They are the means by which alignment between the forces of the starry sky, of earthly phenomena, and the acts of human beings (the three realms of [[Tian|Heaven]]-[[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]]-humanity, 天地人 ''Tiāndìrén''), is established. Such harmonisation is referred to as "centring" (央 ''yāng'' or 中 ''zhōng''). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Since humans are capable of centring natural forces, by the means of rites, they are themselves "central" to creation.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}

So, human beings participate in the ongoing creation-evolution of the God of Heaven, acting as ancestors who may produce and influence other beings:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=131–132}}
{{Quote|The involvement of an evolution in the divine creation hints that, although the Creator functions everywhere and all the time, every little creation is also participated by one particular thing which was previously created by the Creator. That is to say, each creature plays both the roles of creature and creator, and consequently is not only a fixed constituent of, but also a promoter and author of, the diversity or richness of the world.}}

[[File:Luna-Reflection-Sea-Superluna-Night-Super-Water-1826849.jpg|thumb|left|The metaphor of the moon.]]

The relationship between oneness and multiplicity, between the supreme principle and the myriad things, is notably explained by Zhu Xi through the "metaphor of the moon":{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=188–190}}
{{Quote|Fundamentally there is only one Great Pole (''Tàijí''), yet each of the myriad things has been endowed with it and each in itself possesses the Great Ultimate in its entirety. This is similar to the fact that there is only one moon in the sky, but when its light is scattered upon rivers and lakes, it can be seen everywhere. It cannot be said that the moon has been split.}}

In his terminology, the myriad things are generated as effects or actualities (用 ''yòng'') of the supreme principle, which, before in potence (體 ''tǐ''), sets in motion ''qi''. The effects are different, forming the "myriad species" (萬殊 ''wànshū''), each relying upon their myriad modifications of the principle, depending on the varying contexts and engagements. Difference exists not only between the various categories of beings, but among individuals belonging to the same category as well, so that each creature is a unique coalescence of the cosmic principle.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=188–190}} The ''qi'' of kindred beings accord and communicate with one another, and the same happens for the ''qi'' of worshippers and the god receiving sacrifice, and for the ''qi'' of an ancestor and his descendants.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=200}} All beings are, at different levels, "in" the God of Heaven, not in the sense of addition but in the sense of belonging.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=212}}

In the Confucian tradition, the perfect government is that which emulates the ordering of the stary vault of Heaven:
{{Quote|To conduct government by virtue may be compared to the North Star: it occupied its place, while the myriad stars revolve around it.|[[Confucius]], ''[[Analects]]'' 2:1}}

Since the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1046 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty]] 81046–256 BCE), the radical Chinese terms for the supreme God are ''[[Tian|Tiān]]'' 天 and ''[[Shangdi|Shàngdì]]'' 上帝 (the "Highest Deity") or simply ''Dì'' 帝 ("Deity").{{sfnb|Chang|2000}}{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|pp=63–67}}{{refn|group=note|帝 ''Dì'' is sometimes translated as "[[:wiktionary:thearch|thearch]]", from the Greek ''theos'' ("deity"), with ''[[arche]]'' ("principle", "origin"), thus meaning "divine principle", "divine origin".

These names are combined in different ways in Chinese theological literature, often interchanged in the same paragraph if not in the same sentence.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=66, note 224}} One of the combinations is the name of God used at the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, which is the "Highest Deity the Heavenly King" (皇天上帝 ''Huángtiān Shàngdì'');{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}} others are "Great Deity the Heavenly King" (天皇大帝 ''Tiānhuáng Dàdì'') and "Supreme Deity of the Vast Heaven" (昊天上帝 ''Hàotiān Shàngdì'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=70}}

Throughout the Chinese theological literary tradition, the Dipper constellations, and especially the Big Dipper (北斗星 ''Běidǒuxīng'', "Northern Dipper"), also known as Great Chariot, within Ursa Major, are portrayed as the potent symbol of spirit, divinity, or of the [[Wufang Shangdi|activity of the supreme God regulating nature]]. Examples include:
{{Quote|The Dipper is the Deity’s carriage. It revolves about the centre, visiting and regulating each of the four regions. It divides yin from yang, establishes the four seasons, equalises the five elemental phases, deploys the seasonal junctures and angular measures, and determines the various periodicities: all these are tied to the Dipper.|[[Sima Qian]], ''Treatise on the Celestial Officers''{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=9}}}}
{{Quote|When the handle of the Dipper points to the east at dawn, it is spring to all the world. When the handle of the Dipper points to the south it is summer to all the world. When the handle of the Dipper points to the west, it is autumn to all the world. When the handle of the Dipper points to the north, it is winter to all the world. As the handle of the Dipper rotates above, so affairs are set below.|''Heguanzi'', 5:21/1-4{{sfnb|Pankenier|2004|p=220}}}}

''Dì'' is literally a title expressing dominance over the [[Tianxia|all-under-Heaven]], that is all created things.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}} It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of ''di'' as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' explaining "deity" as "what faces the base of a melon fruit".{{sfnb|Zhao|2012|p=51}} ''Tiān'' is usually translated as "Heaven", but by graphical etymology it means "Great One" and scholars relate it to the same ''Dì'' through phonetic etymology and trace their common root, through their archaic forms respectively ''*Teeŋ'' and ''*Tees'', to the symbols of the celestial pole and its spinning stars.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}} Other words, such as 顶 ''dǐng'' ("on top", "apex") would share the same etymology, all connected to a conceptualisation—according to the scholar John C. Didier—of the north celestial pole godhead as cosmic square (''Dīng'' 口).{{sfnb|Dider|2009|p=4, Vol. III}} Zhou (2005) even connects ''Dì'', through [[Old Chinese]] ''*Tees'' and by phonetic etymology, to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''Dyeus''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005}} Medhurst (1847) also shows affinities in the usage of "deity", Chinese ''di'', Greek ''theos'' and Latin ''deus'', for incarnate powers resembling the supreme godhead.{{sfnb|Medhurst|1847|p=260}}

===Shang-Zhou theology===
[[Ulrich Libbrecht]] distinguishes two layers in the development of early Chinese theology, traditions derived respectively from the Shang and subsequent Zhou dynasties. The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the cosmos was "by itself so", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called ''dì'' (帝), "deities", and the utmost progenitor was Shangdi, identified as the dragon.{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Shangdi, and the four ''[[Wufang Shangdi|fāng]]'' (方 "directions" or "sides") and their ''fēng'' (風 "winds") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143–144, Vol. II}}

The Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, emphasised a more universal idea of ''[[Tian]]'' (天 "Heaven").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}

====Tian====
{{Main article|Tian}}
''Tiān'' 天 is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]] as the starry vault, manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature. There are many compounds of the name ''Tian'', and many of these clearly distinguish a "Heaven of dominance", a "Heaven of destiny" and a "Heaven of nature" as attributes of the supreme cosmic God.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65}}

In the ''Wujing yiyi'' (五經異義, "Different Meanings in the [[Five Classics]]"), [[Xu Shen]] explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65}}
* ''Huáng Tiān'' 皇天 —"Yellow Heaven" or "Shining Heaven", when it is venerated as the lord of creation;
* ''Hào Tiān'' 昊天—"Vast Heaven", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (''qi'');
* ''Mín Tiān'' 旻天—"Compassionate Heaven", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-Heaven;
* ''Shàng Tiān'' 上天—"Highest Heaven" or "First Heaven", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven;
* ''Cāng Tiān'' 苍天—"Deep-Green Heaven", for it being unfathomably deep.

Other names of the God of Heaven include:
* ''Tiāndì'' 天帝—the "Deity of Heaven" or "Emperor of Heaven":{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}} "On Rectification" (''Zheng lun'') of the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' uses this term to refer to the active God of Heaven setting in motion creation;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Tiānzhǔ'' 天主—the "Lord of Heaven": In "The Document of Offering Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on the Mountain Tai" (''Fengshan shu'') of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' it is used as the title of the first God from whom all the other gods derive.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65}}
* ''Tiānhuáng'' 天皇—the "King of Heaven": In the "Poem of Fathoming Profundity" (''Si'xuan fu''), transcribed in "The History of the Later Han Dynasty" (''Hou Han shu''), Zhang Heng ornately writes: «I ask the superintendent of the Heavenly Gate to open the door and let me visit the King of Heaven at the Jade Palace»;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}
* ''Tiāngōng'' 天公—the "Duke of Heaven" or "General of Heaven";{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=981}}
* ''Tiānjūn'' 天君—the "Prince of Heaven" or "Lord of Heaven";{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=981}}
* ''Tiānzūn'' 天尊—the "Heavenly Venerable", also a title for high gods in Taoist theologies;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}
* ''Tiānshén'' 天神—the "God of Heaven", interpreted in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' as "the being that gives birth to all things";{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Shénhuáng'' 神皇—"God the King", attested in ''Taihong'' ("The Origin of Vital Breath");{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Lǎotiānyé'' (老天爷)—the "Olden Heavenly Father".{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}

Attributes of the supreme God of Heaven include:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|pp=65-66}}
* ''Tiāndào'' 天道—"Way of Heaven"; it is the God's will of power, which decides the development of things: The ''Book of Historical Documents'' says that «the Way of Heaven is to bless the good, and make the bad miserable». It is also the name of [[Xiantiandao|some religious traditions]];
* ''[[Tiānmìng]]'' 天命—"Mandate of Heaven", defining the destiny of things;
* ''Tiānyì'' 天意—"Decree of Heaven", the same concept of destiny but implying an active decision;
* ''[[Tiānxià]]'' 天下—"Under Heaven"; means creation, ongoingly generated by the supreme God.

''Shàngdì'' (上帝 "Highest Deity"), sometimes shortened simply to ''Dì'' (帝 "Deity"), is another name of the supreme God inherited from Shang and Zhou times. The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' recites: «How vast is the Highest Deity, the ruler of men below!».{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}} ''Dì'' is also applied to the name of cosmic gods besides the supreme godhead, and is used to compose titles of divinity; for instance ''Dìjūn'' 帝君 ("Divine Ruler", Latin: ''Dominus Deus''), used in Taoism for high deities in the celestial hierarchy.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}

In the Shang dynasty, as discussed by John C. Didier, Shangdi was the same as ''Dīng'' (口, modern 丁), the "square" as the north [[celestial pole]], and ''Shàngjiǎ'' (上甲 "Supreme Ancestor") was an alternative name.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=213–219, Vol. II, comprising the sections "口, Di, the Ancestors, Shangdi, and Xiadi" and "口 as the Central Stellar Home of the High Ancestors and Conduit of Communication from the Center of Earth with the Center of the Sky"}} Shangdi was conceived as the utmost ancestor of the Shang royal lineage, the Zi (子) lineage, also called Ku (or Kui) or Diku ("''[[Divus]]'' Ku"), attested in the ''[[Shiji]]'' and other texts.{{sfnb|Eno|2008|p=72}}

The other gods associated with the [[circumpolar stars]] were all embraced by Shangdi, and they were conceived as the ancestors of side noble lineages of the Shang and even non-Shang peripherial peoples who benefited from the identification of their ancestor-gods as part of Di. Together they were called 下帝 ''xiàdì'', "lower deities" part of the "Highest Deity" of the Shang. With the supreme God identified as the pivot of the skies, all the lesser gods were its stars 星 ''xīng'', a word which in Shang script was illustrated by a few grouped 口 ''dīng'' (cf. ''jīng'' 晶, "perfect [celestial, i.e., star] light", and 品 ''pǐn'', originally "starlight"); up to the Han dynasty it was still common to represent the stars as small squares.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=213–219, Vol. II, comprising the sections "口, Di, the Ancestors, Shangdi, and Xiadi" and "口 as the Central Stellar Home of the High Ancestors and Conduit of Communication from the Center of Earth with the Center of the Sky"}} The Shang conducted magnificent sacrifices to these ancestor-gods, whose altar mimicked the stars of the north celestial pole. Through this sympathetic magic, which consisted in reproducing the celestial centre on earth, the Shang established and monopolised the centralising political power.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=213–219, Vol. II, comprising the sections "口, Di, the Ancestors, Shangdi, and Xiadi" and "口 as the Central Stellar Home of the High Ancestors and Conduit of Communication from the Center of Earth with the Center of the Sky"}}

The diagram is based on the ''[[Huainanzi]]''.{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}]]
The emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE) are credited with an effort to unify the cults of the ''[[Wufang Shangdi|Wǔfāng Shàngdì]]'' (五方上帝 "Five Forms of the Highest Deity"), which were previously held at different locations, in single temple complexes.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=784, chapter: Bujard, Marianne. "State and Local Cults in Han Religion"}} The Five Deities are a cosmological conception of the fivefold manifestation of the supreme God, or his five changing faces,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=71–72}} that goes back to the [[Neolithic]] and continues in the [[Chinese classics|classic texts]]. They "reflect the cosmic structure of the world" in which yin, yang and all forces are held in balance, and are associated with the four directions of space and the centre, the [[Sacred Mountains of China|five sacred mountains]], the [[Wu Xing|five phases of creation]], and the [[Four Symbols (China)|five constellations rotating around the celestial pole]] and five planets.{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=250|ps=. It describes a [[Ming dynasty]] painting representing (among other figures) the Wudi: "In the foreground are the gods of the Five Directions, dressed as emperors of high antiquity, holding tablets of rank in front of them. [...] These gods are significant because they reflect the cosmic structure of the world, in which yin, yang and the Five Phases (Elements) are in balance. They predate religious Taoism, and may have originated as chthonic gods of the Neolithic period. Governing all directions (east, south, west, north and center), they correspond not only to the Five Elements, but to the seasons, the Five Sacred Peaks, the Five Planets, and zodiac symbols as well. [...]".}}

During the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), the theology of the state religion developed side by side with the Huang–Lao religious movement which in turn influenced the early Taoist Church,{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=22–28}} and focused on a conceptualisation of the supreme God of the culmen of the sky as the Yellow God of the centre, and its human incarnation, the Yellow Emperor or Yellow Deity. Unlike previous Shang concepts of human incarnations of the supreme godhead, considered exclusively as the progenitors of the royal lineage, the Yellow Emperor was a more universal archetype of the human being. The competing factions of the Confucians and the ''[[fangshi|fāngshì]]'' (方士 "masters of directions"), regarded as representatives of the ancient religious tradition inherited from previous dynasties, concurred in the formulation of Han state religion.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|pp=778–779, chapter: Bujard, Marianne.

====Taiyi====
{{See also|Taiyi Shengshui}}
''Tàiyī'' (太一; also spelled 太乙 ''Tàiyǐ'' or 泰一 ''Tàiyī'';{{sfnb|Zhong|2013|p=69}} "Great Oneness" or "Great Unity"), also known as "Supreme Oneness of the Central Yellow" (中黄太乙 ''Zhōnghuáng Tàiyǐ''), or the "Yellow God of the [[Big Dipper|Northern Dipper]]" (黄神北斗 ''Huángshén Běidǒu''{{refn|group=note|A 斗 ''dǒu'' in Chinese is an entire semantic field meaning the shape of a "dipper", as the [[Big Dipper]] (北斗 ''Běidǒu''), or a "cup", signifying a "whirl", and also has martial connotations meaning "fight", "struggle", "battle".}}), or "Heavenly Venerable Supreme Unity" (太一天尊 ''Tàiyī Tiānzūn''), is a name of the supreme God of Heaven that had become prominent besides the older ones by the Han dynasty in relation with the figure of the [[Yellow Emperor]]. It harkens back to the [[Warring States period]], as attested in the poem ''[[Taiyi Shengshui|The Supreme Oneness Gives Birth to Water]]'', and possibly to the Shang dynasty as ''Dàyī'' (大一 "Big Oneness"), an alternative name for the Shangs' (and universe's) foremost ancestor.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. III, esp. "Chapter 6: Great Ancestor Dayi 大乙; Polar God Taiyi 太乙; Yi 一, "One"; and the Development of Early Imperial Chinese Cosmology"}}

Taiyi was worshipped by the social elites in the Warring States, and is also the first god described in the Nine Songs, shamanic hymns collected in the ''[[Chuci]]'' ("Songs of Chu").{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=75}} Throughout the Qin and the Han dynasty, a distinction became evident between Taiyi as the supreme godhead identified with the northern culmen of the sky and its spinning stars, and a more abstract concept of ''Yī'' (一 "One"), which begets the polar godhead and then the myriad beings; the more absract Yi was an "interiorisation" of the supreme God which was influenced by the Confucian discourse.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=86–90, Vol. III}}

During the Han dynasty, Taiyi became part of the imperial cult, and at the same time it was the central concept of Huang–Lao, which influenced the early Taoist Church; in early Taoism, Taiyi was identifies as the ''[[Tao|Dào]]'' 道. The "Inscription for Laozi" (''Laozi ming''), a Han stela, describes the Taiyi as the source of inspiration and immortality for [[Laozi]]. In Huang-Lao the philosopher-god Laozi was identified as the same as the Yellow Emperor, and received imperial sacrifices, for instance by [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] (146–168).{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|p=19}} In Han apocryphal texts, the Big Dipper is described as the instrument of Taiyi, the ladle from which he pours out the primordial breath (''yuanqi''), and as his heavenly chariot.{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=75}}

A part of the ''[[Shiji]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] identifies Taiyi with the simple name ''Di'' (Deity) and tells:{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=75}}
{{quote|The Dipper is the Thearch's carriage. It revolves around the central point and majestically regulates the four realms. The distribution of yin and yang, the fixing of the four seasons, the coordination of the five phases, the progression of rotational measurements, and the determining of all celestial markers—all of these are linked to the Dipper.}}

In 113 BCE, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], under the influence of prominent ''fangshi''—Miu Ji and later Gongsun Qing—, officially integrated the Huang–Lao theology of Taiyi with the Confucian state religion and theology of the Five Forms of the Highest Deity inherited from the erstwhile dynasties.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}}

''Huángdì'' (黄帝 "Yellow Emperor" or "Yellow Deity") is another name of the God of Heaven, associated with the [[celestial pole]] and with the power of the ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' (shamans).&lt;ref name=Wells2014/&gt;{{rp|12, note 33}} In the older cosmological tradition of the Wufang Shangdi, the Yellow Deity is the main one, associated with the centre of the cosmos.

In Chinese religion he is the deity who shapes the material world (地 ''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Dì]]''), the creator of the ''[[Huaxia]]'' civilisation, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and [[Yan Huang Zisun|progenitor of all Chinese]].{{sfnb|Chamberlain|2009|p=222}} In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi his astral body is [[Saturn]], but he is also identified as the Sun God, and with the star [[Regulus]] (α Leonis) and [[star (Chinese constellation)|constellations Leo and Lynx]], of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon, his serpentine form.{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=120–123}} The character 黄 ''huáng'', for "yellow", also means, by [[homophony]] and shared [[etymology]] with 皇 ''huáng'', "august", "creator" and "radiant", attributes of the supreme God.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|pp=504–505}}

As a progenitor, Huangdi is portrayed as the historical incarnation of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=1080}} According to a definition given by apocryphal texts related to the ''[[Yellow River Map|Hétú]]'' 河圖, the Yellow Emperor "proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper", is born to "a daughter of a chthonic deity", and as such he is "a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth".{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=22–28}}

As a human being, the Yellow Emperor was conceived by a virgin mother, Fubao, who was impregnated by Taiyi's radiance (''yuanqi'', "primordial pneuma"), a lightning, which she saw encircling the Northern Dipper (Great Chariot, or broader Ursa Major), or the celestial pole, while walking in the countryside. She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonnefoy|first=Yves|title=Asian Mythologies|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1993|isbn=0226064565}} pp. 241, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his human side, he was a descendant of 有熊氏 ''Yǒuxióng'', the lineage of the Bear—another reference to the Ursa Major. Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in [[Siberia]] or in north Asia.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=153–156, Vol. I}}

In older accounts, the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' to derive from ''guāng'' 光, "light") and thunder, and as one and the same with the "Thunder God" (雷神 ''Léishén''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Song|first=Yaoliang|title=The Deified Human Face Petroglyphs of Prehistoric China|year=2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=1938368339}} p. 239: in the ''Hetudijitong'' and the ''Chunqiuhechengtu'' the Yellow Emperor is identified as the Thunder God.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Lihui|last2=An|first2=Deming|title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=157607806X}} p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]''.

As the deity of the centre, the Yellow Emperor is the ''Zhongyuedadi'' (中岳大帝 "Great Deity of the Central Peak") and he represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} He represents the hub of creation, the ''[[axis mundi]]'' ([[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]]) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} As the centre of the four directions, in the ''[[Shizi (book)|Shizi]]'' he is described as "Yellow Emperor with Four Faces" (黄帝四面 ''Huángdì Sìmiàn'').{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=120}} The "Four-Faced God" or "Ubiquitous God" (四面神 ''Sìmiànshén'') is also the Chinese name of [[Brahma]].

Huangdi is the model of those who merge their self with the self of the supreme God, of the [[asceticism|ascetics]] who reach enlightenment or immortality.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=674}} He is the god of nobility, the patron of Taoism and [[traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]]. In the ''Shiji'', as well as in the Taoist book ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', he is also described as the perfect king. There are records of dialogues in which Huangdi took the advice of wise counselors, contained in the ''Huangdi Neijing'' ("Inner Scripture of the Yellow Emperor") as well as in the ''Shiwen'' ("Ten Questions"). In the Huang–Lao tradition he is the model of a king turned immortal, and is associated with the transmission of various mantic and medical techniques.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=505}} Besides the ''Inner Scripture of the Yellow Emperor'', Huangdi is also associated to other textual bodies of knowledge including the ''[[Huangdi Sijing]]'' ("Four Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor") and the ''Huangdi zhaijing'' ("Scripture of the Dwellings of the Yellow Emperor").{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1229}}

In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi, besides the Yellow Deity, the [[Heidi (god)|Black Deity]] (黑帝 ''Hēidì'') of the north, winter and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], is portrayed by [[Sima Qian]] as Huangdi's grandson, and is himself associated with the north pole stars.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=156, Vol. I}} The "Green Deity" or "Blue Deity" (蒼帝 ''Cāngdì'' or 青帝 ''Qīngdì''), of the east, spring, and identified with [[Jupiter]],{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|loc=''passim''}} is frequently worshipped as the supreme God and its main temple at [[Mount Tai]] (the cult centre of all [[Dongyue Temple|Eastern Peak Temples]]) is attested as a site for fire sacrifices to the supreme God since prehistoric times.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|p=1}}

''Yùdì'' (玉帝 "Jade Deity" or "Jade Emperor"), or ''Yùhuáng'' (玉皇 "Jade King"), is a personification of the supreme God of Heaven in popular religion.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1197}} More elaborate names for the Jade Deity include ''Yùhuáng Shàngdì'' (玉皇上帝 "Highest Deity the Jade King") and ''Yùhuángdàdì'' (玉皇大帝 "Great Deity the Jade King"), while among the common people he is intimately referred to as the "Lord of Heaven" (天公 ''Tiāngōng'').{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1197}}

He is also present in Taoist theology, where, however, he is not regarded as the supreme principle though he has a high position in the pantheon. In Taoism his formal title is the "Most Honourable Great Deity the Jade King in the Golden Tower of the Clear Heaven" (''Hàotiān Jīnquē Zhìzūn Yùhuángdàdì'' 昊天金阙至尊玉皇大帝), and he is one of the Four Sovereigns, the four deities proceeding directly from the [[Three Pure Ones]], which in Taoism are the representation of the supreme principle.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1197}}

The eminence of the Jade Deity is relatively recent, emerging in popular religion during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) and becoming established during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), especially under [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and [[Emperor Huizong of Song]].{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1197}} By the Tang dynasty the name of "Jade King" had been widely adopted by the common people to refer to the God of Heaven, and this got the attention of the Taoists who integrated the deity in their pantheon.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=1197}} The cult of the Jade Deity became so widespread that during the Song dynasty it was proclaimed by imperial decree that this popular conception of God was the same supreme God of Heaven whom the elites had the privilege to worship at the [[Temple of Heaven]].{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|p=155}}

There are a great number of temples in China dedicated to the Jade Deity (玉皇庙 ''yùhuángmiào'' or 玉皇阁 ''yùhuánggé'', et al.), and his birthday on the 9th day of the first month of the Chinese calendar is one of the biggest festivals.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|p=155}} He is also celebrated on the 25th day of the 12th month, when he is believed to turn to the human world to inspect all goods and evils to determine awards or punishments.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|p=155}} In everyday language the Jade Deity is also called the Olden Heavenly Father (''Lǎotiānyé'' 老天爷) and simply Heaven.{{sfnb|Yao|Zhao|2010|p=155}}

===Taidi===
''Tàidì'' (太帝 "Utmost Deity" or "Great Deity"), is another name that has been used to describe the supreme God in some contexts. It appears in the mysical narratives of the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' where the spreme God is associated to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]], the ''[[axis mundi]]''.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=603}}

===Shen===
{{Main article|Shen (Chinese religion)}}
神 ''Shén'' is a general concept meaning "spirit", and usually defines the plurality of [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods in the world]], however in certain contexts it has been used as singular denoting the supreme God, the "being that gives birth to all things".{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}

Concepts including ''shen'' expressing the idea of the supreme God include:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}
* ''Tiānshén'' 天神, the "God of Heaven", interpreted in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (說文解字) as "the being that gives birth to all things";
* ''Shénhuáng'' 神皇, "God the King", attested in ''Taihong'' ("The Origin of Vital Breath").

''Shéndào'' (神道 "Way of the God[s]"), in the ''[[Yijing]]'', is the path or way of manifestation of the supreme God and the gods of nature.
{{Quote|It is too delicate to be grasped. It cannot be perceived through reason. It cannot be seen through the eyes. It does without knowing how it can do. This is what we call the Way of the God[s].{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}}}

Since the Qin and Han dynasty, "Shendao" became a descriptor for the "Chinese religion" as the ''shèjiào'' 社教, "social religion" of the nation.{{sfnb|Zhao|2012|p=47}} The phrase ''Shéndào shèjiào'' (神道設教) literally means "established religion of the way of the gods".{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=124}}

===Zi===
[[File:Nanbaixiang-Jiedao-canalside-P1200770.JPG|thumb|A temple of popular religion in Nanbaixiang, [[Ouhai District|Ouhai]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]. The facade of the left side building features the modern stylisation of the 禄 ''lù'' / 子 ''zi'' symbol → [[File:禄 lù or 子 zi symbol---black.svg|20px]].]]
''Zi'' 子, literally meaning "son", "(male) offspring", is another concept associated to the supreme God of Heaven as the north [[celestial pole]] and its spinning stars. ''Zì'' 字, meaning "word" and "symbol", is one of its near homophonous and graphic cognates. It was the surname used by the royal lineage of the Shang dynasty.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=226, Vol. II}} It is a component of concepts including 天子 ''Tiānzǐ'' ("Son of Heaven") and 君子 ''jūnzǐ'' ("son of a lord", which in Confucianism became the concept of morally perfected person). According to Didier, in Shang and Zhou forms, the grapheme ''zi'' itself depicts someone linked to the godhead of the squared north celestial pole (口 ''Dīng''), and is related to 中 ''zhōng'', the concept of spiritual and thus political centrality.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=190–191, Vol. II}}

In modern Chinese popular religion ''zi'' is a synonym of 禄 ''lù'' ("prosperity", "furthering", "welfare"). ''Lùxīng'' (禄星 "Star of Prosperity") is [[Zeta Ursae Majoris|Mizar]], a star of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot) constellation which rotates around the north celestial pole; it is the second star of the "handle" of the Dipper. Luxing is conceived as a member of two clusters of gods, the ''[[Sanxing (deities)|Sānxīng]]'' (三星 "Three Stars") and the ''Jiǔhuángshén'' (九皇神 "Nine God-Kings"). The latter are the seven stars of the Big Dipper with the addition of two less visible ones thwartwise the "handle", and they are conceived as the ninefold manifestation of the supreme God of Heaven, which in this tradition is called ''Jiǔhuángdàdì'' (九皇大帝, "Great Deity of the Nine Kings"),&lt;ref name=Cheu1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheu|first=Hock Tong|title=The Nine Emperor Gods: A Study of Chinese Spirit-medium Cults|year=1988|publisher=Time Books International|isbn=9971653850}} p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xuántiān Shàngdì'' (玄天上帝 "Highest Deity of the Dark Heaven"),&lt;ref name=DeBernardi2007&gt;{{cite book|last=DeBernardi|first=Jean|chapter=Commodifying Blessings: Celebrating the Double-Yang Festival in Penang, Malaysia and Wudang Mountain, China|editor-last=Kitiarsa|editor-first=Pattana|title=Religious Commodifications in Asia: Marketing Gods|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113407445X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dòufù'' (斗父 "Father of the Chariot").

==Theology of the schools==
As explained by Stephan Feuchtwang, the fundamental difference between Confucianism and Taoism lies in the fact that the former focuses on the realisation of the starry order of Heaven in human society, while the latter on the contemplation of the Dao which spontaneously arises in nature.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} Taoism also focuses on the cultivation of local gods, to centre the order of Heaven upon a particular locality.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}

[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) emerged in the critical [[Warring States period]] as a reformer of the religious tradition inherited from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. His elaboration of ancient theology gives centrality to self-cultivation and human agency,{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}} and to the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of 愛人 ''àirén'', "loving others").{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=2}}

Philosophers in the Warring States compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classic metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (一 ''Yī''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii–xxxix, Vol. I}}

Fu Pei-Jun characterises the Heaven of ancient Confucianism, before the [[Qin dynasty]], as "dominator", "creator", "sustainer", "revealer" and "judge".{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=102, relying upon Fu, Pei-jun (1984). ''The Concept of 'T'ien' in Ancient China: With Special Emphasis on Confucianism'' (Ph.D. dissertation). Yale University.}} The [[Han dynasty|Han-dynasty]] Confucian scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BCE) described Heaven as "the supreme God possessing a will".{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=3}} In the [[Song dynasty]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], especially the major exponent [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200), generally rationalised the theology, cosmology and ontology inherited from the foregoing tradition.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|loc=''passim''}} Neo-Confucian thinkers reaffirmed the unity of the "heavenly city" and the earthly "divine city"; the city that the God of Heaven morally organises in the natural world through humanity is not ontologically separate from Heaven itself,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=98–99}} so that the compound "Heaven-Earth" (天地 ''Tiāndì'') is another name of the God of Heaven itself in Neo-Confucian texts.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=107}} Heaven contains Earth as part of its nature, and the myriad things are begotten (生 ''shēng'') by Heaven and raised up (養 ''yǎng'') by Earth.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=109–111}} Neo-Confucians also discussed Heaven under the term 太极 ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Tàijí]]'' ("Great Pole").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=121}}

Stephan Feuchtwang says that Confucianism consists in the search for "middle ways" between yin and yang in each new configuration of the world, to align reality with Heaven through rites. The order of Heaven is emphasised; it is a moral power and fully realises in patriarchy, that is to say the worship of progenitors, in the Han tradition in the male line, who are considered to have embodied Heaven. This conception is put into practice as the religious worship of progenitors in the system of [[ancestral shrines]], dedicated to the deified progenitors of [[Chinese kin|lineages]] (groups of families sharing the same surname).{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} The philosopher Promise Hsu identifies Tian as the foundation of a civil theology of China.{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}}

====Three models====
Huang Yong (2007) has discerned three models of theology in the Confucian tradition:{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=455}}
* (i) Theology of Heaven as discussed in the Confucian canonical texts, the ''[[Classic of History]]'', the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'', as a transcendent God similar to the God of the Hellenistic and Abrahamic traditions;
* (ii) Theology of Heaven in contemporary [[New Confucianism]], represented especially by [[Xiong Shili]], [[Mou Zongsan]], and [[Tu Weiming]], as an "immanently transcendent" God, the ultimate reality immanent in the world to transcend the world;
* (iii) Theology of Heaven in Neo-Confucianism, particularly the Cheng brothers in the Song dynasty, as the wonderful life-giving activity transcending the world within the world.

=====Canonical theology=====
The supreme power in Confucianism is ''Tian'', ''Shangdi'' or ''Di'' in the early or classic Confucian tradition, later also discussed in its activity as 天理 ''Tiānlǐ'' or 天道 ''Tiāndào'', the "Order of Heaven" or "Way of Heaven" by Neo-Confucians.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=457}}{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=24}} A number of scholars support the theistic reading of early Confucian texts.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|pp=457-462}} In the ''Analects'' Heaven is treated as a conscious and providential being concerned not only with the human order in general, but with Confucius' own mission in particular.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=457}} Confucius claimed to be a transmitter of an ancient knowledge rather than a renovator.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=458}}

In Confucianism, God has not created man in order to neglect him, but is always with man, and sustains the order of nature and human society, by teaching rulers how to be good to secure the peace of the countries.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=459}} The theistic idea of early Confucianism gave later way to a depersonalisation of Heaven, identifying it as the pattern discernible in the unfolding of nature and his will (''Tianming'') as peoples' consensus, culminating in the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]''.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=460}}

=====Immanent transcendence=====
Contemporary New Confucian theologians have resolved the ancient dispute between the theistic and nontheistic, immanent and transcendent interpretations of ''Tian'', elaborating the concept of "immanent transcendence" (内在超越 ''nèizài chāoyuè''), contrasting it with the "external transcendence" (外在超越 ''wàizài chāoyuè'') of the God of [[Christianity]]. While the God of the Christians is outside the world that he creates, the God of the Confucians is immanent in the world to call for the transcendence of the given situation, thus promoting an ongoing transformation.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=461}}

The first theologian to discuss immanent transcendence was Xiong Shili. According to him, [[noumenon]] (体 ''tǐ'') and [[phenomenon]] (用 ''yòng'') are not separate, but the noumenon is right within the phenomenon. At the same time, the noumenon is also transcendent, not in the sense that it has independent existence, separated from the "ten thousand things", but in the sense that it is the substance of all things. As the substance, it is transcendent because it is not transformed by the ten thousand things but is rather their master: it "transcends the surface of things".{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=462}} By transcending the surface, one realises the self-nature (自性神 ''zì xìng shén'') of himself and of all things; to the extent that a thing has not fully realised its own self-nature, God is also that on which any particular thing or human being depends (依他神 ''yī tā shén'').{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=463}}

According to the further explanations of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven is not merely the sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition, it is not one of the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of Western religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans—who are the primary concern of Confucianism—and within other beings in the world.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=464}} ''Tian'' is the ontological substance of reality, it is immanent in every human being as the human nature (''ren''); however, the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=464}} Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realise one's heart–mind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian». This means that ''Tian'' is within the human being, but before this last comes to realise his true heart–mind, or know his true nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to him. Mou cites [[Max Muller]] saying that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become», to explain the idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach ''Tian''.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=464}}

Mou makes an important distinction between Confucianism and Christianity: the latter does not ask one to become a Christ, because the nature of Christ is unreachable for ordinary humans, who are not conceived as having a divine essence; by contrast, in Confucianism, sages who have realised ''Tian'' teach to others how to become sages and worthy themselves, since Heaven is present in everyone and may be cultivated.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=464}} Mou defines Confucianism as a "religion of morality", a religion of the "fulfillment of virtues", whose meaning lies in seeking the infinite and the complete in the finitude of earthly life.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=464}}

Tu Weiming, a student of Mou, furtherly develops the theology of "immanent transcendence". By his own words:{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=465}}
{{Quote|A person is in this world and yet does not belong to this world. He regards this secular world as divine only because he realizes the divine value in this secular world. Here the secular world in which the divinity is manifested is not a world separate from the divinity, and the divinity manifested in the secular is not some Ideal externally transcendent of the secular world.}}

According to Tu, the more man may penetrate his own inner source, the more he may transcend himself. By the metaphorical words of Mencius (7a29), this process is like "digging a well to reach the source of water".{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=465}} It is for this emphasis on transcending the phenomena to reach the true self, which is the divine, that Tu defines Confucian religiosity as the "ultimate self-transformation as a communal act and as a faithful dialogical response to the transcendent"; Confucianism is about developing the nature of humanity in the right, harmonious way.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=465}} Tu further explains this as a prognosis and diagnosis of humanity: "we are not what we ought to be but what we ought to be is inherent in the structure of what we are".{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=465}}

Heaven bids and impels humans to realise their true self.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=466}} Humans have the inborn ability to respond to Heaven.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=466}} One may obtain knowledge of divinity through his inner experience (''tizhi''), and knowledge, developing his heavenly virtue. This is a central concern of Tu's theology, at the same time intellectual and affectional—a question of mind and heart at the same time.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=466}}

=====Theology of activity=====
{{Further information|Li (Neo-Confucianism)}}
Huang Yong has named a third approach to Confucian theology interpreting the Neo-Confucianism of the brothers [[Cheng Hao]] (1032–1085) and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] (1033–1107). Instead of regarding the divinity of ''Tian'' as a substance, this theology emphasises its creative "life-giving activity" (生 ''shēng'') that is within the world in order to transcend the world itself.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=469}} Also in the works of Zhou Xi, Heaven is discussed as always operating within beings in conjunction with their singular 心 ''xīn'' ("heart–mind").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=212}}

Neo-Confucians incorporated in Confucianism the discussion about the traditional concept of 理 ''Lǐ'', variously translated as "form", "law", "reason", "order", "pattern", "organism", and most commonly "principle", regarding it as the supreme principle of the cosmos.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=469}} The Chengs use ''Li'' interchangeably with other terms. For instance, discussing the supreme principle, Cheng Hao says that it "is called change (易 ''yì'') with respect to its reality; is called 道 ''dào'' with respect to its ''li''; is called divinity (神 shén) with respect to its function; and is called nature (性 ''xìng'') with respect to it as the destiny in a person". Cheng Yi also states that the supreme principle "with respect to ''li'' it is called Heaven (天 ''Tiān''); with the respect to endowment, it is called nature, and with the respect to its being in a person, it is called heart–mind". As it appears from these analogies, the ''Li'' is considered by the Chengs as identical with Heaven.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=469}}

By the words of the Chengs, Huang clarifies the immanent transcendence of the ''Li'', since it comes ontologically before things but it does not exist outside of things, or outside ''[[qi]]'', the energy–matter of which things are made. In Chengs' theology the ''Li'' is not some entity but the "activity" of things, ''sheng''. Explaining it through an analogy, according to the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', ''Li'' is originally a verb meaning to work on jade.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=470}} The Chengs further identify this activity as the true human nature.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=472}} Sages, who have realised the true nature, are identical with the ''Li'' and their actions are identical to the creativity of the ''Li''.{{sfnb|Huang|2007|p=473}}

Generally, in Confucian texts, 功 ''gōng'' ("work", "work of merit" or "beneficial work") and 德 ''dé'' ("virtue") are frequently used to refer to the ways of becoming a honourable man of Heaven, and thus they may be regarded as attributes of Heaven itself. Zhu Xi himself characterises Heaven as extremely "active" or "vital" (''jiàn'' 健), while the Earth is responsive (顺 ''shùn'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=113–115}}

====Humanity as the incarnation of Heaven====
{{Main article|Ren (Confucianism)}}
The relationship "between Heaven and mankind" (''tiānrénzhījì'' 天人之際), that is to say how Heaven generates men and how they should behave to follow its order, is a common theme discussed in the Confucian theology of Heaven.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=24}} Generally, Confucianism sees humanity, or the form-quality of the human being, 仁 ''rén'' (translatable as "benevolence", "love", "humanity"), as a quality of the God of Heaven itself, and therefore it sees humanity as an incarnation of Heaven.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=136–137}} This theory is not at odds with the classical non-Confucian theology which views [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] as the incarnated God of Heaven, since Huangdi is a representation of nobility and the pursuit of Confucianism is to make all humans noble (''[[junzi|jūnzǐ]]'' 君子) or sages and holy men (圣人 ''[[zhenren|shèngrén]]'').

According to [[Benjamin I. Schwartz]], in the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' it is explained that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Machle|first=Edward J.|year=1993|title=Nature and Heaven in the Xunzi: A Study of the Tian Lun|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791415538}} p. 209. Cites: {{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Benjamin I.|authorlink=Benjamin I.

{{Quote|[Dissonances] between man and Heaven [are] only provisional ... the human intellect which brings order to chaos is itself an incarnation of the powers of Heaven. Heaven's working in the non-human sphere is described in a language which can almost be described as mystical. Once the normative human culture is realized, man is aligned with the harmonies of the universe.}}

In the "[[Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind]]" (天人感应 ''Tiānrén [[Ganying|Gǎnyìng]]'') written by the Han-dynasty scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]], humanity is discussed as the incarnation of Heaven. Human physiological structure, thought, emotions and moral character are all modelled after Heaven. In the Confucian discourse, ancestors who accomplished great actions are regarded as the incarnation of Heaven, and they last as a form shaping their descendants.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=80}} ''Rén'' is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may comprehend his divine nature and achieve oneness with Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}

====Discourse about evil, suffering and world renewal====
{{Further information|Hun and po}}
In Confucian theology there is no [[original sin]], and rather humanity, as the incarnate image of Heaven's virtue, is born good (良心 ''liángxín'', "good heart–mind").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=150}} In Confucian [[theodicy]], the rise of evil in a given cosmic configuration is attributed to failings in the moral organisation of ''[[qi]]'', which depends on mankind's (or the "practising subject", ''shíjiàn zhǔtǐ'' 實踐主體, in [[Zhu Xi]]) free will, that is to say the ability to choose whether to harmonise or not with the order of Heaven, which is part of the creature's ability to co-create with the creator.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=143}}

Paraphrasing Zhu Xi:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=149–150}}
{{Quote|... each human activity, found in either the mind, the body, or in both of them simultaneously, either follows principles of the just Heaven, or is corrupted by selfish appetites.}}

Human ''qi'', the primordial potential substance, organises according to the [[yin and yang]] polarity in the two facets of 形 ''xíng'' ("body") and 神 ''shén'' ("soul").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=144}} ''Qi'' is open to both disorder (yin) and order (yang), bodily and heavenly appetites.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=145}} While other creatures have a limited perfection, the human being alone has an "unlimited nature", that is to say the ability to cultivate its ''qi'' in amounts and directions of its own choice, either yin or yang.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=146}} While Confucians prescribe to be moderate in pursuing appetites, since even the bodily ones are necessary for life,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=151}} when the "proprietorship of corporeality" (''xíngqì zhīsī'' 形氣之私) prevails, selfishness and therefore immorality ensue.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=147}}

When evil dominates, the world falls into disaster, society shatters up and individuals are hit by diseases, giving the way for a new heavenly configuration to emerge. By the words of Zhu Xi:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=141}}
{{Quote|Once [Heaven] sees that human beings' immorality comes to its apex, it will crush everything up. What will be left is only a chaos, wherein all humans and things lose their being. Subsequently, a new world will emerge.}}

Sufferings, however, are also regarded by Confucians as a way of Heaven to refine a person preparing him for a future role. According to [[Mencius]]:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=142}}
{{Quote|When Heaven is about to confer a great office on any man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with toil. It exposes his body to hunger, and subjects him to extreme poverty. It confounds his undertakings. By all these methods it stimulates his mind, harden his nature, and supplies his incompetencies.}}

Likewise, Zhu Xi says:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=143}}
{{Quote|Helplessness, poverty, adversity, and obstacles can strengthen one's will, and cultivate his humanity (''ren'').}}

===Taoist theology===

[[File:Shangdi and Doumu altar in Chengxu Temple, Zhouzhuang, Jiangxi.jpg|thumb|Altar to Shangdi and [[Doumu]] (斗母 "Mother of the Chariot"), representing the originating principle of the universe in masculine and feminine form, in the [[Chengxu Temple]] of [[Zhouzhuang]], [[Jiangxi]].]]
[[Taoist schools|Religious traditions under the label of "Taoism"]] have their own theologies which, characterised by [[henotheism]], are meant to accommodate local deities in the Taoist celestial hierarchy.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}} According to Stephan Feuchtwang, Taoism is concerned with the cultivation of local deities bringing them in alignment with the broader cosmology, in order to "centre" through the power of rite each locality with its peculiarities.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}} It has hermetic and lay liturgical traditions, the most practised at the popular level being those for healing and exorcism, codified into a textual corpus commissioned and approved by emperors throughout the dynasties, the [[Taoist Canon]].{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

The core of Taoist theology is the concept of ''[[Tao|Dào]]'' 道, the "Way", which is both the order of nature and the source of it. Differently from common religion or even Confucianism, Taoism espouses a [[negative theology]] declaring the impossibility to define the Dao. The core text of Taoism, the ''[[Daodejing]]'', opens with the verses: «The Dao that can be said is not the eternal Dao, the name that can be said is not the eternal name». Feuchtwang explains the Dao as equivalent to the ancient Greek conception of ''[[physis]]'', that is "nature" as the generation and regeneration of beings.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} Taoists seek "perfection", which is [[xian (Taoism)|immortality]], achieved by becoming one with the Dao, or the rhythms of nature.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

Deities who take part in the Dao are arranged in a hierarchy. The supreme powers are three, the [[Three Pure Ones]], and represent the centre of the cosmos and its two modalities of manifestation (yin and yang).{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=151}} The hierarchy of the highest powers of the cosmos is arranged as follows:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}}
* ''[[Three Pure Ones|Sānqīng]]'' 三清 — Three Pure Ones:
** "Jade Purity" 玉清 ''Yùqīng'', "Heavenly Honourable of the First Beginning" 元始天尊 ''Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn'';
** "High Purity" 上清 ''Shàngqīng'', "Heavenly Honourable of the Numinous Treasure" 灵宝天尊 ''Língbǎo Tiānzūn'';
** "Supreme Purity" 太清 ''Tàiqīng'', "Heavenly Honourable of the Way and its Virtue" 道德天尊 ''Dàodé Tiānzūn'', incarnated historically as [[Laozi]].
* ''Sìyù'' 四御 — Four Sovereigns:
** ''Hàotiān Jīnquē Zhìzūn Yùhuáng Dàdì'' 昊天金阙至尊玉皇大帝 — Most Honourable Great Deity the Jade King in the Golden Tower of the Clear Heaven
** ''Zhōngtiān Zǐwēi Běijí Dàdì'' 中天紫微北极大帝 — Great Deity of the Purple Subtlety of the North Star at the Heart of Heaven
** ''Gōuchén Shànggōng Tiānhuáng Dàdì'' 勾陈上宫天皇大帝 — Great Deity the Heavenly King in the High Palace at the [[Polaris|Old Hook]]
** ''Chéngtiān Xiàofǎ Tǔhuáng Deqí'' 承天效法土皇地祇 — Land Appeasing Soil Ruler who Imitates the Law which Sustains Heaven, is goddess [[Houtu]]

==Trends in modern Chinese political and civil theology==

Interest in traditional Chinese theology has waxed and waned throughout the dynasties of the [[history of China]]. For instance, the [[Great Leap Forward]] enacted in the mid-20th century involved the outright destruction of traditional temples in accordance with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. From the 1980s onwards a revival has taken place, with public sacrifices held at temples meant to renew the perceived alliance between community leaders and the gods.&lt;ref name=Stafford2013/&gt; In the 2010s, "the great majority of China's population of 1.3+ billion" takes part in Chinese cosmological religion, its rituals and festivals of the lunar calendar.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|p=144}} The cult of the Yellow Emperor is celebrated officially by the contemporary Chinese government.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|p=164}}

Even [[Chinese Buddhism]], a religion which originally came from abroad, adapted to common Chinese cosmology by paralleling its concept of a triune supreme with [[Shakyamuni]], [[Amithaba]] and [[Maitreya]], representing respectively enlightenment, salvation and post-apocalyptic paradise.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=151}} The [[Tathātā]] (真如 ''zhēnrú'', "suchness") is generally identified as the supreme being itself.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}}

In the wake of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], many scholars understand Confucian theology as a [[natural theology]].{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|loc=''passim''}} The Chinese theological conception of the God of Heaven's ongoing self-creation/evolution in the "divine city" and the broader cosmos is contrasted with that of God as a craftsman external to his creation which is the type of theism of Christianity.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=129–130}} Contemporary scholars also compare Confucianism and Christianity on the matters of humanity's good nature and of [[pneumatology]], that is to say the respective doctrines of the ''shen'' dynamism produced by God's activity (''guishen'') and of the [[Holy Spirit]], finding that the Confucian doctrine is truly [[humanism|humanistic]] since the spirit is the creative dynamism always present in humanity, while in the Christian doctrine the Holy Spirit ultimately belongs to God alone.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=236}} According to the philosopher Promise Hsu, in the wake of [[Eric Voegelin]], while Christianity fails to provide a public, [[civil theology]], Confucianism with its idea of Tian, within broader Chinese cosmological religion, is particularly apt to fill the void left by the failing of Christianity.{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}} Paraphrasing [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], Hsu says:{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}}
{{Quote|A society exists concretely, with regard to space, time, and human beings. Their organizational form and its symbols are sacred in their concreteness, regardless of ... speculations about their meaning.}}

Quoting from [[Ellis Sandoz]]'s works, Hsu says:{{sfnb|Hsu|2014}}
{{Quote|Civil theology consists of propositionally stated true scientific knowledge of the divine order. It is the theology discerned and validated through reason by the philosopher, on the one hand, and through common sense and the ''logique du Coeur'' evoked by the persuasive beauty of mythic narrative and imitative representations, on the other hand.}}

Also Joël Thoraval characterises the common Chinese religion, or what he calls a "popular Confucianism", which has powerfully revived since the 1980s, consisting in the widespread belief and worship of five cosmological entities—Heaven and Earth (''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Di]]'' 地), the sovereign or the government (''jūn'' 君), ancestors (''qīn'' 親) and masters (''shī'' 師)—, as China's civil religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Thoraval|first=Joël|title=Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Ancestors, Masters: Some Remarks on the Politico-Religious in China Today|series=Occasional Papers|number=5|year=2016|publisher=Centre for Studies on China, Korea and Japan|location=Paris, France|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116171349/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16819">'''Crisis of Marxism''' (aka “crisis in [[Marxism]]”) was a term first employed in the 1890s after the unexpected revival of global capitalist expansion became evident after the [[Long Depression|Great Depression of Europe from 1873-1896]], which eventually precipitated a crisis in Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''How to Change the World: Reflections on Marx and Marxism'', Yale University Press, 2011, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis resulted in a series of theoretical debates over the significance of economic recovery for the strategy of the socialist movement,&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; leading to ideological fragmentation and increasingly sectarian debates.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''How to Change the World: Reflections on Marx and Marxism'', Yale University Press,  2011, pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, orthodox Marxists came to believe that capitalism was on the “verge of breakdown,” while the socialist movement was on the “verge of revolutionary triumph,” but due to a renewed burst of capitalist and industrial activity such interpretations could no longer be maintained in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''How to Change the World: Reflections on Marx and Marxism'', Yale University Press,  2011, pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to introduce the notion of a crisis amid Marxism has been attributed to Thomas Masaryk,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jay, ''Fin de Siècle Socialism and Other Essays'', Routledge, 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; who declared in 1898 that he was observing a “crisis within Marxism”.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Labriola, ''Socialism and Philosophy'', Chicago, IL, Charles H. Keer &amp; Company, 1907, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing a potential problem, Masaryk professed that socialism would be strengthened considerably “if its leaders will frankly criticize its fundamentals to overcome their defects.”&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Labriola, ''Socialism and Philosophy'', Chicago, IL, Charles H. Keer &amp; Company, 1907, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaries treat these controversies within the Marxist ranks as a “crisis in Marxism,” a “crisis of Marxism”, or sometimes designating it as a “revisionist crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;Georges Haupt, ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871-1914: Essays by Georges Haupt'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the father of revisionism, [[Eduard Bernstein]] is regarded the main proponent in precipitating one of the greatest crises in the consciousness of the Marxist proletarian movement, and therefore initiating the “revisionist controversy.”&lt;ref&gt;David W. Morgan, “The Father of Revisionism Revisited: Eduard Bernstein,” The Journal of Modern History, University of Chicago Press, Vol. 51, no. 3, Sept. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The October 1898 Stuttgart Party Conference brought this theoretical crisis into the open, entrenched the main battle lines, and established the principal elements of the Revisionist position.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, Preface p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis in the economic theories of Marxism==

The debate over the economic dilemmas of Marxism came to the forefront after several articles by Conrad Schmidt in 1897 and [[Eduard Bernstein]] in 1898 were published in German Social-Democrat’s journals. They questioned the validity of some Marxist tenets, pointed out the possible erroneous nature of materialism, and proposed to revise Marxism,&lt;ref&gt;Georgi Plekhanov, “On the Alleged Crisis in Marxism”, 1898, ''Selected Philosophical Works'', Vol. II, Moscow, 1976, pp. 316-325.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually asserting that many of [[Karl Marx]]’s economic anticipations were not borne out by the expectations presented in ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'' and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dukes, ''World Order in History: Russia and the West'', Routledge, 1996, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernstein and other Marxist revisionists addressed a number of issues that focused on the deficiencies of Marx’s economic predictions. One of the first issues addressed was the Marxian prediction that industrial capitalism would lead to concentration and centralization. But Bernstein pointed out that ownership of businesses had become more diffuse, instead of being concentrated in few hands.&lt;ref&gt;Heather M. Campbell, edit., ''The Britannica Guide to Political Science and Social Movements That Changed the Modern World'', Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In his attempt to prove that industrial concentration was not increasing, Bernstein wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…it is a well-established fact that in a whole series of branches of industry small and medium-sized undertakings appear quite capable of existing beside the large industries.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Bernstein, ''Evolutionary Socialism'', New York, Schocken, 1961, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bernstein also attempted to demonstrate empirically that huge firms were not as profitable as small-scale ones, arguing that all sizes of companies could survive well together.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein challenged orthodox Marxist theories that capitalism was doomed to fail, noting that capitalism was increasingly overcoming a number of its frailties “such as unemployment, overproduction, and the inequitable distribution of wealth.”&lt;ref&gt;Heather M. Campbell, edit., ''The Britannica Guide to Political Science and Social Movements That Changed the Modern World'', Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Bernstein claimed that the apparent stabilization of capitalism was not temporary but a permanent feature.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Parvus (Alexander Helphand): “Bernstein's Statement”, ''Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung '', Feb. 9, 1898, reprinted in ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernstein contended that the income of the proletariat was rising,&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; which directly contradicted Marx’s conjecture that workers would become poorer due to capitalism’s insoluble contradictions, oppression of workers and oppressed class mold, and profit-based structure.&lt;ref&gt;M. Patricia Marchak Ideological Perspectives on Canada, McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2012, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his empirical approach, Bernstein took the position that economic prosperity under capitalism was causing a reduction in class conflict as well as increasing the differentiation of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein predicted that class antagonism would eventually diminish in a capitalist society whereas socialism would evolve peacefully under parliamentary and reformist responses.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Van der Linden, ''Kantian Ethics and Socialism'', Hackett Publishing Company, 1988, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first serious detractors of Bernstein’s reformist and optimistic stance towards capitalism was [[Alexander Parvus]] a Marxist theoretician. Parvus contended that Bernstein was attempting to “overthrow socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Pravus, “Bernstein's Overthrow of Socialism,” series of articles in ''Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung'' that denounced Bernstein, written between January and March of 1898. Reprinted, Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, Introduction p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his 1898 essays, Parvus critically examined the significance of Bernstein's revisionism, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What would be the point of striving to achieve political power if it only led to a ‘colossal defeat’? What would be the point of opposing capitalism if we could not manage without it? Instead we would have to encourage capitalist development, since, if it is not interrupted by general trade crises, it must eventually lead to the prosperity of all!&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Parvus (Alexander Helphand): “Bernstein's Statement”, ''Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung'', Feb. 9, 1898, reprinted in ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were a number of other economic dilemmas facing orthodox Marxism in the late 1890s. [[David Ramsey Steele]], a former member of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], summed up many of the most serious conditions behind the crises that plagued Marxism, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The workers were becoming richer, the working class was fragmented into sections with different interests, technological advance was accelerating rather than meeting a roadblock, the '[[rate of profit]]' was not falling, the number of wealthy investors ('magnates of capital') was not falling but increasing, industrial concentration was not increasing, and in all countries the workers were putting their country above their class.&lt;ref&gt;David Ramsey Steele, “The Mystery of Fascism,” first published in ''Liberty'', Vol. 15, no. 11, Nov. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bernstein and the ''Precondition of Socialism''==

In his 1899 ''Precondition of Socialism'', Bernstein treated the theoretical parts of Marxist doctrine as “not scientific but doctrinaire,” therefore rejecting the fundamental principle of scientific socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Bernstein, ''Precondition of Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy'', Raymond Guess, Quentin Skinner editors, Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, new translation, “Introduction,” p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Bernstein evoked Kantian liberal ideals that promoted ethical and moral arguments in favor of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger, ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; As Bernstein highlighted under the concept of [[ethical socialism]], “no action on the part of the masses”, could have a “lasting effect without a moral impetus.”&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger, ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 114, from Bernstein’s “The Realistic and Ideological Moments in Socialism,” 1898 in MS, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed the abandonment of the Hegel-derived dialectic and revolution itself, ushered in the first “post-Marxism” era.&lt;ref&gt;Saree Makdisi, Cesare Casarino, Rebecca E. Karl, edit., ''Marxism Beyond Marxism'', chap. 1, Fredric Jameson, “Actually Existing Marxism,” Routledge, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henry Tudor and J.M. Tudor, Bernstein’s rationale to reform Marxism was to secure “the rights of individuals and promoting their material wellbeing without undermining their independence.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, Introduction p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the predominant problem of socialism was to “prevent the sheer size of the modern state from submerging the individual and nullifying democratic control.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Tudor and J. M. Tudor, edited and translated, ''Marxism and Social Democracy: The Revisionist Debate 1896-1898'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, Introduction p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakdown controversy==

The crisis of Marxism encompassed the “Breakdown Controversy” which was an argument among [[Karl Kautsky]], orthodox Marxists, Bernstein and his revisionists over the predicted breakdown of capitalism due to its internal contradictions. Orthodox Marxists held the opinion that capitalism’s collapse was imminent, which would result in a revolutionary conjuncture.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, ''Praxis'', No. 3, 1976, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Opposed to revolutionary tactics, Bernstein argued that revolution was only justified if capitalism falls of its own accord. But if capitalism fails to self-destruct under the crisis of capital, as predicted by Marx, Bernstein and Marxist reformers believed that a transition to socialism could be accomplished through the existing political structure.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, Praxis, No. 3, 1976, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; To the consternation of orthodox Marxists, the contradiction of capitalism did not result in the worsening of economic conditions, pitting socialist theory against empirical data. In this debate, Kautsky, considered the pope of socialism, maintained that the Marxist revolution did not demand the economic breakdown of capitalism. In contrast, Bernstein conceived evolutionary socialism as an approach to Marxism that saw the pathway to socialism as reformist and evolutionary, minus the chaos and violence of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Terrance McLoughlin, R. T. Drake, “The First Crisis of Marxian Theory and the Bernstein-Kautsky Debate”, Praxis, No. 3, 1976, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==

The consequences that followed the crisis of Marxism led to the birth of revisionist Marxism, which subsequently resulted in the emergence of the [[Social Democracy]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;Ronaldo Munck, ''Marx @ 2000: Late Marxist Perspectives'', London and New York, Zed Books, 2002, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; considered a turning point when Bernstein challenged the central precepts of socialist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Haupt, ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871-1914: Essays by Georges Haupt'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, “Preface” by Eric Hobsbawm, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The final political schism over Marxist revisionism ruptured after the violent 1917 Russian Revolution, where the social democratic parties discarded militant revolutionary in support of parliamentary reformation, while still declaring their dedication to socialization.&lt;ref&gt;David Miller, “Social Democracy,” in ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward Craig, general edit., Vol. 8 (Questions to Sociobiology), 1998, p. 827&lt;/ref&gt; Social democracy advocated an evolutionary transformation of the private-based economy to socialism via established political processes under social reform of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Social democracy", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation, [[Joseph Stalin]] unleashed a series of attacks against Marxist reformers and Social Democrats, declaring in 1924 that "Social democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism.... These organisations are not antipodes, they are twins.”&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Stalin, “Concerning the International Situation,” ''Works'', Vol. 6, January–November, 1924, pp. 293-314&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Stalin, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) applied the term “[[social fascists]]” to the various independent Social Democratic parties, especially in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hildebrand, ''The Third Reich'', Routledge, 1991, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the 1890s, numerous periods were under a continuing crisis of Marxist theory, including the early 1930s where German Marxist theoretician [[Karl Korsch]] warned that “Marxism today is in the midst of an historical and theoretical crisis. It is not simply a crisis within the ‘Marxist movement’, but a crisis of ‘Marxism itself.’”&lt;ref&gt;Karl Korsch, “The Crisis of Marxism,” 1931, First Published in ''Die materialistische Geschichtsauffassung'', 1971, trans. Otto Koester&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that Marxism has been in a continuous state of crisis throughout the 20th Century. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, a general Marxist crisis emerged that some claim was due to the rejection of Marxism by “millions of workers as an obstacle rather than a help to their struggles.”&lt;ref&gt;Harry M. Cleaver, "Kropotkin, Self-valorization and the Crisis of Marxism," ''Anarchist Studies'', 2:2, 1993, this paper was presented to the Conference on Pyotr Alexeevich Kropotkin organized by the Russian Academy of Science, held in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Dimitrov on December 8–14, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Day of Prayer''' is a day allocated to prayer, either by leaders of religions or the general public, for a specific purpose. Such days are usually [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] in nature. They usually are treated as commemorative in nature, rather than as actual liturgical feast days or memorials.

==World Day of Prayer for Peace==
:''Not to be confused with the [[World Day of Peace]].''
[[File:Peace Conference 10-11 489 cropped.jpg|thumb|Memorial engraving of global religious leaders at the first "World Day of Prayer for Peace" in Assisi (1986)]]
[[Pope John Paul II]] organized the first World Day of Prayer for Peace in [[Assisi]], Italy, on October 27, 1986.
In all there were 160 religious leaders who spent the day together with fasting and praying to their [[God]] or Gods. They represented 32 Christian religious organizations and 11 other non-Christian world religions, including:
*Christian religions and organizations:
**Roman [[Catholic Church]]
**[[Greek Orthodox Church]]
**[[Russian Orthodox Church]]
**[[World Council of Churches]]
**[[World YWCA]]
**World Alliance of [[YMCA]]'s
**[[Friends World Committee for Consultation]] (Quakers)
**[[Mennonite World Conference]]
**[[Reformed Ecumenical Council|Reformed Ecumenical Synod]]
**[[Baptist World Alliance]]
**[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]
**[[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]]
**[[Lutheran World Federation]]
**[[Anglican Communion]]

In 1993, John Paul II repeated the Day of Prayer to pray for an end to the [[Bosnian War|war in Bosnia]], and invited leaders of the Christian, Muslim and Jewish religions. And on January 24, 2002, he organized another World Day of Prayer for Peace, again in Assisi. Some 200 other religious leaders were present, including Roman Catholic cardinals, Muslim clerics, Jewish rabbis, Buddhists, Sikhs, Bahais, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians and members of African traditional religions. Following the [[Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], the Assisi event intended to discourage making religion a motive for conflict in the 21st century. The Pope had explicitly condemned the attacks when they happened, saying there was no possible excuse or justification for such acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1779135.stm |title=Pope leads world prayer day |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World-Day-of-Prayer-for-Peace Assisi 2011.jpg|thumb|Meeting of the participants of the fourth "World Day of Prayer for Peace" in Assisi (2011)]]

Pope John Paul II's successor and former aide, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], travelled to Assisi on October 27, 2011 for an ecumenical discussion to commemorate the 1986 meeting, but there was no single interdenominational prayer service. Benedict felt that, while such gatherings are good, one cannot give the impression – even externally, interpreted by others – that theological differences have been reduced or are not consequential.

==Global Day of Prayer==
The Global day of Prayer was founded by [[South Africa]]n businessman [[Graham Power]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091103164123/http://www.globaldayofprayer.com/history.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, the event spread to more African countries until it spread globally in 2005.  It is an [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] Christian event and involves 10 days of prayer before the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] observance of [[Pentecost]] (beginning with [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension Day]]) and 90 days of prayer after Pentecost.

==Great Prayer Day==
[[Great Prayer Day]] is a [[Public holidays in Denmark|public holiday in Denmark]] introduced in 1686 in the wake of the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation of the national church]].

==National Day of Prayer==
{{main|National Day of Prayer}}
This is a day designated by the [[United States Congress]] as a day when all [[United States|Americans]] regardless of [[faith]] are asked to come together and [[prayer|pray]] in their own way.  It is held on the first Thursday in May.  A "National Day of Prayer Task Force" was created in order to coordinate the event.

==National Day of Prayer and Remembrance==

A day of prayer in the United States to commemorate the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

==World Peace and Prayer Day==
Chief Arvol Looking Horse, Spiritual Leader, Keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Pipe, was directed to begin a spiritual journey and he committed to organize World Peace and Prayer Day in the Four Directions that would be held annually on the summer solstice, June 21.  As leader of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota (Sioux) Nation, he has invited the people of the world to return to their sacred sites on June 21 to pray to the Creator to heal the Earth and to heal relationships between people.  In 1996 Chief Looking Horse led a Unity Ride of Bigfoot Riders from the Wahpeton Dakota Reservation, Saskatchewan to Grey Horn Butte (He Hota Paha) Wyoming, called Devils Tower on current maps.  Over the past sixteen years the event has been hosted in Ireland (2001), Durban, South Africa (2002), Australia (2003) and Japan (2004).

In 2005 the WPPD ceremony then returned to Paha Sapa, the Sacred Black Hills for another wopila (thank you).
The Wolakota Youth Council embarked on a large-scale project called Prayer Run for World Peace 2005.  This project included both First Nation tribes and many non-native youth from all cultures across the nation.  Starting in May 2005 groups from the four directions started their run.  Los Angeles, CA in the west, Manitoba, Canada in the north, Long Island, New York in the east and the southern group from Mexico and El Paso, TX.  The youth concluded their run in the Black Hills to participate in the 10th annual World Peace and Prayer Day.  There was also a Prayer Ride for World Peace that started from Cypress Hills Saskatchewan.  A Horse Bundle was carried by the riders on a route that brought them across Montana and through many Tribal communities.  As many as 15 youth stayed on their horses all the way to the event.  It was a beautiful sight to see the horses and runners come in to the beginning of World Peace and Prayer Day.  They brought all their prayers in one hoop of unity.

'''2006:'''  A Prayer Run for World Peace started in Vancouver, British Columbia that spanned 2,262 miles to the site of World Peace and Prayer Day in Eklutna, Alaska, hosted by the Inuit.

'''2007:''' The Wolakota Youth Council also sponsored a Youth Prayer Run for World Peace that started in El Paso, TX and traveled over 1,600 miles to Mexico City, Mexico to the site of  Teotihuacan for the ceremony that was hosted by the Mayan.

'''2008:''' The ceremony journeyed to New Zealand to Whangarei.  The tribal communities of the Whangarei area mainly affiliate to the overarching tribe known as Ngati Wai who were the hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120322204107/http://www.wppdaotearoa2008.blogspot.com/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2009:''' The [[Intertribal Friendship House]] in Oakland, CA hosted the WPPD ceremony.

'''2010''': The fifteenth year of World Peace and Prayer Day was held at the Burgandy Brook Farm in Palmer, MA.  It was hosted by Blue Star Equiculture and honored the Horse Nation.

'''2011''' will be held at Bdote, Minnesota USA, which is the American Indian sacred site at the confluence of the Mississippi River and Minnesota River at the border of Minneapolis and Saint Paul Minnesota. The four-day event June 18–21 will include speakers and spiritual leaders from previous WPPD events around the world and an attempt at the World's Largest Group Hug on June 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303141335/http://worldpeaceandprayerday2011.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The First Link of Prayer from Jerusalem==
The first globally publicized "link of prayer" for peace from Jerusalem was in June 1993 organized by Dan Mazar and the [[Jerusalem Christian Review]], a Jerusalem-based archaeological journal.  The event included more than 100 Christian and political leaders from around the world and was broadcast by satellite and radio live from Jerusalem.

Parts of the Global Prayer were also shown on the [[CNN]], [[CBS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television networks and almost 120 other television stations worldwide. The Prayer Link began from Los Angeles, California with a prayer from the former U.S. President, [[Ronald Reagan]]:  "I join my friends at the Jerusalem Christian Review... for this very special day.  A day dedicated to prayer..." said the former US president and governor of the [[State of California]].  The "prayer link" also included prayers of political figures live by satellite from 5 continents. Leaders such as [[Jack Kemp]], [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] and numerous U.S. Senators, as well as former Australian Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] all prayed for the "Peace of Jerusalem". Also included were Christian evangelists [[Billy Graham]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[James Dobson]], along with denominational leaders from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=Prayer&gt;World Link of Prayer: ''Christianity Today Magazine'', September 1993; ''Associated Press Wire Service'', July 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1993/06/28/archive/reagan-other-americans-help-launch-christian-prayer-line-to-jerusalem|title=Reagan, Other Americans Help Launch Christian Prayer Line to Jerusalem|date=28 June 1993|website=Jta.org|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem==
{{main|Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem}}
A prayer meeting organized by Pentecostal evangelists Jack W. Hayford and Robert Stearns through their organization "Eagles Wings". They annually invite people around the world to pray for Jerusalem on the first Sunday of every October, close to the time of Yom Kippur. Their first prayer meeting occurred in 2004.

==Haystack Prayer Meeting==
{{main|Haystack Prayer Meeting}}
Held in August 1806 this is viewed by many scholars as the seminal event for the development of Protestant Missions in the subsequent decades and centuries. On a hot summer day, a few Williams College students gathered in a field to discuss the spiritual welfare of the people of Asia.  When a thunderstorm developed over the field, the students took refuge in the lee of a large haystack and continued their prayer meeting.

==Women's World Day of Prayer==
{{main|World Day of Prayer}}
Held on the first Friday in March each year, the World Day of Prayer is the world's largest [[ecumenical]] laywomen’s initiative.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} It is run under the motto ''Informed Prayer and Prayerful Action'', and is celebrated annually by Christian women in over 170 countries. The movement aims to bring together women of various races, cultures and traditions in a yearly common day of prayer, as well as in closer fellowship, understanding and action throughout the year.

==World Day of Prayer for Priests==
On the feast day of the [[Sacred Heart]] (19 days after the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] observance of [[Pentecost]]), the [[Roman Catholic Church]] holds a day of prayer for the sanctification of priests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030619160403/http://www.worldpriestday.com/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Day of Prayer for the Unborn==
Some churches, especially the Catholic Church and similar churches, usually have a day of prayer for the unborn, which may also extend to prayers for the pregnant, and for an end to abortion, and even to other [[pro-life]] concerns, such as the preservation of marriage, euthanasia, the elderly, and an end to embryonic stem cell research and genetic experimentation and eugenics, or even the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=World%20Day%20of%20Prayer%20for%20the%20Unborn |title=Google |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Day of Prayer for Families==
Some churches have a day of prayer for families, especially the monotheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=World%20Day%20for%20Families |title=Google |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Greek religion}}
The '''Delphic maxims''' are a set of 147 [[aphorisms]] inscribed at [[Delphi]]. Originally, they were said to have been given by the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]] [[Apollo]]'s [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] and were therefore attributed to Apollo himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temenostheon.com/delphic_maxims.html Temenos Theon – The Delphic Maxims]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[5th century]] scholar [[Stobaeus]] later attributed them to the [[Seven Sages of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Kurke, ''Aesopic Conversations: Popular Tradition, Cultural Dialogue, and the Invention of Greek Prose'', Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary scholars, however, hold that their original authorship is uncertain and that 'most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.'&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D. Wormell, ''The Delphic Oracle'', (Basil Blackwell, 1956), vol. 1, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous of these maxims is '[[know thyself]],' which was carved into the [[Delphi#Temple_of_Apollo|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]]. The specific order and wording of each maxim varies between different versions (and translations) of the text.

==Ai-Khanoum inscription==
In the ruins of the Hellenistic city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] (former [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]], and modern [[Afghanistan]]), on a [[Herõon]] (funerary monument) identified in Greek as the tomb of Kineas (also described as the ''[[oikistes]]'' (founder) of the Greek settlement) and dated to 300-250&amp;nbsp;BCE, an inscription has been found describing part of the Delphic maxims (maxims 143 to 147):

:παῖς ὢν κόσμιος γίνου,
:ἡβῶν ἐγκρατής,
:μέσος δίκαιος,
:πρεσβύτης εὔβουλος,
:τελευτῶν ἄλυπος.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/25638818 Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries], Shane Wallace, 2016, p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Païs ôn kosmios ginou (As children, learn good manners)
:''hèbôn enkratès, (as young men, learn to control the passions)
:''mesos dikaios (in middle age, be just)
:''presbutès euboulos (in old age, give good advice)
:''teleutôn alupos. (then die, without regret.)"''

The precepts were placed by a Greek named Clearchos, who may or may not have been [[Clearchus of Soli]] the disciple of [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/25638818 Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries], Shane Wallace, 2016, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; who, according to the same inscription, had copied them from [[Delphi]]:

{{History of Thailand}}
The '''Dvaravati''' ({{lang-th|ทวารวดี}}, {{RTGS|Thawarawadi}}); ({{lang-km|ទ្វារវត្តី}} - ''Tvearvottey'') period lasted from around the 6th to the 11th century in what is now [[Thailand]]. Dvaravati refers to a culture, an art style, and a disparate conglomerate of principalities. Archaeological research over the past two decades or so has revealed the presence of a "proto-Dvaravati" period which spans the 4th-5th century, and perhaps earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Stephen A.|date=October 2016|title=The case for proto-Dvāravatī: A review of the art historical and archaeological evidence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/case-for-protodvaravati-a-review-of-the-art-historical-and-archaeological-evidence/6ABA16AADF5C3B4D62086719BEEF6A5C|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=366–392|doi=10.1017/s0022463416000242|issn=0022-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The culture of Dvaravati, was based around moated cities, the earliest of which appears to be U Thong, in modern day Suphanburi province. Other key sites include Nakhon Pathom, Phong Tuk, Si Thep, Khu Bua and Si Mahosot amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Stephen A.|date=October 2016|title=The case for proto-Dvāravatī: A review of the art historical and archaeological evidence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/case-for-protodvaravati-a-review-of-the-art-historical-and-archaeological-evidence/6ABA16AADF5C3B4D62086719BEEF6A5C|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=366–392|doi=10.1017/s0022463416000242|issn=0022-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends engraved on royal urns report the following kings: Suryavikrama (673-688), Harivikrama (688-695), Sihavikrama (695-718).&lt;ref name=C86&gt;{{harvnb|Coedés|1968|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A Khmer inscription dated 937 documents a line of princes of Chanasapura started by a [[Bhagadatta (of Chanasa)|Bhagadatta]] and ended by a Sundaravarman and his sons Narapatisimhavarman and Mangalavarman.&lt;ref name=C12&gt;{{harvnb|Coedés|1968|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But at that time, the 10th century, Dvaravati began to come under the influence of the [[Khmer Empire]] and central [[Thailand]] was ultimately invaded by King [[Suryavarman II]] in the first half of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |title=The Mon-Dvaravati Tradition of Early North-Central Thailand |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mond/hd_mond.htm|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hariphunchai]] survived its southern progenitors until the late 13th century AD when it was incorporated in the [[Lanna]] Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[David K. Wyatt]] and Aroonrut Wichienkeeo. ''The Chiang Mai Chronicle'', p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The people of the region used the [[Mon language]], but whether they were [[Mon people]] is unknown. There is evidence that these principalities may comprise many cultural groups of people, including [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and [[Khmer people]]. The theory of Thai migration into Dvaravati has been refuted and is now known to have happened much later.

The term Dvaravati derives from coins which were inscribed in [[Sanskrit]] ''[[sri|śrī]] dvāravatī''. The Sanskrit word ''dvāravatī'' means "that which has gates"&lt;ref name=Higham&gt;Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9786167339443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|301}} (from ''dvāra'' "door, gate, entrance"). Its name may derive from the city of [[Dvārakā]] in ancient India.

Little is known about the administration of Dvaravati. It might simply have been a loose gathering of [[chiefdom]]s rather than a centralised state, expanding from the coastal area of the upper peninsula to the riverine region of [[Chao Phraya River]]. [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were significant. The three largest settlements appear to have been at [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]], [[Suphan Buri Province|Suphanburi]], Praak Srigacha, with additional centers at [[U Thong District|U Thong]], Chansen, [[Khu Bua]], Pong Tuk, Muang Phra Rot, [[Lopburi]], Si Mahasod, [[Kamphaeng Saen]], Dong Lakhorn, U-Taphao, Ban Khu Muang, and [[Si Thep District|Sri Thep]].&lt;ref name=Higham/&gt;{{rp|303–312}}

The traditional chronology of Dvaravati is mainly based on the Chinese textual account and stylistic comparison by art historians. However, the results from excavations in Chansen and Tha Muang mound at U-Thong raise questions about the traditional dating. Newly dated typical Dvaravati cultural items from the site of U-Thong indicate that the starting point of the tradition of Dvaravati culture may possibly date as far back to 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, I. (2011). The Dvaravati Gap-Linking Prehistory and History in Early Thailand. Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association, 30, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Stephen A.|date=October 2016|title=The case for proto-Dvāravatī: A review of the art historical and archaeological evidence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/case-for-protodvaravati-a-review-of-the-art-historical-and-archaeological-evidence/6ABA16AADF5C3B4D62086719BEEF6A5C|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=366–392|doi=10.1017/s0022463416000242|issn=0022-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological, art historical, and epigraphic (inscriptions) evidence all indicate, however, that the main period of Dvaravati spanned the seventh to ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Stephen A.|date=October 2016|title=The case for proto-Dvāravatī: A review of the art historical and archaeological evidence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/case-for-protodvaravati-a-review-of-the-art-historical-and-archaeological-evidence/6ABA16AADF5C3B4D62086719BEEF6A5C|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=366–392|doi=10.1017/s0022463416000242|issn=0022-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dvaravati culture and influence also spread into Northeast Thailand and parts of lowland Laos from the sixth century onward. Key sites include Muang Fa Dead in Kalasin Province and Muang Sema in Nakhon Ratchasima province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Stephen A.|date=2013|title=Buddhism and its Relationship to Dvaravati Period Settlement Patterns and Material Culture in Northeast Thailand and Central Laos c.

== Art ==
{{main|Dvaravati art}}
Dvaravati itself was heavily influenced by [[India]]n culture, and played an important role in introducing [[Buddhism]] and particularly [[Buddhist art]] to the region.  [[Stucco]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] on the religious monuments include [[garuda]]s, [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]s, and [[Nāga]]s. Additionally, groups of musicians have been portrayed with their instruments, prisoners, females with their attendants, soldiers indicative of social life.  [[Votive tablet]]s have also been found, also [[molding (process)|moulds]] for tin [[amulets]], pottery, [[terracotta]] trays, and a bronze chandelier, earring, bells and cymbals.&lt;ref name=Higham/&gt;{{rp|306–308}}

==Cannabis ruling==
In 2013, Zalmonovich issued a [[halahkic]] ruling that consuming recreational cannabis is forbidden, but consuming medical cannabis is a [[mitzvah]]. This ruling was at odds with an earlier ruling by Rabbi [[Hagai Bar Giora]] who earlier in 2013 opined that there is no issue with smoking cannabis.&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"/&gt; Zalmonovich's views were informed by personal experience: “My mother and sister were diagnosed with cancer and suffered from terrible pain. So I asked the doctors for as much marijuana for them as possible.”&lt;ref name="Malul"&gt;{{cite web|last=Malul |first=Chen |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.649769 |title=Are cannabis and cigarettes kosher for Passover? - Sites |website=Haaretz.com |date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further noted that cannabis is however not [[chametz]], and that on Jewish holidays where starting a fire is forbidden, one may not strike a flame to ignite cannabis, but it is allowed to light it from a candle already burning, or consume a [[cannabis edible]].&lt;ref name="Malul"/&gt;

Like most religions, the [[Bahá'í Faith]] holds that having a strong belief, a personal [[faith]], is crucial to a spiritual life.

==Knowing the truth for oneself==

A Being disciplined about search for truth can be seen as a philosophy, and the literature of the religion sometimes praises philosophers. According to the Bahá'i Faith, the object of all learning is to achieve the presence of God in one's life, and thereby to know ourselves.

The Bahá'í Faith suggests that several ways of learning can help lead you to that goal:&lt;ref name="quest1"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/books/quest/quest.01.html Ch1 - The Ways of the Search: Towards a Philosophy of Reality] ''Eternal Quest for God: An Introduction to the Divine Philosophy of `Abdu'l-Bahá'' by Julio Savi, George Ronald, Publisher, 46 High Street, Kidlington, Oxford OX5 2DN, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quest2"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/books/quest/quest.01.html Ch2 - The Beginning of All Things] ''Eternal Quest for God: An Introduction to the Divine Philosophy of `Abdu'l-Bahá' by Julio Savi, George Ronald, Publisher, 46 High Street, Kidlington, Oxford OX5 2DN, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sense perception
* Intellect
* Insight
* The Holy Writings
* Experience and research
* Spirit of faith

&lt;!-- These five of the six sections below need a complete rewrite. I tried fixing them, but they need a complete rewrite; they should be about how the Bahá'í Faith believes they lead to faith, not a description of each. Why? The overall system is one going towards understanding and each way of knowing reveals some of all of the truth for oneself.

;Sense Perception
It is the most immediate way of knowledge and the broadest - shared with all animals.:&lt;ref "quest1"/&gt;  The senses are [[Senses#Definition_of_.22sense.22Specific organs|relates]] by their inherent function in relation to the function of the nervous system arriving at specific and clear awarenesses of existence (eyes see light and it is perceived, and so on). Certain realities are revealed by sense perception, but it can be fooled ([[illusions]]) and there is much we have learned of the universe senses will never testify to (from [[special relativity]], to the relationships of an [[ecology]], to the role of [[motherhood]] and [[love]], and of the love of God.)

;Intellect
The ability to appreciate abstraction, to conceptualize things and perceive therein relationships, is a useful method of gaining access to truth - this is the practice of [[science]] and [[logic]] and [[mathematics]].  However it can be mislead as it depends on assumptions and correct applications of relationships - and so can be wrong. And there are certain gaps in reasoning - for example [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Godels' Theorem]].

;Insight
By awareness of the inherent qualities of a thing, implications can be known, independently of inductive or deductive reasoning methods. This is not just a matter of mystics - great scientific advances have been made by an insight, and when language and behavior fail to communicate, a parent can still intuit when their child is hungry or thirsty.  But here again we can be mislead - that we may be attracted to or repelled from considering certain things over other things, or that we may become lost in our imagination of things that aren't true or simply relying on habit to tell us what we think we feel is true.

;Holy Writings
It accepted by Bahá'ís that truly divinely authored speech or writing is infallibly true&lt;ref "quest1"/&gt; - the problem arises what any specific reference actually means, or that the understanding should be literal, figurative, or both. The Bahá'í Faith, as every religion, take scripture seriously yet seriously is not synonymous with literally. Since Bahá'ís accept the divine authorship of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Qur'an, and have a respect for the divinely mandated station and message of the Founders of the major religions as well as the belief systems of the native peoples of the planet though noting that it can be difficult to separate truth from myth.

;Experience and research
Experience and research are avenues where each method can be considered in relation to the others so that harmony is achieved and paradoxes reconciled.{{fact|date=November 2010}} Experience and research also reveal that each avenue is one which learning itself affects - by training one can gain more precise appreciation of sense perception, a more extensive and sensitive application of intellectual relationships, a patience and clarity for insight,  and sincere deepened and expansive respect for the sacred in life and all existence.{{fact|date=November 2010}} As such the Bahá'í Faith has a [[Bahá'í Faith and education| principle of universal, or compulsory education]] with such topics as moral and spiritual education, engaging in a useful trade or profession, literacy and other implications. These are not conditions of understanding truth - they are the fruits of degrees of success of understanding truth which can further the effort of achieving further understanding. But all experience and research can still not result in all understanding and never error. In the Bahá'í Faith the Holy Books are held up as examples of incomparable authorship that could not have been achieved in their day by any person or cooperation of people, but are instead the work of God. And social fads and deranged application of human capacities could arrive at universally accepted and perfectly vacuous systems like [[nazism]] which in their day were held up as achievements of all avenues of human achievement and knowing.

;Spirit of faith
The ''Spirit of Faith'' is a concept of a reality within the context of Bahá'í metaphysics and mysticism - it is situated between the human spirit, most identified with the rational quality of the soul, and the Holy Spirit which among other things is one of the main channels of God's attention and mercy to all creation[[http://www.bcca.org/ref/books/bwf/0831thespiritoffaith.html]]. In this situation the Spirit of Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit, is from the Kingdom of God, and yet it is personal, not a Revelation meant for all mankind. The Spirit of Faith is also referred to as the ''indwelling spirit'' though both phrases are used in broader meanings as well. It has priority over all the other ways of knowing the truth for a person in that it can be far more immediate and all-embracing than the other ways of knowing for the person who achieves it. And yet it is recognized that having this condition does not automatically make an impact on anyone else and as such even those who attain to it should keep in mind all the ways of knowing the truth for the sake of each person - that God reaches to us 'where we're at' and leads us on as well as noting the goal of spiritual life isn't just to recognize the truth the fullest extent possible - it's also to develop a noble character. This condition is also capable of becoming a barrier between a person and God and knowing truth. Some mystics begin to think they stand in company with the Prophets when in fact they are still just human and have attained to no divine mandate[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/mystics2/mystic.html] without which the Prophets would never have let themselves be known to the generality of humanity. --&gt;

==Progression and development==
The Bahá'í Faith also references the idea that like many other things, the appreciation of truth, one's belief, and one's degree of faithfulness, is progressive. Major works of the Bahá'í Faith are renderings of the overall progress of the individual: [[Seven Valleys]], [[Four Valleys (Bahá'í)|Four Valleys]], [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]], [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|The Book of Certitude]] all reference stages of coming to know God and one's self. There are also significant references in various places in Bahá'í literature with respect to the goal or importance of a ''praiseworthy character''. For example a major initiative first mentioned in the first half of the twentieth century was to engage in the ''Double Crusade''. Speaking to the United States Bahá'í community [[Shoghi Effendi]] said [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/ADJ/adj-2.html?#gr32]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(A) rectitude of conduct, which in all its manifestations offers a striking contrast to the deceitfulness and corruption that characterize the political life of the nation and of the partisan factions that compose it, a holiness and chastity that are diametrically opposed to the moral laxity and licentiousness which defile the character of a not inconsiderable proportion of its citizens, an interracial fellowship completely purged from the curse of racial prejudice which stigmatizes the vast majority of its people, these are the weapons which the American believers can and must wield in their Double Crusade. First, to regenerate the inward life of their own community, and next to assail the longstanding evils that have entrenched themselves in the life of their nation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus half of the ''Double Crusade'' is about individual character and its issues within the religious community.

Various disciplines are mandated or suggested in the Bahá'í Faith as ways to grow, and protect, one's faith:

* Read the words of Bahá'u'lláh twice a day
* Read the daily obligatory prayers
* Teaching or promulgating one's belief (not [[proselytizing]])
* Performing pure and goodly deeds
* Being obedient to the laws and teachings of Bahá'u'lláh
* Being detached from ego and worldly matters (not disengagement from)
* Eschewing gossip and backbiting
* Meditating on spiritual matters

'''Farrukhzad''' ({{lang-pal|script=Latn|Farrūkhzādag}}; [[New Persian]]: {{lang|fa|فرخزاد}}), was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] aristocrat from the [[House of Ispahbudhan]] and the founder of the [[Bavand dynasty]], ruling from 651 to 665. Originally a powerful servant of the [[Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628), he, along with several other powerful aristocrats made a conspiracy against the latter and ended his tyrannical rule. They thereafter put Khosrow's son [[Kavadh II]] (r. 628) on the throne, whose rule lasted only a few months, before he was killed by a plague, being succeeded by his son [[Ardashir III]] (r. 628-629), who was only after one year murdered by the rebellious former Sasanian army chief (''[[spahbed]]'') [[Shahrbaraz]], who usurped the throne.

These events greatly weakened the Sasanian Empire, but by 632, when Khosrow's grandson [[Yazdegerd III]] (r. 632-651) ascended the throne, order was somewhat restored. However, just as peace was about to come, [[Muslim conquest of Persia|the Sasanian Empire was invaded by Muslim Arabs]], which resulted in the death of many Sasanian veterans, including Farrukhzad's brother [[Rostam Farrokhzad]] himself. Farrukhzad thereafter succeeded the latter as the ''spahbed'' and the leader of the ''Pahlav'' ([[Parthia]]n) faction, which had been formed by their father [[Farrukh Hormizd]], who was murdered in 631.

However, Farrukhzad was unable to defeat the Arabs, and was in 643, after having seen the loss of [[Ctesiphon]] and [[Isfahan]], Farrukhzad, along with Yazdegerd III, fled from one place to another until in 650, when Farrukhzad mutinied against his king, who was shortly killed by one of his servants. Farrukhzad later became the ruler of [[Tabaristan]] in 651, and would rule the region until his murder in 665 by [[Valash]], a [[House of Karen|Karenid]] aristocrat, who thereafter conquered his domains.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=304–318}}

== Name ==
Although his real name was "Farrukhzad" (meaning "the son of Farrukh" or "born with luck and happiness"), he is also known in other sources by various other names, such as '''Khurrazad''', '''Zad Farrukh''', '''Zinabi Abu'l-Farrukhan''' and '''Bav'''.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=150, 235, 424}}

== Family ==
Farrukhzad was the son of [[Farrukh Hormizd]], a prominent aristocrat from the [[House of Ispahbudhan|Ispahbudhan family]], who served as the army chief (''[[spahbed]]'') of the [[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr#Kusts of Eranshahr|kust]]s of [[Adurbadagan (kust)|Adurbadagan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]—he was one of the generals who led the Sasanian army during the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]], but in 626 along with his comrade [[Shahrbaraz]] rebelled against the Sasanian king [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628).{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=142}} Farrukhzad had one brother named [[Rostam Farrokhzad]], who at that time resided in the [[Adurbadagan]] province.

== The war with the Byzantines and the overthrow of Khosrow II ==
[[File:KhosrauIIDinarHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coin of [[Khosrow II]].]]
Farrukhzad is first mentioned during the reign of Khosrow II, where he occupied high offices and according to the Iranian poet [[Ferdowsi]] was "so close to Khusrow II that none dared to approach him without his permission".{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=147}} In 626, Shahrbaraz and Farrukhzad's father and brother rebelled. In 627, Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to negotiate with Shahbaraz, who was camping near the Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]]. However, Farrukhzad secretly mutinied against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz. He then encouraged to remain undivided and not fear the fury of Khosrow. Furthermore, he also said that there were not any grandees (''[[wuzurgan]]'') who supported him.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=147}}

Khosrow, however, began suspecting Farrukhzad of treachery but kept it to himself, because he did not want to make the situation worse than it already was.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=148}} At the same time, Farrukhzad was assembling more people who opposed Khosrow in order to stage a [[coup d'état]]. In 628, Farrukhzad freed Khosrow's eldest son [[Kavadh II|Sheroe]] from prison and along with several feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow. Sheroe was then crowned as the new king and became known by his dynastic name of "Kavadh II".

The feudal families which overthrew Khosrow included: Shahrbaraz, who represented the [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]]; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the [[Sasanian Armenia|Armenian]] faction represented by [[Varaztirots II Bagratuni]]; and finally the [[Kanarang]]iyan faction represented by [[Kanadbak]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=173}} Kavadh II thereafter ordered his ''[[vizier]]'' (''[[wuzurg framadar]]'') [[Piruz Khosrow]] to execute all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's favorite son and heir [[Mardanshah (Sasanian prince)|Mardanshah]]. Three days later, Kavadh ordered [[Mihr Hormozd]] to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian Empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. Furthermore, he also took all the properties of Farrukhzad and put him under arrest in [[Estakhr]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=291}}

== The Sasanian civil war of 628-632 ==
Following the loss of territory required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire, thus starting the [[Sasanian civil war of 628-632]]. This divided the resources of the country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague erupted in the western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavadh II, who was succeeded by his 8-year-old son [[Ardashir III]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}} Meanwhile, Farrukh Hormizd formed a faction in northern Iran known as the ''Pahlav'' (Parthian) faction, a faction of [[Parthia]]ns from several families who had rallied under him. During the time same time, however, Piruz Khosrow also formed an faction in southern Iran, known as the ''Parsig'' (Persian) faction.

On 27 April 629, Ardashir was overthrown and killed by Shahrbaraz, who then usurped the throne. Forty days later, however, Farrukh Hormizd killed him and made Khosrow's daughter [[Boran]] the new monarch of the Sasanian Empire. Boran then appointed Farrukh Hormizd as the minister of the empire. She, was, however, quickly deposed by Shahrbaraz's son [[Shapur-i Shahrvaraz]], who after a brief reign was replaced by [[Azarmidokht]], the sister of Boran. Azarmidokht, under the advice of the Sasanian nobles, recalled Farrukhzad from his arrest and invited him to serve the Sasanians once again. Farrukhzad, however, declined the invitation and refused to serve under a woman. He then retired in a fire-temple at Estakhr.

In 631, Farrukh Hormizd, in order to seize power, asked Azarmidokht to marry him. Not daring to refuse, Azarmidokht had him killed with the aid of the Mihranid aristocrat [[Siyavakhsh]], who was the grandson of [[Bahram Chobin]], the famous ''[[spahbed]]'' and briefly ''[[shah]]anshah''. She was however, shortly killed by Rostam Farrokhzad, who then restored Boran to the throne. Later in 632, Farrukhzad was once again invited to serve the Sasanians, this time by the newly crowned king [[Yazdegerd III]], who was a puppet king of Farrukhzad's brother, Rostam Farrokhzad. Farrukhzad accepted and all his properties were restored to him.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=291}}

== The Arab invasion of Iran ==

===The invasion of western Iran===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Mesopotamia]] and its surroundings.]]
However, during the same year, the majority of the [[Arabs]], united under the banner of [[Islam]], [[Muslim conquest of Persia|invaded the Sasanian Empire]]. By 636, the Arabs were at [[Al-Qādisiyyah (historical city)|al-Qadisiya]], a town close to Ctesiphon, which made Rostam Farrokhzad take action himself. However, Farrukhzad was unable to take part, because he was serving as the ''[[marzban]]'' (general of a frontier province, "[[margrave]]") of [[Balasagan]], a province far away from Ctesiphon.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=231, 234}}

While preparing to face the Arabs, he wrote a letter to Farrukhzad, which said that he should raise an army and go to Adurbadagan, while reminding him that Yazdegerd III was the only heritage left from the Sasanians.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=229}} Rostam then set out from Ctesiphon in command of a large Sasanian force to confront the Arabs. The battle lasted three days, Rostam being defeated and killed during the last day.

After the death of his brother, Farrukhzad succeeded him as  the ''spahbed'' of Khorasan and Adurbadagan, and as the new leader of the Ispahbudhan family and the ''Pahlav'' faction. He then raised an army at Adurbadagan, and went to Ctesiphon, where he was appointed as its commander by Yazdegerd III, who fled to [[Hulwan]] with his property, family and 1,000 servants. Farrukhzad, however, also fled to Hulwan after a small and disheartening clash with the Arabs.{{sfn|Zarrinkub|1975|p=12}} In 637, Ctesiphon was captured by the Arabs. Meanwhile, Farrukhzad, along with Yazdegerd III, the Mihranid officer [[Mihran Razi]], Piruz Khosrow, and [[Hormuzan]], left Hulwan for Adurbadagan, but while they were moving to the place, they were ambushed by an Arab army at [[battle of Jalula|Jalula]], where they were defeated.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=235, 245}} Mihran Razi was killed during the battle, while Hormuzan had fled to [[Khuzestan]] and Piruz Khosrow to [[Nahavand]]. In 642, the Arabs captured Nahavand and [[Isfahan]], killing Piruz Khosrow including other Sasanian officers such as [[Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih]] and [[Mardanshah]]. During the same year (or in 643), Farrukhzad raised another army with his son [[Isfandyadh]] and the [[Dailamite]] general [[Muta of Dailam|Muta]]. They were, however, [[Battle of Waj Rudh|defeated at Waj Rudh]], a village in [[Hamadan]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=248}} Meanwhile, Yazdegerd III fled to southern Iran and stayed there until 648. It is not known if Farrukhzad was with Yazdegerd III during his stay in southern Iran.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=246}}

===Flight to Khorasan, rule and death===
Around 650, Yazdegerd III, along with Farrukhzad, arrived to Khorasan. Yazdegerd III then appointed Farrukhzad as the governor of [[Merv]] and ordered Baraz, the son of [[Mahoe Suri]], to give absolute control of the city over to him. Mahoe, however, disobeyed him. Farrukhzad then advised Yazdegerd III to take refugee in [[Tabaristan]]. Yazdegerd III, however, did not accept his advice.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=259-260}} Farrukhzad later made a mutiny against Yazdegerd III and left for [[Ray, Iran|Ray]],{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=260-262}} to avenge his father against [[Siyavakhsh]], who was the ruler of the city. On his way to Ray, he met his ally [[Kanadbak]], who was part of the conspiracy against Khosrow II and had taken part in Rostam's clash with the Arabs, but after the defeat had fled to [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], a city which was part of his domains. Farrukhzad then continued his journey to Ray, but before reaching the city met the Arab general Nu'aym near [[Qazvin]] in 651, whom he made peace with.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=251-252}} 
[[File:Map of northern Iran under late Sasanian rule.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of northern [[Iran]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab invasion of Iran]].]]
He then agreed to aid the Arabs against Siyavakhsh. The combined Ispahbudhan-Arab [[Battle of Ray|then engaged in a night battle against Siyavakhsh's army]] at the foot of the mountain just outside Ray. Farrukhzad led some of Nu'aym's cavalry by a little-known way into the city, from where they attacked the Mihranid army's rear, causing great bloodshed. Siyavakhsh's army was in the end defeated and he was himself killed.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1988|pp=514-522}} To set an example, Nu'aym then ordered the destruction of the aristocratic quarter of Ray. However, the town was later rebuilt by Farrukhzad, who became the ruler of Ray.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=251-252}}

Farrukhzad then went to Tabaristan, but at his arrival, he heard about the death of Yazdegerd under the orders of Mahoe Suri, which made him shave his hair and live as a monk in a [[fire temple]] at Kusan.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=293}} When the Arabs invaded Tabaristan, Farrukhzad was requested by the locals to become their king, which he gladly accepted and which marked the foundation of the [[Bavand dynasty]]. He then gathered an army, defeated the Arabs, and made a peace treaty with them.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=293}} Farrukhzad would rule Tabaristan including some parts of [[Abarshahr]] peacefully in 14 years, until he was murdered around 665 by a [[House of Karen|Karenid]] nobleman named [[Valash]], whose family was at war with Farrukhzad's family.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=304–318}}

After Farrukhzad's death, his son [[Surkhab I]] fled to an Ispahbudhan/Bavand stronghold named Kula. Later in 673, Surkhab avenged his father by killing Valash, and then reconquered his fathers realm. He thereafter crowned himself as ''[[ispahbadh]]'' (ruler) of the Bavand dynasty at his capital in [[Farim, Iran|Perim]].

== Origin == 
The origin of women precentors in synagogues is directly related to the adoption of gender-segregated ritual space for rabbinic Jewish practice. Although the first historical evidence of gender-separation appears as early as the eighth century in [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] synagogues, the first direct discussion of gender segregation by rabbis appears in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stiefel|first1=Barry|title=Jews and the Renaissance of Synagogue Architecture, 1450–1730|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781848933637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYhECgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+and+the+Renaissance+of+Synagogue+Architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixpY_wsYrOAhUBxCYKHR4_AmIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=annex&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-fifteenth century, gender-segregation was accepted as commonplace, eliciting little rabbinic discussion. The creation and evolution of space for women in synagogues affected their social position within Jewish communities as well as their contributions to Jewish culture. In the first millennium C.E., both Eastern Christianity and Islam diminished the status and visibility of women in public worship due to changes in social and cultural attitudes concerning female modesty and femininity. Jews residing in these parts of the world (where the majority lived) followed their example. This evolved into a Jewish tradition under the rabbis of the [[Geonim|Geonic era]] (c. 600-1040), spreading on migration and trade routes, as well as through the correspondence of rabbinic [[responsa]] between Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stiefel|first1=Barry|title=Jews and the Renaissance of Synagogue Architecture, 1450–1730|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781848933637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYhECgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+and+the+Renaissance+of+Synagogue+Architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixpY_wsYrOAhUBxCYKHR4_AmIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=annex&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historically recognizable women precentors emerge soon after the ''Weibershul'' annex of the [[Worms Synagogue]] was established, ca. 1215. This annex, unlike a veiled or gated ''[[mechitza|meḥitsa]]'' was a separate structure. (A similar annex was built in the [[Frankfurt]] Synagogue.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norma Baumel Joseph|authorlink1=Meḥitza: Halakhic Decisions and Political Consequences|editor1-last=Grossman|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=Haut|editor2-first=Rivka|title=Daughters of the King: Women and the Synagogue (A Survey of History, Halakhah, and Contemporary Realities)|date=1992|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=9780827604414|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dulcie (wife of Rabbi [[Eliezer of Worms]]) and Urania bat Abraham served as precentors in the Worms ''weibershul''. Richenza is mentioned in the [[Yizkor Books|yizkor book]] of [[Nuremberg]]. Marat Guta bat R. Nathan (d. 1308) was another of the early firzogerin of whom it was written: "she prayed from the women in her lovely prayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zinberg|first1=Israel|title=A History of Jewish Literature: Old Yiddish literature from its origins to the Haskalah period|date=1975|publisher=KTAV|isbn=0870684655|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7auAgLTBgU0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0870684655&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG6vLhqIrOAhXKTSYKHZgsBkgQuwUIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=precentress&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of women precentors continued to develop and spread geographically. Examples are found across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Americas, as well as among Ashkenazim and Sephardim. (''Firzogerin'' and synonymous titles were unique to Ashkenazi communities.) Female precentors appear to have flourished most in Eastern Europe, reaching their apex during the 18th and 19th centuries, just prior to the emergence of Judaism's liberal and egalitarian movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stiefel|first1=Barry|title=Jews and the Renaissance of Synagogue Architecture, 1450–1730|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781848933637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYhECgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+and+the+Renaissance+of+Synagogue+Architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixpY_wsYrOAhUBxCYKHR4_AmIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=annex&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The most famous firzogerin was the [[Chassidic Rebbes|Ḥassidic rebbe]], [[Maiden of Ludmir|Hannah Rochel Verbermacher]] (1815–1888), the only child of a wealthy merchant from [[Ludmir]], [[Volhynia]] where she had her own [[shtiebel]] (called the ''Gornshtibl'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Maiden of Ludmir: A Jewish Holy Woman and Her World |last=Deutsch |first=Nathaniel |authorlink=Nathaniel Deutsch |year=2003 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California |isbn=0-520-23191-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4WylwfJNOoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fanny Neuda]] (1819-1894), probably composed and collected the [[tkhines]] she later published in her bestelling ''Stunden der Andacht'' (1855), while serving as the firzogerin of the synagogue of her husband, Rabbi [[Abraham Neuda]] in [[Loštice]]. Earlier examples of firzogerin include Rebbetsin Serril Rappaport of [[Oleksiniec]] (daughter of the [[Dubner Maggid]], ca. late 18th c.), Rachel Mendes Meza (18th century) of [[Jodensavanne]], Leah Dreyzl (early 18th century, wife of R' Aryeh Leib Auerbach) of Stanislov, Toybe [Pan] (17th century, wife of Yankev Pan) of [[Prague]], Deborah Ascarelli (sixteenth century) of [[Rome]], and Rebecca Tiktiner (d. 1550, daughter of Rabbi Meir Tiktiner) of Prague. Though specific names have not yet been identified, instances of Jewish women precentors also occurred in 17th century Ottoman [[Constantinople]] and [[Salonika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stiefel|first1=Barry|title=Jews and the Renaissance of Synagogue Architecture, 1450–1730|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781848933637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYhECgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+and+the+Renaissance+of+Synagogue+Architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixpY_wsYrOAhUBxCYKHR4_AmIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=annex&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[M. S. Subbulakshmi]] had previously visited Gandhi in Delhi, and sung [[Ram Dhun]]. Gandhi expressed the wish to hear Subbulakshmi sing the song. Subbulakshmi answered that she wasn't familiar with the song, and suggested that a noted singer should sing the bhajan. In turn, Gandhi replied that "he would rather hear her speak the words than hear someone else sing it".  Feeling obliged, Subbulakshmi worked with her friends who knew the tune and lyrics, and when she got them right. The song was recorded at [[All India Radio]] (AIR) studios in Chennai, the night of October the 1st, finishing at 2 A.M. of October the 2nd. The following morning the recording was airlifted to Delhi, where it was played to Gandhi in the evening of his 78th birthday, October 2, 1947.&lt;ref name="Murthi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahuja2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Subbulakshmi, M.

A few months later, on 30 January, 1948, when AIR announced Gandhi's assassination, it was followed by playing of Subbulakshmi's recording of Hari Tuma Haro repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Murthi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murthi|first=R.K.|title=Encyclopedia of Bharat Ratnas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkF3avvFvb4C&amp;pg=PA179|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=978-81-209-1307-3|pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahuja2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahuja|first=M.

"'''I Don't Wanna Stop'''" is a Grammy nominated single from heavy metal singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s 10th studio album, ''[[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]]''. The song was first announced and released through Osbourne's website.

==Background==
"I Don't Wanna Stop" was named the official theme song to the [[WWE]] PPV [[Judgment Day (2007)|Judgment Day]]. A week prior to the event, Osbourne performed the song on the May 18, 2007 edition of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown]]'' that was taped at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on May 15. The episode aired outside the US on [[Sky Sports]] in the UK, [[FOX8]] in Australia, and [[The Score Television Network|The Score]] in Canada also on May 18. 

The song is also the theme song of professional wrestler [[Brent Albright]]. The song was also played on BBC 1 on May 25 on [[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/exclusives/ozzyosbourne Judgement Day - Ozzy Osbourne]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also performed at the 2nd annual ''[[VH1 Rock Honors]]'' award show, followed by "[[Crazy Train]]" and "[[Bark at the Moon (song)|Bark at the Moon]]".

The song was included in the in-game soundtrack to ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'', which was released in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.ign.com/articles/790/790648p1.html IGN - Ozzy Osbourne Loves Madden '08]&lt;/ref&gt;  The song is also featured in the 5th and final tier of ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'', notable for its unusually difficult solo section, and was released as [[Complete list of downloadable songs for the Rock Band series|downloadable content]] for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' video game series on June 15, 2010.

Osbourne performed this song, along with "[[Crazy Train]]" and "[[Not Going Away]]" on comedian Jimmy Kimmel's self named show, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.

It is the first song by [[Ozzy Osbourne|Osbourne]] to ever reach #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, making it the longest career run in rock history for an artist before reaching number one at 37 years, 4 months.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  He is also the oldest solo artist to reach number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, at 58 years, 8 months.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The song was nominated for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Foo Fighters]]' "[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]".

Statistics for '''Islam in the Dominican Republic''' estimate that 0.03 percent of the population (3,000 individuals) are [[Muslim]], but accurate statistics of religious affiliation are difficult to calculate and there is a wide variation concerning the actual numerical amount. Although the majority of the population is [[Roman Catholic]], Muslims have formed local organizations such as the ''Círculo Islámico de República Dominicana'' (The Islamic Circle of Dominican Republic) and the Islamic Center of the Dominican Republic (located in [[Miami]]). Currently, the Círculo Islámico estimates that Muslims number over 3,000 (most recent statistics), including of a good number of local converts. Most recently, there has been another organization, led by native born Muslim converts, the ''Entidad Islámica Dominicana or EID'' (Dominican Islamic Entity).{{cn|date=November 2013}}

The Círculo Islámico established the first [[mosque]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] in the center of [[Santo Domingo]], about a five-minute walk from the Palacio de Policía Nacional and the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] (UNIBE) where Muslims from around the city would have easy access to reach it. They made an agreement with the owner to purchase the land and the building for an amount of 2.85 million [[Dominican peso|pesos]]. The mosque is open daily for the five prayers ([[salat]]) and offers classes on Islamic studies for ladies and children on weekends. They also provide free medical consultation along with a free pharmacy, Consulta Al-Foutory, which is located in a separate building at the back of the mosque. Masjid al Noor is largely believed to be the only active mosque in the country and receives the bulk of the Muslim population for the two Eids, Ramadan, Salat al Jummah, and the five daily prayers. However, there is another mosque in Los Llanos neighborhood of San Pedro de Macorix, Dominican Republic. This mosque is led by a converted Dominican [[Imam]]. Los Llanos is roughly a 30 minutes drive from Masjid al Noor. The Musalla Al-Hidayya provides Jummah services in the city of [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], and the Musalah Al-Nabawi( address: Av. Espana Plaza Estrella No. 411, Bavaro Punta Cana )  serves local and visiting Muslims in the tourist sector of [[Bávaro-Punta Cana]] in the East of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Latin American Dawah Organization, Muslim Organizations in Latin America, Online http://www.latinodawah.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Domrepmap.png|thumb|left|Map of the Dominican Republic]]

===Slavery===
Like other countries in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], the history of Islam in the Dominican Republic began with the importation of African slaves, which first arrived to the island of [[Hispaniola]] (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), beginning in 1502. These people arrived with a rich and ancient culture, although brutal repression and forced conversions gradually diluted their original cultural identity and religions. The first recorded instances of resistance were in 1503, when [[Nicolás de Ovando]], Hispaniola’s first royal governor, wrote to [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] requesting that she prevent further shipments to the colony of enslaved [[Black ladinos]], or persons possessing knowledge of Spanish or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] languages and cultures, but who also often had connections to either Senegambia, Islam, or both. De Ovando had arrived earlier in April 1502 and was already complaining that the ''ladinos'' on the island were “a source of scandal to the Indians, and some had fled their owners,” establishing [[maroon (people)|maroon]] communities in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Gomez, ''Black Crescent: The Experience and Legacy of African Muslims in the Americas'', [[New York University]] Press, {{ISBN|0-521-60079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==

Muslim population in the nation was increased by [[Middle East]]ern settlers, mostly [[Arab]]s of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Syria]]n, [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] and by [[Pakistan]]is and other people from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

Brands of [[Sufism|Tasawwuf]] are becoming more and more manifested in the country from native born Dominican Muslims and foreign Muslims who are [[murid]]s of the [[Shadhili]], [[Qadiri]], and [[Ba 'Alawiyya|Ba'Alawi]] [[Tariqa]]s. The actual figures of the Muslim population growth has not been officially censused, though some sources give a number of 5,000 to 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;The website of EID http://entidadislamicadominicana.webs.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072345/http://entidadislamicadominicana.webs.com/ |date=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The website of the Al Zawiya Alawiya Husayni Ninowiya http://www.wix.com/eidpersonal/alawihusaynininowidominicana&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77499">[[File:Trumpeldor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Abraham Melnikov]]&lt;br&gt;The Roaring Lion, 1926–1934&lt;br&gt;Stone&lt;br&gt;[[Tel Hai]]]]
'''Israeli sculpture''' designates [[sculpture]] produced in the [[Land of Israel]] from 1906, the year the "[[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts]]" (today called the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design) was established. The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]].

Efforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of "[[Canaanism|Caananite]]" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from [[Mesopotamia]]. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the "New Horizons" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier "Caananite" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international [[conceptual art]]. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.

==History==
[[File:Bezalel Sculpture Class, 1914.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bezalel sculpture class, 1914]]
An attempt to find indigenous 19th-century Israeli sources for the development of "Israeli" sculpture is problematic from two points of view.  First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future.  This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period.  Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period.  In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs.  These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.&lt;ref&gt;See, Yona Fischer  (Ed.),  Art and Art in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1979).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Sources of Israeli Sculpture"&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, Sources of the Land of Israel Sculpture, 1906-1939 (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum, 1990).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gideon Ofrat]] identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time, he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.

At the same time, even at the Bezalel – a school of art founded by a sculptor – sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design.  Even in the "New Bezalel", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery&lt;ref&gt;See, Gideon Efrat, The New Bezalel, 1935-1955 (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, 1987)  pp. 128-130.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.

===Early sculpture in the Land of Israel===

The beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by [[Boris Schatz]]. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with [[Mark Antokolski]], was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem.  He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style.

Schatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work "Matthew the Hasmoneum" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero [[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Johanan]] grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of "The Victory of Good Over Evil", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) pp. 53–55. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and [[Renaissance art]] on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include "[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]" (1473–1475) and "Putto with a Dolphin" (1470) by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref&gt;] See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) p. 51. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in [[woodcarving]], in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for [[ivory]] design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) pp. 55–68.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the "Jewish Legion" and the workshop on woodcarving.&lt;ref&gt;] Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) p.98.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 [[Ze'ev Raban]] immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic "Oriental" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures "Eli and Samuel" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews.  However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.&lt;ref&gt;About the jewelry design of Raban, see Yael Gilat, “The Ben Shemen Jewelers’ Community, Pioneer in the Work-at-Home Industry: From the Resurrection of the Spirit of the Botega to the Resurrection of the Guilds,” in Art and Crafts, Linkages, and Borders, edited by Nurit Canaan Kedar, (Tel Aviv: The Yolanda and David Katz Art Faculty, Tel Aviv University, 2003), 127–144. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. [[Eliezer Strich]], for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, [[Yitzhak Sirkin]] carved portraits in wood and in stone.

The main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the "[[Jewish Legion]]". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in [[terracotta]] and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as "The Awakening Judah" (1925), or memorial monuments to [[Ahad Ha'am]] (1928) and to [[Max Nordau]] (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the [[Tower of David]].

The "Roaring Lion" monument (1928–1932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period.  Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and [[Alfred Mond]] (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental [[lion]], sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gamzo compared the sculpture to the image of the Assyrian lion from Khorsabad, found in the collection of the Louvre.  See Haim Gamzo, The Art of Sculpture in Israel (Tel Aviv: Mikhlol Publishing House Ltd., 1946) (without page numbers). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.

The sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form.

Among the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of [[Aaron Priver]] stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, [[Nachum Gutman]], better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to [[Vienna]] in 1920, and later went to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a "primitive" style in the depiction of its subjects.

The works of [[David Ozeransky]] (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of [[Ze'ev Raban]].  Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is "Ten Tribes" (1932) – a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was "The Lion" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;see: Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid’s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]    &lt;http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was never a student at the institution, the work of [[David Polus]] was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of "David the Shepherd" (1936–1938) in [[Ramat David]]. In his monumental work 1940 "[[Alexander Zeid|Alexander Zeid Memorial]]", which was cast in concrete at "Sheik Abreik" and stands near the [[Beit She'arim]] National Park, Polus represents the man known as "The Watchman"  as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic-symbolic style, whose subjects were "the thicket" and "the shepherd."&lt;ref&gt;Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid’s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  While the style of the main statue  is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land.

In 1910 the sculptress [[Chana Orloff]] emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the [[École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs]]. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society.&lt;ref&gt;See Haim Gamzo, Chana Orloff (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1968). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.&lt;ref&gt;] Her museum exhibitions during those years took place in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1935, and in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Haifa Museum of Art in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi.  In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris.  Upon his return, he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the "New Bezalel."  In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum.  His sculpture "The Pioneer" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934.  In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gamzo, The Sculptor Ben-Zvi (Tel Aviv: HaZvi Publications, 1955). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Raphael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied sculpture in France.

One of this group of artists – Batya Lishanski – studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was "Labor and Defense" (1929),  which was built over the grave of [[Ephraim Chisik]] - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz [[Hulda, Israel|Hulda]]) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland.

The influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna.  Artists such as [[Jacob Brandenburg]], [[Trude Chaim]], and [[Lili Gompretz-Beatus]], and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate  expressionism.  Among the artists of that group [[Rudi Lehmann|Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann]], who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out.  Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created  showed the influence of expressionism  in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists.

===Caananite to abstract, 1939–1967===

At the end of the 1930s, a group called "[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]" – a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature – was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]], who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in [[England]]. The new nationalism that Danziger's "Caananite" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. "The dream of Danziger's generation", [[Amos Keinan]] wrote after Danziger's death, was "to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.&lt;ref&gt;Amos Kenan, “Greater Israel,” Yedioth Ahronoth, 19 August 1977. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period.

In Tel Aviv Danziger  founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yehiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;] The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), p. 134. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields.  In this studio Danziger created his first significant works – "Nimrod" (1939) and "Shebaziya" (1939).

From the moment it was first displayed, the statue "Nimrod" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of [[Nimrod]], the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword to pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of [[homoerotic]] beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper "HaBoker" declaring that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation...Nimrod will be forever young."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Sara Breitberg Semel, “Agripas vs. Nimrod,” Kav, No. 9 (1999). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first showing of the sculpture in the "General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel", in [[Habima Theatre]] in May, 1942&lt;ref&gt;] This exhibition is dated according to Gamzo’s critique, which was published on May 2, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; engendered the persistent argument over the "Caananite"  movement. Because of the exhibition, [[Yonatan Ratosh]], founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him.  The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Caananites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything "Jewish". To a large extent, "Nimrod" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before.

In spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Caananite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the "primitive" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the "New Horizons" group, most of whose members experimented with the Caananite style early in their artistic careers.

==="New Horizons" group===

In 1948, a movement called "[[New Horizons]]" ("Ofakim Hadasim") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Moshe Sternschuss]], and [[Dov Feigin]] were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially [[Joseph Zaritsky]]. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not "pure" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism.  Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative  elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of "the victory of abstraction"&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted.  But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;On the subject of kibbutz pressure, see Gila Blass, New Horizons (Tel Aviv: Papyrus and Reshefim Publishers, 1980), pp. 59–60. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of "New Horizons" and the art of the "Caananites."&lt;ref&gt;See Gideon Ophrat, “The Secret Canaanism in ‘New Horizons’,” Art Visits [Bikurei omanut], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the "international" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in [[Mitzpe Ramon]]. This event  served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. [[Yona Fisher]] speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the "magic of the desert" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of "Culture" rather than "Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;] Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now  (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), pp. 30–31.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape.  The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], and [[Alexander Calder]]. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See: L. Orgad, Dov Feigin (Tel Aviv: The Kibbutz  HaMeuhad [The United Kibbutz], 1988), pp. 17–19. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; His works from this year onward, such as "Bird" and "Flight" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of [[Pablo]] Picasso done using a similar technique.

In contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris.  In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design.  Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was "Dance" (1944),  which was displayed in an exhibition next to "Nimrod" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Hadar, Moses Sternschuss  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined "New Horizons" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as "Horns of Hattin" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as "Ein Gedi" (1950s), "Sheep of the Negev" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;] A similar analysis of the narrative of Israeli sculpture appears in Gideon Ophrat’s article, “The Secret Canaanism” in ‘New Horizons’,” Studio, No. 2 (August, 1989). [In Hebrew]  The article appears also in his book, With Their Backs to the Sea: Images of Place in Israeli Art and Literature, Israeli Art (Israeli Art Publishing House, 1990), pp. 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yechiel Shemi]], also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26  In works such as "Mythos"  (1956) Shemi's connection with the "Caananite" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work.

Israeli-born [[Ruth Tzarfati]] studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the "New Horizons" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group.  This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture "She Sits" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, "Baby Girl" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses.

===Sculpture of protest===
[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|right|250px|He Walked through the Fields (1967) by Yigal Tumarkin]]
In the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, [[pop art]] and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 76.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who returned to Israel in 1961, at  the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;Igael Tumarkin, “Danziger in the Eyes of Igael Tumarkin,” Studio, No. 76 (October–November 1996), pp. 21–23. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons.  His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), p. 28.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "[[Land art]]," such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth.  In this way, Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

After the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin.  At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal.  The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists.  The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life.  The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.

===Landscape sculpture in conceptual art===

Another aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by [[Land Art]] and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the "Israeli" landscape and the "Eastern" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Canaanite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of "New Horizons", in the various relationships with the landscape.

One of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerry Marx]] on "Jerusalem River Project".  For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of [[Abu Tor]] and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the [[Kidron Valley]]. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter  14).&lt;ref&gt;Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 32–36.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project "Hanging Nature", in a collaborative project in The [[Israel Museum]]. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as "art" and as "nature" simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer , in: Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. (The article is untitled and preceded by the following quotation: “Art precedes science.”  The pages in the book are unnumbered).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of [[Mount Carmel]]. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, [[Zeev Naveh]] the ecologist, and [[Joseph Morin (researcher)|Joseph Morin]] the soil researcher.  In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry.  "Nature should not be returned to its natural state," Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept."&lt;ref&gt;From "Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry, Israel Museum, 1972, " in: Yona Fischer, in Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.

In 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work.  Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, ''Makom'' (in [[Hebrew]] - ''place''), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design,  sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as "sculpture" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc.  One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat  [could not confirm English spelling-sl ] at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan.

In 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the [[Golan Heights]] for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit.  Danziger, who was serving as a judge in "the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit," suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. ”We felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close."&lt;ref&gt;Itzhak Danziger, The Project for the Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers of the Egoz Commando Unit.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel,  sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, "on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks [...]  People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish."&lt;ref&gt;] Amnon Barzel, “Landscape as an Artistic Creation” (Interview with Itzhak Danziger), Haaretz (July 27, 1977). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer"  in the area between [[Kibbutz]] [[Metzer]] and the Arab village [[Meiser]] in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. [[Moshe Gershuni]] called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ginton Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 88–89.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks," in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods.  Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture.   In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars" for these lands.&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Zalmona, Onward: The East in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1998), pp. 82–83.  For documentation of much of Danziger’s sculptural activity, see Igael Tumarkin, Trees, Stones, and Fabrics in the Wind (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1981. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians," presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman.  The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism.  Of the three of them, Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images.  In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures.  In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert.   In another work Ofek screened the words "America," "Africa," and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;] See: The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), pp. 238–240.

===Abstract sculpture===

[[File:Dead Sea Sculpture1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dead Sea Sculpture (1986) by [[Buky Schwartz]]]]
At the beginning of the 1960s [[Menashe Kadishman]] arrived on the scene of abstract sculpture while he was studying in [[London]]. The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature.&lt;ref&gt;] Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), pp. 43-48. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these works, such as "Suspense" (1966), or "Uprise" (1967–1976), developed into pure geometric figures.

At the end of this decade, in works such as "Aqueduct" (1968–1970) or "Segments" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture.  With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of "Land Art."  One of his main projects was carried out in 1972.  In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum. The work became known as a "monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), p. 127. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of [[Michael Gross (artist)|Michael Gross]] created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of [[Yaacov Agam]] contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create [[kinetic art]]. Works of his such as "18 Degrees" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.

Symbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of [[Dani Karavan]]. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from "[[Monument to the Negev Brigade]]" (1963-1968) to "White Square" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ruti Director, “When Politics Becomes Kitsch,” Studio, no. 92 (April 1998), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist aesthetic.  These structures, like the work "Third Watch" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.&lt;ref&gt;See: Amnon Barzel, Israel: The 1980 Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1980). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buky Schwartz]] absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in [[New York City]]. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the [[video art]] film "Video Structures" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body – A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 48, pp. 70–71. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In sculptures such as "Levitation" (1976) or "Reflection Triangle" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.

===Representative sculpture of the 1970s===

[[Performance art]] began to develop in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the "[[Ten Plus]]" group, led by [[Raffi Lavie]] and the "[[Third Eye (performance artists)|Third Eye]]" group, under the leadership of [[Jacques Cathmore]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006) pp. 35–36. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them.  In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues.

[[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] during those years created a number of displays of a political nature.  In his work "Touching the Border" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time, Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland."&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 142–151.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist, [[Efrat Natan]], created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture," in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T," bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision."&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 43. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975–1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904–1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Segoli, “My Red is Your Dear Blood,” Studio, No. 76 (October–November 1996), pp. 38–39. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exposure (Installation view), 1975 by [[Gideon Gechtman]]]]
The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, “The Heart of the Matter,” Gideon Gechtman: Works 1971-1986, Autumn 1986, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.

Another major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled "Open Workshop" (1975) at the [[Israel Museum]]. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical "activity" known as "Jewish Work" and, within this framework," Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space.  on the construction site.  Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name "Jewish Work" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site.  In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.

==1980s and 1990s==
In the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of "simulacra", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.

Gideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real objects (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art.&lt;ref&gt;See: Neta Gal-Atzmon, “Cycles of Original and Imitation: Works 1973-2003,” in Gideon Gechtman, Hedva, Gideon, and All the Rest (Tel Aviv: Association of Painters and Sculptors) (Unnumbered looseleaf folder).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials.  Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements.  Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature.

[[File:Nahum Tevet, Painting Lesson, no 5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nahum Tevet]]&lt;br&gt;Painting Lesson, no 5, 1986&lt;br&gt;Acrylic and industrial paint on wood; found object&lt;br&gt;[[Israel Museum]] collection]]
During the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the "Arte Povera" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is [[Nahum Tevet]], who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning of the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as "a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content [...] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Sarit Shapira, One Thing at a Time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2007), p. 21. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of sculptors who called themselves "Drawing Lessons,"  from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as "Ursa Major (with eclipse)" (1984) and "Jemmain" (1986)  created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which "demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world."&lt;ref&gt;See: Nahum Tevet in the “Check-Post” exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures of [[Drora Domini]] as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection.  Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture.  The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them.  Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the "ars poetica" style.&lt;ref&gt;See: Drora Dumani in the “Check-Post” exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist who created wooden structures  was the sculptor [[Isaac Golombek]]. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted.  The items he produced had structures one on top of another. [[Itamar Levy]], in his article "High Low Profile" [Rosh katan godol],&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, “High Low Profile,” Studio: Journal of Art, No. 111 (February 2000), pp. 38-45.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items.

A different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the [[Zik Group]], which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around them, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;The Zik Group: Twenty Years of Work, edited by Daphna Ben-Shaul (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 2005).

Another effect of the postmodern approach was the protest against historical and cultural narratives. Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality.  In the era following the "political revolution"  which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the "identity discussion," in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included.

In the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the [[Holocaust]] began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the "second generation" there began to appear figures taken from [[World War II]], combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew.  Among the pioneering works were [[Moshe Gershuni]]'s installation "Red Sealing/Theatre" (1980) and the works of [[Haim Maor]]. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by [[Igael Tumarkin]], who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist [[Penny Yassour]], for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work "Screens" (1996), which was displayed at the "Documenta" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.&lt;ref&gt;] See: Galia Bar Or, “Parodoxical Space,” Studio, No. 109 (November–December 1999), pp. 45–53. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The other materials Yassour used – metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces – produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror.

Another aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State.  These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli "[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor [[Philip Rentzer]] presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel.  His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation "The Box from Nes Ziona" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.&lt;ref&gt;See: “Immigrant With a Compulsion,” Ynet  website: http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3476177,00.html   [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as [[Arie Aroch]], [[Moshe Castel]], and [[Mordechai Ardon]], the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, [[Belu Simion Fainaru]] used Hebrew letters  and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work "Sham" ("There" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] (ש). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, [[Aleph]] (א) to [[Zayin]] (ז) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;David Schwarber, Ifcha Mistabra: The Culture of the Temple and Contemporary Israeli Art (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University), pp. 46–47.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of [[Gender]] and sexual motifs.  [[Sigal Primor]] exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture.  In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the "bride", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, "The Glass Door". In her work "The Bride", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire.

In her installation "Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)" (1997), [[Tamar Raban]] turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi  Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates.&lt;ref&gt;For documentation on the installation, see: “Dinner Dress” and the associated video on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways.  During the performance, Raban would tell stories about "Dora," Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure "Dora" – a nickname for [[Ida Bauer]], one of the historic patients of [[Sigmund Freud]]. In the corner of the room was the artist [[Pnina Reichman]], embroidering words and letters in English, such as "all those lost words" and "contaminated memory," and counting in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Levia Stern, “Conversations About Dora,” Studio: Journal of Art, No. 91 (March 1998), pp. 34–37. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of [[Hila Lulu Lin]], the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work "No More Tears" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of [[Nir Nader]] and [[Erez Harodi]], and the performance artist [[Dan Zakheim]] stand out.

As the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the "total visual experience,"&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Mendelson, “The Opening and Closing Spectacles: Rumblings About Art in Israel,1998-2007,” Real-time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2008).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists.  The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found [[Ohad Meromi]] and [[Michal Rovner]], who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of [[Uri Tzaig]] the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In "Universal Square" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two football teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field.

Another well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is [[Sigalit Landau]]. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as "The Country" (2002) or "Endless Solution" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population.

In Israel there are many memorial sculptures whose purpose is to perpetuate the memory of various events in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period.  The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was “[[The Roaring Lion]]”, which [[Abraham Melnikoff]] sculpted in [[Tel Hai]]. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the “Caananite” movement in art.

The memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, “The Dialectic of the 1950s: Hegemony and Multiciplicity,”  in: Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 18. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure of the memorials was designed as spatial theater.  The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions.  A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.&lt;ref&gt;See: Avner  Ben-Amos, “The Theater of Memory and Death: Memorials and Ceremonies in Israel,” in Drora Dumani, Everywhere: Israeli Landscape with Memorial  (Tel Aviv: Hargol, 2002).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz [[Yad Mordechai]] (1951) or Kibbutz [[Negba]] (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression.  Within the framework of [[HaKibbutz Ha’Artzi]] intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture “Mother and Child”, which [[Chana Orloff]] erected at Kibbutz [[Ein Gev]] (1954) or [[Yechiel Shemi|Yechiel Shemi's]] sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954).  These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar Or, “Universal and International: The Art of the Kibbutz in the First Decade,” in Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 88. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was [[Nathan Rapoport]], who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946–1948).  Rapoport’s many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled “The Last March”, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a “Zionist narrative” of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning.

In contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the “Pilots’ Memorial" (1950s), erected by [[Benjamin Tammuz]] and [[Aba Elhanani]] in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by [[David Palombo]], who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] that [[Itzhak Danziger]] erected in [[Rosh Pina]]. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the “Monument to the Negev Brigade” (1963–1968) which [[Dani Karavan]] created on the outskirts of the city of [[Beersheva]]. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the “Monument to the Holocaust and National Revival”, erected in Tel Aviv’s [[Rabin Square]] (then “Kings of Israel Square”). [[Igael Tumarkin]], creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space,&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Tumarkin, "Monument to the Holocaust and Revival", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)&lt;/ref&gt; the monument didn’t express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the “Land of Israel”. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the “Mark of Cain”. The two structures together form a [[Magen David]].  Tumarkin saw in this form “a prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.”&lt;ref&gt;] Yigal Tumarkin, "Monument to the Holocaust and Revival", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him, Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: “What have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...]  Do works of forced labor and death liberate?”&lt;ref&gt;Michal K. Marcus, In the Spacious Time of Yigal Tumarkin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the “Children’s Memorial” (1987), or the “Yad Vashem Train Car” (1990) by [[Moshe Safdie]], or in the Memorial to the victims of “The Israeli Helicopter Disaster” (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer.

==Characteristics==

Attitudes toward the realistic depiction of the human body are complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant.  With the appearance of “Canaanite” art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of “The Land of Israel.” That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s.  With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the “New Horizons” group. In addition, this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.

[[File:Parsi-jashan-ceremony-1.jpg|thumb|[[Zoroastrians]] Spiritual Ceremoney]]

'''Kātouzian''' in [[Zoroastrianism]] refers to the priests at the time of [[Jamshid]] who conducted the worship of [[Hormozd]]. They used to dwell in mountains and caves, praying and looking for wisdom.
The word '''Kātouzian''' ({{lang-fa|کاتوزیان}}) itself is a plural form of the word '''Kātouzi''' ({{lang-fa|کاتوزی}}).

According to [[Shahnameh]], Jamshid had divided the people into four groups:
* '''Kātouzians'''
* Neysārians: The warriors who protected the people by the might of their arms
* Nāsoudians: The farmers who grew the grain that fed the people
* Hotokhoshians: The artisans, who produced goods for the ease and enjoyment of the people

In Shahnameh, [[Ferdowsi]] says: &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page06.htm] [https://archive.org/details/shahnama01firduoft], Shahnameh Translated by Warner &amp; Warner, Part Jamshid, Page 132.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Then to the joy of all he founded castes&lt;br/&gt;
For every craft; it took him fifty years.&lt;br/&gt;
Distinguishing one caste as sacerdotal&lt;br/&gt;
To be employed in sacred offices,&lt;br/&gt;
He separated it from other folk&lt;br/&gt;
And made its place of service on the mountains&lt;br/&gt;
That God might be adored in quietude.

'''Livnot U'Lehibanot''' is an unaffiliated, educational and volunteer organization established in 1980, with a campus in  [[Safed]], [[Israel]]. 

The name Livnot U'Lehibanot, which in Hebrew means "To Build and To Be Built", refers to the physical contribution the participants make to the building of the Land of Israel, and to the knowledge and experiences gained during the programs it offers.&lt;ref&gt;Sirena Rubinoff. ''NY Blueprint'' (April 29, 2007). [http://nyblueprint.com//Articles/view.aspx?id=286 'My Galilee Fellowship Experience: Building and Being Built in Israel'].&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers at Livnot, as it is often referred to, were responsible for many [[Western Wall]] tunnel excavations, aiding in the absorption of Ethiopian immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;Batsheva Pomerantz. ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' (July 27, 2006). [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1153292010880 'Making a meaningful connection'].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as helping to repair damage caused to the cities of Safed, Kiryat Shemona, Karmiel and Hazor in the North of Israel by [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] fire during  the [[Second Lebanon War]] in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Gabi Nachmani. ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' (August 6, 2006). [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1154525812554&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Don't put socks in the packages...one of the soldiers lost a leg'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170905/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1154525812554&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-08-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Program participants are mostly North American Jews between the ages of 21 and 35 who come on programs of various lengths with an emphasis on hiking, volunteering, and learning. While much of the learning is spiritual in nature, Livnot is non-denominational in its practice of [[Judaism]]. Livnot also runs one-week and one-month [[Taglit-Birthright Israel]] extension trips.

==Educational philosophy==

Livnot is a non-denominational, unaffiliated, educational non-profit with programs open to Jews over the age of 21 who have little or no formal Jewish background. Livnot programs typically combine community service projects and hiking with educational seminars on various Jewish topics. All the educational components of the Livnot program are forum-based and encourage questions and dialog. The community service, hiking and non-coercive spirituality components are an integral part of the program's educational mission.

==Other Livnot programs==
Livnot U'Lehibanot offers wide variety of 1-week to long-term programs of discovery and exploration. The programs all include volunteering, hiking, community service, connections with local residents and a variety of seminars and workshops. Participants live in [[Safed#External links|Tzfat/Safed]], a small rural northern Israeli community known as the City of Kabbalah.

'''Lu Xiong''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 鲁雄; [[Pinyin]]: Lǔ Xióng) is a minor character featured within the classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. 

Lu Xiong was a renowned commanding general who served under the [[Shang Dynasty]] for many years. At the time of the [[Su Hu]] arc, Lu would inform the king that it would not be best to send [[Chong Houhu]] as the coalition leader, for many lives will be taken away in an unnecessary fashion. Thus, Lu Xiong would tell the king to give the Imperial Battle Axe to [[Ji Chang]]. 

During the Queen Jiang arc, Lu would be chosen as the head guard of the Nine Dragon Bridge while [[King Zhou]] headed out to the Demarcation Building. During the time of [[Jiang Huan]]'s personal attack upon the king, Lu would not seem to remember anything of such the following day.

Lu Xiong was appointed as the deity of Shuide Star (水德星) in the end.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' Chapter 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie-Joseph Blaise de Chénier''' (11 February 1764 – 10 January 1811) was a French poet, [[dramatist]] and [[politician]] of [[French people|French]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] origin.

==Biography==
The younger brother of [[André Chénier]], Joseph Chénier was born at [[Constantinople]], but brought up at [[Carcassonne]]. He was educated in Paris at the [[Collège de Navarre]]. Entering the army at seventeen, he left it two years afterwards; and at nineteen he produced ''Azémire'', a two-act drama (acted in 1786), and ''Edgar, ou le page supposé'', a [[comedy]] (acted in 1785), which both failed. His ''Charles IX'' was kept back for nearly two years by the censor. Chénier attacked the [[censorship]] in three pamphlets, and the commotion aroused by the controversy raised keen interest in the piece. When it was at last produced on 4 November 1789 it was an immense success, due in part to its political suggestion, and in part to [[François Joseph Talma]]'s magnificent portrayal of King [[Charles IX of France]].

[[Camille Desmoulins]] said that the piece had done more for the [[French Revolution]] than the days of October, and a contemporary memoir-writer, the marquis de Ferrire, says that the audience came away ''ivre de vengeance et du tourment d'un soir de sang'' ("drunk with the vengeance and torment of an evening of blood"). The performance was the occasion of a split among the actors of the [[Comédie-Française]], and the new theatre in the [[Palais Royal]], established by the dissidents, was inaugurated with ''[[Henry VIII of England|Henri VIII]]'' (1791), generally recognized as Chénier's masterpiece; ''[[Jean Calas]], ou l'école des juges'' ("Jean Calas, or the judges' school") followed in the same year.

In 1792 he produced his ''Caïus Gracchus'', which was even more revolutionary in tone than its predecessors. It was nevertheless proscribed in the next year at the instance of the Montagnard deputy Albitte, for the anti-anarchical [[hemistich]] ''Des lois et non du sang'' ("Laws, and not blood"); ''Fénelon'' (1793) was suspended after a few representations; and in 1794 ''Timoléon'', set to [[Etienne Méhul]]'s music, was also proscribed. This piece was played after the [[Reign of Terror]], but the [[fratricide]] of ''Timoléon'' became the text for insinuations to the effect that by his silence Joseph Chénier had connived at the judicial murder of his brother, André, whom Joseph's enemies alluded to as Abel.

In fact, after some fruitless attempts to save his brother, variously related by his biographers, Joseph became aware that André's only chance of safety lay in being forgotten by the authorities, and that ill-advised intervention would only hasten the end. Joseph Chénier had been a member of the [[National Convention]] and had voted for the death of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]; he belonged to the committees of general security, and of [[Committee of Public Safety|public safety]]. He was, nevertheless, suspected of moderate sentiments, and before the end of the Terror had become a marked man.

He had a seat in the [[Council of Five Hundred]], and the  [[tribunat]]. In 1801 he was one of the educational jury for the [[Seine (département)|Seine]] ''[[département in France|département]]''. His political career ended in 1802, when he was eliminated with others from the tribunate for his opposition to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. From 1803 to 1806 he was inspector-general of public instruction. He had allowed himself to be reconciled with Napoleon's government, and ''Cyrus'', represented in 1804, was written in his honour, but he was temporarily disgraced in 1806 for his ''Épître à [[Voltaire]]''. In 1806 and 1807 he delivered a course of lectures at the Athéne on the language and literature of France from the earliest years; and in 1808 at the emperor's request, he prepared his ''Tableau historique de l'état et du progrés de la littérature française depuis 1789 jusqu'à 1808'' ("Historical view of the state and progress of French literature from 1789 to 1808"), a book containing some good criticism, though marred by the violent prejudices of its author.

The list of his works includes [[hymn]]s and national songs among others, the famous ''[[Chant du départ]]''; odes, ''Sur la mort de Mirabeau'', ''Sur l'oligarchie de Robespierre'', etc.; tragedies which never reached the stage, ''Brutus et Cassius'', ''Philippe deux'', ''Tibre''; translations from [[Sophocles]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], from [[Thomas Gray]] and [[Horace]], from [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] and [[Aristotle]]; with elegies, dithyrambics and [[Ossian]]ic rhapsodies. As a satirist he possessed great merit, though he sins from an excess of severity, and is sometimes malignant and unjust. He is the chief tragic poet of the revolutionary period, and as [[Camille Desmoulins]] expressed it, he decorated [[Melpomene]] with the tricolour cockade.

'''Meicuchuca''' (died 1470) was the first ruler (''[[zipa]]'') of [[Bogotá|Bacatá]], currently known as the [[Colombia]]n capital Bogotá, as of around 1450. His ''[[zaque]]'' counterpart ruling over the northern area of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] territory was [[Hunzahúa]].

== Biography ==
Little is known about Meicuchuca and many stories about his reign are more mythical than historical. He ruled the southern Muisca territory from around 1450 to 1470 and was succeeded according to Muisca heritage laws by his nephew [[Saguamanchica]].

=== Meicuchuca and the snake ===
The legend of Meicuchuca and the snake tells the story of the ''zipa'' who already had many wives. [[Women in Muisca society|Polygamy]] was common practice with the Muisca and the higher the rank, the more wives could be held. The highest position of ''zipa'' could allow to have and sustain 300 wives, while the lower rank ''cacique'' "only" made 100 wives possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/chibch/chibch8b.htm Polygamy in Muisca culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223017/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/chibch/chibch8b.htm |date=2015-09-23 }} - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meicuchuca allegedly fell in love with a woman outside of the Muisca community. He only had eye for her and spent day and night with the beautiful stranger, forgetting all his other wives.

His primary wife ([[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]: ''gui chyty'')&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/chyty Muisca dictionary: ''chyty'']&lt;/ref&gt; became very jealous and sought the help of a Muisca priest; ''chyquy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/chyquy Muisca dictionary: ''chyquy'']&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended her to fast and not bathe herself for twelve days. The first wife did what the priest had told her but the lack of food brought her close to death. The priest offered [[gold]]en figures to the gods and ordered the wife to take a bath, put on new clothes and head to the bed of her husband. She was surprised to find Meicuchuca sleeping in the bed and next to him an enormous snake.

The primary wife returned to the priest and told him what happened. The priest ordered the wife next day to take a bath in the [[Bogotá River]] close to the [[Tequendama Falls]] with the lover of Meicuchuca and other [[Women in Muisca society|women]] of Bacatá. The women went bathing in the river and suddenly the lover of Meicuchuca transformed in a snake again and disappeared in the water. Meicuchuca, terrified by the snake transformation, found the love for his wives again.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.fusagasuga.com.co/index.php/la-ciudad/historias-magicas/240-meicuchuca-y-la-serpiente Meicuchuca and the snake]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/serpiente.html Meicuchuca, the lover of the snake] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matusevitch self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Matusevitch's self portrait]]

'''Michael Matusevitch''' was a painter (1929 - 2007). He was born in [[Odessa]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] ([[Ukraine]] in nowadays). 
Matusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter.

==Wartime==
In [[1941]], Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents{{where|date=November 2018}}. After two weeks, war{{clarify|date=November 2018}} broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in [[Odessa]], resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the [[Nazism|Nazis]], making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg.

In the end, the group reached [[Tadzhikistan]] in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. 
Matusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. 
Matusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house.

==Odessa==
At the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. 
Matusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the [[Grekov Odessa Art school]].
At the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. 
Matusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the [[Red Army]]. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions.

==Study==
In 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the [[Socialist Realism]] mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. 
[[Modern art]] was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable.

In 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.”

==Influential painter==
An important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]]. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in [[Moscow]] from the [[Netherlands]], Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting. 

In 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” 
Subsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, [[Sasha Richter]].

==Israel==
In 1974, he arrived in [[Israel]] and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“
Matusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists.

In 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in [[Tel Aviv|Tel-Aviv]]. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch.  

==Death and legacy==
Matusevitch passed away in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much.

In 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an [https://www.matusevitchart.com online gallery], together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - [https://www.matusevitchart.com].  It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family.

'''''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World''''' is an academic anthology edited by the British [[religious studies]] scholars  Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by [[Edinburgh University Press]] in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of [[Pagan studies]], the book examines different forms of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] as practiced in Europe and North America.

Divided into three parts, the first, entitled "A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as [[globalisation]] and the [[secularisation]] of the natural world. The second part, entitled "The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature", contained papers by Prudence Jones, [[Ronald Hutton]], Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled "Nature Religion in Practice", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, [[Vivianne Crowley]] and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans.

==Origins==
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies had been held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, having been organised by the religious studies scholars [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism then took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]]; organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England, it was entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference's organisers later described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part One: A Cthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World===

====Beyer's "Globalisation and the Religion of Nature"====
The anthology's opening paper was written by Peter Beyer, then an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Ottawa]], Canada, and the author of the book ''Religion and Globalization'' (1994). In this paper, Beyer delved the definition of "[[nature religion]]" developed by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, looking at those religious movements whose "devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeding to provide a basic summary of [[globalisation]], he then made a brief discussion of how the two interact, arguing that nature religions had a tendency to develop a counter-structural strategy in dealing with globalising forces. In this manner they emphasise the idea that spiritual authenticity is stronger among the oppressed, such as those indigenous communities who adhere to nature religionist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. pp. 16&amp;ndash;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hanegraaff's "Reflections on New Age and the Secularisation of Nature"====
Beyer's paper was followed by that provided by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, then a Research Associate at the [[University of Utrecht]] and the author of ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mind of Secular Thought'' (1996).

Diana Paton and Maarit Forde] (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as Diana Paton, have contended that what constitutes Obeah in [[Jamaica]] has been constructed by white society, particularly law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Paton, "The Trials of Inspector Thomas: Policing and Ethnography in Jamaica," in [https://www.dukeupress.edu/obeah-and-other-powers ''Obeah and Other Powers: The Politics of Caribbean Religion and Healing'', ed. Diana Paton and Maarit Forde] (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 173-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, different Afro-Caribbean communities use their own terminology to describe the practice, such as science, among the Jamaican Windward [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Sharpe, ''[https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/ghosts-of-slavery Ghosts of Slavery: A Literary Archeology of Black Women's Lives]'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003), 3. &lt;/ref&gt; Obeah is similar to other [[Afro-American religions]] such as [[Palo (religion)|Palo]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Santería]], and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] in that it includes communication with ancestors and spirits and healing rituals. Nevertheless, it differs from religions like Vodou and Santeria in that there is no explicit canon of gods or deities that is worshipped, and the practice is generally an individual action rather than part of a collective ceremony or offering.&lt;ref&gt;Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gilbert, "Introduction," in ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Sacred_Possessions.html?id=EvOEdueU4GkC Sacred Possessions: Vodou, Santeria, Obeah and the Caribbean]'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1997), 6. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Variants of Obeah are practiced in the [[Bahamas]] and in the [[Caribbean]] nations of [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Suriname]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and the [[Virgin Islands]],&lt;ref name="Psy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychiatrists and Traditional Healers: Unwitting Partners in Global Mental Health |first1=Mario |last1=Incayawar |first2=Ronald |last2=Wintrob |first3=Lise |last3=Bouchard |first4=Goffredo |last4=Bartocci |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Su9Zhe3HglsC&amp;pg=PA222 |year=2009 |isbn=0-470-51683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the Igbo people of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chatafrik.com/articles/health-and-welfare/igbo-medicine-and-culture-the-concept-of-dibia-and-dibia-representations-in-igbo-society-of-nigeria|title=Igbo Medicine and Culture: The Concept of Dibia and Dibia Representations in Igbo Society of Nigeria  - ChatAfrik|last=Ph.D|first=Patrick Iroegbu|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igbocybershrine.com/tag/dibia/|title=Dibia {{!}} Odinani: The Sacred Arts &amp; Sciences of the Igbo People|website=igbocybershrine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://umunumo.com/igbomedicine.html|title=Igbo medicine|last=System|first=Independent Computer|website=umunumo.com|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, aspects of these folk religions have survived through syncretism with [[Christianity|Christian]] symbolism and practice introduced by European colonials and slave owners.

==Origins==
{{Odinani sidebar}}
In parts of the Caribbean where Obeah developed, slaves were taken from a variety of African nations with differing [[Traditional African religion|spiritual practices and religions]]. It is from these arrivals and their spiritualisms that Obeah originates. The origins of the word "Obeah" have been contested in the academic community for nearly a century; there is not a widely accepted consensus on what region or language the word derives from, and there is a politics to every hypothesis. [[Orlando Patterson]] promoted an Akan-[[Twi]] etymology, suggesting that the word came from [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Paton, ''The Cultural Politics of Obeah:'' ''Religion, Colonialism, and Modernity in the Caribbean World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015), 28.

&lt;/ref&gt; He and other proponents of the Akan-Twi hypothesis argued that the word was derived from ''obayifo'', a word associated with malevolent magic by [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Samuel Murrell'', Obeah: Magical Art of Resistance. In Afro-Caribbean Religions: An Introduction to Their Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Traditions'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2010), 231. &lt;/ref&gt;  ({{Lang-ak|witchcraft}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqpoxEl_0_4C&amp;pg=PA263|title=Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia|last=Chambers|first=Douglas B.|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=2009|isbn=1-60473-246-6|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kwasi Konadu suggested a somewhat updated version of this etymology, suggesting that ''bayi'', the neutral force used by the ''obayifo'', is the source material – a word with a slightly less negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Paton, ''Cultural Politics,'' 28. &lt;/ref&gt;

The first time in Jamaican history the term "obeah" was used in the colonial literature was in reference to [[Nanny of the Maroons]] an [[Akan people|Akan]] woman, considered the ancestor of the Windward Maroon community and celebrated for her role in defeating the British and securing a land treaty in 1739, as an old 'witch' and a 'Hagg'.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Edward|year=1774|title=The History of Jamaica Or, A General Survey of the Antient and Modern State of that Island: With Reflexions on Its Situation, Settlements, Inhabitants, Climate, Products, Commerce, Laws, and Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLw_AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=edward%20long%20coromantee&amp;pg=PA446#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|format=google|volume=2|pages=445–475|number=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLPrMMKmynwC&amp;pg|title=Notable Caribbeans and Caribbean Americans: A Biographical Dictionary|last1=Mendez|first1=Serafin|last2=Cueto|first2=Gail|last3=Deynes|first3=Neysa Rodríguez|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313314438|location=|page=|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thicknesse, ''[[iarchive:memoirsanecdotes00thic|Memoirs and anecdotes of Philip Thicknesse, late lieutenant governor of Land Guard Fort, and unfortunately father to George Touchet, Baron Audley]]'' (Dublin: Graisberry and Campbell, 1790), 77. &lt;/ref&gt; Obeah has also received a great deal of attention for its role in [[Tacky's War|Tacky’s Rebellion]] (also an Akan), the 1760 conflict that spurred the passage of the first Jamaican anti-Obeah law.&lt;ref&gt;British Parliament, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00014140/00001 "An Act to remedy the evils arising from irregular assemblies of Slaves, and to prevent their possessing arms and ammunition, and going from place to place without tickets, and for preventing the practice of obeah, and to restrain overseers from leaving the estates under their care on certain days, and to oblige all free negroes, mulattoes or Indians, to register their names in the vestry-books of the respective parishes of this Island, and to carry about them the certificate, and wear the badge of their freedom; and to prevent any captain, master or supercargo of any vessel bringing back Slaves transported off this Island,"] in CO 139/21, The National Archives, UK. &lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite its associations with a number of Akan slaves and rebellions, the origin of Obeah has been criticised by several writers who hold that an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] origin is more likely.&lt;ref name="Konadu 2010 140"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOXO_jkE-aUC&amp;pg=PA140|title=The Akan Diaspora in the Americas|last=Konadu|first=Kwasi|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2010|isbn=0-19-539064-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[W.

In another hypothesis, the [[Efik language]] is the root of Obeah where the word ''obeah'' comes from the Efik ''ubio'' meaning 'a bad omen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O0W5XyQVCYC&amp;pg=PA78|title=The world in so many words: a country-by-country tour of words that have shaped our language|last=Metcalf|first=Allan A.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=1999|isbn=0-395-95920-9|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melville J. Herskovits|Melville Herskovits]] endorsed a different Efik origin, arguing that obeah was a corruption of an Efik word for “doctor.”&lt;ref&gt;Paton, ''Cultural Politics'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonial British communities, aside from referring to the set of spiritual practices, “Obeah” also came to refer to a physical object, such as a talisman or charm, that was used for evil magical purposes. The item was referred to as an Obeah-item (e.g. an 'obeah ring' or an 'obeah-stick', translated as: ''ring used for witchcraft'' or ''stick used for witchcraft'' respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delbourgo|first=James|title=Gardens of life and death|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UPdRfySujWEJ:history.rutgers.edu/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_docman%26task%3Ddoc_view%26gid%3D204%26Itemid%3D144+Gardens+of+life+and+death&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiuIK9KHxuTyLqVLd6jaGV_ZKjp8ysRwn9nQREomNWH3zZTlv7rwzRR_P2GZsy5ob5Pf1y4yN8s8DoV9kMp4ZiDEfkUM7YVy7mx2fL8pemGAff2D2f8xNLyXxtf2C_fdpCwh3Qx&amp;sig=AHIEtbTf2Vg29aDuoPjHJcbj2kXnuoLgVw|publisher=British Society for the History of Science|page=3|accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obeah incorporated various beliefs from the religions of later migrants to the colonies where it was present. Obeah also influenced other religions in the Caribbean, e.g. Christianity, which incorporated some Obeah beliefs.&lt;ref name="Psy" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Illustration at page 212, Folk-lore, volume 1, 1890.png|thumb|alt=Image of a 19th-century illustration of an obeah figure of a seated figure confiscated from a black man named Alexander Ellis|Obeah figure confiscated from a black man named Alexander Ellis on his arrest in suspicion of practicing as an 'obeah-man' in [[Morant Bay]], Jamaica in 1887.

The term 'Obeah' is first found in documents from the early 18th century, as in its connection to [[Nanny of the Maroons]]. Colonial sources referred to the spiritual powers attributed to her in a number of derogatory ways, ranging from referring to her as “the rebel’s old obeah woman”&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, 3. &lt;/ref&gt;  to characterizing her as “unsexed” and more bloodthirsty than Maroon men.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert T. Thomas, ''[[iarchive:untroddenjamaic00thomgoog|Untrodden Jamaica]]'' (Kingston, Jamaica: A.W. Gardner, 1890), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Maroon oral traditions discuss her feats of ''science'' in rich detail. She is said to have used her obeah powers to kill British soldiers in Nanny’s Pot, a boiling pot without a flame below it that soldiers would lean into and fall in,&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; to quickly grow food for her starving forces,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Bilby, ''True Born Maroons'' (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2005), 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to catch British bullets and either fire them back or attack the soldiers with a machete.&lt;ref&gt;Bilby, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion of Obeah became even more frequent when it was made illegal in Jamaica after [[Tacky's War]]. During the rebellion, Tacky is said to have consulted an Obeahman who prepared for his forces a substance that would protect them from British bullets, which boosted their confidence in executing the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Jones, James Athearn"&gt;Jones, James Athearn (1831), ''Haverill, or memoirs of an officer in the army of Wolfe'' (J.J &amp; Harper), p. 199. {{ISBN|978-1-1595-9493-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danielle N. Boaz, “‘Instruments of Obeah:’ The Significance of Ritual Objects in the Jamaican Legal System, 1760 to the Present,” in ''Materialities of Ritual in the Black Atlantic,'' ed. Akinwumi Ogundiran and Paula Sanders (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2014), 145. &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787 a letter to an English newspaper referred to "Obiu-women" interpreting the wishes of the dead at the funeral of a murdered slave in Jamaica: a footnote explained the term as meaning "Wise-women".&lt;ref&gt;BECARA, i. e. White Man. "To the Editor of the Universal Register." Times [London, England] 23 Nov. 1787: 1. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuing source of white anxiety related to Obeah was the belief that practitioners were skilled in using poisons, as mentioned in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]'s ''Journal of a West India Proprietor''. Many white Jamaicans accused women of such poisonings; one case Lewis discussed was that of a young woman named Minetta who was brought to trial for attempting to poison her master.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew G. Lewis, ''Journal of a West India Proprietor, 1815-1817, Edited with an introduction by Mona Wilson'' (London: G. Routledge &amp; Sons Ltd., 1929), 149-150. &lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and others often characterized the women they accused of poisonings as being manipulated by Obeahmen, who they contended actually provided the women with the materials for poisonings.&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Turner Bryson, “The Art of Power: Poison and Obeah Accusations and the Struggle for Dominance and Survival in Jamaica’s Slave Society,” ''Caribbean Studies'' 41, no. 2 (2013): 63.

&lt;/ref&gt; The laws forbidding Obeah reflected this fear: an anti-Obeah law passed in Barbados in 1818 specifically forbade the possession of "any poison, or any noxious or destructive substance".&lt;ref&gt;"Colonial Intelligence." Times [London, England]. 5 Dec. 1818: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor who examined the medicine chest of an Obeah man arrested in Jamaica in 1866 identified white arsenic as one of the powders in it, but could not identify the others. The unnamed correspondent reporting this affirmed "The Jamaica herbal is an extensive one, and comprises some highly poisonous juices, of which the Obeah men have a perfect knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. "The Outbreak In Jamaica." Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 19th century the appearance of a [[comet]] &lt;!--Biela's Commet or 3D/Biela 1852--&gt;  in the sky became the focal point of an outbreak of religious fanatical [[End times|millennialism]] among the Myal men of Jamaica. [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] was at that time sweeping the English-speaking nations as well, and it readily appealed to those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, as spirit contact, especially with the dead, is an essential part of many African religions.

During the conflict between Myal and Obeah, the Myal men positioned themselves as the "good" opponents to "evil" Obeah.&lt;ref&gt;"The Obeah men are hired to revenge some man's wrong, while Myal men profess to undo the work of Obeah men and to cure those subject to Obeah alarms." OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. "The Outbreak In Jamaica." Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that Obeah men stole people's shadows, and they set themselves up as the helpers of those who wished to have their shadows restored. Myal men contacted spirits in order to expose the evil works they ascribed to the Obeah men, and led public parades which resulted in crowd-hysteria that engendered violent antagonism against Obeah men. The public "discovery"{{According to whom|date=July 2010}} of buried Obeah charms, presumed to be of evil intent, led on more than one occasion to violence against the rival Obeah practitioners. Such conflicts between supposedly “good” and “evil” spiritual work could sometimes be found within plantation communities. In one 1821 case brought before court in [[Berbice]], an enslaved woman named Madalon allegedly died as a result of being accused of malevolent obeah that caused the drivers at Op Hoop Van Beter plantation to fall ill.&lt;ref&gt;Randy M. Browne, “The ‘Bad Business’ of Obeah: Power, Authority, and the Politics of Slave Culture in the British Caribbean,” ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 68, no. 3 (2011): 451. 

&lt;/ref&gt; The man implicated in her death, a spiritual worker named Willem, conducted an illegal [[Mami Wata|Minje Mama]] dance to divine the source of the Obeah, and after she was chosen as the suspect, she was tortured to death.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, 469-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws were passed that limited both Obeah and Myal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;In 1818 ''The Times'' reported the passing of an act by the House of Assembly in Barbados against the practice of Obeah, which carried the penalty of death or transportation for those convicted. "Colonial Intelligence." Times [London, England] 5 Dec. 1818: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obeah in Trinidad and Tobago==
Trinidad and Tobago, Obeah includes the unique practice of the [[Moko jumbies|Moko-Jumbie]], or stilt dancer. ''Moko'' was a common word for [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] slaves{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In the Trinidad and Tobago Obeah tradition. A [[Douen]] is a child who has died before being baptized, and is said to be forced to forever walk the earth at night in English-speaking regions of the Caribbean.  Jewelry is made from deadly toxic red and black seeds called jumbies, jumbie eyes or jumbie beads (seeds of ''[[Abrus precatorius]]'' containing the [[AB toxin]] [[abrin]]) in the Caribbean and South America. By contrast, the moko-jumbie of Trinidad and Tobago is brightly colored, dances in the daylight, and is very much alive. The moko-jumbie also represents the flip side of spiritual darkness, as stilt-dancing is most popular around holy days and [[Carnival]].

==Obeah in literature==
Although 18th-century literature mentions Obeah often, one of the earliest references to Obeah in fiction can be found in 1800, in William Earle's novel ''Obi; or, The History of Three-Finger'd Jack'', a narrative inspired by true events that was also reinterpreted in several dramatic versions on the London stage in 1800 and following.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/obi/toc.html Obi]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the next major books about Obeah was ''Hamel, the Obeah Man'' (1827).  Several early plantation novels also include Obeah plots.  In [[Frederick Marryat|Marryat]]'s novel ''[[Poor Jack]]'' (1840) a rich young plantation-owner&lt;ref&gt;Described as a 'curly-headed Creole', possibly intended to be mixed-race. F. Marryat, ''Poor Jack'', Chapter XLI.&lt;/ref&gt; ridicules superstitions held by English sailors but himself believes in Obeah.

The 20th century saw less actual Obeah in open practice, but it still continued to make frequent appearances in literature. The following is only a partial list:

* [[Aleister Crowley]], a controversial English mystic declared ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' was dictated to him in 1904 by a non-physical being. Ch 1 verse 37 reads: "Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the [[wanga]]; the work of the wand and the work of the sword; these shall he learn and teach"
* [[Henry S. Whitehead]], who lived for some time on [[St Croix]] in the Caribbean, published his supernatural tale "The Jumbee" in ''Weird Tales'' (1926). The story lent its title to his collection ''[[Jumbee and Other Uncanny Tales]]'' (1944). 
* [[Zora Neale Hurston]] researched and wrote widely on the subject, including essays, drama, and the novel ''[[Jonah's Gourd Vine]]''.
* The former slave, Christophine, in [[Jean Rhys]]'s novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' is a practitioner of Obeah.
* ''Solitaire'', the female lead in the [[James Bond]] novel [[Live and Let Die (novel)|''Live and Let Die'']], is said to have "the power of the Obeah."
* An Obeah woman is a sort of [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] in [[Earl Lovelace]]'s novel ''[[Salt]]''.
* Ma Kilman in [[Derek Walcott]]'s epic poem "[[Omeros]]" is a healer who uses Obeah.
* In the novels and memoirs of [[Jamaica Kincaid]] there are several passages that mention Obeah.
* There are frequent references to Obeah in ''[[The Suffrage of Elvira]]'' written by [[V S Naipaul]]
* A central character in ''[[Unburnable]]'' is reputed to be an Obeah woman.
*The protagonist of the novel ''[[Brown Girl in the Ring (novel)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]'' by [[Nalo Hopkinson]] is an Obeah-woman in training, learning from her grandmother. She uses her abilities to defeat an evil Obeah-man and his [[duppy]].
*Obeah is heavily referenced in [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]]'s novel ''[[Cemetery Dance (novel)|Cemetery Dance]]''.
* A main character in the 2009 YA novel Three Witches by Paula Jolin (Roaring Brook/MacMillan)is a native of Trinidad and attempts to use Obeah to raise a dead classmate.
* Several characters in the book "The Book of Night Women" by Marlon James are said to practice Obeah, and it is a focal point at a number of points in the novel.
* ''Shadowcatcher'', the antagonist in the [[Nicholas Da Silva]] graphic novel series [[Dread &amp; Alive (novel)]], is an Obeah-man who uses Obeah to regain the prized amulet taken away from him by his brother, Cudjoe, the Myalman of the Jamaican Maroons."
*Robert Louis Stevenson Jamieson and his brother Arthur Conan Doyle Jamieson are both practicing Obeah in the [[Necroscope: the lost Years]] Novel from [[Brian Lumley]].
*Obeah figures in prominently in The Lazarus Curse (Dr. Thomas Silkstone #4) by Tessa Harris. The story centers around Jamaican slaves in 18th century England and the Obeah-men and their spells/talismans.
*[[Marie-Magdeleine Carbet]], [[Martinique]]'s most prolific woman writer, wrote a short story, "Obeah," now republished in English translation (along with the original French) by Michigan State UP as ''"Obeah" and Other Martinican Stories''.
* Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band "Golden Birdies" on the Clear Spot album refers to an "Obi Man" clearly a kind of voodoo priest "Up one hand broom star was an obi-man,revered throughout the bone-knob land, his magic black purse slit creeped open, let go flocks of them" &lt;ref&gt;https://genius.com/Captain-beefheart-and-his-magic-band-golden-birdies-lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name changes==
'''Ladislas Weisz''' was born June 13, 1899 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Antisemitism]] forced his family to change their name to the more Hungarian "''Péri''". When he moved to Germany, he was known as '''Laszlo Péri'''. After he moved to [[England]], he adopted the name "'''Peter Peri'''". His grandson, an artist born in 1971, also has the name [[Peter Peri]].

==Career==
Born in 1899, in Budapest into a large, [[Proletariat|proletarian]] Jewish family Peri became politicised at an early age. In 1919, he finished an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, and became a student at the workshops for proletariat fine arts in 1919. He was in contact with [[Lajos Kassák]] and the Activists. In 1917, he began his career as an actor at the MA Theater School, studying with János Mácsza. As part of a theatre company he went to [[Prague]] where he heard about the fall of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Republic of Councils]]. He studied architecture in 1919–20 in Budapest and [[Berlin]]. He lived for a short time in Paris in 1920, in the house of a socialist baker, before being forced to leave the country due to his political activities.

Peri moved to Vienna, then on to Berlin in 1921, where he created his first abstract geometric reliefs. In February 1922, he had a show with [[László Moholy-Nagy|Moholy-Nagy]] at [[Der Sturm Gallery]], Berlin. In 1923, his portfolio containing twelve [[linocut]]s was published by Der Sturm Verlag. His contributions to [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] at the time were to challenge the surface of the wall by producing irregularly shaped wall reliefs and to open up new planes; namely the discovery of concrete as a potential sculptural medium, colouring it if necessary, and the appreciation of the hard contour as a visual device, as seen in his [[collage]]s and linoprints. These could be used to create a visual medium hovering between the relief and architecture; whereas Moholy-Nagy's ''Glasarchitektur'' achieved this using paint and canvas, Péri used less conventional media.

At the ''Grosse Berliner Kunstausstellung'' in May 1923, between the contributions of Van Doesburg and El Lissitzky’s ‘Proun Room’ he showed his three-piece {{cvt|7|m|ft}}x{{cvt|17|m|ft}} composition which, while it may also have been executed in paint on wood, had pretensions to be executed in concrete. Peri, joined the [[German Communist Party]] (KPD) in 1923. His 1924, constructivist design for a Lenin tribute for the German art exhibition in Moscow, marked the end of his investigations into the non-objective.

That same year Peri began to work for the Berlin municipal architectural office and was there from 1924 to 1928. Probably motivated by a vision to put his [[Productivism|productivist]] values into action, but frustrated he quit the job in 1928. In 1928, he signed the manifesto and statutes of the [[Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists|Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany]] (''Assoziation Revolutionärer Bildener Künstler Deutschlands'') (ARBKD) (ASSO) which, like other new and militant Communist art organisations, called for a reinvigoration of the idea of "proletarian culture" and suitably positive images of working-class life and culture. He was also a mMember of ''Die Abstrakten'' (The Abstracts) and ''Rote Gruppe'' (Red Group). In 1929, he returned to representational painting and sculpture.

Peri immigrated to England in 1933, after his wife Mary Macnaghten granddaughter of social reformer [[Charles Booth (social reformer)|Charles Booth]] was arrested in possession of Communist propaganda. In 1934, Peri contributed "several forceful works in coloured concrete" to the AIA (Artists’ International Association) exhibition The Social Scene. He made contact with [[John Heartfield]]. In England, he lived first in Ladbroke Grove, then in Hampstead; in 1938, he moved to a studio in Camden Town where he worked until 1966. While in Hampstead, Peri joined the recently founded English section of the Artists International (later to be known as Artists International Association), an association composed largely of commercial artists and designers whose declared intention was to mobilise "the international unity of artists against Imperialist War on the Soviet Union, Fascism and Colonial oppression".{{cn|date=July 2017}}  In July 1938, he had a solo exhibition London Life in Concrete in an empty building at 36 Soho Square. In 1939, he became a British citizen and took the name "Peter Peri". In November 1948, he held a solo show Peri's People at the AIA Gallery. Late in the 1940s he did a series of commissions for the London County Council. In 1951, Peri produced a sculptural group ''[[The Sunbathers]]'' for the [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;The sculpture was rediscovered in 2017: ''Guardian'' Friday 21 April 2017 "Naked ambition: £15,000 appeal to revive nude sunbather statues" by Mark Brown

When the [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] opened in 1960, Peri was commissioned to "represent the life and activities [of [[Coventry]]] in modern terms and materials"; the work is known simply as ''The Coventry Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;''Coventry Gallery's Help for Local Artists'', [[The Times]], 9 March 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Peri joined the [[Quaker]] faith and produced a small bronze sculpture of a Quaker Meeting, much loved by the students of [[Woodbrooke]] Study Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/ Woodbrooke Quaker Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham]], where it is now located.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/qmh/2239272233/ Quaker Meeting sculpture on Flickr] (accessed 23 February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Peri died January 19, 1967.

The '''Ramgarhia''' are a community of [[Sikh]]s from the [[Punjab region]] of northwestern India, encompassing members of the [[Lohar]] and [[Tarkhan (Punjab)|Tarkhan]] subgroups.&lt;ref name="jsingh"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |editor1-first=Pashaura |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=Louis E. |editor2-last=Fenech |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19100-411-7 |first=Joginder |last=Singh |page=84 |chapter=Sikhs in Independent India |url=https://books.google.mg/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Originally called '''Thoka''', meaning ''carpenter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religions and communities of India |page=184 |first=Pran Nath |last=Chopra |year=1982 |publisher=East-West Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ramgarhia are named after [[Jassa Singh Ramgarhia]], whose birth name of Thoka became Ramgarhia in the 18th century when he was put in charge of rebuilding of what became known as [[Ramgarh Fort]], at Ramrauni, near [[Amritsar]]. He rose from being a carpenter to the leader of a [[misl]] bearing the Ramgarhia name.&lt;ref name="singha"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |page=111 |first=H. S. |last=Singha |year=2000 |publisher=Hemkunt Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Medieval India |page=146 |last1=Saini |first1=A. K. |last2=Chand |first2=Hukam |isbn=978-81-261-2313-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misl==
The Ramgarhia was one of the three misls selected to guard the [[Golden Temple]] at Amritsar from attack. Jassa Singh Ramgarhia had [[Ramgarhia Bunga]] built in 1755 to the east of the temple. The fort houses the [[Mughal empire|Mughal coronation stone]], brought by Jassa Singh Ramgarhia from the [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Aside from Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, notable leaders in the misl his son and successor, [[Jodh Singh Ramgarhia]], his younger brother, [[Tara Singh Ramgarhia]], and his grandson, [[Mangal Singh Ramgarhia]].

==Occupation and status==
Ramgarhias were traditionally mostly carpenters but included other artisan occupations such as stonemasons and blacksmiths.&lt;ref name="singha"/&gt; Generally, Sikh carpenters use ''Ramgarhia'' as a surname whereas [[Hinduism|Hindu]] carpenters use ''Dhiman''.&lt;ref name="judge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategies of Social Change in India |page=54|first=Paramjit S. |last=Judge |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lKM4aWhIH0C |isbn= 978-8-17533-006-1 |publisher=M. D. Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their artisan skills were noted by the [[British Raj|British]], who encouraged many Ramgarhia to move to colonies in [[East Africa]] in the 1890s, where they assisted in the creation of that region's infrastructure and became Africanised.&lt;ref name="singha"/&gt; One significant project in which they and other Punjabi Sikhs were involved was the construction of the railway linking the present-day countries of Kenya and Uganda, which was completed in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |editor1-first=Pashaura |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=Louis E. |editor2-last=Fenech |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19100-411-7 |first=Darshan Singh |last=Tatla |page=497 |chapter=The Sikh Diaspora |url=https://books.google.mg/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British authorities also encouraged Ramgarhias to migrate within India during the first quarter of the 20th century. Their inventiveness and skills at construction, repair and maintenance were of much use at, for example, the tea plantations in [[Assam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sikh Diaspora: Theory, Agency, and Experience |first=Himadri |last=Banerjee |chapter=The Other Sikhs: Bridging Their Diaspora |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Hawley |publisher=BRILL |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-00425-723-8 |pages=170-171 |url=https://books.google.mg/books?id=AV6wAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now distant from their landlords in Punjab, who were mostly Jat Sikhs, the Ramgarhia diaspora in the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] of Assam were able to enhance their previously low social status.&lt;ref name="judge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sikh Diaspora: Theory, Agency, and Experience |first=Himadri |last=Banerjee |chapter=The Other Sikhs: Bridging Their Diaspora |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Hawley |publisher=BRILL |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-00425-723-8 |pages=175-176 |url=https://books.google.mg/books?id=AV6wAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons learned  in Punjab, where they had established a few [[gurdwara]]s to aid community cohesion and had been loyal to the British and generally unwilling to support the Jat-led [[Akali movement]], assisted their improved status in Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |editor1-first=Pashaura |editor1-last=Singh |editor2-first=Louis E. |editor2-last=Fenech |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19100-411-7 |first=Himadri |last=Banerjee |page=538 |chapter=Sikhs Living Beyond Punjab in India |url=https://books.google.mg/books?id=7YwNAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Sikhism generally rejecting the [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste system]], it does have its own very similar socio-economic hierarchy, with its constituents often described as castes. In that, according to Peter Childs, the Ramgarhias today rank second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Childs |first=Peter |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture |isbn=978-1-13475-554-7 |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=270 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qHiVvKbSLX8C&amp;pg=PA270}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joginder Singh says that they still lack influence in the Punjab, which is a region heavily dependent on agriculture and dominated by some influential peasant farmers, mostly Jat but also some from communities such as the [[Labana]]s and [[Saini]]s. Those people, says Singh, have "captured the control of Sikh socio-religious institutions and political parties." Associations representing the less influential but numerically superior people have formed in reaction to this, including Ramgarhia groups that are running their own educational and socio-religious institutions as well as mobilising their diaspora and any prominent individuals who might assist in enhancing their identity.&lt;ref name="jsingh"/&gt;

[[File:David-harp.jpg|right|thumb|[[David]] playing his harp (unknown artist, c. 960). The book of [[Psalms]], included in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and said to have been written largely by David, is one of the earliest collections of sacred music, and still plays a role in the liturgies of the two religions.]]

'''Religious music''' (also '''sacred music''') is music performed or composed for [[religion|religious]] use or through religious influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/genre/religious-ma0000004431|title=Religious Music Genre Overview {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ritual music''' is music, sacred or not, performed or composed for or as [[ritual]].

==Christian music==
{{main|Church music|Christian music}}
According to some scholars, the earliest music in the Christian Church came from Jewish worship music, with some additional [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] influence.{{sfn|Conomos|2003}} It is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking, or speaking with an understood ritual cadence.&lt;ref&gt;Foley 2008,{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is another opinion that the roots of early Christian music come from the early ascetic monastic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin and Gibbs 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic Music ==
Islamic "songs" come in the form of prayers (In Arabic, prayer is ''Salah)'' that occur 5 times a day. These prayers are conducted by facing Mecca and having both knees to the ground bowing and reciting these prayers and usually are recitations of the Islamic Holy word the Quran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. Rasheid|first=Omar|date=|title=Muslim Prayer and Public Spheres: An Interpretation of the Quranic Verse 29:45|url=|journal=Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology|volume=68|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These prayers occur of the day and connect the Muslim people through a series of melodic prayers that often become amplified through the city. In Islam the implication of prayer and in this case the ''Salah'' is for ritual since it is believed to be the direct word of God that shall be performed as a collective, as well as individually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== History of Islam Prayer ====
"What shall I say of their prayer? For they pray with such concentration and devotion that I was astonished when I was able to see it personally and observe it with my own eyes.” (Riccold De Monte in the year 1228).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The origin of the art of prayer in all Abrahamic religions is to glorify God and the same goes for Islam. The ''Al Salat'' is the most widely used word to mean institutionalized prayer and is one of the oldest forms of prayer in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalee|first=Mohammed|date=1999|title=The Foundation of Muslim Prayer|url=|journal=Medieval Encounters|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islamic prayer, traditions, and ideals had influence from these Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hienz|first=Justin|date=August 2008|title=SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURY RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES ON THE SALĀT RITUAL|url=|journal=THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIMS PRAYER|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of origination of Salah came from the Muslim prophet Muhammad (the Messenger of God) in a cave as he began to worship Allah (God). It is believed that through this act of worship Mohammad interacted with the Abrahamic prophet Moses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Now these "prayers" come in the form of recitations of the Quran and poems written by prophets of the faith.

==== The Spread of Islamic Prayer ====
Besides the spread of Islam through Arabia by prophets it spread through trade routes like the Silk Road and through conflict of war. Through the Silk road traders and members of the early Muslim faith were able to go to countries such as China and create mosques around 627 C. E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11321/islam-enters-far-east/|title=Islam Enters the Far East - The Religion of Islam|last=waheed|website=www.islamreligion.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As men from the Middle East came to China they would get married to these Asian women, which led to a spreading of the faith and traditions of Islam in multiplicities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Crusades in the 9th and 10th century encouraged the spread of Islam through the invasions of Latin Christian soldiers and Muslim soldiers into each other's land. The whole conflict began on the premises of a Holy Land and which group of people owned these lands that led to these foes invading their respective lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/why-muslims-see-the-crusades-so-differently-from-christians|title=Why Muslims See the Crusades So Differently from Christians|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the religion itself spread so did its implications of ritual, such as prayer.

==Sikh music==
{{main|Sikh music}}

==Jewish music==
{{main|Jewish music}}
The earliest synagogal music was based on the same system as that in the [[Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to the [[Talmud]], [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], who had served in the sanctuary [[Levite|Levitical]] choir, told how the choristers went to the synagogue from the orchestra by the [[altar]] (Talmud, Suk. 53a), and so participated in both services.

One of the main problems that has come from these advancements in the past few decades has been defining death, which leads to organ donation and transplantation controversy.&lt;ref name="Buddhism and Bioethics" /&gt;  In 1968, [[Harvard medical school]] defined death as 'irreversible coma.'&lt;ref name="Brain Death Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matis|first1=Georgios|last2=Chrysou|first2=Olga|last3=Silva|first3=Danilo|last4=Birblis|first4=Theodossios|title=Brain Death: History, Updated Guidelines And Unanswered Questions|journal=The Internet Journal of Neurosurgery|date=2012|volume=8|issue=1|url=https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/14074}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important for healthcare practitioners to understand formal religious views on bioethics and organ donations in multicultural societies so medical advancements can still be aligned with religious views.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockopp|first1=edited by Jonathan E.|last2=Eich|first2=Thomas|title=Muslim medical ethics : from theory to practice|date=2008|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.|isbn=9781570037535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islamic Bioethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atighetchi|first1=Dariusch|title=Islamic bioethics : problems and perspectives|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=[Dordrecht]|isbn=1402049617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both receiving and donating organs is up to interpretation as there is no direct references to the process in [[religious texts]].&lt;ref name="The Views of UK Faith Leaders"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randhawa|first1=Gurch|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Anna|last3=Pateman|first3=Ruth|last4=Kinsella|first4=Suzannah|last5=Parry|first5=Vivienne|title=Religion and Organ Donation: The Views of UK Faith Leaders|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|date=9 July 2010|volume=51|issue=3|pages=743–751|doi=10.1007/s10943-010-9374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many scholars, religious authorities and individuals interpret the readings differently.  All this allows for different views between religions as well as within major religions. Any religious processes and traditions that occur right after death also effect views on organ donation.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliver|first1=Mike|title=Donating in good faith or getting into trouble Religion and organ donation revisited|journal=World Journal of Transplantation|date=2012|volume=2|issue=5|pages=69|doi=10.5500/wjt.v2.i5.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[Christians]] generally support organ donation as an altruistic act and leaves the process as an individual decision.  [[The Church of England]] has stated that organ donation is an act of Christian duty.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt;

===Catholicism===
[[Catholics]] believe the dead body is designed for [[resurrection]] and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Catholic bioethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Kevin D. O'Rourke, Philip|title=Medical ethics : sources of Catholic teachings|date=1993|publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0878405402|edition= 2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, love and [[communion (religion)|communion]] are key beliefs in Catholic religion and an organ donor's act is considered an act of self-giving and communion.&lt;ref name="Catholic bioethics" /&gt; [[The New Testament]] suggests in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 22:39, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matthew 22|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] interpreted this [[Golden Rule]] in his quote,"We shall receive our supreme reward from God according to the genuine and effective love we have shown to our neighbor."&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pope John Paul II|title=Many Ethical, Legal, and Societal Questions Must be Examined at Greater Depths|journal=Vatican Press|date=June 20, 1991|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XocwyhNJxJEC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=-+Pope+John+Paul+II+%E2%80%9CWe+shall+receive+our+supreme+reward+from+God+according+to+the+genuine+and+effective+love+we+have+shown+to+our+neighbor%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KWrfzeEgGv&amp;sig=Ldf2OckF11LGRjl_AH-Th0eJEP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo_s26tL3aAhWrg-AKHUgIAggQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=-%20Pope%20John%20Paul%20II%20%E2%80%9CWe%20shall%20receive%20our%20supreme%20reward%20from%20God%20according%20to%20the%20genuine%20and%20effective%20love%20we%20have%20shown%20to%20our%20neighbor%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has owned a [[donor card]] since the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt; but deceased popes cannot become organ donors because their bodies must be buried intact, and preserved as potential [[relic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/8303510/The-Pope-is-an-organ-donor-but-his-body-parts-cannot-be-donated.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
Since [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]] are not allowed to accept external blood products, their view on organ donation is complicated by the medical procedure itself.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt; Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that organ donation with no transfusion of blood is an individual decision.&lt;ref name="Organ Donation Transplantation and Religion" /&gt;

==Islam==
The majority of Islamic religious leaders accept organ donation during life (provided it does not harm the donor) and after death in order to save life. Most religious leaders do not accept brain death as a criterion and consider cessation of all signs of life including heart beat as a precondition for declaring death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Despite this position by Islamic religious leaders, Muslims are oftentimes uncertain about whether or not Islamic tradition considers organ donation to be forbidden. This uncertainty stems from ambiguity caused by conflicting opinions among some Islamic leaders regarding this issue. Moreover, a lack of support along with a generally negative attitude toward organ donation and transplantation has been reflected in surveys of diverse Islamic populations. This overall negativity towards organ donation has resulted in low rates of participation in organ donation by practicing Muslims even in cases where donation would be considered permissible by religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Padela | first1 = A.

Muslims believe that humans do not have ownership of their body or spirit, it is considered to be God's gift.&lt;ref name="Bioethics and organ transplantatio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moazam|first1=Farhat|title=Bioethics and organ transplantation in a muslim society : a study in culture, ethnography, and religion|date=2006|publisher=Indiana Univ. Press|location=Bloomington [u.a.]|isbn=9780253347824|edition= [Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islamic biomedical ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachedina|first1=Abdulaziz|title=Islamic biomedical ethics : principles and application|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195378504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judges of organ donation ethics question whether the noble act of donating an organ outweighs the desecration of a dead body.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics"/&gt; Additionally, some Muslims believe that all body parts must be present on the [[Day of Judgement]] and organ donations would interfere with that testimony.&lt;ref name="Organ Donation and Islam"/&gt;

Many [[Ayatollahs]] view organ donations differently.  For example, Grand Ayatollahs [[Ali al-Sistani]] did not approve of posthumous organ donation, while Grand Ayatollahs [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]] allowed donation of all organs after death as long as the body could still be recognizable.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics" /&gt;   Practicers of [[Shia Islam]] consider minor, regenerative organ donations different than major, non-regenerative organs.&lt;ref name="Islamic Bioethics"/&gt;

Some points of view that Muslims hold are based on the Prophet Muhammad’s teachings.  The quote “Whoever helps another will be granted help from Allah in the Hereafter” has been interpreted by some Muslims in support of organ donation.&lt;ref name="Organ Donation and Islam" /&gt;

In 1996, the [[United Kingdom]] Muslim Law Council declared that organ donation coincides with Islamic beliefs.&lt;ref name="Organ donation, transplantation and religion" /&gt;

===Egypt===
In recent decades, organ transplantation has become a major topic of disagreement in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics" /&gt; The [[Egyptian Parliament]] has not yet been able to develop an organ transplant program or any other laws concerning the subject.&lt;ref name="Islamic Bioethics" /&gt;  Most of the opposition comes from the existence of a [[black market]] and [[organ theft]] that has tainted the view citizens have on organ donation.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics" /&gt;  Since Muslims believe organs belong to God, proponents suggest it is God who ultimately saves the patient and opponents suggest that one can not donate an organ that they themselves do not own.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics" /&gt; [[Muhammad Metwali Al Shaarawy]] was a popular figure in Egypt whose quote, "How can you give a kidney that you yourself do not own?" influenced Egyptian views on organ donation.&lt;ref name="Muslim medical ethics" /&gt;

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], an Islamic ruling nation, laws have been passed in which monetary compensation for [[kidney donation]] is legal under regulation.&lt;ref name="Altruism and Religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabinowich|first1=Aviad|last2=Jotkowitz|first2=Alan|title=Altruism and Religion: A New Paradigm for Organ Donation|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|date=7 September 2017|volume=57|issue=1|pages=360–365|doi=10.1007/s10943-017-0488-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Organ donation in Jewish law}}
Like Islam, the body requires burial within 24 hours of death and any unnecessary interference with the body should be avoided.  The Jewish Law, [[Halakha]], discusses the moral obligation ([[mitzvah]]) of saving one's life, which many scholars and rabbis consider to outweigh the consequences of interfering with one's body.&lt;ref name="Implementing Presumed Consent for Organ Donation in Israel: Public, Religious and Ethical Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Ori|last2=Jacobson MD PhD|first2=Eyal|title=Implementing Presumed Consent for Organ Donation in Israel: Public, Religious and Ethical Issues|journal=IMAJ|date=2007|volume=9|pages=777–781|url=https://www.ima.org.il/FilesUpload/IMAJ/0/47/23737.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish medical ethics]] takes a unique approach. It encourages live organ donation, such as kidney transplant, partial liver lobe (Adult/Child) transplant and the like, when two basic conditions are met, firstly, that the operation does not (significantly) endanger the life of the donor, and secondly, that the recipient's life will be saved through this donation. However, opinions are divided on the issue of organ donations which will  permanently end the donor's heart beating, in a case when the donor is brain dead. According to one school of thought,&lt;ref name="Bleich"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Bleich
  | first = J. David
  | authorlink = J. David Bleich
  | title = Time of death in Jewish law
  | publisher = Z. Berman
  | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of death is indicated by irreversible cessation of heart beat. Hence, this view does not allow vital organs to be removed from a brain dead patient, as stopping the heart from beating is, in their view, tantamount to killing. Conversely, the other school of thought&lt;ref name="Tendler"&gt;See [[Moshe Tendler]]'s elucidation of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]]'s [[responsa]]&lt;/ref&gt; (which include many Orthodox rabbis and Israel's [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]]) the determination of death is based on brain function irrespective of a beating heart. Therefore, according to their view, removing vitals organs from a brain dead patient for the sake of saving a life, is in fact permissible, and even encouraged.

As a result of these two orthodox schools of thought, Orthodox [[Jewish ethics]] remains divided over key death-related policies. Tactically, opponents to the brain death criterion have requested waivers from state law, as a matter of religious freedom, so as to continue relying on traditional indicators.&lt;ref name="Bleich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tendler" /&gt; Meanwhile, proponents of the brain death criterion, such as [[Halachic Organ Donor Society]] have been active in advocating [[organ donations]] and transplants either at brain death or even at cessation of heart beat, where donation of corneas and skin is still medically possible.

===Israel=== 
[[Israel]] used a committee of medical and religious authorities in order to create laws regarding organ donation.  Two laws were enacted in 2008.  First, the Brain-Respiratory Death Law states conditions that determines the conditions necessary to determine brain death.  It also allows for both brain death and cease of the heartbeat as acceptable deaths.  Second, the Organ Transplantation Law, fully implemented in 2012, addresses the legality and ethics of organ donation in Israel.  The law states that [[organ trade]] and donor compensation are illegal.&lt;ref name="Altruism and Religion" /&gt;

A nonprofit NGO called Matnat Chaim was created in Israel in order to promote live-donor [[kidney transplantation]].  Their goal is to be in accordance with [[Jewish law]] and states that the act is considered a [[wikt:Special:Search/compliment|laudatory]] one.&lt;ref name="Altruism and Religion" /&gt;

Only about 10% of the Israeli population owns an organ donor card.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt;

==Buddhism==
The [[spiritual consciousness]] remaining in the body after death leads to discrepancy on organ donation in the Buddhist community.  Issues with defining a diagnosis of [[brainstem death]] also provides contradictions in organ donation views.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt;

According to Buddhism, it is a great [[Merit (Buddhism)|Merit]] to donate one's own flesh for the sake of another. The lord Buddha is also believed to be sacrificed himself by jumping into a fire in order to nourish a lost and starved villager in woods, in a previous life as a rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//hubpages.com/hub/Sutta-Jataka |title=Sutta Pitaka: The Jātaka Tales |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103100803/hubpages.com/hub/Sutta-Jataka |archivedate=November 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bodhisattva value of compassion is also expressed through organ donation by putting another person’s wellness above one’s own.  Donations made based on monetary or societal motivation are not valued by Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Into the jaws of Yama"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsomo|first1=Karma Lekshe|title=Into the jaws of Yama, lord of death : Buddhism, bioethics, and death|date=2006|publisher=State Univ. of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791468321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ Donation Transplantation and Religion"/&gt;

A person’s spiritual consciousness continues through the path of the [[bardo]] and [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] after death.  Some believe that since physical organs are useless after death, donating them is an act of great compassion.  Other’s believe that in order to ensure positive rebirth, the dying individual should not be disturbed.  However, organs have to be harvested right after death is declared in order to be useful.  All these considerations allow for differentiating views depending on the individual.&lt;ref name="Into the jaws of Yama" /&gt;

The choice of making the donation has to be made by the donor him/herself according to Buddhism. It's not clear brain death is a form of death according to Buddhism. But if it considered as death, in which case one cannot make decision oneself, it's a good deed for one who died and also for the ones involved in decision making and contributing. Buddhists believe in the value of compassion, in which actions such as organ donation can be used to overcome the sufferings of life.&lt;ref name="On Being Human"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourgeault|first1=Daisak Ikeda, René Simard, Guy|title=On being human : where ethics, medicine, and spirituality converge|date=2003|publisher=Middleway Press|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=0972326715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buddhism and Bioethics"/&gt;

Buddhism generally accepts brainstem death and the irreversible ability for respiration as a valid criteria for death of a human being.&lt;ref name="Buddhism and Bioethics" /&gt; A living body or a dead body in Japanese culture is considered to be the permanent carrier of the soul.&lt;ref name="On Being Human"/&gt;  This belief has made it hard to develop a unanimous agreement on brain death in [[Japan]].

Many Buddhists in [[Eastern Asia]] adopt the [[Confucian]] [[taboos]] that are against destruction or disfiguring the human body.  Because of this view, many countries in East Asia have low rates of organ donation.&lt;ref name="Into the jaws of Yama" /&gt;

Because [[Hawai’i]] has a large Asian population, these cultural and religious ideals can be reflected in their participation in organ donation.  As a state, they have the lowest rate of organ donations compared the rest of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Into the jaws of Yama" /&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhists]] believe the [[spirit]] may remain in the body until about a week after death, therefore organ donation can be seen as interfering with the next rebirth.&lt;ref name="Organ donation, transplantation and religion" /&gt; [[Pure Land Buddhism]] is a branch of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] that is against organ donation.  They believe that the soul should be able to leave peacefully towards the path of rebirth.  Since the soul takes time to depart from the physical body, they believe the body should not be disturbed immediately after death is declared.&lt;ref name="An Asian Perspective on Organ Transplantation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tai|first1=Michael Cheng-Tek|title=An Asian Perspective on Organ Transplantation|journal=Tzu Chi Medical Journal|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=90–93|doi=10.1016/S1016-3190(09)60017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea and Taiwan, organ donation is successfully adopted.&lt;ref name="Into the jaws of Yama" /&gt;

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, the physical integrity of the body after death is not considered important.&lt;ref name="Organ Donation Transplantation and Religion" /&gt; Hindu values [[reincarnation]] and prolonging life which allows for many individuals to agree with organ donation.&lt;ref name="Donating in good faith" /&gt;

Life after death is a strong belief of [[Hinduism]] and is an ongoing process of rebirth. It is a perpetual circle of birth and rebirth of the soul, so the physical body is insignificant. This could be seen as reflecting positively on the concept of organ donation and transplantation in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/organdonation.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic faiths]] hold similar views.

==Jainism==

In [[Jainism]], compassion and charity are considered to major virtues. Organ donation has been widely supported by the Jain community leaders and monks.&lt;ref&gt;Maitri Porecha,  [http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1870940/report-gurus-discourse-donate-organ-save-life Gurus' discourse: Donate organ, save life], DNA Aug 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been reported that in Mumbai, 85-90% of all organ donations including eye donations, are by Jains and Gujaratis (a significant fraction of them are Jain in Mumbai).&lt;ref&gt;Ratan Sharda  [http://www.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2013/4/22/Positive-Side-of-Religion.aspx Positive Side of Religion], News Bharati, 4/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gujarat]] has had considerable success with the eye donation program due to a significant population of the [[Jain community]], which considers eye donation as a sublime form of charity.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Shroff [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779960/ Legal and ethical aspects of organ donation and transplantation] Indian J. Urol. 2009 Jul-Sep; 25(3): 348–355.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nineveh]] was at the time within the [[Asōristān]] province of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Much like [[Julian the Apostate]] of the [[Roman Empire]], Sanharib disliked Christianity and tried to persuade his son Behnam to reject Christianity.

== Rituals ==

Special pujas will be conducted at temple at ''Thirumalai''. The ritual begin after the devotees taking a holy-dip in the [[Thamirabarani River|Thamirabharani]]  river at [[Munchirai]], the first Sivalayam.  The participants wear saffron robes, hold a palm-leaf fan on their hand and chant the mantra '' "Govinda... Gopaala..." '' all through the whole day of running. The pilgrims receive the holy ashes, ''"Thiruneer"'' from all the eleven temples. The purpose for the pilgrimage is believed to be fulfilled only by receiving the Sandal-paste from the final ''Sankaranarayanar Temple'' at Thirunattalam. After this, it is also told that a worship at [[Adi Kesava Temple]] at [[Thiruvattar]] nearby is also very useful after this ceremony. The objective of the pilgrimage is to uphold that [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Vishnu]] are both the manifestations of one supreme being.

Before, the devotees observes a one-week fast.  [[Tender coconut]]  and [[Palmyra|Tender palmyra]]  in the day time and [[tulsi]]-water at night are the only food items taken by the devotees during the [[fasting]] days.

'''St.&amp;nbsp;Priapus Church''' ({{lang-fr|Église S.&amp;nbsp;Priape}}), also known as '''Temple of Priapus''', is a [[North America]]n [[pagan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/temple-of-priapus_n_6958200.html "Montreal's Penis Temple Dedicated To Every Member"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 30&amp;nbsp;March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; religion founded in the 1980s that centres on the worship of the [[phallus]].

==Formation and tenets==
St. Priapus Church was founded in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], by D. F. Cassidy and has found a following mainly among [[homosexual]] men in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The church, which is named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Priapus]], teaches that the phallus is the source of life, [[beauty]], joy, and pleasure.&lt;ref name = JGM&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]]. (1996). ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', 5th&amp;nbsp;ed, p.&amp;nbsp;952. Detroit, MI: Gale, {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Scripture of the Holy Seed'', also informally called the ‘Bible of Man Worship’, is the official religious text of the church. It is written in a similar way to that of the Judeo-Christian scriptures, with passages about a savior and sacrifice, but with erotic and sexual meanings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/73222726/Bible-of-Man-Worship-Volume-2-MS-Word&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial practices==
The phallus is to be worshipped, which can be accomplished by a variety of [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]], including group [[masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Dynes [Ed.]. (1990). ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;779. New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semen]] is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.&lt;ref name = JGM/&gt; Similarly, [[fellatio]] is strongly encouraged; St.&amp;nbsp;Priapus Church sees it as a [[wikt:commandment|commandment]], a good deed which has positive effects not just for the recipient but for society in general, a practice facilitating world peace. (Well-fellated men, the church teaches, are less likely to make war.)&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg. (1997). Pasado, presente y perspectivas del teléfono erótico. ''El cortejo de Afrodita. Ensayos sobre literatura hispánica y erotismo'', anejo&amp;nbsp;11, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–114. [&amp;nbsp;''Actas del Segundo Coloquio Internacional de Erótica Hispana'' (1997), [[Málaga]]&amp;nbsp;], ''Analecta Malacitana''. {{ISBN|8492217235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of the phallus are personified as deities, particularly Priapus and [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who are revered in religious ceremonies. The ceremonies are a mixture between pagan phallus worship as well as the structure of a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;http://radicalfaeries.tribe.net/thread/1fa402f1-705f-45eb-b6a2-4c2c15d4d5b8&lt;/ref&gt; During the services, the congregation is naked with the exception of the priest. Phallic statues and candles are incorporated in the worship as well as phallic-centered prayers. Along with group masturbation, often to pornographic videos, group sex also may take place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeout.com/newyork/sex-dating/get-naked-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Although the membership of the church is primarily [[gay]], with some presence of non-gay [[men who have sex with men]], it is not officially gay and does not exclude non-gays. Similarly, while members of the church are overwhelmingly male, there is no rejection or exclusion of women; any woman who wishes to worship the phallus and its semen is welcome, and there have been occasional female participants.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole section|date=May 2015}}

There are nine centres of the church in Canada and eight in the United States. The largest membership of the church resides in [[San Francisco, California]], and it has its headquarters in Montreal.&lt;ref name = JGM/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">{{Ancient Roman religion}}

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], a '''''supplicatio''''' is a day of public prayer when the men, women, and children of Rome traveled in procession to religious sites around the city praying for divine aid in times of crisis. A ''supplicatio'' can also be a thanksgiving after the receipt of aid.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Hickson Hahn, "Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns," pp. 238, 247, and [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," p. 270, both in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Supplications might also be ordered in response to prodigies ''([[prodigium|prodigia]])''; again, the population as a whole wore wreaths, carried laurel twigs, and attended sacrifices at temple precincts throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;Veit Rosenberger, in "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion,'' p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

A ''supplicatio'' was decreed for two different reasons: 

As a thanksgiving, when a great victory had been gained. It was usually decreed as soon as official intelligence of the victory had been received by a letter from the general in command. The number of days during which it was to last was proportioned to the importance of the victory. 

Sometimes it was decreed for only one day but more commonly for three or five days. A supplication of ten days was first decreed in honour of [[Pompey]] at the conclusion of the war with [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] and one of fifteen days after the victory over the [[Belgae]] by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], an honour which Caesar himself says had never been granted to any one before. 

Subsequently a supplicatio of twenty days was decreed after his conquest of [[Vercingetorix]]. From this time the senate seems to have frequently increased the number of days out of mere compliment to the general. We thus find mention of thanksgivings for forty days, fifty days and even sixty. 

A ''supplicatio'' was usually regarded as a prelude to a [[roman triumph|triumph]] but it was not always followed by one, as [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] reminds [[Cicero]], to whose honour a supplicatio had been decreed. This honour was conferred upon Cicero on account of his suppression of the conspiracy of [[Catiline]], which had never been decreed to any one before in a civil capacity ([[togatus]]) as he frequently takes occasion to mention. 

A Supplicatio, a solemn supplication and humiliation, was also decreed in times of public danger and distress and on account of prodigies to avert the anger of the gods.

'''Tiantai''' ({{zh|c=天台|p=&lt;small&gt;{{noitalics|[[People's Republic of China|PRC]] Standard Mandarin:}}&lt;/small&gt; Tiāntāi, &lt;small&gt;{{noitalics|[[Taiwan|ROC]] Standard Mandarin:}}&lt;/small&gt; Tiāntái}}) is a school of [[Buddhism]] in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]] that reveres the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' as the highest teaching in Buddhism.{{sfn|Groner|2000|p=199–200}} In Japan the school is known as [[Tendai]], in Korea as [[Cheontae]], and in Vietnam as ''Thiên thai''.

The name is derived from the fact that [[Zhiyi]] (538–597 CE), the fourth patriarch, lived on [[Tiantai Mountain]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=154}} Zhiyi is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system. Tiantai is sometimes also called "The Lotus School", after the central role of the ''Lotus Sutra'' in its teachings.{{sfn|Ziporyn|2004}}

During the [[Sui dynasty]], the Tiantai school became one of the leading schools of Chinese Buddhism, with numerous large temples supported by emperors and wealthy patrons. The school's influence waned and was revived again through the [[Tang dynasty]] and also rose again during the [[Song dynasty]]. Its doctrine and practices had an influence on Chinese [[Zen|Chan]] and [[Pure land]] Buddhism.

==History==
Unlike earlier schools of [[Chinese Buddhism]], the Tiantai school was entirely of Chinese origin.{{sfn|Groner|2000|pp=248–256}} The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from [[India]], with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. However, Tiantai grew and flourished as a native Chinese Buddhist school under the 4th patriarch, [[Zhiyi]], who developed an original and extensive Chinese Buddhist system of doctrine and practice through his many treatises and commentaries.

Over time, the Tiantai school became doctrinally broad, able to absorb and give rise to other movements within Buddhism, though without any formal structure.{{sfn|Groner|2000|pp=248–256}} The tradition emphasized both scriptural study and meditative practice, and taught the rapid attainment of Buddhahood through observing the mind.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=162}}

The school is largely based on the teachings of Zhiyi, [[Zhanran]], and [[Zhili (philosopher)|Zhili]], who lived between the 6th and 11th centuries in China. These teachers took an approach called "classification of teachings" (''jiaopan'') in an attempt to harmonize the numerous and often contradictory Buddhist texts that had come into China. This was achieved through a particular interpretation of  the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]''.

===Early figures===
Due to the use of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s philosophy of the Middle Way, he is traditionally taken to be the first patriarch of the Tiantai school.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=109}}{{sfn|Ng|1990|p=1}}

The sixth century [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] master Huiwen ({{zh|c=慧文}}) is traditionally considered to be the second patriarch of the Tiantai school. Huiwen studied the works of Nāgārjuna, and is said to have awakened to the profound meaning of Nāgārjuna's words: "All conditioned phenomena I speak of as empty, and are but false names which also indicate the mean."{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=109}}

Huiwen later transmitted his teachings to [[Zen master|Chan master]] [[Nanyue Huisi]] ({{zh|c=南嶽慧思}}, 515-577), who is traditionally figured as the third patriarch. During meditation, he is said to have realized the "Lotus [[Samadhi|Samādhi]]", indicating enlightenment and [[Buddhahood]]. He authored the ''Mahāyāna-śamatha-vipaśyanā''.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=110}} Huisi then transmitted his teachings to [[Zhiyi]] ({{zh|c=智顗}}, 538-597), traditionally figured as the fourth patriarch of Tiantai, who is said to have practiced the Lotus Samādhi and to have become enlightened quickly. He authored many treatises such as explanations of the Buddhist texts, and especially systematic manuals of various lengths which explain and enumerate methods of Buddhist practice and meditation.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=110}} The above lineage was proposed by Buddhists of later times and do not reflect the popularity of the monks at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper81/14705/1305005.html 风穴寺与临济宗]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhiyi===
[[File:Sramana Zhiyi.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Painting of Śramaṇa Zhiyi]]
Scholars such as Paul Loren Swanson consider [[Zhiyi]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 智顗, 538–597 CE) to have been the major founder of the Tiantai school as well as one of the greatest Chinese Buddhist philosophers. He was the first to systematize and popularize the complex synthesis of Tiantai doctrine as an original Chinese tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Paul Loren. Foundations of Tʻien-Tʻai Philosophy: The Flowering of the Two Truths Theory in Chinese Buddhism, Asian Humanities Press, 1989, page ix&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zhiyi analyzed and organized all the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] and Mahayana [[sutra]]s into a system of five periods and eight types of teachings.  For example, many elementary doctrines and bridging concepts had been taught early in the Buddha's advent when the vast majority of the people during his time were not yet ready to grasp the 'ultimate truth'.  These Āgamas were an ''[[upaya]]'', or skillful means - an example of the Buddha employing his boundless wisdom to lead those people towards the truth. Subsequent teachings delivered to more advanced followers thus represent a more complete and accurate picture of the Buddha's teachings, and did away with some of the philosophical 'crutches' introduced earlier.  Zhiyi's classification culminated with the [[Lotus Sutra]], which he held to be the supreme synthesis of Buddhist doctrine. The difference on Zhiyi's explanation to the ''[[Golden Light Sutra]]'' caused a debate during the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag202091.pdf 論宋代天台宗山家、山外之爭]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhiyi's Tiantai school received much imperial support during the [[Sui dynasty]], because of this, it was the largest Buddhist school at the beginning of the Tang and thus suffered because of its close relationship with the house of Sui.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Johnston (editor). Encyclopedia of Monasticism: A-L&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhanran===
[[File:Zhanran.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Illustration of Zhanran]]
After Zhiyi, Tiantai was eclipsed for a time by newer schools such as the [[East Asian Yogācāra]] (''Fǎxiàng-zōng''), and [[Huayan school]]s, until the 6th patriarch Jingxi [[Zhanran]] (711-782) revived the school and defended its doctrine against rival schools such as the [[Huayen]] and Faxiang.&lt;ref&gt;Groner, Paul (2000). ''Saicho : The Establishment of the Japanese Tendai School''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 228–229. {{ISBN|0824823710}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates between the [[Faxiang]] school and the Tiantai school concerning the notion of universal Buddhahood were particularly heated, with the Faxiang school asserting that different beings had different natures and therefore would reach different states of enlightenment, while the Tiantai school argued in favor of the Lotus Sutra teaching of Buddhahood for all beings.{{sfn|Groner|2000|pp=248–256}} Zhanran's view of Buddha nature was expanded in his ''Jingangpi'' or "Diamond Scalpel," which is the 'locus classicus' of the doctrine of "the Buddha-nature of Insentient Beings." According to Shuman Chen, Zhanran:

&lt;blockquote&gt;provides his rationale primarily from the perspective of the all-pervasive quality of Buddha-nature, which he considers synonymous with suchness. This rationale indicates that external tangible objects like water, buildings, and flora, formless sounds and smells, and internal thoughts or ideas all possess Buddha-nature. This is because Sakyamuni Buddha and any other Buddha’s meritorious qualities in their practice leading to enlightenment and in the resultant realization do not reject anything, instead embracing all. In the Tiantai terminology, the Buddha and all beings mutually include, inter-pervade, and are identical to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Shuman Chen. Buddha-Nature of Insentient Beings. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion , 2nd ed., vol. 1, pp. 208-212, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-Tang crisis and Song revival===
After Zhanran, Tiantai declined once again. Brook Ziporyn writes that this period has been seen as the second dark age of Tiantai, a state of crisis "extending from the Tang into the Five Dynasties and Northern Song, an age marked internally by the deterioration of distinctive Tiantai ideas and marked externally by the loss of crucial texts and monastic institutions, especially after [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|the persecution of 845]] (a period that saw the increased influence of Chan)."&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook (1994). [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8820/2727 Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai]. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Huayan and [[Zen|Chan]] influences made strong inroads into Tiantai thought. Zhanran's disciple and seventh patriarch Daosui, and syncretic figures such as Zhi Yuan (768-844) and Daochang Ningfen all combined Tiantai with Chan ideas (particularly of the [[Heze school]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook (1994). [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8820/2727 Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai]. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65&lt;/ref&gt; Daosui ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 道邃; [[pinyin]]: ''Dàosuì''), is important because he was the primary teacher of [[Saichō]], the founder of the Japanese Tiantai tradition (known in Japanese as [[Tendai]]). Other Tiantai syncretists include Deshao (881-972) who was associated with the Fayen branch of Chan and his student Yongming Yenshou (954-974) who attempted to unify Tiantai, Huayen and Yogacara teachings under a kind of idealism influenced by Zongmi, emphasizing what he called the "one pure formless mind".&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook (1994). [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8820/2727 Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai]. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation led to the famous debate within the Tiantai school known as the "home mountain" (''shanjia'') vs. "off mountain" (''shanwai'') debate. "Off mountain" supporters, as they were later polemically termed, supported these new doctrines (such as the "one pure mind") claiming they were originally Tiantai doctrines, while "home mountain" supporters saw the original Tiantai view as different and superior to this new view influenced by Chan and Huayan doctrines (especially by [[Zongmi]]'s works).&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook. Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 17 • Number 1 • Summer 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The most eminent figure during this debate was Patriarch [[Siming Zhili]] (960-1028), who wrote various commentaries on Zhiyi's works and defended the "Home mountain" view. Zhili's major criticisms included attacking Chan's failure to understand the necessity of the use of words and scriptural study as part of practice as well as criticizing Zongmi's view of a pure mind as the buddha-nature, arguing instead that the "three truths" as taught by Zhiyi are the ultimate reality. For Zhili, mind or consciousness has no special status relative to other types of dharmas, such as physical matter.&lt;ref&gt;Ziporyn, Brook. Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 17 • Number 1 • Summer 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Zhili's "home mountain" view turned out to be victorious, and his works became part of the orthodox Tiantai canon during the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Ciyun Zunshi (964-1032) was another important figure in this second Tiantai revival. His work focused on the promotion of rituals for lay Buddhists and worked on converting the populace away from using blood, meat and alcohol for funerary and ancestral rites. Ciyi also promoted the practice of adopting local Chinese deities and spirits into the Buddhist religion as "vassals" or "retainers" and strongly promoted repentance rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt; 

These two figures were also associated with the popularization of [[Pure Land]] practices through the foundation of lay societies (lotus societies, ''lianshe''). Tiantai monk Mao Ziyuan (1096?-1166) took this one step further by establishing what became known as the "White Lotus Society" which allowed both men and women to attend together and even to preach and be in charge of society repentance halls as married clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the efforts of these major Tiantai figures, the school became one of the dominant forms of Buddhism during the Song, alongside of Chan.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh,  Michael J. Review of ''Buddhism in the Sung Edited by Peter N. Gregory and Daniel A. Getz''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan, Ming and Qing===
The defeat of the Song dynasty was a serious blow to Tiantai which suffered another setback during the [[Yuan dynasty]] which supported Tibetan Buddhism, while Chan Buddhism continued to grow in popularity while attacking the legitimacy of other schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yung-fen. The Revival of Tiantai Buddhism in the Late Ming: On the Thought of Youxi Chuandeng (1554-1628), 2011, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; This period saw the Tiantai figure Huxi Huaize (fl. 1310) write his polemical treatise ''Record of Tiantai’s Transmission of the Buddha’s Mind-seal'' as an effort to defend the Tiantai tradition against Chan critiques.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yung-fen. The Revival of Tiantai Buddhism in the Late Ming: On the Thought of Youxi Chuandeng (1554-1628), 2011, page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ming Dynasty]] saw further religious revivals among the major Chinese Buddhist schools, including Tiantai, particularly under the reign of the Buddhist friendly Wanli Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Wu, Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth Century China, Oxford University Press, 2008, page 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main figures of the Ming Tiantai Buddhist revival is Miaofeng Zhenjue (1537-1589), who lectured widely and whose students revived ancestral Tiantai monasteries such as Gaoming and Ayuwang.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Wu, Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth Century China, Oxford University Press, 2008, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Youxi Chuandeng (1554-1628), a student of Miaofeng, was also another important figure who wrote a work entitled "On Nature Including Good and Evil" which presents his ideas on doctrinal classification, the principle of nature-inclusion, and the practice of the Dharma-gate of inherent evil attempting to harmonize these with Confucianism and the thought of the Śūraṃgama Sūtra. Chuandeng was also instrumental in rebuilding Gaoming monastery which had been abandoned by this time.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yung-fen. The Revival of Tiantai Buddhism in the Late Ming: On the Thought of Youxi Chuandeng (1554-1628), 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Tianxi Shoudeng (1607-1675) was one of the most influential teachers and exegetes of Tiantai during the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Wu, Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth Century China, Oxford University Press, 2008, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
[[File:Guoqingsi005r.jpg|thumb|[[Guoqing Temple]].]]
The Tiantai school takes the ''[[Lotus Sūtra]]'' (''{{IAST|Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra}}'') as the main basis, the ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] as the guide, the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' as the support, and the ''Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' (The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 25,000 Lines) for methods of contemplation.{{sfn|Huai-Chin|1997|p=91}} The ''Pusa yingluo benye jing'' (T. 24, No. 1485) is also a key text. Tiantai is often termed the ‘Four Sutras One Treatise School’ (四経一論) because of the strong influence of these texts on the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Jikai Dehn, Mohe Zhiguan study materials, http://tendaiaustralia.org.au/documents/MoheZhiguanOutline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to its doctrinal basis in Indian Buddhist texts, the Tiantai school also created its own meditation texts which emphasize the principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā. Of the Tiantai meditation treatises, Zhiyi's ''Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā'' (小止観), ''Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā'' (摩訶止観), and ''Six Subtle Dharma Gates'' (六妙法門) are the most widely read in China.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=110}} Rujun Wu identifies the work ''[[Mohe Zhiguan]]'' of Zhiyi as the seminal meditation text of the Tiantai school.{{sfn|Wu |1993|p=}} 

The Major Tiantai treatises studied in the tradition are the following works of Zhiyi:&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Jikai Dehn, Mohe Zhiguan study materials, http://tendaiaustralia.org.au/documents/MoheZhiguanOutline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of teachings==
Tiantai classified the Buddha's teachings in Five Periods and Eight Teachings. This classification is usually attributed to Zhiyi, but is probably a later development.{{sfn|Donner|1991|p=208}} The classification of teachings was also done by other schools, such as the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Fivefold Classification]] of the [[Huayan school]].

===Five Periods===
The Five Periods are five periods in the life of the Buddha in which he delivered different teachings, aimed at different audiences with a different level of understanding:{{sfn|Hua|1977|p=52-53}}{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=1003}} 
# The Period of [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avatamsaka]]. During twenty-one days after his Enlightenment, the buddha delivered the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].
# The Period of Agamas. During twelve years, the Buddha preached the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] for the [[Hinayana]], including the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].
# The Period of Vaipulya. During eight years, the Buddha delivered the [[Mahayana]] teachings, such as the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]], the [[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]], the [[Golden Light Sutra|Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra]] and other Mahayana sutras.
# The Period of Prajna. During twenty-two years, the Buddha explained [[Sunyata|emptiness]] in the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]].
# The Period of Saddharmapundarika and Nirvana Sutra. In the last eight years, the  Buddha preached the doctrine of the [[Ekayāna|One Buddha Vehicle]], and delivered the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Nirvana Sutra]] just before his death.

===Eight Teachings===
The Eight Teachings consist of the Four Doctrines, and the Fourfold Methods.{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=911}}{{sfn|Hua|1977|p=52-53}}

====Four Doctrines====
# Tripitaka Teaching: the [[Tripitaka|Sutra]], [[Vinaya]] and [[Abhidhamma]], in which the basic teachings are explained
# Shared Teaching: the teaching of emptiness
# Distinctive Teaching: aimed at the Bodhisattva
# Perfect Teaching - the Chinese teachings of the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra

====Fourfold Methods====
# Gradual Teaching, for those with medium or inferior abilities
# Sudden Teaching, the Distinctive Teachings and the Complete Teaching for those with superior abilities
# Secret Teaching, teachings which are transmitted without the recipient being aware of it
# Variable Teaching, no fixed teaching, but various teachings for various persons and circumstances

==Teachings==
{{See also|Ten suchnesses}}

[[David W. Chappell|David Chappell]] lists the most important teachings as the doctrines of:
* The Threefold Truth, 
* The Threefold Contemplation,  
* The Fourfold Teachings, 
* The Subtle Dharma, 
* The Nonconceivable Discernment.{{sfn|Chappell|1987|p=247-266}}

[[Nan Huai-Chin]], a 20th-century [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] teacher, summarizes the main teaching of the Tiantai school as the following: 
* The One Vehicle (Skt. ''[[Ekayāna]]''), 
* The vehicle of attaining [[Buddhahood]], as the main principle; 
* The three forms of [[samatha|śamatha]]-[[vipassanā|vipaśyanā]] correlated with the meditative perspectives of [[śūnyatā]], 
* The mean, as the method of cultivating realization.{{sfn|Huaijin|1997|p=91}}

===The Threefold Truth===
The Tiantai school took up the principle of The Threefold Truth, derived from Nāgārjuna: 
# Phenomena are empty of self-nature, 
# Phenomena exist provisionally from a worldly perspective, 
# Phenomena are both empty of existence and exist provisionally at once.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=162}}

The transient world of phenomena is thus seen as one with the unchanging, undifferentiated substratum of [[existence]]. This doctrine of interpenetration is reflected in the Tiantai teaching of three thousand realms in a single moment of thought.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=162}}

The Threefold Truth has its basis in [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]:
&lt;poem&gt;All things arise through causes and conditions.
That I declare as [[śūnyatā|emptiness]].
It is also a provisional designation.
It is also the meaning of the [[Middle Way|Middle Path]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/poem&gt;

===Three Contemplations===
While the Three Truths are essentially one, they may be recognized separately as one undertakes the Three Contemplations:
# The first contemplation involves moving from the world of provisionality to the world of śūnyatā. 
# The second contemplation is moving back from the world of emptiness to the world of provisionality with an acceptance thereof. 
# The third contemplation involves balancing the previous two by following the Middle Path.

===The Fourfold Teachings===
The Three Contemplations and Threefold Truth in turn form the basis of the Fourfold Teachings, making them "parallel structures".{{sfn|Chappell|1987|p=247-266}}

==Meditation-practice==
According to [[Charles Luk]], in China it has been traditionally held that the meditation methods of the Tiantai are the most systematic and comprehensive of all.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=110}} Tiantai emphasizes [[Samatha|śamatha]] and [[Vipassanā|vipaśyanā]] meditation.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=155}}

Regarding the functions of śamatha and vipaśyanā in meditation, Zhiyi writes in his work ''Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā'':
{{quote|The attainment of Nirvāṇa is realizable by many methods whose essentials do not go beyond the practice of śamatha and vipaśyanā. Śamatha is the first step to untie all bonds and vipaśyanā is essential to root out delusion. Śamatha provides nourishment for the preservation of the knowing mind, and vipaśyanā is the skillful art of promoting spiritual understanding. Śamatha is the unsurpassed cause of samādhi, while vipaśyanā begets wisdom.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=111}}}}

In Zhiyi's magnum opus, the "[[Mohe Zhiguan|Great Samatha-Vipasyana]]", he outlined his meditation system as consisting of 25 preparatory practices, 4 kinds of samadhi and ten modes of contemplation. Zhiyi saw the four samadhis as the main pillar of Tiantai meditation practice. Zhiyi writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now if you wish to ascend to the stage of wondrous realization, you will not be able to reach it unless you practice. But if you become skilled at stirring and agitating [the raw milk], then the essence of ghee may be obtained. The Lotus Sutra says, "I also see the sons of Buddha cultivating all manner of practices in order to seek the path to Buddhahood." There are many methods of practice, but we may summarize them under four sorts: (I) constantly sitting, (2) constantly walking, (3) part walking part sitting, and (4) neither walking nor sitting. By referring to them collectively as "samadhis," we mean [that one thereby] attunes, rectifies, and stabilizes [the mind]. The Ta-[chih-tu]lun ("Great [Perfection of Wisdom] Treatise") says, "Skillfully to fix the mind on one spot and abide there without shifting-that is called samadhi."" The Dharmadhatu is a "single spot," and through true discernment you can abide there and never stray from it. These four types of activity constitute the supporting condition [for meditation]. By discerning the mind and resorting to the supporting condition [of the four activities], one attunes and rectifies [the mind]. For this reason we call them samadhis."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Peter N. Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism, page 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Tiantai school also places a great emphasis on [[Anapanasati|Mindfulness of Breathing]] (Skt. ''{{IAST|ānāpānasmṛti}}'') in accordance with the principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā. Zhiyi classifies breathing into four main categories: Panting (喘), Unhurried breathing (風), Deep and quiet breathing (氣), and Stillness or rest (息). Zhiyi holds that the first three kinds of breathing are incorrect, while the fourth is correct, and that the breathing should reach stillness and rest.{{sfn|Luk|1964|p=125}}

==Influence==
[[David W. Chappell|David Chappell]] writes that although the Tiantai school, "has the reputation of being...the most comprehensive and diversified school of Chinese Buddhism, it is almost unknown in the West" despite having a "religious framework that seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism". He attributes this failure of expansion to the school having "narrowed its practice to a small number of rituals" and because it has "neglected the intellectual breadth and subtlety of its founder".{{sfn|Chappell|1987|p=247-266}}

*According to Islamic tradition, during one such occasion while he was in contemplation, the archangel [[Gabriel]] appeared before him in the year 610 CE and said, ‘Recite’, upon which he replied, ‘I am unable to recite’. Thereupon the angel caught hold of him and embraced him heavily. This happened two more time after which the angel commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses:&lt;ref name="Brown 2003, pp. 72–73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sell 1913, p. 29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bukhari"/&gt;"Proclaim!

| 
*[[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is considered the first Muslim convert. The early historian [[Ibn Ishaq]] and Tabari puts [[Ali]] Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law as the first male convert; [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] presents three candidates, and does not decide between them.&lt;ref name="Muhammad in Mecca"/&gt;
*One account in Tabari says that the first male convert was [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], a freed slave who had become Muhammad's adopted son. It is known that Ali was indeed the first person to convert to Islam, however some dispute this arguing he was only 12 years old at the time he embraced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Watt 1953, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

*With [[Abu Jahl]] instigating, Umayyah tied Bilal up and had him dragged around [[Mecca]] as a means to break Bilal's faith.&lt;ref name="Insider's Guide to Islam"/&gt; Frustrated upon Bilal's refusal to denounce Islam, Umayyah became even more angry. He ordered that Bilal's limbs were to be stretched out and tied to stakes lying flat on desert sand, so that he could feel the intensity of the sun and the Arabian heat. He would be whipped and beaten while tied to the stakes. Constantly refusing to denounce Islam, Umayyah became frustrated and ordered that a large boulder/stone be placed on Bilal's chest. The boulder heated by the sun burned Bilal's body while also crushing him.&lt;ref name="Insider's Guide to Islam"/&gt;
*After such punishments, news of this slave reached some of Muhammad's companions who told Muhammad of the slave. Muhammad then sent Abu Bakr. Eventually, Abu Bakr negotiated a deal with Umayyah to purchase Bilal and emancipate him from slavery.&lt;ref name="Insider's Guide to Islam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Insider's Guide to Islam"/&gt;

*Converts to Islam came from nearly all [[Arab tribes]] present in Medina, such that by June of the subsequent year there were seventy-five Muslims coming to Mecca for pilgrimage and to meet [[Muhammad]]. Meeting him secretly by night, the group made what was known as the "''Second Pledge of al-`Aqaba''", or "The Second Pledge of Mount Aqabah" where the pledge was made. It has been described by both Orientalists and Muslim scholars as "''Pledge of War''".&lt;ref name = "watt83"&gt;Watt (1974) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watt, p. 138"&gt;Watt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yWYH0mHo2AwC&amp;pg=PA138 Muhammad in Mecca], p. 138, {{ISBN|0887067077}}.

*According to ''[[Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum]]'' (The Sealed Nectar), a modern [[Islam]]ic [[hagiography]] of Muhammad written by the Indian Muslim author Safi ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Muhammad ordered the first caravan raid led by [[Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]] (Muhammad's uncle) seven to nine months after the Hijra. A party of thirty to forty men assembled at the seacoast near al-Is, between Mecca and Medina, where [[Amr ibn Hishām]] (Abu Jahl), the leader of the caravan was camping with three hundred Meccan riders.&lt;ref name="Dr. Mosab"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawarey|first=[http://mosab.hawarey.org/ Dr. Mosab]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJVqNwAACAAJ&amp;dq=9789957051648|isbn=9789957051648|title=The Journey of Prophecy; Days of Peace and War (Arabic)|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|year=2010}}Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available [https://www.webcitation.org/5zLhjeYyz?url=http://military.hawarey.org/military_english.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri p. 147"&gt;Mubarakpuri, When the Moon Split, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haykal 1976"&gt;{{citation|title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&amp;printsec=frontcover| first=Husayn |last=Haykal|year=1976|publisher=Islamic Book Trust |isbn=978-983-9154-17-7|pages=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*It is mentioned in [[Ibn Hisham]] and [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s biography of Muhammad (the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad from the 7th century), that for these caravan raids Muhammad gave permission to "plunder" the caravans of theirs enemies and seize their goods and property(s) and said: "Go forth against this caravan; it may be that Allah will grant you plunder"&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;ʻAbd al-Malik Ibn Hishām, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=78kvVKf-E47Waob9gJgP&amp;id=LOQPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=plunder+caravan+muhammad&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plunder The life of Muhammad, Apostle of Allah], p. 95, Folio Society, 1964.

The '''Virgen de Cotoca''' (literal translation:  Virgin of Cotoca; figurative translation:  Our Lady of Cotoca; variant:  Blessed Virgin of Cotoco) is the patron saint for the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Department of Santa Cruz]], [[Bolivia]].  Her image is located in a [[shrine]] built in her honor and located in the [[Cotoca|City of Cotoca]] in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  The Virgin of Cotoca is [[Veneration of Mary|venerated]] by thousands of Bolivians who ask for her [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] for blessings and other petitions.

There is one [[feast day]] dedicated to the Virgin of Cotoca, but it is celebrated over the course of 8 days.  The celebration begins 8 December, which is also the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] celebrated by [[Roman Catholics]].  The celebration of the Virgin of Cotoca ends on 15 December.  Throughout the 8 days, but primarily on the first and 8th day, thousands of devoted Bolivians make [[pilgrimages]] to the shrine where the image is located in Cotoca.

==History==

===The legend===
The exact origin of the image of the Virgin of Cotoca is not entirely clear.  Popular imagination has converted the origin into various legends.  The most popular legend tells of two lumberman who, while attempting to cut down a tree, found a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary in the trunk of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;Sanabria Fernandez, Hernando, 2008 (In Spanish) ''Tradiciones, leyendas y casos de Santa Cruz de la Sierra'' [Traditions, legends and cases from Santa Cruz], Grupo Editorial La Hoguera:  Santa Cruz, Bolivia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virgen de Cotoca.JPG|thumb|Mural showing the legend of the first apparition of the Virgin of Cotoca, created by Germán Miguel García Miranda]]

The City of Cotoca, where the image is currently housed, most likely began as a village started by a small agricultural community.  Due to Cotoca’s geographical location, it has always been a regular stop for many travelers on their way from the nearby capital Santa Cruz to the Chiquitania territory in Bolivia and to the country of Brazil.  Up through well into the 19th century, the population of Cotoca primarily consisted of Afro-Bolivianos and [[mulattos]] who worked as slaves on the local sugar cane [[haciendas]].

The legend of the original apparition of the Virgin of Cotoca involves several runaway slaves.  This legend is well known due to the writer Aquiles Gomez.  In Gomez's writings, he relates that several slaves were unjustly accused by their patron of assassinating another hacienda owner.  The slaves escaped into the surrounding jungle to avoid their own death.  According to the legend, two of the slaves were looking for firewood when they suddenly came upon a majestic image of the Virgin Mary in the trunk of a tree.  The slaves were Christian and prayed fervently that the Virgin would intercede for them so as to establish their innocence of the crime.  The slaves carefully removed the trunk with the image and took it to Cotoca to show their patron in hopes that he would believe that they had not killed the man in question.  When the slaves arrived in Cotoca, they were greeted with the news that the actual killer had already confessed to the crime.  Remarkably, the confession is said to have occurred exactly the same day and hour that the slaves had come upon the image in the tree.

This event is considered to be the first of many [[miracles]] attributed to the Virgin of Cotoca.

In 1799, primarily due to the miracles said to be occurring because of the Virgin of Cotoca's intercession, the [[Catholic Church]] in Bolivia authorized the construction of a shrine to be built in her honor.  The first mass was celebrated at the shrine on December 15, 1800.

===The image===
The statue of the Virgin of Cotoca is of neatly carved wood polished in polychrome. She is covered with golden jewelry and crowned with a bejeweled crown. The image wears a white or sky-blue mantle with gold trim, emblazoned with the coat of arms of Bolivia and of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Archdiocese of Santa Cruz]], and holds a white [[scapular]] in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;http://amazoniabolivia.com/amazonia_bo.php?id_contenido=421&amp;opcion=detalle_des&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devotion===
Although it has undergone numerous renovations over time, the Shrine of the Virgin of Cotoca still exists in Cotoca and is currently cared for by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests.  Those making pilgrimages to the sanctuary usually do so on foot, beginning in the [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|City of Santa Cruz]] located approximately 20 kilometers outside of Cotoca.

[[Image:Yuki Shrine - giant Sugi.jpg|thumb|200 px|A classic ''yorishiro'': a giant tree]]
A {{nihongo|'''''yorishiro'''''|依り代・依代・憑り代・憑代}} in [[Shinto]] terminology is an object capable of attracting spirits called ''[[kami]]'', thus giving them a physical space to occupy&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; during religious ceremonies. ''Yorishiro'' are used during ceremonies to call the ''kami'' for worship.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt; The word itself literally means ''approach substitute''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; Once a ''yorishiro'' actually houses a ''kami'', it is called a ''[[shintai]]''. Ropes called ''[[shimenawa]]'' decorated with paper streamers called ''[[shide (Shinto)|shide]]'' often surround ''yorishiro'' to make their sacredness manifest. Persons can play the same role as a ''yorishiro'', and in that case are called {{nihongo|''yorimashi''|憑坐|lit. possessed person}} or {{nihongo|''kamigakari''|神懸り・神憑|lit. kami possession}}.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt;

To many (animists) they are the natural residence of spirits, ''kami'' in the case of Japan.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"&gt;Nakamaki (1983:65)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Yorishiro'' and their history are intimately connected with the birth of [[Shinto shrine]]s. Early Japanese did not have the notion of anthropomorphic deities, and felt the presence of spirits in nature and its phenomena.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"&gt;Tamura (2000:21)&lt;/ref&gt; Mountains, forests, rain, wind, lightning and sometimes animals were thought to be charged with spiritual power, and the material manifestations of this power were worshiped as ''kami'', entities closer in their essence to [[Polynesia]]n [[mana]]. Village councils sought the advice of ''kami'' and developed the ''yorishiro'', tools that attracted ''kami'' acting like a lightning rod.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; ''Yorishiro'' were conceived to attract the ''kami'' and then give them a physical space to occupy to make them accessible to human beings for ceremonies,&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; which is still their purpose today.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt; Village council sessions were held in a quiet spot in the mountains or in a forest near a great tree, rock or other natural object that served as a ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; These sacred places and their ''yorishiro'' gradually evolved into the shrines of today.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;  The very first buildings at shrines were certainly just huts built to house some ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;

A trace of this origin can be found in the term {{nihongo|''hokura''|神庫}}, literally meaning "deity storehouse", which evolved into ''[[hokora]]'' (also written with the character 神庫), one of the earliest words for a shrine.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; Most of the sacred objects we find today in shrines (trees, [[Yata no Kagami|mirrors]], [[Kusanagi|swords]], ''[[magatama]]'') were originally ''yorishiro'', and only later became ''kami'' themselves by association.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;

== Common ''yorishiro'' ==
[[Image:Meotoiwa.jpg|thumb|left|Two ''iwakura'': the [[Meoto Iwa]], the Husband-and-Wife Rocks]]
The most common ''yorishiro'' are swords, mirrors, ritual staffs decorated with paper streamers called ''[[gohei]]'', comma-shaped jewels called {{nihongo|''[[magatama]]''|勾玉 or 曲玉}}, large rocks ({{nihongo|''iwasaka''|岩境}} or {{nihongo|''iwakura''|磐座}}, and sacred trees.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt; ''Kami'' dwell often in unusually shaped rocks or trees, or in caves and earth mounds.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt;  ''Yorishiro'' can also be persons, and in that case they are called {{nihongo|''yorimashi''|憑坐}}.&lt;ref name="EoS"&gt;Okada, "Yorishiro"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trees ===
Because of Shinto's nature, ''yorishiro'' are often natural objects like trees. Significantly, in ancient Japanese texts the words 神社 ("shrine"; now normally read as ''jinja'') and 社 were sometimes read as ''yashiro'' ("sacred place"), but also sometimes read as ''mori'' ("grove"), reflecting the fact that the earliest shrines were simply sacred groves or forests where ''kami'' were present.&lt;ref name="BT43"&gt;Sonoda Minoru in ''Breen, Teeuwen'' (2000:43)&lt;/ref&gt; (Part of the reading disparity may have been due to the confusion between similar characters 社 and 杜.) Many shrines still have on their grounds one of the original great ''yorishiro'', a great tree surrounded by a sacred rope called {{nihongo|''[[shimenawa]]''|標縄・注連縄・七五三縄}}.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt; Now such trees have become divine by association, and no longer simply represent a ''kami''.&lt;ref name="Tamura20"/&gt;

Shinto altars called  ''himorogi'' are usually just square areas demarcated with ''sakaki'' (''[[Cleyera japonica]]'') at the corners supporting sacred border ropes (''shimenawa'').&lt;ref name="sugi"/&gt; A branch of ''sakaki'' at the center is erected as a ''yorishiro''.&lt;ref name="sugi"&gt;Sugiyama, "Himorogi"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iwakura ===
[[File:Maneki-neko-ja.jpg|thumb|150 px|A ''[[maneki-neko]]'' is supposed to attract the ''kami'' of luck]]Rock sects are also common. An ''iwakura'' is simply a rock formation where a ''kami'' is invited to descend, and is therefore holy ground.&lt;ref name="iwa"&gt;Sugiyama, "Iwakura"&lt;/ref&gt; With time, through a process of association, the ''iwakura'' itself can come to be considered divine.&lt;ref name="iwa"/&gt; Archeological research in Japan confirms these sects to be ancient.&lt;ref name="iwa"/&gt; In shrines, even today stones considered to be related to the shrine's ''kami'' are used to make food offerings to the ''kami''.&lt;ref name="iwa"/&gt;

=== Iwasaka ===
An ''iwasaka'' is a stone altar or mound erected as a ''yorishiro'' to call a ''kami'' for worship.&lt;ref name="iwas"/&gt; The concepts of ''iwasaka'' and ''iwakura'' are so close that some suggest the two words are in fact synonymous.&lt;ref name="iwas"&gt;Sugiyama, "Iwasaka"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Yorishiro'' in homes ===
''Yorishiro'' are, however, most numerous in people's homes.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with ''[[kadomatsu]]'', which are the ''yorishiro'' of the new year's ''kami''.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ikenobo.jp/english/about/history.html#his01&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kamifuda'', pieces of paper representing the ''kami'', are hung above the door.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; There are ''kami'' who dwell in the toilet (''benjō-gami'') and in the well (''suijin'').&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; The ''kamado-gami'' lives in the oven, and its function is to protect the house from fires.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; Other common ''yorishiro'' are the small altar called ''[[kamidana]]'' and the ''[[butsudan]]'', which is an altar for the dead.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; (''Butsudan'' were originally meant just for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] worship, but now often contain also [[spirit tablet]]s called ''ihai'', which are ''yorishiro'' used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors).&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt; In shops one often sees clay cats with a raised paw called ''[[maneki-neko]]'' or rake-like bamboo objects called ''kumade'' supposed to attract good business.&lt;ref name="nakamaki"/&gt;

'''Yule''' or '''Yuletide''' ("Yule time") is a festival observed by the historical [[Germanic peoples]]. Scholars have connected the celebration to the [[Wild Hunt]], the god [[Odin]], and the [[Paganism|pagan]] Anglo-Saxon {{lang|ang|[[Mōdraniht]]}}. It later underwent [[Christianised reformulation|Christianized reformulation]] resulting in the term [[Christmastide]].

Terms with an etymological equivalent to ''Yule'' are used in the [[Nordic countries]] for Christmas with its religious [[rite]]s, but also for the holidays of this season. Today Yule is also used to a lesser extent in the English-speaking world as a synonym for Christmas. Present-day Christmas customs and traditions such as the [[Yule log]], [[Yule Goat|Yule goat]], [[Christmas ham|Yule boar]], [[Wassailing|Yule singing]], and others stem from pagan Yule. Today the event is celebrated in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] and some other forms of [[Modern Paganism]].

==Etymology==
''Yule'' is the modern English representation of the [[Old English]] words ''{{lang|ang|ġéol}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|ġéohol}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|ġéola}}'' or ''ġéoli'', with the former indicating the 12-day festival of "Yule" (later: "[[Christmastide]]") and the latter indicating the month of "Yule", whereby ''{{lang|ang|ǽrra ġéola}}'' referred to the period before the Yule festival (December) and ''{{lang|ang|æftera ġéola}}'' referred to the period after Yule (January). Both words are thought to be derived from [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|jeχʷla-}}'', and are cognate with [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''{{lang|got|(fruma) jiuleis}}''; [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and Norwegian [[Nynorsk]] ''{{lang|is|jól}}'', jol, ''{{lang|is|ýlir}}''; [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Bokmål|Norwegian Bokmål]] ''{{lang|no|jul}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth &amp; Toller (1898:424); Hoad (1996:550); Orel (2003:205)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=jol&amp;ant_bokmaal=5&amp;ant_nynorsk=5&amp;nynorsk=+&amp;ordbok=begge|title=Bokmålsordboka {{!}} Nynorskordboka|website=ordbok.uib.no|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological pedigree of the word, however, remains uncertain, though numerous speculative attempts have been made to find [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] cognates outside the [[Germanic languages|Germanic group]], too.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of the proposed etymologies, see Orel (2003:205).&lt;/ref&gt; The noun ''Yuletide'' is first attested from around 1475.&lt;ref name="BARNHART-896"&gt;Barnhart (1995:896).&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is attested in an explicitly pre-Christian context primarily in Old Norse. Among many others (see [[List of names of Odin]]), the long-bearded god Odin bears the names ''{{lang|non|jólfaðr}}'' (Old Norse for "Yule father") and ''{{lang|non|jólnir}}'' ("the Yule one"). In plural (Old Norse ''{{lang|non|jólnar}}'', "the Yule ones") may refer to the Norse gods in general. In Old Norse poetry, the word is often employed as a synonym for 'feast', such as in the [[kenning]] ''{{lang|non|hugins jól}}'' (Old Norse "[[Huginn]]'s Yule" → "a raven's feast").&lt;ref name="GUDBRAND-VIGFUSSON-326"&gt;Guðbrandur Vigfússon (1874:326).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jolly'' may share the same etymology,&lt;ref name="Hoad67"&gt;T. F. Hoad, ''English Etymology'', Oxford University Press, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-19-283098-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but was borrowed from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|jolif}}'' (→ French ''{{lang|fr|joli}}''), itself from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|jól}}'' + Old French suffix ''{{lang|fro|-if}}'' (compare Old French ''{{lang|fro|aisif}}'' "easy", Modern French ''{{lang|fr|festif}}'' = ''{{lang|fr|fest}}'' "feast" + ''{{lang|fro|-if}}''). The word was first mentioned by the Anglo-Norman chronicler [[Geoffrey Gaimar]] in his ''{{lang|fro|[[Estoire des Engleis]]}}'', or "History of the English People", written between 1136–40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/joli Site CNTRL ; Etymology of ''joli''] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germanic paganism==
Yule is an indigenous [[List of winter festivals|midwinter festival]] celebrated by the [[Germanic peoples]]. The earliest references to it are in the form of month names, where the Yule-tide period lasts somewhere around two months in length, falling       along the end of the modern [[calendar year]] between what is now mid-November and early January.&lt;ref name="ORCHARD187"&gt;Orchard (1997:187).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attestations===
Yule is attested early in the history of the Germanic peoples; from the 4th-century [[Gothic language]] it appears in the month name ''{{lang|got|fruma jiuleis}}'', and, in the 8th century, the English historian [[Bede]] wrote that the [[Anglo-Saxon]] calendar included the months ''{{lang|ang|geola}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|giuli}}'' corresponding with either modern December or December and January.&lt;ref name="SIMEK379"&gt;Simek (2007:379).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Old Norse month name ''{{lang|non|ýlir}}'' is similarly attested, the [[Old Norse]] corpus also contains numerous references to an event by the Old Norse form of the name, ''{{lang|non|jól}}''. In chapter 55 of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''{{lang|non|[[Skáldskaparmál]]}}'', different names for the [[áss|gods]] are given. One of the names provided is "Yule-beings". A work by the [[skald]] {{lang|non|[[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]]}} that uses the term is then quoted, which reads "again we have produced Yule-being's feast [mead of poetry], our rulers' eulogy, like a bridge of masonry".&lt;ref name="FAULKES133"&gt;Faulkes (1995:133).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one of the numerous [[list of names of Odin|names of Odin]] is ''{{lang|non|Jólnir}}'', referring to the event.&lt;ref name="SIMEK180-181"&gt;Simek (2007:180–181).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Saga of Hákon the Good|Saga of {{lang|non|Hákon|nocat=y}} the Good]]'' credits [[Haakon the Good|King Haakon I of Norway]] with the [[Christianisation]] of [[Norway]] as well as rescheduling the date of Yule to coincide with Christian celebrations held at the time. The saga states that when Haakon arrived in Norway he was confirmed a Christian, but since the land was still altogether heathen and the people retained their pagan practices, Haakon hid his Christianity to receive the help of the "great chieftains". In time, Haakon had a law passed establishing that Yule celebrations were to take place at the same time as the Christians celebrated Christmas, "and at that time everyone was to have ale for the celebration with a measure of grain, or else pay fines, and had to keep the holiday while the ale lasted."&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER106"&gt;Hollander (2007:106).&lt;/ref&gt;

Yule had previously been celebrated for three nights from midwinter night, according to the saga. Haakon planned that when he had solidly established himself and held power over the whole country, he would then "have the gospel preached". According to the saga, the result was that his popularity caused many to allow themselves to be baptised, and some people stopped making sacrifices. Haakon spent most of this time in [[Trondheim]]. When Haakon believed that he wielded enough power, he requested a bishop and other priests from England, and they came to Norway. On their arrival, "Haakon made it known that he would have the gospel preached in the whole country." The saga continues, describing the different reactions of various regional [[thing (assembly)|things]].&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER106"/&gt;

A description of pagan Yule practices is provided (notes are Hollander's own):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was ancient custom that when sacrifice was to be made, all farmers were to come to the [[heathen temple]] and bring along with them the food they needed while the feast lasted. At this feast all were to take part of the drinking of ale. Also all kinds of livestock were killed in connection with it, horses also; and all the blood from them was called ''{{lang|non|hlaut}}'' [sacrificial blood], and ''{{lang|non|hlautbolli}}'', the vessel holding the blood; and ''{{lang|non|hlautteinar}}'', the sacrificial twigs [&amp;zwnj;[[aspergillum|aspergills]]&amp;zwnj;]. These were fashioned like sprinklers, and with them were to be smeared all over with blood the pedestals of the idols and also the walls of the temple within and without; and likewise the men present were to be sprinkled with blood. But the meat of the animals was to be boiled and served as food at the banquet. Fires were to be lighted in the middle of the temple floor, and kettles hung over them. The sacrificial beaker was to be borne around the fire, and he who made the feast and was chieftain, was to bless the beaker as well as all the sacrificial meat.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER107"&gt;Hollander (2007:107).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The narrative continues that toasts were to be drunk. The first toast was to be drunk to Odin "for victory and power to the king", the second to the gods {{lang|non|[[Njörðr]]}} and {{lang|non|[[Freyr]]}} "for good harvests and for peace", and thirdly a beaker was to be drunk to the king himself. In addition, toasts were drunk to the memory of departed kinsfolk. These were called ''{{lang|non|minni}}''.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER107"/&gt;

===Theories and interpretation===
Scholars have connected the month event and Yule time period to the [[Wild Hunt]] (a ghostly procession in the winter sky), the god Odin (who is attested in Germanic areas as leading the Wild Hunt and, as mentioned above, bears the name ''{{lang|non|Jólnir}}''), and increased supernatural activity, such as the aforementioned Wild Hunt and the increased activities of {{lang|non|[[draugr|draugar]]}}—undead beings who walk the earth.&lt;ref name="SIMEK-AND-ORCHARD"&gt;Simek (2007:180–181 and 379–380) and Orchard (1997:187).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|ang|[[Mōdraniht]]}}, an event focused on collective female beings attested by Bede as having occurred among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan Anglo-Saxons]] on what is now Christmas Eve, has been seen as further evidence of a fertility event during the Yule period.&lt;ref name="ORCHARD187"&gt;Orchard (1997:187).&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of Yule are generally held to have centred on [[winter solstice|Midwinter]] (although specific dating is a matter of debate), and feasting, drinking, and sacrifice (''{{lang|non|[[blót]]}}'') were involved. Scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] comments that the pagan Yule feast "had a pronounced religious character" and comments that "it is uncertain whether the Germanic Yule feast still had a function in the cult of the dead and in the veneration of the ancestors, a function which the mid-winter sacrifice certainly held for the West European [[Stone Age|Stone]] and [[Bronze Age]]s." The traditions of the [[Yule log]], [[Yule Goat|Yule goat]], Yule boar (''{{lang|non|[[Sonargöltr]]}}'') still reflected in the [[Christmas ham]], [[Wassailing|Yule singing]], and others stem from Yule customs, and customs which Simek says "indicates the significance of the feast in pre-Christian times."&lt;ref name="SIMEK-379-380"&gt;Simek (2007:379–380).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary traditions==
In modern Germanic language-speaking areas and some other Northern European countries, historical cognates to English ''yule'' denote the [[Christmas]] holiday season. Examples include ''{{lang|sv|jul}}'' [[Jul (Sweden)|in Sweden]], [[jul (Denmark)|in Denmark]] and [[jul (Norway)|in Norway]], ''{{lang|is|jól}}'' [[jól (Iceland)|in Iceland and the Faroe Islands]], ''{{lang|fi|joulu}}'' in Finland, ''{{lang|fy|Joelfest}}'' in Friesland, ''{{lang|nl|Joelfeest}}'' in the Netherlands and ''{{lang|et|jõulud}}'' in Estonia.

===Neopaganism===
As forms of [[Neopaganism]] can be quite different and have very different origins, these representations can vary considerably despite the shared name. Some celebrate in a way as close as possible to how they believe Ancient Germanic pagans observed the tradition, while others observe the holiday with rituals "assembled from different sources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |date=December 2008 |title=Modern Pagan Festivals: A Study in the Nature of Tradition |journal=Folklore |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=251–273 |jstor=40646468 |doi=10.1080/00155870802352178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germanic Neopagan sects, ''Yule'' is celebrated with gatherings that often involve a meal and gift giving. Groups such as the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] in the US recognise the celebration as lasting 12 days, beginning on the date of the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref name=AFA&gt;[http://www.runestone.org/flash/articles/12days2005.htm McNallen, Stephen ''The Twelve Days of Yule – 2005''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109081117/http://www.runestone.org/flash/articles/12days2005.htm |date=9 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most forms of [[Wicca]], this holiday is celebrated at the [[winter solstice]] as the rebirth of the [[Horned God|Great horned hunter god]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local.lancasteronline.com/4/213802 |title=Wiccans, pagans ready to celebrate Yule |accessdate=21 December 2007 |author=James Buescher |date=15 December 2007 |publisher=Lancaster Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229225148/http://local.lancasteronline.com/4/213802 |archivedate=29 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is viewed as the newborn solstice sun. The method of gathering for this [[wheel of the Year#Eight festivals|sabbat]] varies by practitioner. Some have private ceremonies at home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5DA113FF932A15751C1A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Celebrations; It's Solstice, Hanukkah, Kwannza: Let There Be Light! |accessdate=21 December 2007 |author=Andrea Kannapell |date=21 December 1997 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others do so with their [[coven]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E3DD1E3EF930A25751C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Like Magic, Witchcraft Charms Teenagers |accessdate=21 December 2007 |quote=Generally meeting in covens, which anoint their own priests and priestesses, Wiccans chant and cast or draw circles to invoke their deities, mainly during festivals like Samhain and Yule, which coincide with Halloween and Christmas, and when the moon is full. |author=Ruth la Ferla |date=13 December 2000 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
