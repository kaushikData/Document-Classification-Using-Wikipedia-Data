The '''2010 Central European floods''' were a devastating series of weather events which occurred across several Central European countries during May and June 2010. [[Poland]] was the worst affected. [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Ukraine]] were also affected.

At least thirty-seven people died in the floods and approximately 23,000 people were evacuated. The city of [[Kraków]] declared a state of emergency.

The floods forced the closure and relocation of items from the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|Auschwitz concentration camp museum]]. On 20 May, aid began arriving to Poland from several [[European Union]] countries.

The '''7AK7''' is a [[pentode]]  [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve).  According to its manufacturer, [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], it was "designed for service in electronic computers".&lt;ref&gt;
Sylvania. [http://www.nj7p.org/Tubes/PDFs/Frank/137-Sylvania/7AK7.pdf Engineering Data Service. 7AK7]. July 1953. (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/6hLZjuBJs)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tube was developed in 1948,&lt;ref name="Green2010"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tom |last1=Green|title=Bright Boys: The Making of Information Technology|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|page=141|isbn=1568814763}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed at the request of L.

Significant attention was directed towards its manufacturing process in order to ensure the part's
reliability.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Achema''' is the largest fertilizer producer in the [[Baltic states]]. It is located in the city of [[Jonava]] in central [[Lithuania]]. In 2011 Achema employed about 1700 workers and reached 2.2 billion Litas revenues (about 640 million Euros), net profit was 96.3 million Litas (27.9 million Euros). The current managing director is Arūnas Laurinaitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://verslas.delfi.lt/business/paveldetojai-ir-akcininkai-sutare-achemos-grupei-vadovaus-alaurinaitis.d?id=51185889|title=The Shareholders agreed on the succeeding Achema Group CEO |publisher=Delfi.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The factory construction began in 1962 as one of the state-owned enterprises of the [[Lithuanian SSR]].

== Environmental catastrophe ==
An explosion occurred in the chemical fertilizers factory on 20 March 1989, causing a leak of nearly 7,500 tonnes of [[liquid ammonia]]. The catastrophe developed further into a fire of [[nitrophoska]] and [[fertilizer]]s storehouses polluting the atmosphere with products of their [[decomposition]]: [[nitrous oxide]], [[chlorine gas]], etc. The toxic cloud moved towards [[Ukmergė]], [[Širvintos]], [[Kėdainiai]]. The concentration of ammonia surpassed the [[permissible exposure limit|permissible level]] 150 times in [[Upninkai]], located 10&amp;nbsp;km from the enterprise. One day after the accident, a toxic cloud 7&amp;nbsp;km wide and 50&amp;nbsp;km long was recorded between Jonava and [[Kėdainiai]]. Seven people died during the fire and leakage of ammonia, 29 became handicapped, and more people suffered from acute respiratory and cardiac arrest.

== Sistematika department ==

The beginning of SC “Achema“ subdivision „Sistematika“ work is closely related to the history of SC “Achema“ when automation department was established back in 1964 at that time company “Azotas“. The department was growing together with the company, and in 1999 was reorganized into the subsidiary “Sistematika“ which activity was expanding together with the concern “Achema Group“.

| title = [[IUPAC]] definition

''Note 1'': Adhesion requires energy that can come from chemical and/or physical&lt;br/&gt;linkages, the latter being reversible when enough energy is applied.

''Note 2'': In biology, adhesion reflects the behavior of cells shortly after contact&lt;br/&gt;to the surface.

''Note 3'': In surgery, adhesion is used when two tissues fuse unexpectedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2012|volume=84|issue=2|pages=377–410|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2012/pdf/8402x0377.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adhesion''' is the tendency of dissimilar particles or [[interface (matter)|surface]]s to cling to one another ([[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] refers to the tendency of similar or identical particles/surfaces to cling to one another). The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types. The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion. In addition to the cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are also certain emergent mechanical effects.

'''D''': W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + W&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; – W&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; – W&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

[[Surface energy]] is conventionally defined as the [[work (physics)|work]] that is required to build an area of a particular surface. Another way to view the surface energy is to relate it to the work required to cleave a bulk sample, creating two surfaces. If the new surfaces are identical, the surface energy γ of each surface is equal to half the work of cleavage, W: γ = (1/2)W&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the surfaces are unequal, the [[Young-Dupre equation|Young-Dupré equation]] applies:
W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, where γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the surface energies of the two new surfaces, and γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the interfacial energy.

This methodology can also be used to discuss [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]] that happens in another medium: γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2)W&lt;sub&gt;121&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2)W&lt;sub&gt;212&lt;/sub&gt;. These two energy quantities refer to the energy that is needed to cleave one species into two pieces while it is contained in a medium of the other species. Likewise for a three species system: γ&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; – γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + W&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; – W&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; – W&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;, where W&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of cleaving species 1 from species 2 in a medium of species 3.&lt;ref name=Israelachveli/&gt;

A basic understanding of the terminology of cleavage energy, surface energy, and [[surface tension]] is very helpful for understanding the physical state and the events that happen at a given surface, but as discussed below, the theory of these variables also yields some interesting effects that concern the practicality of adhesive surfaces in relation to their surroundings.&lt;ref name=Israelachveli&gt;J. N. Israelachvili, ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'' (Academic Press, New York, 1985). chap. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
There is no single theory covering adhesion, and particular mechanisms are specific to particular material scenarios.
Five mechanisms of adhesion have been proposed to explain why one material sticks to another:

===Mechanical===
Adhesive materials fill the voids or pores of the surfaces and hold surfaces together by interlocking. Other interlocking phenomena are observed on different length scales. Sewing is an example of two materials forming a large scale mechanical bond, [[velcro]] forms one on a medium scale, and some textile adhesives (glue) form one at a small scale.

===Chemical===
Two materials may form a [[Chemical compound|compound]] at the joint. The strongest joints are where atoms of the two materials share or swap electrons (known respectively as [[ionic bonding]] or [[covalent bonding]], respectively). A weaker bond is formed if a [[hydrogen]] atom in one molecule is attracted to an atom of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], or [[fluorine]] in another molecule, a phenomenon called [[hydrogen bonding]].

Chemical adhesion occurs when the surface atoms of two separate surfaces form [[ionic bond|ionic]], [[covalent bond|covalent]], or [[hydrogen bond]]s. The engineering principle behind chemical adhesion in this sense is fairly straightforward: if surface molecules can bond, then the surfaces will be bonded together by a network of these bonds. It bears mentioning that these attractive ionic and covalent forces are effective over only very small distances – less than a nanometer. This means in general not only that surfaces with the potential for chemical bonding need to be brought very close together, but also that these bonds are fairly brittle, since the surfaces then need to be kept close together.&lt;ref name=Kendall&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. Kendall|title=Adhesion: Molecules and Mechanics|pmid=17795378|year=1994|volume=263|issue=5154|pages=1720–5|doi=10.1126/science.263.5154.1720|journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispersive===
{{Main|Dispersive adhesion}}

In dispersive adhesion, also known as [[physisorption]], two materials are held together by [[van der Waals force]]s: the attraction between two molecules, each of which has a region of slight positive and negative charge. In the simple case, such molecules are therefore polar with respect to average charge density, although in larger or more complex molecules, there may be multiple "poles" or regions of greater positive or negative charge. These positive and negative poles may be a permanent property of a molecule ([[Keesom force]]s) or a transient effect which can occur in any molecule, as the random movement of electrons within the molecules may result in a temporary concentration of electrons in one region ([[London forces]]).

[[File:Drops I.jpg|thumb|Cohesion causes water to form [[Drop (liquid)|drops]], surface tension causes them to be nearly spherical, and adhesion keeps the drops in place.]]
[[File:Hibiscus pink.jpg|thumb|Water droplets are flatter on a [[Hibiscus]] flower which shows better adhesion.]]

In surface science, the term ''adhesion'' almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as a drop of liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the [[contact angle]] is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a [[Centrifugal Adhesion Balance]] allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the lower contact angle corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in a high degree of [[wetting]], a lyophilic condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in lyophobic conditions with high measured contact angles and poor wetting.

[[London dispersion]] forces are particularly useful for the function of adhesive devices, because they don't require either surface to have any permanent [[Polarizability|polarity]]. They were described in the 1930s by [[Fritz London]], and have been observed by many researchers. [[London dispersion force|Dispersive force]]s are a consequence of statistical [[quantum mechanics]]. London theorized that attractive forces between molecules that cannot be explained by ionic or covalent interaction can be caused by [[polar moment]]s within molecules. [[Multipole]]s could account for attraction between molecules having permanent multipole moments that participate in [[electrostatic interaction]]. However, experimental data showed that many of the compounds observed to experience van der Waals forces had no multipoles at all. London suggested that momentary dipoles are induced purely by virtue of molecules being in proximity to one another. By solving the quantum mechanical system of two electrons as [[harmonic oscillator]]s at some finite distance from one another, being displaced about their respective rest positions and interacting with each other's fields, London showed that the energy of this system is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E = 3 h \nu - \frac{3}{4} \frac{h \nu \alpha^2}{R^6}&lt;/math&gt;

While the first term is simply the [[zero-point energy]], the negative second term describes an attractive force between neighboring oscillators. The same argument can also be extended to a large number of coupled oscillators, and thus skirts issues that would negate the large scale attractive effects of permanent dipoles cancelling through symmetry, in particular.

The additive nature of the dispersion effect has another useful consequence. Consider a single such dispersive [[dipole]], referred to as the origin dipole. Since any origin dipole is inherently oriented so as to be attracted to the adjacent dipoles it induces, while the other, more distant dipoles are not correlated with the original dipole by any phase relation (thus on average contributing nothing), there is a net attractive force in a bulk of such particles. When considering identical particles, this is called cohesive force.&lt;ref name=London&gt;F. London, "The General Theory of Molecular Forces" (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing adhesion, this theory needs to be converted into terms relating to surfaces. If there is a net attractive energy of cohesion in a bulk of similar molecules, then cleaving this bulk to produce two surfaces will yield surfaces with a dispersive surface energy, since the form of the energy remain the same. This theory provides a basis for the existence of van der Waals forces at the surface, which exist between any molecules having [[electrons]]. These forces are easily observed through the spontaneous jumping of smooth surfaces into [[Contact mechanics|contact]]. Smooth surfaces of mica, gold, various polymers and solid gelatin solutions do not stay apart when their separating becomes small enough – on the order of 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm. The equation describing these attractions was predicted in the 1930s by De Boer and Hamaker:&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{area} = -\frac{A}{24 \pi z^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the force (negative for attraction), z is the separation distance, and A is a material-specific constant called the [[Hamaker constant]].

[[File:Roofcollapse.jpg|thumb|left|The two stages of PDMS microstructure collapse due to van der Waals attractions. The PDMS stamp is indicated by the hatched region, and the substrate is indicated by the shaded region. A) The PDMS stamp is placed on a substrate with the "roof" elevated. B) Van der Waals attractions make roof collapse energetically favorable for PDMS stamp.]]

The effect is also apparent in experiments where a [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) stamp is made with small periodic post structures. The surface with the posts is placed face down on a smooth surface, such that the surface area in between each post is elevated above the smooth surface, like a roof supported by columns. Because of these attractive dispersive forces between the PDMS and the smooth substrate, the elevated surface – or “roof” – collapses down onto the substrate without any external force aside from the van der Waals attraction.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rogers.matse.illinois.edu/files/2005/sagginglangmuir.pdf|author=Y. Y. Huang|title=Stamp Collapse in Soft Lithography|doi=10.1021/la0502185|year=2005|last2=Zhou|first2=Weixing|last3=Hsia|first3=K. J.|last4=Menard|first4=Etienne|last5=Park|first5=Jang-Ung|last6=Rogers|first6=John A.|last7=Alleyne|first7=Andrew G.|journal=Langmuir|volume=21|issue=17|pages=8058–68|pmid=16089420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple smooth [[polymer]] surfaces – without any [[microstructure]]s – are commonly used for these dispersive adhesive properties. [[Decal]]s and stickers that adhere to glass without using any chemical adhesives are fairly common as toys and decorations and useful as removable labels because they do not rapidly lose their adhesive properties, as do [[sticky tape]]s that use adhesive chemical compounds.

It is important to note that these forces also act over very small distances – 99% of the work necessary to break van der Waals bonds is done once surfaces are pulled more than a nanometer apart.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt; As a result of this limited motion in both the van der Waals and ionic/covalent bonding situations, practical effectiveness of adhesion due to either or both of these interactions leaves much to be desired. Once a crack is initiated, it propagates easily along the interface because of the [[brittle]] nature of the interfacial bonds.&lt;ref name=Newby&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~mkc4/our%20papers/Bimin_slippage_science.pdf|author= Bi-min Zhang Newby, Manoj K. Chaudhury and Hugh R. Brown|title=Macroscopic Evidence of the Effect of Interfacial Slippage on Adhesion|doi=10.1126/science.269.5229.1407|year=1995|journal=Science|volume=269|issue=5229|pages=1407–9|pmid=17731150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an additional consequence, increasing surface area often does little to enhance the strength of the adhesion in this situation. This follows from the aforementioned crack failure – the stress at the interface is not uniformly distributed, but rather concentrated at the area of failure.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

===Electrostatic===
Some conducting materials may pass electrons to form a difference in [[electrical charge]] at the joint. This results in a structure similar to a [[capacitor]] and creates an attractive [[electrostatic]] force between the materials.

===Diffusive===
Some materials may merge at the joint by [[Atomic diffusion|diffusion]]. This may occur when the molecules of both materials are mobile and [[soluble]] in each other. This would be particularly effective with polymer chains where one end of the molecule diffuses into the other material. It is also the mechanism involved in [[sintering]]. When [[metal]] or [[ceramic]] powders are pressed together and heated, atoms diffuse from one particle to the next. This joins the particles into one.

[[File:Interdigitation.jpg|thumb|The interface is indicated by the dotted line. A) Non-crosslinked polymers are somewhat free to diffuse across the interface. One loop and two distal tails are seen diffusing. B) Crosslinked polymers not free enough to diffuse. C) "Scissed" polymers very free, with many tails extending across the interface.]]
Diffusive forces are somewhat like mechanical tethering at the molecular level. Diffusive bonding occurs when species from one surface penetrate into an adjacent surface while still being bound to the phase of their surface of origin. One instructive example is that of polymer-on-polymer surfaces. Diffusive bonding in polymer-on-polymer surfaces is the result of sections of polymer chains from one surface interdigitating with those of an adjacent surface. The freedom of movement of the polymers has a strong effect on their ability to interdigitate, and hence, on diffusive bonding. For example, cross-linked polymers are less capable of diffusion and [[interdigitation]] because they are bonded together at many points of contact, and are not free to twist into the adjacent surface. Un[[crosslinked]] [[polymers]] ([[thermoplastics]]), on the other hand are freer to wander into the adjacent phase by extending tails and loops across the interface.

Another circumstance under which diffusive bonding occurs is “scission”. [[Chain scission]] is the cutting up of polymer chains, resulting in a higher concentration of [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] tails. The heightened concentration of these chain ends gives rise to a heightened concentration of polymer tails extending across the interface. Scission is easily achieved by [[ultraviolet]] irradiation in the presence of oxygen gas, which suggests that adhesive devices employing diffusive bonding actually benefit from prolonged exposure to heat/light and air. The longer such a device is exposed to these conditions, the more tails are scissed and branch out across the interface.

Once across the interface, the tails and loops form whatever bonds are favorable. In the case of polymer-on-polymer surfaces, this means more van der Waals forces. While these may be brittle, they are quite strong when a large network of these bonds is formed. The outermost layer of each surface plays a crucial role in the adhesive properties of such interfaces, as even a tiny amount of interdigitation – as little as one or two tails of 1.25 angstrom length – can increase the van der Waals bonds by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref name=Maeda&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12130780|author=N.

==Strength==
The strength of the adhesion between two materials depends on which of the above mechanisms occur between the two materials, and the surface area over which the two materials contact. Materials that wet against each other tend to have a larger contact area than those that do not. Wetting depends on the surface energy of the materials.

Low surface energy materials such as [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] and [[polyoxymethylene]] are difficult to bond without special surface preparation.

Another factor determining the strength of an adhesive contact is its shape. Adhesive contacts of complex shape begin to detach at the "edges" of the contact area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Valentin L.|last2=Pohrt|first2=Roman|last3=Li|first3=Qiang|date=2017-09-01|title=Strength of adhesive contacts: Influence of contact geometry and material gradients|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=308–325|doi=10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|issn=2223-7690}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The process of destruction of adhesive contacts can be seen in the film&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Friction Physics|title=Science friction: Adhesion of complex shapes|date=2017-12-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV2W91d8vwQ|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other effects==
In concert with the primary surface forces described above, there are several circumstantial effects in play. While the forces themselves each contribute to the magnitude of the adhesion between the surfaces, the following play a crucial role in the overall strength and reliability of an adhesive device.

===Stringing===
[[File:Fingering.jpg|thumb|Fingering process. The hatched area is the receiving substrate, the dotted strip is the tape, and the shaded area in between is the adhesive chemical layer. The arrow indicates the direction of propagation for the fracture.]]

[[Stringing]] is perhaps the most crucial of these effects, and is often seen on adhesive tapes. Stringing occurs when a separation of two surfaces is beginning and molecules at the interface bridge out across the gap, rather than cracking like the interface itself. The most significant consequence of this effect is the restraint of the crack. By providing the otherwise brittle interfacial bonds with some flexibility, the molecules that are stringing across the gap can stop the crack from propagating.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt; Another way to understand this phenomenon is by comparing it to the [[stress concentration]] at the point of failure mentioned earlier. Since the stress is now spread out over some area, the stress at any given point has less of a chance of overwhelming the total adhesive force between the surfaces. If failure does occur at an interface containing a [[viscoelastic]] adhesive agent, and a crack does propagate, it happens by a gradual process called “fingering”, rather than a rapid, brittle fracture.&lt;ref name=Newby/&gt;
Stringing can apply to both the diffusive bonding regime and the chemical bonding regime. The strings of molecules bridging across the gap would either be the molecules that had earlier diffused across the interface or the viscoelastic adhesive, provided that there was a significant volume of it at the interface.

===Microstructures===
Technologically advanced adhesive devices sometimes make use of microstructures on surfaces, such as the periodic posts described above. These are [[biomimetic]] technologies inspired by the adhesive abilities of the feet of various [[arthropod]]s and [[vertebrate]]s (most notably, [[gecko]]s). By intermixing periodic breaks into smooth, adhesive surfaces, the interface acquires valuable crack-arresting properties. Because crack initiation requires much greater stress than does crack propagation, surfaces like these are much harder to separate, as a new crack has to be restarted every time the next individual microstructure is reached.&lt;ref name=Majmuder&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Majmuder|title=Microfluidic Adhesion Induced by Subsurface Microstructures|doi=10.1126/science.1145839|year=2007|last2=Ghatak|first2=A.|last3=Sharma|first3=A.|journal=Science|volume=318|issue=5848|pages=258–61|pmid=17932295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hysteresis===
[[Hysteresis]], in this case, refers to the restructuring of the adhesive interface over some period of time, with the result being that the work needed to separate two surfaces is greater than the work that was gained by bringing them together (W &gt; γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). For the most part, this is a phenomenon associated with diffusive bonding. The more time is given for a pair of surfaces exhibiting diffusive bonding to restructure, the more diffusion will occur, the stronger the adhesion will become. The aforementioned reaction of certain polymer-on-polymer surfaces to ultraviolet radiation and oxygen gas is an instance of hysteresis, but it will also happen over time without those factors.

In addition to being able to observe hysteresis by determining if W &gt; γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is true, one can also find evidence of it by performing “stop-start” measurements. In these experiments, two surfaces slide against one another continuously and occasionally stopped for some measured amount of time. Results from experiments on polymer-on-polymer surfaces show that if the stopping time is short enough, resumption of smooth sliding is easy. If, however, the stopping time exceeds some limit, there is an initial increase of resistance to motion, indicating that the stopping time was sufficient for the surfaces to restructure.&lt;ref name=Maeda/&gt;

===Wettability and adsorption===
Some atmospheric effects on the functionality of adhesive devices can be characterized by following the theory of surface energy and [[interfacial tension]]. It is known that γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2)W&lt;sub&gt;121&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2)W&lt;sub&gt;212&lt;/sub&gt;. If γ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is high, then each species finds it favorable to cohere while in contact with a foreign species, rather than dissociate and mix with the other. If this is true, then it follows that when the interfacial tension is high, the force of adhesion is weak, since each species does not find it favorable to bond to the other. The interfacial tension of a liquid and a solid is directly related to the liquids [[wettability]] (relative to the solid), and thus one can extrapolate that cohesion increases in non-wetting liquids and decreases in wetting liquids. One example that verifies this is [[dimethylsiloxane|polydimethyl siloxane]] rubber, which has a work of self-adhesion of 43.6 mJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in air, 74 mJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in water (a nonwetting liquid) and 6 mJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in methanol (a wetting liquid).

This argument can be extended to the idea that when a surface is in a medium with which binding is favorable, it will be less likely to adhere to another surface, since the medium is taking up the potential sites on the surface that would otherwise be available to adhere to another surface. Naturally this applies very strongly to wetting liquids, but also to gas molecules that could adsorb onto the surface in question, thereby occupying potential adhesion sites. This last point is actually fairly intuitive: Leaving an adhesive exposed to air too long gets it dirty, and its adhesive strength will decrease. This is observed in the experiment: when [[mica]] is cleaved in air, its cleavage energy, W&lt;sub&gt;121&lt;/sub&gt; or W&lt;sub&gt;mica/air/mica&lt;/sub&gt;, is smaller than the cleavage energy in vacuum, W&lt;sub&gt;mica/vac/mica&lt;/sub&gt;, by a factor of 13.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;

===Lateral adhesion===
Lateral adhesion is the adhesion associated with sliding one object on a substrate such as sliding a drop on a surface. When the two objects are solids, either with or without a liquid between them, the lateral adhesion is described as [[friction]]. However, the behavior of lateral adhesion between a drop and a surface is tribologically very different from friction between solids, and the naturally adhesive contact between a flat surface and a [[Drop (liquid)|liquid drop]] makes the lateral adhesion in this case, an individual field. Lateral adhesion can be measured using the [[centrifugal adhesion balance]] (CAB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadmor|first=Rafael|date=2009|title=Measurement of Lateral Adhesion Forces at the Interface between a Liquid Drop and a Substrate|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.266101|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=103|issue=26|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.103.266101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadmor|first=Rafael|last2=Das|first2=Ratul|last3=Gulec|first3=Semih|last4=Liu|first4=Jie|last5=E.

The '''Aliso Canyon Oil Field''' (also '''Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Field''', '''Aliso Canyon Underground Storage Facility''') is an oil field and natural gas storage facility in the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] in Los Angeles County, California, north of the [[Porter Ranch, Los Angeles|Porter Ranch]] neighborhood of the City of [[Los Angeles]].  Discovered in 1938 and quickly developed afterward, the field peaked as an oil producer in the 1950s, but has remained active since its discovery. One of its depleted oil and gas producing formations, the Sesnon-Frew zone, was converted into a gas storage reservoir in 1973 by the Southern California Gas Company, the gas utility servicing the southern half of California. This reservoir is the second-largest natural gas storage site in the western United States, with a capacity of over 86 billion cubic feet of [[natural gas]]. Currently it is one of four gas storage facilities owned by Southern California Gas, the others being the [[La Goleta Gas Field]] west of Santa Barbara, [[Honor Rancho Oil Field|Honor Rancho]] near Newhall, and Playa del Rey.

Oil production on the field continues from &lt;!--Termo 10, Crimson 4, SCG 18--&gt;32 active wells as of 2016. The gas storage reservoir is accessed through 115 gas injection wells, along with approximately 38 miles of pipeline internal to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-14-11-004/SCG-06_P__Baker_Testimony.pdf |title=Direct testimony of Phillip E.

==Geographic setting==
The field is on the southern slope of the Santa Susana Mountains, an east-west trending range dividing the [[San Fernando Valley]] on the south from the [[Santa Clarita Valley]] on the north-northeast. With some of its productive wells set at an elevation over 3,000 feet, it is one of the highest and most rugged oil fields in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/Summary_of_Operations/1959/Vol45No1.pdf |title=Aliso Canyon Oil Field |author=W.L. Ingram |publisher=California Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil and Gas |date=June 1959 |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |page=65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main entrance to the oil field is on Limekiln Canyon Trail where it intersects Sesnon Boulevard. Vehicles must pass a guard station and locked gate to enter.

Land uses in the vicinity of the field include industrial (for the oil and gas field itself), open space, parkland, and residential to the south. Areas to the west, north, and east in the Santa Susana Mountains have been identified as Significant Ecological Areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/Environment/info/ene/aliso_canyon/DEIR/Aliso_Draft_EIR_Vol1.pdf |author=Ecology and Environment, Inc. |title=Aliso Canyon Turbine Replacement Project, Draft Environmental Impact Report |date=April 2012 |publisher=State of California Public Utilities Commission |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |page=4.10–1 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Michael D. Antonovich Open Space Preserve abuts the field on the northeast, and numerous parks in Porter Ranch are adjacent on the south.&lt;ref&gt;Draft EIR, 4.10-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the field is on the south slope of the Santa Susana Mountains, drainage is to the south into the San Fernando Valley, with runoff into Mormon Canyon, Limekiln Canyon, and Aliso Canyon, which all flow into the [[Los Angeles River]], which then flows south through the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and out to the ocean at Long Beach.  Vegetation on the field includes a mix of native habitat types, including [[oak woodland]]s and [[coastal sage scrub|Venturan sage scrub]], as well as non-native grassland, with many disturbed areas around roads and drilling and production pads.  Climate in the area is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], with warm, almost rainless summers, and mild and rainy winters. Snow is rare although it can fall at the higher elevations.  Wildfires are common, particularly in the summer and fall, and some of the storage field was burned over in the October, 2008 14,000-acre [[Sesnon Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Draft EIR, 4.8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The Aliso Canyon field consists of multiple layers of oil and gas bearing sediments in a southeast-plunging [[anticline]] bounded on the north by the Santa Susana Fault Zone and on the west-northwest by the Frew Fault. These tectonic features have formed a structural trap keeping oil in place. The layered [[Tertiary]] sedimentary zones within the anticline resemble a layer-cake elevated on the northwest, with some of the layers containing oil and gas, and other impermeable layers between them, keeping them separate. Older [[Cretaceous]] sedimentary rocks have been forced over the top by motion along the Frew Fault.&lt;ref name="DOGGR24"&gt;{{cite web |title=California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I (1998), II (1992) and III (1982) |publisher=California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) |url=ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/publications/Datasheets/Dtasheet.pdf |date=1999 |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The uppermost stratigraphic unit containing oil is the [[Pliocene]]-age [[Pico Formation]], which contains the Aliso, Porter, and Upper, Middle, and Lower Del Aliso zones, from top to bottom, ranging in depth from about 4,500 to 8,000 feet.  Underneath the Pico is the Middle [[Miocene]] [[Modelo Formation]], and beneath that, bounded by an [[unconformity]], the Eocene-age [[Llajas Formation]]. Since these units are both permeable and in direct contact, they form a single productive zone, the Sesnon-Frew, the largest of the field's zones and the one used by SoCalGas for gas storage.  This unit has an average depth of about 9,000 feet, and averages about 160 feet thick.&lt;ref name="DOGGR25"&gt;DOGGR, 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath the Sesnon-Frew are marine sediments of Cretaceous age, not known to contain oil, and below that crystalline basement rocks of Cretaceous age or older.&lt;ref name="DOGGR24"/&gt;

==History and production==
[[File:AlisoCanyonDetail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of the Aliso Canyon field. Active oil wells are black dots; active gas injection wells are orange dots.]]
The Santa Susana Mountains are one of several [[anticline|anticlinal]] formations within the Ventura Basin, and as such have long been of interest to those looking for oil.&lt;ref&gt;Draft EIR, 4.6-2&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest oil well in California, and the oldest commercially viable oil well in the western United States, was at the [[Pico Canyon Oilfield|Pico Canyon Area]] of the Newhall Oil Field less than five miles northwest of the Aliso field boundary, also in the Santa Susana Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21427 |publisher=California Office of Historic Preservation |accessdate=January 20, 2016|title=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Paul Getty|J. Paul Getty's]] Tidewater Associated Oil Company drilled the discovery well for the Aliso field in 1938, finding oil in the Porter zone, 5,393 feet below ground surface.&lt;ref name="DOGGR25"/&gt; Other producing zones were discovered not long after, including Del Aliso zone in 1938, and the Sesnon-Frew zone in 1940.&lt;ref name="DOGGR25"/&gt; Several companies operated the field in the early years, including Tidewater, Standard Oil of California, Porter Sesnon et al., Porter Oil Co., Carlton Beal and Associates, and M.L. Orcutt.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, 67; plate II (following page 73)&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of 1959, there were 118 producing wells on the entire field, and over 32 million barrels of oil had been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in production, the Sesnon-Frew zone had been identified as having a strong gas cap, with some wells being completed in gas-only portions of the reservoir, needing to be deepenend. The overproduction of gas led to accusations of wasting, and litigation commenced with Standard Oil and Tidewater accusing Carlton Beal of wasting gas (lacking a modern pipeline transport system, natural gas at this time was not always retained for use – it was commonly flared or just vented to the atmosphere). The State Oil and Gas Supervisor ruled in favor of Standard and Tidewater and limited production on the Sesnon pool to reduce the waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

One enhanced recovery technique, [[water injection (oil production)|waterflooding]], was used on the field, beginning in 1976.&lt;ref name="DOGGR25"/&gt; The Del Aliso zone was produced this way as conventional oil production began to decline. In this method, water pumped up with oil is disposed by being pumped back into the same formation from which it came, restoring reservoir pressure and pushing the remaining reservoir fluid to other recovery wells, even though it becomes more and more diluted with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/w/waterflooding.aspx |title=waterflooding |work=Oilfield glossary |publisher=Schlumberger |accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburban developments of the San Fernando Valley began approaching the field after it had already been fully developed, with some of the first residential housing in Porter Ranch appearing in the 1960s, but the main buildout started in the 1970s. Development continued into the first decade of the 21st century, expanding into the foothills right up to the SoCalGas property line. Many of these projects were master-planned developments, including gated communities, in one of San Fernando Valley's most affluent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cd12.lacity.org/AboutCouncilDistrict12/Neighborhoods/PorterRanch/index.htm |title=Porter Ranch |work=Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitchell Englander |publisher=City of Los Angeles |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202064850/http://cd12.lacity.org/AboutCouncilDistrict12/Neighborhoods/PorterRanch/index.htm |archive-date=2016-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WindSwept&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/06/realestate/re-guide6 |title=Wind-swept but comfy on L.A.'s fringe - latimes |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=1999-01-24 |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to gas storage==

By the early 1970s the Sesnon zone was depleted of oil. As it was an enormous and structurally sound reservoir, with an average depth of about 9,000 feet, and centrally located in the distribution area of Pacific Lighting (an ancestor of Southern California Gas Company), it was ideal to use as a storage reservoir for gas for the local utility. Pacific Lighting bought rights to that portion of the field from Getty's [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater]], and worked over the old oil production wells, many dating from 1940s and 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, PEB-3&lt;/ref&gt; to turn them into gas injection wells. The Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility, as this repurposed part of the oil field became known, became the largest gas storage reservoir owned by SoCalGas and the second largest in the western United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/los-angeles-gas-leak-idUSL1N14Q2H920160107 |publisher=Reuters |author=Alex Dobuzinskis |date=January 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |title=UPDATE 3-California governor declares LA-area gas leak an emergency }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage fields such as the four maintained by SoCalGas are necessary to balance the load between summer and winter months; gas can be withdrawn during the winter, when it is in high demand, and injected back into the reservoir during the warmer months. Aliso Canyon was ideally placed near the center of SoCalGas's service region, and connected to the system by an extensive pipeline network.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, PEB-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 SoCalGas proposed an expansion and upgrade of the storage facility involving replacement of the obsolete gas turbine compressors with more up-to-date electric versions. This project would increase the gas injection capacity of the site from 300 million to 450 million cubic feet per day, and remove the compressors which were installed in 1971 when the storage facility was first being developed. It would also move guard houses and some other structures, build a substation on the field, and upgrade various transmission and telecommunications lines. After environmental review through draft and final [[Environmental Impact Report]]s as required by the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA), the project was approved and construction began in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Draft EIR, ES-1 - ES-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnc.org/aliso-canyon-turbine-replacement-project-update |title=Aliso Canyon Turbine Replacement Project Update |publisher=Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council |date=June 5, 2015 |accessdate=January 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas wells on the site are old, and have required considerable maintenance in recent years. Of 229 storage wells on the site, half were more than 57 years old as of July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, PEB-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Casing, tubing, and wellhead leaks have occurred in recent years. For example, in 2013, two wells were found with casing leaks, four with tubing leaks, and two with leaks at the wellhead.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, PEB-19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, one well – "Porter 50A" – was found to have a gas pressure of 400 pounds per square inch on the surface [[annulus (oil well)|annulus]], an indication of a serious underground leak and potential safety hazard; this well was immediately removed from service, and on investigation corrosion was discovered along a 600-foot stretch of the production casing, ending more than 1000 feet below ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, PEB-18&lt;/ref&gt; SoCalGas designed a Storage Integrity Management Program to address these deficiences, along with a budget, and presented it to the State Public Utility Commission in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-14-11-004/SCG_2016_GRC_Application.pdf |title=General rate case application of Southern California Gas Company |publisher=California Public Utilities Commission |accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other oil companies continue to operate on the field, outside of the SoCalGas facility boundary: The Termo Company and Crimson Resource Management Corp. These companies produce oil from other, shallower zones than the Sesnon-Frew zone that SoCalGas uses for gas storage. The Termo Company proposed an expansion of their operation, adding another 12 wells to the 15 they already had at the end of 2015, but put their plans on hold after the [[Aliso Canyon gas leak|methane gas eruption]] from SoCalGas well Standard Sesnon 25 that began on October 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Champaign Williams |title=Termo postpones drilling in Aliso Canyon |date=January 8, 2016 |url=http://www.sfvbj.com/news/2016/jan/08/termo-postpones-drilling-aliso-canyon/ |work=San Fernando Valley Business Journal |accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015–2016 methane gas blowout==
{{main|Aliso Canyon gas leak}}
A dramatic break somewhere along the length of an 8,750-foot injection well casing resulted in a gigantic methane eruption from the field on October 23, 2015, spewing on the order of 60 million cubic feet of methane per day at first, before the pressure was reduced. The well, Standard Sesnon 25 ("SS 25") had originally been installed in 1953, and reworked as a gas injection well in 1973, but lacked a blowout prevention valve, as it had not been considered a priority given the well's position, at the time, far from a populated area.&lt;ref name=maddaus&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/what-went-wrong-at-porter-ranch-6405804| author=Maddaus G |title=What went wrong at Porter Ranch? |publisher=LA Weekly |date=December 22, 2015| accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallout from the methane cloud, in the form of oily droplets and persistent noxious odors, caused the evacuation of over 6,000 families, who have relocated to hotels and other rentals at SoCalGas's expense throughout the region.&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazzar&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailynews.com/environment-and-nature/20160207/socalgas-massive-relocation-effort-painfully-frustrating-for-some | title=SoCalGas' massive relocation effort 'painfully frustrating' for some | date=February 7, 2016 | first=Brenda | last=Gazzar | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 10,000 homes received air-purification systems at the company's expense.&lt;ref name=Gazzar/&gt; On Dec. 4, 2015, SoCalGas commenced drilling a relief well to stop the natural gas blowout by plugging the damaged well at its base.

In March 2016, Termo Company was fined $75,000 for piping in methane emissions from another natural gas leak in what the [[California Department of Conservation#Division of Oil.2C Gas.2C and Geothermal Resources .28DOGGR.29|Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources]] called a [http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/03/18/58697/during-porter-ranc-stealthy-oil-workers-hid-anothe/ "brazen and intentional violations of state law"].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/03/18/58697/during-porter-ranc-stealthy-oil-workers-hid-anothe/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pennenergy.com/articles/pennenergy/2016/03/oil-company-fined-75k-for-illegal-venting-in-gas-leak-zone.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2016, the [[California State Assembly]] passed a bill that would temporarily ban injection of additional natural gas into this storage facility, effectively shutting it down. [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] has already issued an executive order banning natural gas injection until all of the wells have been thoroughly tested for corrosion and leaks. The bill, known as Senate Bill 380, was introduced in the [[California State Senate]] by [[Fran Pavley]]. If the governor signs this bill,  it will extend the moratorium on gas injection, and require the state to consider permanently shutting down this gas storage facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reicher|first1=Mike|title=Aliso Canyon bill to temporarily ban gas injections passes hurdle in Sacramento|url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160428/aliso-canyon-bill-to-temporarily-ban-gas-injections-passes-hurdle-in-sacramento|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electromagnetism |Network}}

'''Alternating current''' ('''AC''') is an [[electric current]] which periodically reverses direction, in contrast to [[direct current]] ('''DC''') which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which [[electric power]] is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of [[electrical energy]] that consumers typically use when they plug [[kitchen appliance]]s, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a [[wall socket]]. A common source of DC power is a [[battery (electricity)|battery cell]] in a [[flashlight]]. The abbreviations ''AC'' and ''DC'' are often used to mean simply ''alternating'' and ''direct'', as when they modify ''[[Electric current|current]]'' or ''[[voltage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Basic Electronics &amp; Linear Circuits| author = N. N. Bhargava| author2 = D. C. Kulshreshtha| last-author-amp = yes| publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill Education| date = 1983| isbn = 978-0-07-451965-3| page = 90| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C5bt-oRuUzwC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Electrical meterman's handbook| author = National Electric Light Association| publisher = Trow Press| date = 1915 | page = 81| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEpWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual [[waveform]] of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a [[sine wave]], whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound (audio) or images (video) sometimes carried by [[modulation]] of an AC carrier signal. These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.

==Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply==

{{Main|Electric power transmission|Electric power distribution}}
[[File:Electric Transmission.png|thumb|265px|A schematic representation of long distance electric power transmission.  C=consumers, D=step down transformer, G=generator, I=current in the wires, Pe=power reaching the end of the transmission line, Pt=power entering the transmission line, Pw=power lost in the transmission line, R=total resistance in the wires, V=voltage at the beginning of the transmission line, U=step up transformer.]]

Electrical energy is distributed as alternating current because AC [[voltage]] may be increased or decreased with a [[transformer]]. This allows the power to be transmitted through [[power line]]s efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm w}&lt;/math&gt;) in the wire are a product of the square of the current (I) and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (R) of the wire, described by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm w} = I^2 R \, .&lt;/math&gt;
This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is halved (i.e. the voltage is doubled), the power loss will be four times less.

The power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm t} = IV \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, power transmitted at a higher voltage requires less loss-producing current than for the same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts, and transformed to 100&amp;nbsp;V – 240&amp;nbsp;V for domestic use.

[[File:Highvoltagetransmissionlines.jpg|thumb|right|265px|High voltage transmission lines deliver power from [[electric generation]] plants over long distances using alternating current. These lines are located in eastern [[Utah]].]]

High voltages have disadvantages, such as the increased insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a [[power plant]], energy is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a [[Electric generator|generator]], and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different [[mains power systems]] found in the world. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible in the early days of [[electric power transmission]], as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.

[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the generator [[stator]], physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° [[out of phase]] to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher "pole orders" are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600&amp;nbsp;rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600&amp;nbsp;rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the [[neutral point]]. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle [[Harmonic (electrical power)|harmonics]]. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.

For three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. [[Split-phase electric power|Three-wire single-phase]] systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55&amp;nbsp;V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of [[electric shock]] in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110&amp;nbsp;V between the two conductors for running the tools.

A [[Ground and neutral|third wire]], called the bond (or earth) wire, is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low [[electrical impedance]] path to ground sufficient to carry any [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.

==AC power supply frequencies==
{{further|Mains electricity by country}}

The [[Utility frequency|frequency of the electrical system]] varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz]]. Some countries have a mixture of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz supplies, notably [[Electricity sector in Japan#Transmission|electricity power transmission in Japan]]. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type [[traction motor]]s for applications such as [[railway]]s. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in [[arc lamp]]s and [[incandescent light bulb]]s. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25&amp;nbsp;Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz by the late 1950s, although some{{which|date=December 2011}} 25&amp;nbsp;Hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the 21st century. 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz power (formerly 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems were often powered by 400&amp;nbsp;Hz or 415&amp;nbsp;Hz for benefits of [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmweb.com/basics/basics-400-hz-power-systems The Basics of 400-Hz Power Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200&amp;nbsp;V (Japan), 208&amp;nbsp;V, 240&amp;nbsp;V (North America), 380&amp;nbsp;V, 400&amp;nbsp;V or 415&amp;nbsp;V (Europe), and variously 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.

==Effects at high frequencies==

{{main|Skin effect}}

[[File:22. Теслин трансформатор.ogv|thumb|left|280px|A [[Tesla coil]] producing high-frequency current that is harmless to humans, but  lights a [[fluorescent lamp]] when brought near it]]

A direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an [[electric charge]] in an alternating current produces [[electromagnetic waves|waves]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that cancel the propagation of electricity toward the center of materials with high [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. This phenomenon is called [[skin effect]]. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows ''in'' the wire, but effectively flows ''on'' the surface of the wire, within a thickness of a few [[skin depth]]s. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50&amp;nbsp;Hz – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57&amp;nbsp;mm at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to [[ohmic heating]] (also called I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R loss).

{{clear}}

===Techniques for reducing AC resistance===
For low to medium frequencies, conductors can be divided into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called [[Litz wire]]. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making [[Quality factor|high-Q]] [[inductor]]s, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher [[radio frequency]] current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode [[power supply|power supplies]] and [[radio frequency]] [[transformer]]s.

===Techniques for reducing radiation loss===
As written above, an alternating current is made of [[electric charge]] under periodic [[acceleration]], which causes [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] of [[electromagnetic waves]]. Energy that is radiated is lost. Depending on the frequency, different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation.

====Twisted pairs====
At frequencies up to about 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a [[twisted pair]]. This reduces losses from [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[inductive coupling]]. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.

====Coaxial cables====
[[Coaxial cable]]s are commonly used at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a [[dielectric]] layer. The current flowing on the surface of the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5&amp;nbsp;GHz. For [[microwave]] frequencies greater than 5&amp;nbsp;GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguides]] a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.

====Waveguides====
[[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|Waveguides]] are similar to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest difference being that the waveguide has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an [[electric current]], but rather by means of a ''guided'' [[electromagnetic field]]. Although [[Current density|surface currents]] do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the [[wavelength]] of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, [[electrical resistance]] of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause [[dissipation]] of power (surface currents flowing on lossy [[electrical conductor|conductors]] dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.

====Fiber optics====
At frequencies greater than 200&amp;nbsp;GHz, waveguide dimensions become impractically small, and the [[ohmic heating|ohmic losses]] in the waveguide walls become large. Instead, [[fibre optics|fiber optics]], which are a form of dielectric waveguides, can be used. For such frequencies, the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used.

[[File:Sine wave 2.svg|right|thumb|A sine wave, over one cycle (360°). The dashed line represents the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value at about 0.707]]
Alternating currents are accompanied (or caused) by alternating voltages. An AC voltage ''v'' can be described mathematically as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=V_\mathrm{peak}\cdot\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; is the peak voltage (unit: [[volt]]),
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] (unit: [[radians per second]])
**The angular frequency is related to the physical frequency, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; (unit = [[hertz]]), which represents the number of cycles per second, by the equation &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t&lt;/math&gt; is the time (unit: [[second]]).

The peak-to-peak value of an AC voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak. Since the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is +1 and the minimum value is −1, an AC voltage swings between &lt;math&gt;+V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;. The peak-to-peak voltage, usually written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm pp}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm P-P}&lt;/math&gt;, is therefore &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm peak} - (-V_{\rm peak}) = 2 V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Power===
{{main|AC power}}


The relationship between voltage and the power delivered is

:&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{v^2(t)}{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; represents a load resistance.

Rather than using instantaneous power, &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it is more practical to use a time averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles). Therefore, AC voltage is often expressed as a [[root mean square]] (RMS) value, written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt;, because
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm time~averaged} = \frac{{V_{\rm rms}}^2}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

;Power oscillation
:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=V_\mathrm{peak}\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{R}\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=v(t)\ i(t)=\frac{(V_\mathrm{peak})^2}{R} \sin^2(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Root mean square voltage{{anchor|Root mean square}}===
{{further|RMS amplitude}}
{{broader|Root mean square voltage}}

Below it is assumed an [[AC waveform]] (with no [[DC component]]).

The RMS voltage is the square '''R'''oot of the [[Mean of a function|'''M'''ean]] over one cycle of the '''S'''quare of the instantaneous voltage.

*For an arbitrary periodic waveform &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T}{[v(t)]^2 dt}}.&lt;/math&gt;

* For a sinusoidal voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
V_\mathrm{rms} &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \int_0^{T}[{V_{pk}\sin( \omega t+\phi)]^2 dt}}\\
               &amp;=V_{pk}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2T} \int_0^{T}[{1-\cos(2\omega t+2\phi)] dt}}\\
               &amp;=V_{pk}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2T} \int_0^{T}{ dt}}\\
               &amp;=\frac{V_{pk}}{\sqrt {2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

: where the [[trigonometric identity]] &lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x = \frac {1 - \cos 2x}{2}&lt;/math&gt; has been used and the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[crest factor]], which varies for different waveforms.

*For a [[triangle wave]]form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{\sqrt{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

*For a [[square wave]]form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_\mathrm{rms}=V_\mathrm{peak}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
To illustrate these concepts, consider a 230&amp;nbsp;V AC [[Mains power systems|mains]] supply used in [[Mains power systems#Table of mains voltages and frequencies|many countries]] around the world. It is so called because its [[root mean square]] value is 230&amp;nbsp;V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230&amp;nbsp;V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}=\sqrt{2}\ V_\mathrm{rms}.&lt;/math&gt;

For 230&amp;nbsp;V AC, the peak voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{peak}&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;230 V\times\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is about 325&amp;nbsp;V. During the course of one cycle the voltage rises from zero to 325&amp;nbsp;V, falls through zero to -325&amp;nbsp;V, and returns to zero.

==Information transmission==
Alternating current is used to transmit [[information]], as in the cases of [[telephone]] and [[cable television]]. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the [[baseband]] audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information [[wireless|over the air]].

==History==
The first [[alternator]] to produce alternating current was a [[Dynamo|dynamo electric generator]] based on [[Michael Faraday]]'s principles constructed by the French instrument maker [[Hippolyte Pixii]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |title=Pixii Machine invented by Hippolyte Pixii, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |access-date=2012-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907092008/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html |archive-date=2008-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixii later added a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current. The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by [[Guillaume Duchenne]], inventor and developer of [[electrotherapy]]. In 1855, he announced that AC was superior to [[direct current]] for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, Sidney Herman., "History of Electrotherapy", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternating current technology had first developed in Europe due to the work of [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the Hungarian [[Ganz Works]] company (1870s), and in the 1880s: [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]], [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]].

In 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage AC line. Instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred power to the secondary windings which were connected to one or several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design,&lt;ref name=maglab&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html |title=Stanley Transformer |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]] |accessdate=Jan 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html |archive-date=2009-01-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ksa-S7C8dT8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA283 |page=283 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |issue=534 |volume=21 |title=Gas and Electricity in Paris |date=Jan 22, 1880 |last=De Fonveille |first=W. |accessdate=Jan 9, 2009 |bibcode=1880Natur..21..282D |doi=10.1038/021282b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to keep the failure of one lamp from disabling the entire circuit.&lt;ref name=maglab/&gt; In 1878, the [[Ganz Works|Ganz factory]], Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.

===Transformers===
Alternating current systems can use [[transformer]]s to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core [[Transformer|power transformer]] developed by [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. They also exhibited the invention in [[Turin]] in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to [[Electrical load|loads]]. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.&lt;ref name=FJU1889&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftransfo00upperich|last=Uppenborn|first=F. J.|title=History of the Transformer|publisher=E. &amp; F. N. Spon|location=London|date=1889|pages=35–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.

===Pioneers===

[[File:ZBD team.jpg|thumb|right|The Hungarian "ZBD" Team ([[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]], [[Miksa Déri]]), inventors of the first high efficiency, closed-core shunt connection [[transformer]]]]

[[File:DBZ trafo.jpg|right|thumb|The prototype of the ZBD transformer on display at the Széchenyi István Memorial Exhibition, [[Nagycenk]] in [[Hungary]]]]

In the autumn of 1884, [[Károly Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy]] and [[Miksa Déri]] (ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz factory, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around iron wire ring core or b)&amp;nbsp;surrounded by iron wire core.&lt;ref name=FJU1889/&gt; In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see [[transformer#Toroidal cores|toroidal cores]]). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.&lt;ref name=Jeszenszky&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeszenszky|first=Sándor|title=Electrostatics and Electrodynamics at Pest University in the Mid-19th Century|url=http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V%26H%20Sect2/V%26H%20175-182.pdf|publisher=[[University of Pavia]]|accessdate=Mar 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers.&lt;ref name="Halacsy (1961)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halacsy |first1=A.

The AC power systems was developed and adopted rapidly after 1886 due to its ability to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances, overcoming the limitations of the [[direct current]] system. In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed the world's first [[power station]] that used AC generators to power a parallel-connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.&lt;ref name="IEC Techline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171011/http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=technology&amp;item=144 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Ottó Bláthy, Miksa Déri, Károly Zipernowsky |publisher=IEC Techline |accessdate=Apr 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of the AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified a large European metropolis: [[Rome]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="IEC Techline"/&gt;

In the US [[William Stanley, Jr.]] designed one of the first practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits. Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an [[induction coil]], was an early (1885) [[transformer]]. Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur [[George Westinghouse]] who started building AC systems in 1886. The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the "[[War of Currents]]". In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional [[AC motor]], something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an [[induction motor]], was independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical [[three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Arnold Heertje]], Mark Perlman [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQMOPjUgWHsC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=tesla+motors+sparked+induction+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0d_SjX8YX&amp;sig=sA8LhTkGdQtgByBPD_ZDalCBwQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XoVSUPnfJo7A9gSwiICYCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20motors%20sparked%20induction%20motor&amp;f=false Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics], page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] (spring of 1891) and the original [[Niagara Falls]] [[Adams Power Plant]] (August 25, 1895) were among the first hydroelectric alternating current power plants. The first long distance transmission of single-phase electricity was from a hydroelectric generating plant in Oregon at Willamette Falls which in 1890 sent power fourteen miles downriver to downtown Portland for street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1915|title=Electric Transmission of Power|url=|journal=General Electric Review|volume=XVIII|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891, a second transmission system was installed in Telluride Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1915|title=Electric Transmission of Power|url=|journal=General Electric|volume=XVIII|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Antonio Canyon Generator was the third commercial single-phase hydroelectric AC power plant in the United States to provide long-distance electricity.  It was completed on December 31, 1892 by [[Almarian Decker|Almarian William Decker]] to provide power to the city of [[Pomona, California]] which was 14 miles away.  In 1893 he next designed the first commercial [[three-phase]] power plant in the United States using alternating current was the hydroelectric [[Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant]] near [[Redlands, California]].  Decker's design incorporated 10&amp;nbsp;kV three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used today. The [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] in Croatia was set in operation on 28 August 1895. The two [[Electric generator|generators]] (42&amp;nbsp;Hz, 550&amp;nbsp;kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company [[Ganz]]. The transmission line from the power plant to the City of [[Šibenik]] was {{convert|11.5|km|sp=us}} long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000&amp;nbsp;V/110&amp;nbsp;V included six transforming stations. Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include [[Charles Steinmetz]], [[Oliver Heaviside]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1229&amp;dq=theoretical++alternating+current++Oliver+Heaviside&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bifsUOmuLKio0AHXtIGoBg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&amp;f=false I.

Before the disaster, Flight 110 had deviated from [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport|Skopje International Airport]] to [[Ohrid "St. Paul the Apostle" Airport|Ohrid Airport]] due to a blizzard in the Macedonian capital. The plane, a [[Yakovlev Yak-42]], was carrying 108 passengers and eight crew, and crashed about {{convert|7|km}} east of Ohrid Airport. All 116 people onboard were killed as a result of the crash. One passenger lived for eleven days after the disaster but succumbed to his injuries. Most of the victims were [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] citizens of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity.

The crash was Macedonia's third aviation disaster in 16 months, and remains the country's deadliest. A subsequent investigation established the cause of the accident as pilot error.

==Flight==
Flight 110 was an international scheduled passenger flight originating in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with a final destination of [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Due to a blizzard at Skopje, Flight 110 was diverted to [[Ohrid Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7LReAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EjAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6061,1490218&amp;dq=ohrid+crash&amp;hl=en Many feared dead in Macedonia crash]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cleared for an approach to Runway 02, the Yak-42 was approximately 2,300 feet too high to carry out a successful landing, so a missed approach procedure was executed. Shortly afterwards the crew of Flight 110 radioed that they were not receiving the [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] signal. Air Traffic control was unable to satisfy the request for a bearing and the pilot of Flight 110 advised that he could not see the runway lights. Shortly thereafter Flight 110 crashed killing 115 of the 116 people on board. One passenger, Rade Jevremović, survived but was badly injured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WJJiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3ncNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3538,5673853&amp;dq=rade+jevremovic&amp;hl=en Crash survivor recovering]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passengers and crew==
Eighty percent of the passengers were citizens of Yugoslavia, mostly ethnic [[Albanians]], while the remainder were citizens of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Konstantin Testorides|publisher=The Independent|title=Macedonia plane disaster kills 115|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/macedonia-plane-disaster-kills-115-1505914.html|date=21 November 1993|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four members of the flight crew were Russian and the four cabin crew members were Macedonian. Among the passengers was Pierre Ollier, a French [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) official in his mid-20s who had just returned from an assignment in war-torn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=Plane Crash in Macedonia Kills 115; 1 Survivor|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-22/news/mn-59671_1_crash-plane-kills|date=22 November 1993|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Due to Flight 110 being the third aviation disaster in a sixteen-month period to take place in his country, Minister of Urban Planning, Civil Engineering, Communications and Ecology Antoni Pesev resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gK8sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4xQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2535,3031999&amp;dq=ohrid+crash+equipment&amp;hl=en Official resigns over plane crash]&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots association complained of broken equipment and poor safety standards at both Skopje and Ohrid Airports.

On 1 December 1993, Rade Jevremovic died without ever regaining consciousness in the days following the crash of Avioimpex Flight 110.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3U1KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b4YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3104,571403&amp;dq=rade+jevremovic&amp;hl=en Crash survivor dies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight 110 remains the deadliest aviation crash to ever take place in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=Z3 Macedonia air safety profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The cause of the crash was attributed to a violation of the airport traffic pattern by the crew of Flight 110, who initiated a turn into rising terrain. A contributing factor was their decision to proceed with the approach even though they were not receiving a navigational signal due to being out of range of the VOR station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bakelite''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|k|əl|aɪ|t}} {{Respell|BAY|kəl|eyet}}; sometimes spelled '''Baekelite''') or '''polyoxybenzylmethyleneglycolanhydride''' was the first plastic made from synthetic components. It is a [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[phenol formaldehyde resin]], formed from a [[condensation reaction]] of [[phenol]] with [[formaldehyde]]. It was developed by the Belgian-American chemist [[Leo Baekeland]] in [[Yonkers, New York]], in 1907.

Bakelite was patented on December 7, 1909. The creation of a synthetic plastic was revolutionary for its electrical [[nonconductor|nonconductivity]] and heat-resistant properties in electrical insulators, radio and telephone casings and such diverse products as kitchenware, jewelry, pipe stems, children's toys, and firearms. The "[[retro]]" appeal of old Bakelite products has made them collectible.&lt;ref name=CookSlessor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Patrick |last2=Slessor |first2=Catherine|title=An illustrated guide to bakelite collectables |date=1998 |publisher=Quantum |location=London |isbn=9781861602121 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 23, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite was designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] on November 9, 1993, by the [[American Chemical Society]] in recognition of its significance as the world's first [[synthetic plastic]].&lt;ref name=Landmark&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Chemical Society National Historic Chemical Landmarks|title=Bakelite: The World's First Synthetic Plastic|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Baekeland was already wealthy due to his invention of [[Velox paper|Velox photographic paper]] when he began to investigate the reactions of [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]] in his home laboratory. Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibers were [[polymer]]s. Baekeland's initial intent was to find a replacement for [[shellac]], a material in limited supply because it was made naturally from the excretion of [[lac insect]]s (specifically ''[[Kerria lacca]]''). Baekeland produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called "Novolak", but it was not a market success.&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt;

Baekeland then began experimenting on strengthening wood by impregnating it with a synthetic resin, rather than coating it.&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt; By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], Baekeland produced a hard moldable material that he named "Bakelite",&lt;ref name="time" &gt;{{cite news

It was the first synthetic thermosetting plastic produced, and Baekeland speculated on "the thousand and one ... articles" it could be used to make.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|58–59}} Baekeland considered the possibilities of using a wide variety of filling materials, including cotton, powdered bronze, and slate dust, but was most successful with wood and asbestos fibers.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;

Baekeland filed a substantial number of patents in the area.&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt; Bakelite, his "method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde," was filed on July 13, 1907, and granted on December 7, 1909.&lt;ref name="Patent942699"&gt;{{US patent reference

[[File:First Semi-commercial Bakelizer 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p6.tif| thumb|right | The first semi-commercial Bakelizer, from Baekeland's laboratory]]

Baekeland started semi-commercial production of his new material in his home laboratory, marketing it as a material for electrical insulators. By 1910, he was producing enough material to justify expansion. He formed the General Bakelite Company as a U.S. company to manufacture and market his new industrial material. He also made overseas connections to produce materials in other countries.&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt;

Bijker gives a detailed discussion of the development of Bakelite and the Bakelite company's production of various applications of materials.&lt;ref name="Bijker"/&gt; As of 1911, the company's main focus was laminating varnish, whose sales volume vastly outperformed both molding material and cast resin. By 1912, molding material was gaining ground, but its sales volume for the company did not exceed that of laminating varnish until the 1930s.

As the sales figures also show, the Bakelite Company produced "transparent" cast resin (which did not include filler) for a small ongoing market during the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref name="Bijker"/&gt;{{rp|172–174}} Blocks or rods of cast resin, also known as "artificial amber", were machined and carved to create items such as pipe stems, cigarette holders and jewelry.&lt;ref name="Bijker"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Carleton|title=Synthetic resins and their plastics|date=1923|publisher=The Chemical Catalog Co.|location=New York|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the demand for molded plastics led the Bakelite company to concentrate on molding, rather than concentrating on cast solid resins.&lt;ref name="Bijker"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Fourth Kingdom: The Social Construction of Bakelite|pages=101–198|last1=Bijker|first1=Wiebe E.|title=Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs : toward a theory of sociotechnical change|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262522274|edition=1st MIT Press pbk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsbmwN8-m1cC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172–174}}

The Bakelite Corporation was formed in 1922 after patent litigation favorable to Baekeland, from a merger of three companies: Baekeland's General Bakelite Company; the Condensite Company, founded by J.W. Aylesworth; and the [[Formica (plastic)#History|Redmanol]] Chemical Products Company, founded by L.V. Redman.&lt;ref name=aice&gt;{{cite book|author=[[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] Staff|title=Twenty-Five Years of Chemical Engineering Progress|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1977|page=216|isbn=0-8369-0149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under director of advertising and public relations Allan Brown, who came to Bakelite from Condensite, Bakelite was aggressively marketed as "the material of a thousand uses".&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|58–59}}&lt;ref name=PlasticsArticle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Allan|title=Bakelite – What It Is|journal=Plastics|date=1925|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17, 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A filing for a [[trademark]] featuring the letter B above the [[Infinity symbol|mathematical symbol for infinity]] was made August 25, 1925, and claimed the mark was in use as of December 1, 1924. A wide variety of uses were listed in their trademark applications.&lt;ref name=PlasticsTate&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tate|first1=A.

The first issue of ''Plastics'' magazine, October 1925, featured Bakelite on its cover, and included the article "Bakelite – What It Is" by Allan Brown. The range of colors available included "black, brown, red, yellow, green, gray, blue, and blends of two or more of these".&lt;ref name=PlasticsCover&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cover Illustration|journal=Plastics|date=1925|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article emphasized that Bakelite came in various forms. "Bakelite is manufactured in several forms to suit varying requirements. In all these forms the fundamental basis is the initial Bakelite resin. This variety includes clear material, for jewelry, smokers' articles, etc.; cement, using in sealing electric light bulbs in metal bases; varnishes, for impregnating electric coils, etc.; lacquers, for protecting the surface of hardware; enamels, for giving resistive coating to industrial equipment; Laminated Bakelite, used for silent gears and insulation; and molding material, from which are formed innumerable articles of utility and beauty. The molding material is prepared ordinarily by the impregnation of cellulose substances with the initial 'uncured' resin."&lt;ref name=PlasticsArticle/&gt;{{rp|17}} In a 1925 report, the United States Tariff Commission hailed the commercial manufacture of synthetic phenolic resin as "distinctly an American achievement", and noted that "the publication of figures, however, would be a virtual disclosure of the production of an individual company".&lt;ref name=Tariff&gt;{{cite book|last1=United States Tariff Commission|title=Census of dyes and of other synthetic organic chemicals|date=1925|publisher=U.

In England, Bakelite Limited, a merger of three British phenol formaldehyde resin suppliers (Damard Lacquer Company Limited of [[Birmingham]], Mouldensite Limited of Darley Dale and Redmanol Chemical Products Company of [[London]]), was formed in 1926. A new Bakelite factory opened in [[Tyseley]], Birmingham, around 1928.&lt;ref name=Travis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Travis|editor-first1=Anthony S.|title=Determinants in the evolution of the European chemical industry : 1900–1939 : new technologies, political frameworks, markets and companies|date=1998|publisher=Kluwer Acad.

A new factory opened in [[Bound Brook, New Jersey]], in 1931.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|75}} In 1939, the companies were acquired by [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation]]. Union Carbide's phenolic resin business including the Bakelite and Bakelit registered trademarks are assigned to [[Hexion Inc.]]

In addition to the original Bakelite material, these companies eventually made a wide range of other products, many of which were marketed under the brand name "Bakelite plastics". These included other types of cast phenolic resins similar to [[Catalin]], and urea-formaldehyde resins, which could be made in brighter colors than polyoxy&amp;shy;benzyl&amp;shy;methylene&amp;shy;glycol&amp;shy;anhydride.&lt;ref name=CookSlessor/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meikle"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Plastic: A Cultural History|last1=Meikle|first1=Jeffrey L.|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=0-8135-2235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Baekeland's heat and pressure patents expired in 1927, Bakelite Corporation faced serious competition from other companies. Because molded Bakelite incorporated fillers to give it strength, it tended to be made in concealing dark colors.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt; In 1927, beads, bangles and earrings were produced by the [[Catalin]] company, through a different process which enabled them to introduce 15 new colors. Translucent jewelry, poker chips and other items made of phenolic resins were introduced in the 1930s or 1940s by the Catalin company under the Prystal name.&lt;ref name=Leshner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leshner|first1=Leigh|title=Collecting art plastic jewelry : identification and price guide|date=2005|publisher=KP Books|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-0873499545|pages=11–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJomBfX6pqkC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Sylvia|title=Plastics : designs and materials.|date=1978|publisher=Studio Vista|location=London, Angleterre|isbn=9780289707838|page=65}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 23, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of marbled phenolic resins may also be attributable to the Catalin company.

==Synthesis==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phNLecfyWS8 “Making Bakelite Plastic”], NileRed}}

Making Bakelite was a multi-stage process. It began with the heating of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, [[zinc chloride]], or the base ammonia. This created a liquid condensation product, referred to as ''Bakelite A'', which was soluble in alcohol, acetone, or additional phenol. Heated further, the product became partially soluble and could still be softened by heat. Sustained heating resulted in an "insoluble hard gum". However, the high temperatures required to create this tended to cause violent foaming of the mixture, which resulted in the cooled material being porous and breakable. Baekeland's innovative step was to put his "last condensation product" into an egg-shaped "Bakelizer". By heating it under pressure, at about {{convert|150|C|F|-1}}, Baekeland was able to suppress the foaming that would otherwise occur. The resulting substance was extremely hard and both infusible and insoluble.&lt;ref name=CookSlessor/&gt;{{rp|67}} &lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|38–39}}

===Compression molding===
[[File:RotorBakelite-2.jpg|thumb|Bakelite [[distributor]] rotor]]
Molded Bakelite forms in a condensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde, with wood flour or asbestos fiber as a filler, under high pressure and heat in a time frame of a few minutes of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]. The result is a hard plastic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/CIIEcompounds/transcripts/bakelite.asp|title=Chemistry in its element – bakelite|website=Royal Society of Chemistry – RSC.org|last=Clegg|first=Brian|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite's molding process had a number of advantages. Bakelite resin could be provided either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing.&lt;ref name=Metallography&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vander Voort|first1=George F.|title=Metallography, Principles and Practice|date=1984|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=1615032363|pages=75–81|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRQC8zYqtBIC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|42–43}}

===Phenolic sheet===
Another market for Bakelite resin was the creation of phenolic sheet materials. Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|53}} Paper, cotton fabrics, synthetic fabrics, glass fabrics and unwoven fabrics are all possible materials used in lamination. When heat and pressure are applied, [[polymerization]] transforms the layers into [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosetting]] industrial laminated plastic.&lt;ref name=Nimrod&gt;{{cite web|title=Bakelite|url=http://www.nimrodplastics.com.au/product-bakelite.htm|website=Nimrod Plastics|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite phenolic sheet is produced in many commercial grades and with various additives to meet diverse mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements. Some common types include:&lt;ref name=Micarta&gt;{{cite web|title=Micarta ® Laminates – Various Grades Technical Information|url=http://www.professionalplastics.com/professionalplastics/MicartaGrades-DataSheet.pdf|website=Professional Plastics|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakelite has a number of important properties. It can be molded very quickly, decreasing production time. Moldings are smooth, retain their shape and are resistant to heat, scratches, and destructive solvents. It is also resistant to electricity, and prized for its low conductivity. It is not flexible.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}&lt;ref name=Metallography/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wijk2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Wijk|first1=A.J.M.|last2=van Wijk|first2=I.|title=3D Printing with Biomaterials: Towards a Sustainable and Circular Economy|date=2015|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=1614994862|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEAoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and uses==

These characteristics made Bakelite particularly suitable as a molding compound, an adhesive or binding agent, a varnish, and as a protective coating. Bakelite was particularly suitable for the emerging electrical and automobile industries because of its extraordinarily high resistance to electricity, heat and chemical action.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

The earliest commercial use of Bakelite in the electrical industry was the molding of tiny insulating bushings, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;ref name=OldTimer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=The Old Timer|title=I Remember When|journal=Bakelite Review|date=1935|volume=7|issue=3|pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Advertisement&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bakelite The material of a thousand uses (Advertisement)|journal=Popular Science|date=1926|volume=March|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=August 5, 2015|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Dutch art forger [[Han van Meegeren]] was convicted of forgery, after chemist and curator [[Paul B.

Bakelite was sometimes used as a substitute for metal in the magazine, pistol grip, fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. The [[AKM]] and some early [[AK-74]] rifles are frequently mistakenly identified as using Bakelite, but most were made with AG-S4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kokalis|first1=Peter|title=Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune|date=2001|publisher=Paladin Press|pages=45, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s, newer materials were superseding Bakelite in many areas.&lt;ref name=Balinski/&gt; [[Phenolic resin|Phenolics]] are less frequently used in general consumer products today due to their cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature.

Common dice are sometimes made of Bakelite for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic polymer such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).
Bakelite continues to be used for wire insulation, brake pads and related automotive components, and industrial electrical-related applications. Bakelite stock is still manufactured and produced in sheet, rod and tube form for industrial applications in the electronics, power generation and aerospace industries, and under a variety of commercial brand names.&lt;ref name=Balinski/&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the term '''chemically inert''' is used to describe a substance that is not [[chemically reactive]].  Most [[Group 8 element|Group 8 or 18]] elements that appear in the last column of the [[periodic table]] ([[Helium]], [[Neon]], [[Argon]], [[Krypton]], [[Xenon]] and [[Radon]]) are classified as inert (or unreactive). These elements are stable in their naturally occurring form (gaseous form) and they are called [[Inert gas|inert gases]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/inert.html|title=The MSDS HyperGlossary: Inert|website=www.ilpi.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- adding more background information --&gt;

==Noble gas==
{{Main|Noble gas}}
The [[noble gas]]es were previously known as ''inert gases'' because of their perceived lack of participation in any chemical reactions. The reason for this is that their outermost [[electron shell]]s (valence shells) are completely filled, so that they have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. They are said to acquire a [[noble gas configuration]], or a full [[electron configuration]]. 

It is now known that most of these gases in fact ''do'' react to form [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[xenon tetrafluoride]]. Hence, they have been renamed to ''noble gases''. However, a large amount of energy is required to drive such reactions, usually in the form of heat, pressure, or radiation, often assisted by [[catalyst]]s. The resulting compounds often need to be kept in moisture-free conditions at low temperatures to prevent rapid decomposition back into their elements.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Inert gas==
{{Main|Inert gas}}
The term ''inert'' may also be applied in a relative sense. For example, molecular [[nitrogen]] is an [[inert gas]] under ordinary conditions, existing as [[diatomic molecule]]s, {{chem|N|2}}. The presence of a strong triple [[covalent bond]] in the {{chem|N|2}} molecule renders it unreactive under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, nitrogen gas does react with the [[alkali metal]] lithium to form compound [[lithium nitride]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), even under ordinary conditions. Under high pressures and temperatures and with the right catalysts, nitrogen becomes more reactive; the [[Haber process]] uses such conditions to produce [[ammonia]] from atmospheric nitrogen &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/equilibria/haber.html|title=The Haber Process for the manufacture of ammonia|website=www.chemguide.co.uk|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Main uses ===
Inert atmospheres consisting of gases such as [[argon]], [[nitrogen]], or [[helium]] are commonly used in chemical reaction chambers and in storage containers for [[air sensitive|oxygen-sensitive]] or water-sensitive substances, to prevent unwanted reactions of these substances with oxygen or water. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/aqa_pre_2011/oils/changesrev6.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Noble gases|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argon]] is widely used in [[fluorescence]] tubes and low energy light bulbs. Argon gas helps to protect the metal filament inside the bulb from reacting with oxygen and [[Corrosion|corroding]] the filament under high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/ar.htm|title=Argon (Ar) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|website=www.lenntech.com|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Neon]] is used in making advertising signs. Neon gas in a vacuum tube glows bright red in colour when electricity is passed through. Different coloured neon lights can also be made by using other gases. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sciencestruck.com/uses-of-neon|title=A Brief Summary of the Important Uses of Neon|work=ScienceStruck|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Helium]] gas is mainly used to fill hot air and party balloons. Balloons filled with it float upwards and this phenomenon is achieved as helium gas is less dense than air &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele002.html|title=It's Elemental - The Element Helium|website=education.jlab.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- The main uses of each inert gases are added with reliable sources --&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
{{see also|Dioscorea oppositifolia}}
The [[botanical name]]s ''Dioscorea opposita'' and ''[[Dioscorea oppositifolia]]'' have been consistently misapplied to Chinese yam.&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt;&lt;ref name="fna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feis" /&gt; The name ''D. opposita'' is now an accepted [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''D. oppositifolia''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{WCSP|240599|Dioscorea oppositifolia |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Botanical works that point out the error may list, e.g., ''Dioscorea opposita'' [[Auctorum|auct.]] as a synonym of ''D. polystachya''.&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; Furthermore, neither ''D. oppositifolia'' nor the prior ''D. opposita'' have been found growing in North America and have no historical range in China or East Asia, this grouping is native only to the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent of India]] and should not be confused with ''Dioscorea polystachya''.&lt;ref name="fna" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Dioscorea polystachya UGA2307129.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Dioscorea polystachya'', Chinese yam]]
''Dioscorea polystachya'' vines typically grow 3–5 meters long, but can be longer. They twine clockwise. The leaves are up to 11 centimeters long and wide. They are lobed at the base and larger ones may have lobed edges. The arrangement is variable; they may be alternately or oppositely arranged or borne in whorls. 
In the leaf axils appear warty rounded [[bulbil]]s under 2 centimeters long. The bulbils are sometimes informally referred to as "yam berries" or "yamberries".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New plants sprout from the bulbils or parts of them. 

The flowers of Chinese yam are [[cinnamon]]-scented. 

The plant produces one or more spindle-shaped&lt;ref name=fna/&gt; or cylindrical&lt;ref name=feis/&gt; tubers. The largest may weigh 10 pounds and grow one meter underground.&lt;ref name=feis/&gt; ''Dioscorea polystachya'' is more tolerant to frost and cooler climates than other yams, which is attributed to its successful introductions and establishment on many continents.

== Names ==
[[File:Dioscorea polystachya UGA5421977.jpg|thumb|upright|In addition to larger underground tubers, Chinese yam also produces smaller bulbils (aerial tubers), formed where leaves join the stem. These are also edible but not considered as palatable. Some compare their taste to that of new potatoes.&lt;ref name=Toensmeier2013/&gt;]]
In Chinese it is known as ''huáishān'' ([[wikt:怀(淮)|怀(淮)]][[wikt:山|山]]),&lt;ref&gt;Originated from Jiaozuo (焦作), previously known as "Huai Qing Fu (怀庆俯)" {{cite web|url = http://www.shanyao.com/a-22995-1/|title = 四大怀药的历史文化渊源}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''shānyào'' ([[wikt:山药|山药]], [[wikt:山藥|山藥]])  (lit. "mountain medicine."), or ''huáishānyào'' ([[wikt:怀(淮)|怀(淮)]][[wikt:山药|山药]], [[wikt:怀(淮)|怀(淮)]][[wikt:山藥|山藥]])(lit. "mountain medicine from Huai", i.e. Huai Qing Fu (怀庆俯) region).  Rarely, also referred to as ''shǔyù''  ([[wikt:薯蕷|薯蕷]]). The yam bulbils are referred to as ''shanyao dou'' 山药豆, i.e. "yam beans", or ''shanyao dan'' 山药蛋 ("yam eggs").

In Japanese, it is known as ''nagaimo'' (lit. 'long yam'; kanji: [[wikt:長芋|長芋]]). Furthermore, ''nagaimo'' is classified into ''ichōimo'' (lit. 'ginkgo-leaf yam'; kanji: 銀杏芋), or ''yamatoimo'' (lit. Yamato yam; kanji: [[wikt:大和芋|大和芋]]), depending on root shapes. In Japan, this species is sometimes mistakenly called Japanese mountain yam, which refers to the native [[Dioscorea&amp;nbsp;japonica]].&lt;ref name="Shiro" /&gt;

In Korea it is called ''ma'' (hangul: [[wikt:마|마]]), "sanu ([[wikt:山芋|山芋]], [[wikt:산우|산우]])", seoyeo ([[wikt:薯蕷|薯蕷]], [[wikt:서여|서여]]), or sanyak ([[wikt:山藥|山藥]], [[wikt:산약)|산약)]] and in Sri Lanka in Sinhala it is called ''wal ala'' (වැල් අල). Sometimes called Korean yam.

In Vietnam, the yam is called ''củ mài'' or ''khoai mài''. When this yam is processed to become a medicine, the yam is called ''hoài sơn'' or ''tỳ giải''.

In the [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]] of the northern Philippines it is called ''tuge''.

In [[Latin American]] countries it's known as white name or white ñame.

In Manipuri it is called as "Ha".

== In alternative medicine ==
Creams and dietary supplements made from the related ''[[Dioscorea villosa]]'' are claimed to contain human hormones and promoted as a medicine for a variety of purposes, including [[cancer prevention]] and the treatment of [[Crohn's disease]] and [[whooping cough]]. However, according to the [[American Cancer Society]], the claims are false and there is no evidence to support these substances being either safe or effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/wild-yam|title = Wild Yam|date = November 2008|publisher = [[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate = 21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huáishān has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Dermatology in Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an invasive species==
''Dioscorea polystachya'' was introduced to the United States in the 1800s when it was planted as an [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] or food crop. It and other introduced yam species now grow wild there. It is troublesome in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], where its range is "rapidly expanding".&lt;ref name=feis/&gt; It is most prevalent in moist habitat types. It is more tolerant of frost than other yams and can occur in temperate climates as far north as [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=feis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{BONAP|ref |genus=Dioscorea |species=polystachya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:TororoUdon.jpg|thumb|left|Tororo blackbean udon from [[Tamba, Hyōgo|Tamba]] (丹波の黒豆とろろうどん)]][[Image:Tororo (grated Dioscorea opposita).jpg|thumb|Grated ''Dioscorea polystachya'' (Japanese ''tororo'')]]
The tubers of ''D. polystachya'' can be eaten raw, while other yams must be cooked before consumption (due to harmful substances in the raw state). In [[Japanese cuisine]], it is eaten raw and grated, after only a relatively minimal preparation: the whole [[tuber]]s are briefly soaked in a vinegar-water solution, to neutralize irritant [[oxalate]] crystals found in their skin. The raw vegetable is starchy and bland, [[mucilaginous]] when grated, and may be eaten plain as a side dish, or added to noodles.

It is used in the Japanese noodle dish ''tororo [[udon]]/[[soba]]'' and as a binding agent in the batter of [[okonomiyaki]]. The grated yam is known as ''tororo'' (in Japanese). In ''tororo udon/soba'', the ''tororo'' is mixed with other ingredients that typically include ''tsuyu'' broth ([[dashi]]), [[wasabi]], and [[Scallion|green onions]].

== Growing Chinese yam ==
The Huáishān growing cycle spans approximately one year, and should be planted between winter and spring. The traditional methods growing it are: using smaller tubers, top cut of bigger tubers or through cuttings of branches. The first two methods can produce 20&amp;nbsp;cm (7.8&amp;nbsp;in) long tubers and above. The latter produces smaller tubers (10&amp;nbsp;cm or 4 in) that are usually replanted for the next year.

Between 7 and 9 months of replanting huáishān seedlings, their leaves start to get dry (a common fact in plants that grow tubers): that indicates that it's time to harvest. In home gardens generally only what will be consumed is harvested, with the rest left in the pot in moist soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Takeguma|first = Massahiro|url = http://cultivozen.massahiro.com/2013/07/o-cultivo-do-inhame-tororo-growing.html?lang=en|title = Growing Nagaimo|accessdate = 26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clean Energy Regulator''' (CER) is an [[Australia]]n independent [[statutory authority]] responsible for administering [[legislation]] to reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]]. The CER, based in [[Canberra]], was established on 2 April 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About|title=Clean Energy Regulator - about|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ''Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2011A00163|title=Australian Government Federal Register of Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency is part of the [https://www.environment.gov.au/ Environment and Energy] portfolio.

==Functions==
The CER has administrative responsibilities in relation to the renewable energy target, the [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF Emissions Reduction Fund], the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme and the [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/OSR/ANREU/The-Australian-national-registry-of-emissions-units Australian National Registry of Emissions Units (ANREU).]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Legislation-and-regulations Legislation and regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/NGER National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme] provides a national framework for [[carbon accounting]], energy production and energy consumption.&lt;ref name="ngaer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/National-Greenhouse-and-Energy-Reporting/Pages/default.aspx |title=National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting |date= 4 June 2012 |publisher=Clean Energy Regulator |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CER administers the Renewable Energy Target's two schemes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/How-the-scheme-works|title=Clean Energy Regulator - About the Renewable Energy Target|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/How-the-scheme-works/Large-scale-Renewable-Energy-Target Large-scale Renewable Energy Target], which encourages investment in renewable power stations to achieve 33 000 gigawatt hours of additional renewable electricity generation by 2020.
* The [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/How-the-scheme-works/Small-scale-Renewable-Energy-Scheme Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme], which supports small-scale installations like household solar panels and solar hot water systems.

The Emissions Reduction Fund is a voluntary scheme that aims to provide incentives for a range of organisations and individuals to adopt new practices and technologies to reduce their emissions.

==Annual statement of progress towards the 2020 target==
On 23 June 2015 the CER Act was amended to implement the Government's changes to the [[Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets|renewable energy target]]. The new target for large-scale generation was 33,000 gigawatt hours in 2020. This will result in more than 23.5% of Australia's electricity being derived from renewable sources by 2020. The required gigawatt hours of renewable source electricity from 2017 to 2019 were also adjusted to reflect the new target.&lt;ref name=AnnStmt&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Pages/Accountability%20and%20reporting/Administrative%20Reports/The%20Renewable%20Energy%20Target%202015%20Administrative%20Report/Annual-statement.aspx Annual statement—progress towards the 2020 target ]&lt;/ref&gt;

To help track investment in new renewable energy capacity, the CER prepares an annual statement on progress of the scheme towards meeting the new target and the impact it is having on household electricity bills.&lt;ref name=AnnStmt /&gt;

The CER tabled the [http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Accountability-and-reporting/administrative-reports/tracking-towards-2020-encouraging-renewable-energy-in-australia 2016 Renewable Energy Target Administrative Report and Annual Statement]. The report covers the operations of the ''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000'' for the 2016 calendar year and the Renewable Energy Target 2016 Annual statement and supporting information about progress towards meeting the revised 2020 large-scale renewable energy target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Accountability-and-reporting/administrative-reports/tracking-towards-2020-encouraging-renewable-energy-in-australia Renewable Energy Target 2016 Administrative Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan William Reicher''' is an American lawyer who was U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy for [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] at the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] in the [[Clinton Administration]]. Reicher is currently Executive Director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steyertaylor.stanford.edu/ |title=Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance &amp;#124; Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance |publisher=Steyertaylor.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stanford University]], a joint center of the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and [[Stanford Law School]], where he also holds faculty positions. Reicher joined Stanford in 2011 from [[Google]], where he served since 2007 as Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives for the company’s venture [[Google.org]].

Reicher also served as an advisor to the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Obama campaign]] and a member of the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama Transition Team]] where he focused on the energy portions of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Obama stimulus]] package.

Following the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Reicher was considered for the post of [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy Secretary]] in the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] but physicist [[Steven Chu]] was ultimately chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/us/politics/14web-reicher.html?_r=0|title=Dan W. Reicher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his tenure in the Clinton Administration, Reicher was as an energy investor with a private equity firm he co-founded, and where he served as President. He was also a cleantech executive with a venture capital-backed renewable energy company. Early in his career he served as a staff member of [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter’s]] [[Three Mile Island accident|Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island]].

In 2012 Reicher received an honorary doctorate from the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] and was also named one of the five most influential figures in U.S. clean energy by Oilprice.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Renewable-Energy/Oilprice.coms-5-Most-Influential-Figures-in-U.S.-Clean-Energy.html |title=Oilprice.com's 5 Most Influential Figures in U.S. Clean Energy |publisher=OilPrice.com |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decorative laminate 07863.jpg|thumb|300px|Roll and sheet of decorative laminate]]

'''Decorative laminates''' are [[laminate]]d products primarily used as [[furniture]] surface materials or [[wall panel]]ing. It can be manufactured as either high- or low-pressure laminate, with the two processes not much different from each other except for the [[pressure]] applied in the pressing process.

== High-pressure laminate (HPL) ==
According to McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Architecture &amp; Construction, high-pressure laminates consists of laminates "molded and cured at pressures not lower than {{cvt|1000|psi|kg/cm2}} and more commonly in the range of {{cvt|1200|to|2000|psi|kg/cm2|-1}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Cyril |title=Dictionary of Architecture &amp; Construction |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |page=472 |isbn=0071351787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HPL is made of resin impregnated [[cellulose]] layers, which are consolidated under heat and high pressure. The various layers are described below:
* Overlay paper, which serves to improve the abrasion, scratch and heat-resistance
* Decorative paper, which defines the design and is composed of colored or printed paper
* [[Kraft paper]], which is used as core material and control product thickness.

Trade names include [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]], [[Arborite]], [[Micarta]], [[Consoweld]], Alpikord and Duropal.

=== Manufacturing ===
After the papers are impregnated with the [[resin]]s, the three layers of paper/resin are placed into a press which simultaneously applies heat (120&amp;nbsp;°C) and pressure (5 MPa). The pressing operation allows the thermoset resins to flow into the paper, then subsequently cure into a consolidated sheet with a density greater than {{cvt|1.35|g/cm3|lb/ft3}}. During the press cycle, the decorative surface can also be cured while in contact with a textured surface to create one of many different surface finishes.

HPL consists of more than 60 to 70% paper, with the remaining 30 to 40% a combination of [[phenol-formaldehyde resin]] for the core layers and [[melamine resin|melamine-formaldehyde resin]] for the surface layer. Both resins belong to a class of thermosetting resins which crosslink during the press cycle creating irreversible chemical bonds that produce a nonreactive, stable material with characteristics different and superior to those of the component parts.

HPL can be produced using both continuous and discontinuous (batch) manufacturing processes. HPL are supplied in sheet form in a variety of sizes, thicknesses and surface finishes.

== Low-pressure laminate ==
Low Pressure laminate is defined as "a plastic laminate molded and cured at pressures in general of {{convert|400|psi|atm MPa}}."&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms, 6E, Copyright © 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality standards ==
There are various industrial standards specifically applied for high-pressure decorative laminates:

=== European Standard EN438 ===
The [[European Standard]] [[List of EN standards|EN438]] is one of the standards that most decorative laminates manufacturers selling to worldwide market (such as Greenlam, New Mika, Samrat, Resopal, Polyrey, Abet Laminati, Dekodur Laminating Technologie, Violam, [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]], [[Maica Laminates|Maica]], Wilsonart,) adhere to. The specific code is EN438, entitled: Decorative high-pressure laminates (HPL) sheets based on thermosetting resins, specifications. It replaced all other national European standards.

The specific part of EN438 which applies to high-pressure laminates is Part 3. The full title to this standard is:  ''High-pressure decorative laminates (HPL) Sheets based on thermosetting resins (Usually called laminates) Part 3: Classification and specifications for laminates less than 2 mm thick intended for bonding to supporting substrates''. In total there are 9 parts to the EN438.&lt;ref&gt;Full text for the European Standard EN 438: https://www.astandis.at/shopV5/Preview.action;jsessionid=C045446E9099A68CC81A25878D446393?preview=&amp;dokkey=337613&amp;selectedLocale=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative laminates are grouped into the following types according to EN 438:
* Type S (standard grade) - The characteristic properties of this grade are hard, virtually wear and scratch proof surfaces, high resistance to impact, insensitivity to boiling water and a number of typical household chemicals, as well as a pronounced resistance to dry and humid heat. The back side of decorative laminate is designed to allow defect free bonding to a substrate such as MDF or chipboard.
* Type P (postforming grade) - The properties of this grade are generally equivalent to type S, but is capable of being postformed at fixed temperature conditions according to the manufacturers specifications.
* Type F (fire-retardant grade) - The properties of this grade are generally equivalent to type S, but feature increased resistance to fire.

Product specifications applicable to HPL include the nine parts of EN 438 and the two parts of ISO 4586 as shown below:
* EN 438-1: Introduction and general information
* EN 438-2: Determination of properties
* EN 438-3: Classification and specifications for laminates less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick intended for bonding to supporting substrates
* EN 438-4: Classification and specifications for compact laminates of thickness 2&amp;nbsp;mm and greater
* EN 438-5: Classification and specifications for flooring grade laminates less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick intended for bonding to supporting substrates
* EN 438-6: Classification and specifications for exterior grade compact laminates of thickness 2&amp;nbsp;mm and greater
* EN 438-7: Compact laminate and HPL composite panels for internal and external wall and ceiling finishes
* EN 438-8: Classification and specifications for design laminates
* EN 438-9 Classification and specifications for alternative core laminates
* ISO 4586-1: High-pressure decorative laminates—Sheets made from thermosetting resins—Part 1: Classification and specifications
* ISO 4586-1: High-pressure decorative laminates—Sheets made from thermosetting resins—Part 2: Determination of properties

=== Antibacterial ===
Antibacterial properties are important for decorative laminates because these laminates are used as kitchen tops and counter tops, cabinets and table tops that may be in constant contact with food materials and younger children. Antibacterial properties are there to ensure that bacterial growth is minimal.

One of the standards for Anti-Bacterial is the ISO 22196:2007,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northernlam.com/decorative-laminates.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the [[Japanese Industrial Standards|Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS)]], code Z2801. This is one of the standards most often referred to in the industry with regards to tests on microbial activities (specifically bacteria) and in the JIS Z2801, two bacteria species are used as a standard, namely ''E. Coli'' and ''Staphylococcus aureus''. However, some companies may have the initiative to test more than just these two bacteria and may also replace ''Staphylococcus aureus'' with MRSA, the methicillin-resistant version of the same bacteria.

Again, different countries may choose to specify different types of microbes for testing especially if they identified some bacteria groups which are more intimidating in their countries due to specific reasons.

=== Anti-fungi ===
A common anti-fungi standard is the [[ASTM]] G21-09. Not all manufacturers will take the initiatives for product R&amp;D for anti-Fungi attributes. Manufacturers like [[Maica Laminates]] send their products for laboratory tests for certification following the ASTM G21-09 standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maica.com.my|title=maica|website=www.maica.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Formica (South America) partners with Microban Protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formica.com.br/microban/index_microban_ing.htm|title=Formica®: Presente no dia-a-dia de milhares de pessoas|first=Mid|last=Propaganda|website=www.formica.com.br|access-date=2011-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706152440/http://www.formica.com.br/microban/index_microban_ing.htm|archive-date=2011-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a company manufacturing additives, including the anti-bacterial additives.

=== Fire-resistant and flame-retardant ===
There are many different standards with regards to fire-resistant and flame-retardant properties of high-pressure decorative laminates. While different countries may have different standards for the building industry to adhere to, most countries may agree on some of the more common standards being used in the industry. Very often, just like other standards applicable to the industry, the tests may be European Standards with their equivalent in the US Standards.

For example, many Commonwealth countries may be comfortable with the British Standards 476 especially Parts 6 and 7, while there will still be US Standard equivalence in the ASTM.

=== Others ===
The list of tests applicable to decorative laminates will never be exhaustive. As the technology improves, there will be many more tests to ensure the safety of the products upon use by the end consumer, for example perhaps the tests on transfer of surface substance to food materials if prepared on the decorative laminates as a kitchen surface. The core tests will then also branch out based on the specific requirements and standards adopted by different countries.

=== "Green" certificates ===
Two of the internationally acknowledged "Green" certificates for decorative laminates are MAS Certified Green and GREENGUARD. The MAS Certified Green and GREENGUARD marks are to certify that the products have low chemical emissions. Chemicals tested include VOCs, formaldehyde and other harmful particles. The tests are based on single occupancy room with outdoor ventilation following the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007, ''Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mascertifiedgreen.com/page.asp?pg=emissions_test_methods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenguard.org/en/CertificationPrograms/CertificationPrograms_indoorAirQuality.aspx|title=Low Emitting Products to Improve Indoor Air Quality|website=www.greenguard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; GREENGUARD especially, has two main consideration, GREENGUARD and GREENGUARD GOLD. The GREENGUARD n GOLD was previously known as the GREENGUARD Children and Schools Certified, signifying its relevance of very low allowable chemical emissions levels to ensure the safety of young children and school environment.

There are also many other "Green" certifications, some which are requirements by the authorities before the product can be used as building materials. These include the ''Singapore Green Label'' which is recognised by the [[Global Ecolabelling Network|Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN)]] and all its member countries.&lt;ref name=GEN&gt;{{cite web|title=GEN: Global Ecolabelling Network :: Map of Members|url=http://www.globalecolabelling.net/members_associates/map/|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:Decorative laminate 07858.jpg|thumb|300px|Piece of kitchen countertop covered with decorative laminate]]
Decorative high-pressure laminates are usually used for furniture tops especially on flat surfaces, including cabinets and tables. Decorative compact laminates are sometimes constructed as toilet cubicle systems, laboratory tables and kitchen tops. Some new usage models include wall panels with conceptual designs and custom prints.&lt;ref&gt;For further information see [http://www.icdli.com www.icdli.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==
The popularity of large format printing using inkjet printers have given a cheaper alternative to decorative laminates, minus the quality. For most uninformed consumers, the large format printing are similar to laminates, and seem to offer more variety of designs and applications.  For example, large format prints can be printed on [http://stickerz.com/ wall stickers], and then installed on walls. Unlike decorative laminates, there are no special adhesive to be used, and the price may sometimes seem so much cheaper comparatively.

However, there are health considerations for large format prints because of the solvent inks used, especially with their relatively high concentrations of [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/flexo/flexosum/flexosum-chap5.pdf|title=Safer Choice - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OCSPP,OPPT,EETD|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrodeless plasma excitation''' methods include [[helicon discharge|helicon plasma]] sources, [[inductively coupled plasma]]s, and [[surface-wave-sustained mode|surface-wave-sustained]] discharges.

Electrodeless [[high-frequency discharge]]s (HF) have two important advantages over plasmas using [[electrode]]s, like [[capacitively coupled plasma]]s that are of great interest for contemporary plasma research and applications:

* Firstly, no [[sputtering]] of the electrodes occurs.  However, depending on ion energy, sputtering of the reactor walls or the substrate may still occur.  Under conditions typical for plasma modification purposes, the ion energy in electrodeless HF discharges is about an order of magnitude lower than in RF discharges.  This way, the contamination of the gas phase and damage of the substrate surface can be reduced.
* Secondly, the surface-wave effect allows to generate spatially extended plasmas with electron densities that exceed the [[critical plasma density|critical density]].

==BF-TEM and ADF-STEM tomography==

In the field of biology, bright-field [[transmission electron microscopy]] (BF-TEM) and high-resolution TEM ([[High-resolution transmission electron microscopy|HRTEM]]) are the primary imaging methods for tomography tilt series acquisition. However, there are two issues associated with BF-TEM and HRTEM. First, acquiring an interpretable 3-D tomogram requires that the projected image intensities vary monotonically with material thickness. This condition is difficult to guarantee in BF/HRTEM, where image intensities are dominated by phase-contrast with the potential for multiple contrast reversals with thickness, making it difficult to distinguish voids from high-density inclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S143192760550117X| title = Annular Dark Field Tomography in TEM| journal = Microscopy and Microanalysis| volume = 11| year = 2005| last1 = Bals | first1 = S. | last2 = Kisielowski | first2 = C. F. | last3 = Croitoru | first3 = M. | last4 = Tendeloo | first4 = G. V. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the contrast transfer function of BF-TEM is essentially a high-pass filter – information at low spatial frequencies is significantly suppressed – resulting in an exaggeration of sharp features. However, the technique of annular dark-field [[scanning transmission electron microscopy]] (ADF-STEM), which is typically used on material specimens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B.D.A. Levin, et al.|title=Nanomaterial datasets to advance tomography in scanning transmission electron microscopy|journal=Scientific Data |year=2016|volume=3|issue=160041|page=160041

ADF-STEM also acts as a low-pass filter, eliminating the edge-enhancing artifacts common in BF/HRTEM. Thus, provided that the features can be resolved, ADF-STEM tomography can yield a reliable reconstruction of the underlying specimen which is extremely important for its application in material science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3991(03)00105-0| title = 3D electron microscopy in the physical sciences: The development of Z-contrast and EFTEM tomography| journal = Ultramicroscopy| volume = 96| issue = 3–4| pages = 413–431| year = 2003| last1 = Midgley | first1 = P.

===Different tilting methods===
The most popular tilting methods are the single-axis and the dual-axis tilting methods. The geometry of most specimen holders and electron microscopes normally precludes tilting the specimen through a full 180° range, which can lead to artifacts in the 3D reconstruction of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B.D.A. Levin, et al.|title=Nanomaterial datasets to advance tomography in scanning transmission electron microscopy|journal=Scientific Data |year=2016|volume=3|issue=160041|page=160041

However, twice as many images need to be taken. Another method of obtaining a tilt-series is the so-called conical tomography method, in which the sample is tilted, and then rotated a complete turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In [[physics]], '''energy''' is the [[physical quantity|quantitative]] [[physical property|property]] that must be [[#Energy transfer|transferred]] to an [[Physical body|object]] in order to perform [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on, or to [[heat]], the object.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[second law of thermodynamics]] imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be {{em|[[waste heat|consumed]]}} in the form of [[heat]] instead. See e.g. {{cite journal |last1=Lehrman |first1=Robert L. |title=Energy Is Not The Ability To Do Work |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=15–18 |issn=0031-921X |doi=10.1119/1.2349846|bibcode=1973PhTea..11...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]; the law of [[conservation of energy]] states that energy can be [[Energy transformation|converted]] in form, but not created or destroyed. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].

Common forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].

[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].

Living organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]

The total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object – or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object – and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] – the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.]]
The word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐνέργεια|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.

In 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy – a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-226-76420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.&lt;ref name="jphysics"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey &amp; Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 – Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=978-0-7016-3777-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]
{{Main article|Units of energy}}

In 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the "Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the work (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

===Chemistry===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here --&gt;
In the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&amp;nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−''E''/''kT''&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]
{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&amp;nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of a given amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bicycle calculator – speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Bike Calculator |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals – to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie|Calories]] (6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[stearin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]
::&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
::C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 81.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 57CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 55H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
and some of the energy is used to convert [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] into [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].
::ADP + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The rest of the chemical energy in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:&lt;ref group=note&gt;These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the [[power (physics)|power]] output of the sprinter and the [[force (physics)|force]] of the weightlifter. A worker stacking shelves in a supermarket does more work (in the physical sense) than either of the athletes, but does it more slowly.&lt;/ref&gt;
:gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100&amp;nbsp;m race: 4&amp;nbsp;kJ
:gain in gravitational potential energy of a 150&amp;nbsp;kg weight lifted through 2&amp;nbsp;metres: 3&amp;nbsp;kJ
:Daily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficient (in the physical sense)]] in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real [[machine]]s manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in [[ecology]]: to take just the first step in the [[food chain]], of the estimated 124.7&amp;nbsp;Pg/a of carbon that is [[carbon fixation|fixed]] by [[photosynthesis]], 64.3&amp;nbsp;Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants,&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Akihito; Oikawa, Takehisa (2004).

===Earth sciences===
In [[Earth science#earth's energy|geology]], [[continental drift]], [[mountain|mountain ranges]], [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |title=Earth's Energy Budget |publisher=Okfirst.ocs.ou.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194704/http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[metereology|meteorological]] phenomena like wind, rain, [[hail]], snow, lightning, [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] are all a result of energy transformations brought about by [[solar energy]] on the [[atmosphere]] of the planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here --&gt;
In [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{Main article|Energy operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]
as a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.

===Relativity===
When calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically – using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;,
where
:''m'' is the mass of the body,
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
:''&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the rest energy.

For example, consider [[electron]]–[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the [[stress–energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system ("mass manifestations"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating ("energy manifestations"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy–momentum 4-vector]]).&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).

==Transformation==
{{Main article|Energy transformation}}

{{Forms of energy transfer}}
[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]
Energy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.

Examples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) to kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The equation can then be simplified further since &lt;math&gt;E_p = mgh&lt;/math&gt; (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt; (half&amp;nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding &lt;math&gt;E_p + E_k = E_{total}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J.J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&amp;nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~&lt;math&gt;9\times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.

==Conservation of energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}
The fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman&lt;/ref&gt;

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"/&gt; The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:&lt;ref name="RPF1"/&gt;
{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law – it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}

In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm ''The Laws of Thermodynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215201900/http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} including careful definitions of energy, free energy, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|year=1964|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=U.S.A| isbn=978-0-201-02115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As shown rigorously by [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of [[translational symmetry]] of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |title=Time Invariance |publisher=Ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210455/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } &lt;/math&gt;

which is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.

==Energy transfer==
===Closed systems===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]]. Here, the signs in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; represents the work done on the system, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes ignored, especially when the [[thermal efficiency]] of the transfer is high.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This simplified equation is the one used to define the [[joule]], for example.

===Open systems===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, one may write

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

==Thermodynamics==

===Internal energy===
[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

===First law of thermodynamics===
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7167-1088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the system and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work applied to the system.

===Equipartition of energy===
The energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system’s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

The '''Gasometer Oberhausen''' is a former [[gas holder]] in [[Oberhausen]], Germany, which has been converted into an exhibition space. It has hosted several large scale exhibitions, including two by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]. The Gasometer is an industrial landmark, and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] and [[the Industrial Heritage Trail]]. It was built in the 1920s, and reconstructed after [[World War II]].

==History==
In the 1920s the coal and steel industry in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] produced [[blast furnace gas]] and [[coal gas]] as a by-product of iron production and [[coking]], while the steel industry as well as coking used large amounts these gasses or alternative fuels. As supply and demand of gas varied independently, sometimes excess gas had to be [[gas flare|flared off]], while at other times additional fuel had to be purchased. The Gasometer was built as a buffer: storing excess gas and releasing it again when demand exceeded production.&lt;ref name=im /&gt;

The Gasometer was built by [[Gutehoffnungshütte]], by the side of the [[Rhine-Herne Canal]]. Construction started 27 February 1927 and cost 1.74 million [[Reichsmark]]. A framework of 24 steel girders was built on a concrete base, and a skin of 5mm thick sheet metal was riveted to the framework. Inside, a 1,207,000&amp;nbsp;kg pressure disc was mounted which could freely move up and down, floating on top of the gas underneath and keeping it at a constant pressure. 15 May 1929 the Gasometer was first put into operation, with a maximum capacity of 347,000m³, a height of 117.5m and diameter of 67.6m.&lt;ref name=im&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/~gpo202/denkmal/gasometer.htm|title=Industriedenkmäler – Gasometer}}&lt;/ref&gt;


During [[World War II]], the Gasometer was hit by bombs several times, but kept operating.&lt;ref name=gh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasometer.de/en/the-gasometer/history|title=History – Gasometer Oberhausen}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was shelled by allied forces it did not explode, but the gas burned up and the pressure disc slowly descended. The Gasometer officially stopped operating 31 December 1944. It was completely disassembled after it had caught fire during repair work on 10 June 1946. Reconstruction began 1949 using the original pressure disc and roof. By 1 June 1950 the Gasometer was operational again.&lt;ref name=im/&gt;

In 1977 the Gasometer was repainted, at a cost of 3.5 million DM. In later years many coking plants and iron works closed, reducing supply as well as demand for the gas stored in the Gasometer. In addition, natural gas became cheaper. The Gasometer became superfluous and in 1988 it was decommissioned by its owner, [[RAG AG|Ruhrkohle AG]].&lt;ref name=im/&gt;

A discussion ensued about the dismantling or possible reuse of the Gasometer. In 1992 the city council of Oberhausen, with a margin of 1 vote decided to acquire the building and convert it to an exhibition space. At the time, plans were being developed for building shopping mall ([[CentrO]]) on an adjacent plot, and [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park]] planned to use the Gasometer for its exhibition. Ownership transferred to the city of Oberhausen, with Ruhrkohle AG paying 1.8 million DM in saved demolition costs to the city.&lt;ref name=im/&gt;

Conversion and restoration were done by Deutsche Babcock AG in 1993–1994. The former pressure disc was fixed at 4.5m height, with a 3000m² exhibition space on the ground floor below. The main exhibition space, on top of the pressure disc, was fitted with a stage and seating for 500 people. Lifts and stairs were fitted to provide visitors access to the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasometer.de/en/the-gasometer/change|title=Change – Gasometer Oberhausen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion cost approximately DM 16 million.&lt;ref name=im/&gt;

'''Gran Gasoducto del Sur''' (also known as '''Venezuela-Argentina Gas Line''') was a proposed 8,000-15,000-kilometer (5,000-9,000&amp;nbsp;mi) long [[natural gas pipeline]] to connect [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. The overall project cost was expected to be around US$17-23&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=2006ipcr&gt;

==History==
On 9 December 2005, during an annual meeting of [[Mercosur]] in [[Montevideo]], the presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil signed an accord for the construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=ogj/&gt; 

In June 2007 [[Petrobras]] president Jose Sergio Gabrielli said that the pipeline would not become operational for 20 to 30 years. In July 2007 Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] said that interest in building the pipeline had cooled.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The exact route of the pipeline was never defined. It was only disclosed that the first {{convert|2950|km|mi}} section was to run from [[Puerto Ordaz]], Venezuela, through [[Rondônia]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Amapá]] states in Brazil to [[Marabá]], [[Pará]] state Brazil. In [[Manaus]], Amazonas State, the pipeline was to be connected to the [[Urucu–Manaus pipeline]] and the Urucu-Porto Velho pipeline. From [[Marabá]], a {{convert|1387|km|mi}} branch line to [[Fortaleza]], [[Ceará|Ceará State]] was foreseen. In [[Fortaleza]] the pipeline can be connected to the existing system that extends along the coast to [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia|Bahia State]] to be connected with the [[GASENE]] pipeline.&lt;ref name=ogj&gt;

 | date = 2006-01-09
 | accessdate=2008-05-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The second {{convert|1977|km|mi}} long section from [[Marabá]] was to continue southward to [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo State]]. From there, the pipeline was to be routed by the {{convert|1875|km|mi}} section to the border between [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State and [[Uruguay]] and then cross Uruguay to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=ogj/&gt;

==Technical features==
The Puerto Ordaz-[[Marabá]] section was planned to have a {{convert|66|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter and to have 13&amp;nbsp;compressor stations of 25,000&amp;nbsp;hp each. The diameter of the [[Marabá]]-[[Fortaleza]] branch as planned would gradually decrease from {{convert|36|in|mm|-1}} to {{convert|32|in|mm|-1}} and the branch project involves the installation of five 15,000&amp;nbsp;hp compression stations. The gas amount received in [[Fortaleza]] was planned to be 12.75&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per annum. The [[Marabá]]-[[São Paulo]] section was to be {{convert|54|in|mm|-1}} in diameter and to include eight 20,000&amp;nbsp;hp compression stations.  The gas delivered to [[São Paulo]] was planned to be 15&amp;nbsp;bcm per annum. The Brazil-Argentina section with capacity of 18&amp;nbsp;bcm per annum was to include eight 15,000&amp;nbsp;hp compressor stations.&lt;ref name=ogj/&gt;

==Financing==
The project was to be financed by [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.]], [[CAF - Development Bank of Latin America|Development Bank of Latin America]], and [[Caixa Econômica Federal]] with possible participation of other public institutions and private investors.&lt;ref name=ogj/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7242">In mathematics, a '''Hurewicz space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain basic [[selection principle]] that generalizes [[Σ-compact space|σ-compactness]]. A Hurewicz space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are finite sets &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}_1 \subset \mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subset \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that every point of the space belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; .

== History ==
In 1926, [[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurewicz|first=Witold|title=Über eine Verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01216792|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|language=de|volume=24|issue=1|pages=401–421|doi=10.1007/BF01216792|issn=0025-5874}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the above property of topological spaces that is formally stronger than the [[Menger space|Menger property]]. He didn't know whether [[Menger space|Menger's conjecture]] is true, and whether his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property, but he conjectured that in the class of metric spaces his property is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compactness.

== Hurewicz's conjecture ==
Hurewicz conjectured that in [[ZFC]] every Hurewicz metric space is σ-compact. Just, Miller, [[Marion Scheepers|Scheepers]], and Szeptycki&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Just|first=Winfried|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold W.|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul J.|date=1996-11-11|title=The combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|issue=3|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that Hurewicz's conjecture is false, by showing that there is, in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not σ-compact. Their proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom holds or not.

Bartoszyński and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon|date=2001-11-15|title=Continuous images of sets of reals|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864100000791|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=116|issue=2|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(00)00079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Boaz Tsaban|Tsaban]]'s solution based on their work &lt;ref&gt;Boaz Tsaban (2011), 'Menger's and Hurewicz's Problems: Solutions from "The Book"  and refinements', in "Set Theory and its Applications" Contemporary Mathematics 533, 211–226. https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5645&lt;/ref&gt; ) gave a uniform ZFC example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not σ-compact.

== Hurewicz's problem ==
Hurewicz asked whether in [[ZFC]] his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property. In 2002, Chaber and Pol in unpublished note, using dichotomy proof, showed that there is a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not Menger. In 2008, Tsaban and Zdomskyy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsaban|first=Boaz|last2=Zdomskyy|first2=Lyubomyr|date=2008-01-01|title=Scales, fields, and a problem of Hurewicz|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/doi/10.4171/JEMS/132|journal=Journal of the European Mathematical Society|volume=10|issue=3|pages=837–866|doi=10.4171/jems/132|issn=1435-9855|arxiv=math/0507043}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a uniform example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is Menger but not Hurewicz.

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Hurewicz property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. For functions &lt;math&gt;f,g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; f(n)\leq g(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many natural numbers &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt; f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded if it is not bounded. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Hurewicz iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is unbounded. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the [[Cichoń's diagram|bounding number &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;]] is Hurewicz.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Hurewicz game played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subset \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2\subset \mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

If every point of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; , then Bob wins the Hurewicz game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game (formally, a winning strategy is a function).

A topological space is Hurewicz iff Alice has no winning strategy in the Hurewicz game played on this space.&lt;ref name="coc12"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=69|pages=31–62|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood characterization ===
A [[Tychonoff space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hurewicz iff for every compact space &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; containing the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and a &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt; subset G of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; containing the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;X\subset Y\subset G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Properties ==
* Every compact, and even σ-compact, space is Hurewicz.
* Every Hurewicz space is a [[Menger space]], and thus it is a [[Lindelöf space]]
* Continuous image of a Hurewicz space is Hurewicz
* The Hurewicz property is closed under taking &lt;math&gt;F_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; subsets
* Hurewicz's property characterizes filters whose [[Mathias forcing]] notion does not add unbounded functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chodounský|first=David|last2=Repovš|first2=Dušan|last3=Zdomskyy|first3=Lyubomyr|date=2015-12-01|title=MATHIAS FORCING AND COMBINATORIAL COVERING PROPERTIES OF FILTERS|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/div-classtitlemathias-forcing-and-combinatorial-covering-properties-of-filtersdiv/725F31CB4B307A544531F56682D06B6D|journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=80|issue=4|pages=1398–1410|doi=10.1017/jsl.2014.73|issn=0022-4812|arxiv=1401.2283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ivlia''''' ([[bireme]]) is a modern reconstruction of an [[ancient Greek]] rowing warship ([[galley]]) with oars at two levels and an important example of [[experimental archaeology]]. Between 1989 and 1994, this vessel undertook six comprehensive international historical and geographical expeditions in the footsteps of the ancient seafarers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;International expedition "Black Sea".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ship construction ==

The main sponsor of construction of the ship was the [[Black Sea Shipping Company]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;On all her voyages, Ivlia’s sail bore the [[acronym]] BLASCO – the logo of this shipping company.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ivliaplan1.jpg|left|thumb]][[File:Ivliaplan2.jpg|left|thumb]]

[[File:Ivlia2.jpg|thumb|Construction of the ship]]

The ship was constructed in 1989 at the [[Sochi]] Naval Shipyard,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Soviet Naval Shipyard №1.&lt;/ref&gt; by a team under shipwright Damir S. Shkhalakhov, as well as the active participation of the future crew members. Ivlia was built from [[Durmast oak]] and [[Siberian larch]], the oars are of [[beech]]. Technical design of the project was carried out by specialists of the [[Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding|Nikolayev University of Shipbuilding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yachts.mykolayiv.com/index.html |title=Проектно-конструкторский Центр "ЯХТА" - проектирование парусно-моторных и моторных яхт |publisher=Yachts.mykolayiv.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After processing the available scientific data (ancient illustrations on [[vases]] and [[reliefs]], written and archaeological sources) members of the Odessa Archaeological Museum, under the leadership of prof. [[PhD]] Vladimir N. Stanko, proposed the building of a bireme since in antiquity it had been the most widely used vessel in the northern Black Sea region.

== Expedition route ==

Starting from [[Odessa]] ([[Ukraine]]) in 1989, ''Ivlia'' followed the routes of the ancient mariners on the Black Sea and the Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic, covering more than 3.000 [[nautical mile]]s in six expedition seasons and visiting over 50 European ports, finally sailing up the river [[Seine]] to reach [[Paris]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To celebrate the successful completion of the voyages, on behalf of the Mayor of Paris the future President of France, [[Jacques Chirac]], was received on board the Ivlia.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The expedition's progress was widely covered by the international media.&lt;ref group="note" name="SeeLiterature"&gt;See Literature.&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the voyage, hundreds of articles were published, along with dozens of TV and radio reports. The ship was regularly visited by official delegations and thousands of tourists. Ivlia also took part in international maritime festivals: «Colombo'92» ([[Genoa]], Italy), «Brest’92», «Cancal’93», «Whitbread Round the World Race '93» ([[Portsmouth]]) «Vieux Greements’94» (France). The radio constantly broadcast the expedition’s [[call sign]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;RB5FH/mm.&lt;/ref&gt; Over six seasons the crew members included more than 200 people – citizens of Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]], France, Greece and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

== Scientific aspects ==


The research programme of the expedition was developed by the authors of the project, together with the staff of the Odessa Archaeological Museum and the Nikolayev University of Shipbuilding, primarily to address the following objectives:
* Clarification of written and archaeological sources of data on the design, construction technology and load capacity of ancient Greek ships;
* Practical research into the [[seaworthiness]] of antique biremes. It is worth noting the high seaworthiness of the bireme, even with tailwinds of up to 7 on the [[Beaufort scale]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Even with no sails, Ivlia was able to maintain a stable course in stormy weather, solely as a result of [[windage]] from her high stern.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verification of [[cabotage]] routes of Hellenic sailors, as well as the possibility of galleys in antiquity making voyages on the open sea, out of sight of the coast;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the scientific world, there is continuing debate about how far the routes of ancient mariners were from the coastline. Many scholars believe that ancient seagoing ships were weak, and consequently their pilots tacked close to the shores. However, a coast unlit and unequipped with [[navigation mark]]s (as it was in ancient times), posed far more perils for navigation than the open sea. To this must be added the real threat of [[pirate]] attacks, since many of the coastal peoples engaged in [[brigandage]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarifying the details of ancient [[periplus]] and verifying a range of hypotheses (from the project authors) to localise the ancient Greek settlement of the North-Western Black Sea region;
* Mastering the ancient art of navigation, control of an antique vessel by sail, methods of mooring and anchoring galleys;
The practical experience gained on Ivlia's expeditions enabled the project authors to affirm:
* The level of [[cartography|cartographical]] advancement and navigational knowledge of the ancient Greeks and the seaworthiness of their ships were far higher than is commonly believed;
* Ancient mariners were perfectly able to orient by the stars, made open sea crossings, were unafraid of sailing away from the coast, were familiar with and skilfully used the prevailing winds and [[Sea current|currents]];
* The famous [[trireme]]s, which were distinguished by their outstanding performance in combat, were much less seaworthy than the biremes: they were built for battle and used in large naval campaigns;
* Biremes were the most common type of vessel used during the [[Colonies in antiquity|great Greek colonization]] of the Mediterranean. The geographical discoveries of antiquity were made on these vessels, suited as they were to long ocean voyages. As the most seaworthy ships of the time, it is most likely that biremes were used by the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] explorer [[Himilco]], for [[Hanno the Navigator]]'s explorations beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]], as well as [[Pytheas|Pytheas of Massalia's]] voyage to the legendary island of [[Thule]].
In addition, the research programme conducted on board Ivlia included the participation of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, the Institute of Water Transport [[Hygiene]], and other scientific centres of Ukraine. During the expedition, regular measurements were made of environmental parameters and the level of [[Marine pollution|pollution of the sea water]], assessments of the state of marine [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and a variety of medical experiments were conducted.
The data obtained during the six years of voyages are summarized in the articles and books subsequently published by the authors of the project.&lt;ref group="note" name="SeeLiterature" /&gt;
On the whole, Ivlia’s journey around Europe was a bright page in the study of Hellenic shipbuilding and seafaring, and also contributed to the strengthening of international cultural relations.

'''Jupiter mass''', also called '''Jovian mass''', is the [[units of mass|unit of mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]]. This value may refer to the mass of the [[planet]] alone, or the mass of the entire Jovian system to include the [[moons of Jupiter]]. Jupiter is by far the most [[giant planet|massive planet]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is approximately 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.&lt;ref name="Universe Today"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coffey |first=Jerry |title=Mass of Jupiter |url=https://www.universetoday.com/15141/mass-of-jupiter/ |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=18 June 2008 |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter mass is a common unit of [[mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other similarly-sized objects, including the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It may also be used to describe the masses of [[brown dwarf]]s, as this unit provides a convenient scale for comparison.

==Current best estimates==
The current best known value for the mass of Jupiter can be expressed as {{val|1898130|u=[[Orders of magnitude (mass)|yottagrams]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=(1.89813\;\pm\;0.00019)\times10^{27}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="JPL Planets"/&gt;
which is about 1000 times less massive than the sun (about {{solar mass|0.1%}}):
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=\frac{1}{1047.348644\;\pm\;0.000017}\;M_{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="CBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#MSMJ2009|website=maia.usno.navy.mil|publisher=IAU Working Group|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in scientific notation,
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 954.7919(15)\times10^{-6}\;M_{Sun} &lt;/math&gt;.
Compared to the mass of Earth, Jupiter is 318 times more massive.
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 317.82838\;M_\oplus &lt;/math&gt;.

==Context and implications==
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined—this is so massive that its [[barycenter]] with the [[Sun]] lies beyond the [[Photosphere|Sun's surface]] at 1.068&amp;nbsp;[[solar radius|solar radii]] from the Sun's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacDougal |first1=Douglas W. |title=Newton's Gravity |date=November 6, 2012 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781461454434 |pages=193–211 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |accessdate=July 28, 2016 |language=en |chapter=A Binary System Close to Home: How the Moon and Earth Orbit Each Other |quote=the barycenter is 743,000 km from the center of the sun. The Sun's radius is 696,000 km, so it is 47,000 km above the surface.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |series=Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the mass of Jupiter is so large compared to the other objects in the solar system, the effects of its gravity must be included when calculating satellite trajectories and the precise orbits of other bodies in the solar system, including Earth's moon and even Pluto.

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, its atmosphere would collapse, and the planet would shrink.&lt;ref name=Seager2007&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravitational constant==
The mass of Jupiter is derived from the measured value called the [[standard gravitational parameter|Jovian mass parameter]], which is denoted with ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''. The mass of Jupiter is calculated by dividing ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the constant ''[[gravitational constant|G]]''. For celestial bodies such as Jupiter, Earth and the Sun, the value of the ''GM'' product is known to many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more precisely than either factor independently. The limited precision available for ''G'' limits the uncertainty of the derived mass. For this reason, astronomers often prefer to refer to the gravitational parameter, rather than the explicit mass. The ''GM'' products are used when computing the ratio of Jupiter mass relative to other objects.

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the ''nominal Jovian mass parameter'' to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of {{Jupiter mass}}. This  constant is defined as exactly:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{GM})^\mathrm N_\mathrm J&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.2668653|e=17|u=m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
If the explicit mass of Jupiter is needed in SI units, it can be calculated in terms of the [[Gravitational constant]], ''G'' by dividing ''GM'' by ''G''.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1510.07674|last1=Mamajek|first1=E.

==Mass composition==
The majority of Jupiter's mass is hydrogen and helium. These two elements make up more than 87% of the total mass of Jupiter.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|last4=Saumon|first4=Didier|title=The Interior of Jupiter| url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/39188/1/Stevenson_2004p35.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total mass of heavy elements other than hydrogen and helium in the planet is between 11 and {{earth mass|45}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guillot|first1=Tristan|last2=Gautier|first2=Daniel|last3=Hubbard|first3=William B.|title=New Constraints on the Composition of Jupiter from Galileo Measurements and Interior Models|journal=Icarus|date=December 1997|volume=130|issue=2|pages=534–539|doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5812|arxiv=astro-ph/9707210|bibcode=1997Icar..130..534G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the hydrogen on Jupiter is solid hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Öpik|first1=E.J.|title=Jupiter: Chemical composition, structure, and origin of a giant planet|journal=Icarus|date=January 1962|volume=1|issue=1–6|pages=200–257|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(62)90022-2|bibcode=1962Icar....1..200O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that Jupiter contains a central dense core. If so, the mass of the core is predicted to be no larger than about {{earth mass|12}}. The exact mass of the core is uncertain due to the relatively poor knowledge of the behavior of solid hydrogen at very high pressures.&lt;ref name = "Jupiters Interior"/&gt;

The '''Kano air disaster''' was a chartered [[Boeing 707]] passenger flight on 22 January 1973 which crashed while attempting to land at [[Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport|Kano International Airport]].  It is the worst aviation disaster ever to take place in [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 19730122-0|title= JY-ADO}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 176 passengers and crew perished in the crash. There were 26 survivors.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved in the accident was a 2 year old [[Boeing 707]]-3D3C, JY-ADO, owned by Alia [[Royal Jordanian|Royal Jordanian Airlines]], operating on behalf of Nigeria Airways. It first flew in 1971 and was powered by 4 [[Pratt &amp; Whitney|Pratt and Whitney]] [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D|JT3D]] engines. It had a [[Serial code|manufacturer serial number]] (MSN) of 850.&lt;ref name="ASN" /&gt;

==Flight==
The Boeing 707, operated by [[Royal Jordanian|Alia]], had been chartered by [[Nigeria Airways]] to fly [[Hajj|pilgrims]] back from [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia]] to [[Lagos, Nigeria]]. Bad weather at Lagos caused the crew to divert to [[Kano, Nigeria|Kano]]. [[Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport|Kano International Airport]] was experiencing high winds at the time. The aircraft landed nose wheel first, and the nose wheel collapsed after hitting a depression in the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accident details|url = http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1973/1973-4.htm|website = www.planecrashinfo.com|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right main [[landing gear]] leg subsequently collapsed. The 707 turned 180 degrees, [[Runway excursion|excursed from the runway]] and caught fire.

Of the 202 passengers and crew on board, 176 died and only 26 survived. At the time it occurred, the Kano air disaster was the deadliest-ever aviation accident,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HKsvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=REwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5204,1605506&amp;dq=nigeria+airways+kano+crash&amp;hl=en|title=Ludington Daily News - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dubious distinction it only held for about 14 months when [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] crashed in France killing 346 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 19740303-1|title= TC-JAV|accessdate= 31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kashira Power Plant''' is a coal-fired power plant at [[Kashira]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]]. Its first unit was commissioned in 1922 with a power capacity of 110&amp;nbsp;MW. As of today, it has an installed power capacity of 1,910&amp;nbsp;MW and consists of 6 units. Double units 1 and 2 have capacity of 300&amp;nbsp;MW, and single units 4, 5 have capacity of 300&amp;nbsp;MW each, unit 6 has capacity of 330&amp;nbsp;MW. In addition, unit 7 has thermal capacity of 80&amp;nbsp;MW.

In 1951 a HVDC link with 30&amp;nbsp;MW built from the components of [[Elbe-Project]] to Moscow was built. However it is not in service any more. The power plant has an interesting feature as one of its two main chimneys serves as electricity pylon.

The '''Klydonograph''' is a device that records a surge in electrical voltage on a sulphur-dusted [[photographic film]]. The device is credited to [[John F. Peters]], who pursued the idea as a means of investigating the effects of [[lightning]] on [[electric power]] lines. The resulting graphic varies in size and shape as a function of the potential, [[Electrical polarity|polarity]], and wave shape of the captured lightning discharge.

Imaging an electrical impulse with sulphur dust was documented in 1777 by Dr. G. C Lichtenberg, and this idea was further developed by others (to include a photographic plate, for example) before being adopted by the Klydonograph.&lt;ref&gt;Central Station Engineers of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. &lt;u&gt;Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book&lt;/u&gt;. East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Klydonograph is generally used to record impulse voltages between 2 kV and 50 kV.

The '''Lovettsville air disaster''' occurred on August 31, 1940 near [[Lovettsville, Virginia]].  [[Capital Airlines|Pennsylvania Central Airlines]] Trip 19 was a new [[Douglas DC-3|Douglas DC-3A]] that was flying through an intense thunderstorm at {{convert|6000|ft|m}}. Numerous witnesses reported seeing a large flash of lightning shortly before it nosed over and plunged to earth in an [[alfalfa]] field. With limited accident investigation tools at the time, it was at first believed that the most likely cause was the plane flying into windshear, but the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] report concluded that the probable cause was a lightning strike.&lt;ref name="CABReport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Causes of U.S. accidents |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1940/1940%20-%203661.html?search=Lovettsville |format=PDF |publisher=Flight |date=December 19, 1940 |pages=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator [[Ernest Lundeen]] from [[Minnesota]] was one of the 25 people (21 passengers and 4 crew members) killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death in the Blue Ridge |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764600,00.html |work=Time |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date=1940-09-09 |accessdate=2009-04-14  |quote=The news of the worst crash in the history of U.

"Trip 19", as it was designated, was under the command of Captain Lowell V. Scroggins with First Officer J. Paul Moore. The pilot and copilot had over eleven thousand and six thousand hours experience respectively, although only a few hundred of those hours were on DC-3s. In the [[jump seat]] rode a new administrative employee of the airline, hired on August 26.&lt;ref name="CABReport" /&gt;

The DC-3A was newly delivered from the [[Douglas Aircraft]] on May 25, 1940 equipped with twin [[Curtiss-Wright]] [[Wright Cyclone#R-1820 Cyclone 9|R-1820 Cyclone 9]] engines (also designated as G-102-A).&lt;ref name="CABReport" /&gt;

The CAB investigation of the accident was the first major investigation to be conducted under the [[Bureau of Air Commerce]] act of 1938.&lt;ref name="CABReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baesel.net/capaccidents/1940.08.31_PennsylvaniaCentralAirlinesCorp_DouglasDC-3-A.pdf |title=Report of the Civil Aeronautics Board |publisher=[[Civil Aeronautics Board]] |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SbhQHMNH?url=http://www.baesel.net/capaccidents/1940.08.31_PennsylvaniaCentralAirlinesCorp_DouglasDC-3-A.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mythewaterworks.jpg|thumb|The Mythe Waterworks viewed from the Beaufort Bridge, carrying the A38 over the Old Avon.]]
The '''Mythe Water Treatment Works''' in [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]] is a facility which treats water drawn from the [[River Severn]].

On 1 March 2002, [[Severn Trent]] Water worked with local councillors to create an emergency plan, which was supposed to ensure that in a state of emergency their services would not be affected. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.tewkesbury.gov.uk/council/news/index.asp?id=103 |title=Visitors to The Mythe Water Treatment Works Tewkesbury |accessdate=2007-07-24 |format= |work=Tewkesbury Council }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It came to national attention in July 2007 when it became inundated with water from the [[River Severn]] during the [[Summer 2007 United Kingdom floods]]. The water coming into the plant was contaminated, and this led to the loss of tap water for approximately 150,000 people in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Tewkesbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=231771&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=231754&amp;home=yes&amp;more_nodeId1=231776&amp;contentPK=17909093 |title=Battle to restore water begins |accessdate=2007-07-24 |format= |work=This is Gloucestershire }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PacWind, Inc.''' is a [[wind turbine]] manufacturing company based in [[Torrance, California]], [[United States]].

== History ==
The company was founded in 1998, and released their first patented [[VAWT|vertical axis wind turbines]] in May 2006.&lt;ref name=Biz&gt;Business Wire, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15343857_ITM ''PacWind Technology's Scaleable &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Efficiently and Quietly Generates Electricity for Remote Locations''], May 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REW&gt;RenewableEnergyWorld.com, [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=45071 ''Two Small Wind Turbine Developments Propel Industry Upward''], June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, they added another two models of turbines to their product lineup.&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;Energy Resource, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32160207_ITM ''PacWind Begins Rollout of New Wind Power Products''], February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, certain intellectual property assets of PacWind were acquired by WePOWER, LLC. Since then, the original PacWind website has gone offline, and none of the original turbine designs are available for sale.  The WePOWER product lineup as of the end of 2009 were the Falcon series turbines ranging from 600W to 12&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wepower.us/products/ WePOWER, LLC - Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable installations ==
On May 17, 2007, PacWind gained a large amount of publicity when [[television|TV]] personality [[Jay Leno]] announced that, as part of an ongoing project with [[Popular Mechanics]], he would be having one of the 'Delta II' (10Kw) model turbines installed on the roof of his garage.&lt;ref name=Leno&gt;Stuart, Ben, [http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/jay_leno_garage/4216780.html?series=11 ''Jay Leno Builds a Wind Turbine on His Green Garage''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404021023/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/jay_leno_garage/4216780.html?series=11 |date=2008-04-04 }}, [[Popular Mechanics]], May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Carpenter, Susan, ''[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/highway1/la-hy-lenoside7nov07,0,7196712.story Green goes Jay Leno's Big Dog Garage]'', Los Angeles Times, November 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[I Spy Bill Nye]]" episode of ''[[Living With Ed]]'', [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] has a 'SeaHawk' (500w) model turbine installed on the roof of his house.&lt;ref name=Ed&gt;Living With Ed Episode Guide, [http://www.livingwithed.net/eguide.asp?CID=11&amp;xepisode=Season%202 I Spy Bill Nye]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixteen of PacWind's turbines were used in the design of the first eco-friendly billboard in [[Times Square]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;Glenn Collins, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/nyregion/15billboard.html?_r=1 In Times Square, a Company’s Name in (Wind- and Solar-Powered) Lights]'', [[New York Times]], November 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2472">The '''palladium-hydrogen electrode''' (abbreviation: Pd/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the common [[reference electrode]]s used in [[electrochemistry|electrochemical study]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cormet.fi/pdf/PDF_Pd-H2.pdf Operation principle of Pd/H2 reference electrode]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its characteristics are similar to the [[standard hydrogen electrode]] (with [[platinum]]). But [[palladium]] has one significant feature—the capability to absorb (dissolve into itself) molecular [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0022-3735/1/6/424 A palladium-hydrogen probe electrode for use as a microreference electrode]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://neon.otago.ac.nz/research/mfc/pubs/co2-ph/pdh-electrode.pdf Palladium-hydrogen electrodes for coulometric titration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrode operation==
Two phases can coexist in palladium when hydrogen is absorbed:
*alpha-phase at hydrogen concentration less than 0.025 atoms per atom of palladium
*beta-phase at hydrogen concentration corresponding to the [[non-stoichiometric]] formula PdH&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;

The electrochemical behaviour of a palladium electrode in equilibrium with H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in solution parallels the behaviour of palladium with molecular hydrogen

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_2  = \mathrm{H}_{ads} = \mathrm{H}_{abs}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the equilibrium is controlled in one case by the partial pressure or [[fugacity]] of molecular hydrogen and in other case—by [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions in solution.

:&lt;math&gt;E=E^0 + {RT \over F}\ln {a_{\mathrm{H}^+} \over (\frac{p_{\mathrm{H}2}}{p^0})^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

When palladium is electrochemically charged by hydrogen, the existence of two phases is manifested by a constant [[potential]] of approximately +50 mV compared to the [[reversible hydrogen electrode]]. This potential is independent of the amount of hydrogen absorbed over a wide range. This property has been utilized in the construction of a palladium/hydrogen [[reference electrode]]. The main feature of such electrode is an absence of non-stop bubbling of molecular hydrogen through the solution as it is absolutely necessary for the [[standard hydrogen electrode]].

'''Panel generation factor''' (PGF) [1] is used while calculating the size of [[solar photovoltaic cell]]s. It is a varying factor depending upon the climate of the site location (depending upon global geographic location).

For example: in Thailand it is 3.43, in EU countries it is 2.93, etc. This factor is used in calculation of "Total Watt-Peak Rating" while designing the size of solar photovoltaic cells. Therefore, "Total Watt-Peak Rating" = "Total Watt-hours per day needed/generated from the PV modules" divided by "PGF".
"Total Watt-Hours per Day" = "Total Watt-hours per day needed by appliances" Multiplied by "1.3 times" (the energy lost in the system).
Now, to calculate "size of PV cells" OR "number of PV cells" just divide the above obtained "Total Watt-Peak Rating" by "Watt-Peak of each cell OR Watt-Peak of each square meter size", whichever is convenient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">A '''phugoid''' or '''fugoid''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|juː|ɡ|ɔɪ|d}} is an aircraft motion in which the vehicle pitches up and climbs, and then pitches down and descends, accompanied by speeding up and slowing down as it goes "downhill" and "uphill". This is one of the basic [[aircraft dynamic modes|flight dynamics modes]] of an [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] (others include [[short period]], [[dutch roll]], and [[spiral divergence]]), and a classic example of a [[negative feedback]] system.
[[File:Phugoid8.png|400px|thumb|right|A [[diagram]]matic representation of a [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing airplane]] in phugoid]]

==Detailed description==
The phugoid has a nearly constant [[angle of attack]] but varying [[pitch (flight)|pitch]], caused by a repeated exchange of [[airspeed]] and [[altitude]]. It can be excited by an [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] singlet (a short, sharp deflection followed by a return to the centered position) resulting in a [[pitch (flight)|pitch]] increase with no change in [[trim tab|trim]] from the [[cruise (flight)|cruise]] condition. As speed decays, the nose drops below the horizon. Speed increases, and the nose climbs above the horizon. Periods can vary from under 30 seconds for [[light-sport aircraft|light aircraft]] to minutes for [[airliner|larger aircraft]]. [[Ultralight aviation|Microlight aircraft]] typically show a phugoid period of 15&amp;ndash;25 seconds, and it has been suggested that birds and model airplanes show convergence between the phugoid and short period modes. A classical model for the phugoid period can be simplified to about (0.85 × speed in [[knot (unit)|knots]]) seconds, but this only really works for larger aircraft.

Phugoids are often demonstrated to student [[aviator|pilot]]s as an example of the speed stability of the aircraft and the importance of proper trimming. When it occurs, it is considered a nuisance, and in lighter airplanes (typically showing a shorter period) it can be a cause of [[pilot-induced oscillation]].

The phugoid, for moderate amplitude,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hampson Grant, ''Model Airplane Design and Theory of Flight'', Jay, New York, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; occurs at an effectively constant angle of attack, although in practice the angle of attack actually varies by a few tenths of a degree. This means that the stalling angle of attack is never exceeded, and it is possible (in the &lt;1g section of the cycle) to fly at speeds below the known stalling speed. Free flight models with badly unstable phugoid typically stall or loop, depending on thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Laumer, ''How to Design and Build Flying Models'', Harper, New York, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

An unstable or divergent phugoid is caused, mainly, by a large difference between the incidence angles of the wing and tail. A stable, decreasing phugoid can be attained by building a smaller stabilizer on a longer tail, or, at the expense of pitch and yaw "static" stability, by shifting the center of gravity to the rear.

The term "phugoid" was coined by [[Frederick W. Lanchester]], the British aerodynamicist who first characterized the phenomenon. He derived the word from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|φυγή}} and {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} to mean "flight-like" but recognized the diminished appropriateness of the derivation given that {{lang|grc|φυγή}} meant flight in the sense of "escape" rather than vehicle flight.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick William Lanchester, ''Aerodonetics: Constituting the second volume of a complete work on aerial flight'', (London, England: Archibald Constant Co. Ltd., 1908), [https://archive.org/stream/aerodoneticscon02lancgoog#page/n13/mode/2up p. viii] and [https://archive.org/stream/aerodoneticscon02lancgoog#page/n371/mode/2up p. 348.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation incidents==
{{Main|Flight with disabled controls}}

In the [[1975 Tan Son Nhut C-5 accident]], USAF C-5 68-0218 with flight controls damaged by failure of the rear cargo/pressure door, encountered phugoid oscillations while the crew was attempting a return to base, and crash-landed in a rice paddy adjacent to the airport. Of the 328 people on board, 153 died, making it the deadliest accident involving a US military aircraft.

In 1985, [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] lost all hydraulic controls and its vertical stabiliser, and went into phugoid motion. While the crew were able to maintain near-level flight through the use of engine power, the plane lost height over a mountain range northwest of Tokyo before crashing into [[Mount Takamagahara]]. With 520 deaths, it remains the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history.

In 1989, [[United Airlines Flight 232]] suffered an uncontained [[turbine engine failure|engine failure]] that caused total [[hydraulic system]] failure. The crew flew the aircraft with [[aircraft engine controls|throttle]] only. Suppressing the phugoid tendency was particularly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19890719-1 ASN Aircraft accident description McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 N1819U - Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX)]&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots reached [[Sioux Gateway Airport]] but crashed during the landing attempt. The pilots and a majority of the passengers survived.

Another aircraft that lost all hydraulics was a [[DHL Aviation|DHL]] operated [[Airbus A300B4]] that was hit by a [[surface-to-air missile]] fired by the Iraqi resistance in the [[2003 Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident]]. This was the first time that a crew landed an air transport aircraft safely by only adjusting engine thrust.

The 2003 crash of the [[Helios Prototype#Crash|Helios solar-powered aircraft]] was precipitated by reacting to an inappropriately diagnosed phugoid oscillation that ultimately made the aircraft structure exceed design loads.&lt;ref&gt;'Investigation of the Helios Prototype Aircraft Mishap Volume I Mishap Report', Thomas E. Noll, NASA Langley Research Center, 2004, http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64317main_helios.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesley ("Sully") Sullenberger, Captain of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] that [[wiktionary:ditch#Verb|ditched]] in the [[Hudson River]] on January 15, 2009, said in a Google talk that the landing could have been less violent had the anti-phugoid software installed on the [[Airbus A320-214]] not prevented him from manually getting maximum lift during the four seconds before water impact.&lt;ref&gt;Sully Sullenberger: "Making a Difference" Talks at Google, 2012, (40:23) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKuw49KBywA&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">'''Sectional density''' is the ratio of an object's mass to its cross-sectional area with respect to a given axis. It conveys how well an object's mass is distributed (by its shape) to overcome resistance along that axis. For illustration, a nail can penetrate a target medium with its pointed end first with less force than a coin of the same mass lying flat on the target medium.

Sectional density is used in [[Ballistics#Gun_ballistics|gun ballistics]]. It is defined either as a projectile's mass divided by its cross sectional area, or as a projectile's mass ''in pounds'' divided by the square of (pi*rad) x by 2 = sq area ''in inches''.

During [[World War II]] [[bunker buster|bunker-busting]] [[Röchling shell]]s were developed by German engineer [[August Cönders]], based on the theory of increasing sectional density to improve penetration. Röchling shells were tested in 1942 and 1943 against the Belgian [[Fort d'Aubin-Neufchâteau]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://derelicta.pagesperso-orange.fr/aubin3.htm Les étranges obus du fort de Neufchâteau {{fr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and saw very limited use during World War II.

== Formula ==
=== General ===
In a physics context sectional density is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; SD = \frac{M}{A} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4jzcfLhBcYC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=sectional+density+cross+sectional+area&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B5o83WijST&amp;sig=V4thGb0Z4lYlnYbf9ymF2N_qsrs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K3AOVbDJK8eVNoPYgig&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=sectional%20density%20cross%20sectional%20area&amp;f=false Wound Ballistics: Basics and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;
* SD is the sectional density
* M is the mass of the projectile
* A is the cross-sectional area
 		 	
=== Ballistics ===
In a ballistics context sectional density of [[circle|circular]] cross-sections is most commonly defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; SD = \frac{ M_\mathrm{lb} }{ {''r'' _\mathrm{in}}^2} = \frac{ M_\mathrm{gr} }{ 7000 \, {''r''_\mathrm{in}}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chuckhawks.com/sd.htm The Sectional Density of Rifle Bullets By Chuck Hawks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbmballistics.com/ballistics/topics/secdens.shtml Sectional Density and Ballistic Coefficients]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chuckhawks.com/sd_beginners.htm Sectional Density for Beginners By Bob Beers]&lt;/ref&gt;
* SD is the sectional density
* M&lt;sub&gt;lb&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the projectile '''in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]'''
* M&lt;sub&gt;gr&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the projectile '''in [[Grain (unit)|grains]]'''
* ''r'' &lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the projectile the square of (pi*rad) x by 2 = sq area  '''in inches'''	
&lt;!-- =  \approx {p}        * p is [[pressure]] --&gt;	
The sectional density defined this way is usually presented without units.  
&lt;!-- Units of pressure are kgf/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. --&gt;
&lt;!-- In Europe the derivative unit g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also used in literature regarding [[small arms]] projectiles to get a number in front of the decimal separator.{{citation needed}} --&gt;

== Historical background ==
For historical reasons, within the field of ballistics it is often assumed that the unit of mass is the pound, and the unit of length is the inch.  For example: ".357 magnum" (not ".357 inch magnum"). By fixing the units, quantities can be treated as dimensionless.

== Use in ballistics ==
The sectional density of a projectile can be employed in two areas of [[ballistics]].  Within [[external ballistics]], when the sectional density of a projectile is divided by its coefficient of form (form factor in commercial small arms jargon&lt;ref&gt;''Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading:Rifle,Pistol Vol. II'' (1973) Hornady Manufacturing Company, Fourth Printing July 1978, p505&lt;/ref&gt;); it yields the projectile's [[ballistic coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Litz. Applied Ballistics for Long Range Shooting.&lt;/ref&gt;
sectional density has the same (implied) units as the [[ballistic coefficient]].

Within [[terminal ballistics]], the sectional density of a projectile is one of the determining factors for projectile penetration. The interaction between projectile (fragments) and target media is however a complex subject. A study regarding hunting bullets shows that besides sectional density several other parameters determine bullet penetration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rathcoombe.net/sci-tech/ballistics/wounding.html Shooting Holes in Wounding Theories: The Mechanics of Terminal Ballistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacPherson D: Bullet Penetration—Modeling the Dynamics and the Incapacitation Resulting From Wound Trauma. Ballistics Publications, El Segundo, CA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsgroup.co.za/articlesd.html Sectional Density - A Practical Joke? By Gerard Schultz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only if all other factors are equal, the projectile with the greatest amount of sectional density will penetrate the deepest.

'''Segmented turning''' is turning on a [[lathe]] where the initial workpiece is composed of multiple glued-together parts.  The process involves gluing up several pieces of wood to create patterns and visual effects in turned projects.

Segmented turning is also known as polychromatic turning.
[[File:segmented vase 318.jpg|thumb|A ring-constructed turning]]

In traditional wood turning, the template is a single piece of wood.  The size, grain orientation and colors of the wood, will frame how it can be turned into an object like a bowl, platter, or vase.  With segmented turning, the size and patterns are limited only by imagination, skill and patience.

While the vast majority of segmented turnings are vessels of one sort or another, strictly speaking, any turned object comprising multiple pieces of glued wood could be classified as a segmented turning.  Examples include pens, bowls, vases, salt mills, pepper mills, and rolling pins.  By cutting and re-assembling pieces after they are turned, unique forms can be created, crossing over to pure art.  See for example the work of Malcolm Tibbetts.

In addition to design skills, segmented turning demands precision woodworking skills as well as turning skills.  Design and construction of a bowl blank—the wood piece mounted on the lathe for turning a vessel—requires angled miter joints cut to tolerances of as little as a tenth of one degree or better.

There are essentially two different techniques for constructing a bowl blank, ring construction and [[stave (wood)|stave]] construction.

Ring construction is the most common.  A ring-constructed blank comprises rings glued in a cylindrical stack.  Though a platter or shallow bowl could be made from a single ring, stacking many rings is more typical. Apart from a lid or a base made and added after the fact, the height of the finished piece is a function of number of rings, and the height of each ring, which can vary for effect.  Each ring comprises three or more pieces cut and glued to form a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, etc.  The more pieces in a ring, the more challenging for the turner, because there are more opportunities for precision errors—gaps and misalignments in the joints between pieces.  The individual pieces making up a ring themselves are often assembled from smaller pieces of contrasting or complementary colors to achieve striking patterns in the finished piece.  This too adds to the complexity and challenge for the turner.

Native American pottery, basket, and textile designs, particularly from the southwest U.S., frequently inspire form and design features.  These patterns are often geometric in design and thus are easier to recreate than more fluid forms found in nature.

Stave constructions are assembled like barrels—cylinders constructed from multiple long, vertically oriented pieces.  As a rule, the grain in a ring-constructed turning runs horizontally in the finished piece, while the grain in a stave-constructed turning runs vertically, from top to bottom.

Another category of segmented turning called Open Segmented Turning is similar to ring construction but small gaps are left between the segments. Successive rings are offset so the segments interlock with the ring above and below. This type of segmentation seems very delicate and is somewhat transparent but it is generally quite strong. This concept was introduced by Yosh Sugiyama in the early 1980s. For example see the work of William Smith.

A segmented turning can combine ring construction, stave construction, and solid, non-segmented wood as well in a single piece.  However, wood expands and contracts in the direction perpendicular to its grain as a function of its moisture content, itself a function of ambient humidity.  In this case, during design and assembly, the turner has to be mindful of the impact on long term structural integrity of assembling the constituent pieces into incompatible, non-parallel grain directions.

[[Image:bernsteinBowls.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of bowls from boards]]An important variation of the ring construction technique is known as "bowl from a board."  Imagine a flat, square board bisected to create two identical rectangles, like two twin beds placed side-by-side to form a king-sized, square bed.  Rings are created by cutting concentric semicircles from each of the two boards, one concentric half-ring a mirrored-shape of a half-ring from the other.  The semicircles are typically cut with a bandsaw, but a scrollsaw, jigsaw, or coping saw would work.  The blade of the saw used to cut the semicircles is set at an angle from the vertical, typically 45-60 degrees, such that when each mirrored pair is glued together to form a complete ring, the rings are shaped like cross sections of a cone.  The rings are then stacked to create a cone-shaped blank.  An incredible variety of visual effects can be achieved as a function of how the boards are constructed before the concentric rings are cut.

There are ongoing discussions as to whether turning is a trade, craft, or an art form.  Turning in its original form was certainly utilitarian. If your last name is "Turner" chances are there was a production wood turner some generations ago in your family tree.  Many turners produce spindle work for furniture, architectural work, toys, and bowls.  But in recent years, many artists use turned pieces as a canvas for [[Wood carving|carving]], [[pyrography]], [[gold leaf]] work, [[inlay]], [[Wood stain|stain]] and [[painting]].

'''Snowpack''' forms from layers of [[snow]] that accumulate in geographic regions and high [[altitude]]s where the [[climate]] includes cold weather for extended periods during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed [[stream]]s and [[river]]s as they [[melting|melt]]. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of [[flood]]ing (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to [[glacier]]s in their [[accumulation zone]].

'''Sulfur tetrafluoride''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula [[sulfur|S]][[fluorine|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is a colorless gas. It is a corrosive species that releases dangerous [[Hydrofluoric acid|HF]] upon exposure to water or moisture. Despite these unwelcome characteristics, this compound is a useful [[reagent]] for the preparation of [[fluorocarbon|organofluorine compounds]],&lt;ref&gt;C.-L. J. Wang, "Sulfur Tetrafluoride" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are important in the pharmaceutical and [[specialty chemical]] industries.

==Structure==
Sulfur in SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is in the formal +4 [[oxidation state]]. Of sulfur's total of six [[valence electron]]s, two form a [[lone pair]]. The structure of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can therefore be anticipated using the principles of [[VSEPR theory]]: it is a [[Seesaw (chemistry)|see-saw shape]], with S at the center. One of the three equatorial positions is occupied by a nonbonding [[lone pair]] of electrons. Consequently, the molecule has two distinct types of F ligands, two [[Axis of rotation|axial]] and two [[equatorial bond|equatorial]]. The relevant bond distances are {{nowrap|S–F&lt;sub&gt;ax&lt;/sub&gt;}} =&amp;nbsp;164.3&amp;nbsp;pm and {{nowrap|S–F&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;}} =&amp;nbsp;154.2&amp;nbsp;pm. It is typical for the axial ligands in [[hypervalent]] molecules to be bonded less strongly. In contrast to SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the related molecule SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has sulfur in the 6+ state, no valence electrons remain nonbonding on sulfur, hence the molecule adopts a highly symmetrical octahedral structure. Further contrasting with SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is extraordinarily inert chemically.

The &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrum of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reveals only one signal, which indicates that the axial and equatorial F atom positions rapidly interconvert via [[pseudorotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis and manufacture==
SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is produced by the reaction of [[sulfur dichloride|SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium fluoride|NaF]] in [[acetonitrile]]:&lt;ref name=IS&gt;F. S. Fawcett, C. W. Tullock, "Sulfur (IV) Fluoride: (Sulfur Tetrafluoride)" Inorganic Syntheses, 1963, vol. 7, pp 119–124. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470132388.ch33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3 SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 NaF  →  SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 NaCl

SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is also produced in the absence of solvent at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name=IN&gt;Tullock C. W.; Fawcett F. S.; Smith W. C.; Coffman D. D. (1960) "The Chemistry of Sulfur Tetrafluoride. I. The Synthesis of Sulfur Tetrafluoride" J. Am. Chem. Soc., 82 (3), pp 539–542 {{DOI|10.1021/ja01488a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TP&gt;Tullock C.W. (1961).  "Synthesis of Sulfur Tetrafluoride". United States Patent [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2992073.pdf 2992073].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at high yield is produced using [[sulfur|sulfur (S)]], [[sodium fluoride|NaF]] and [[chlorine|chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in the absence of reaction medium, also at less-desirable elevated reaction temperatures (e.g. 225-450 °C).&lt;ref name=IN/&gt;&lt;ref name=TP/&gt;

A low temperature (e.g. ambient-86 °C) method of producing SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at high yield, without the requirement for reaction medium, has been demonstrated utilizing [[bromine|bromine (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] instead of [[chlorine|chlorine (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[sulfur|S]] and [[potassium fluoride|KF]]:&lt;ref&gt;Winter, R.W.; Cook P.W. (2010). "A simplified and efficient bromine-facilitated SF4-preparation method". J. Fluorine Chem. 131: 780-783. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jfluchem.2010.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:S  +  (2+x) Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 KF  →  SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;↑  +  x Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 KBr

==Use of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for the synthesis of fluorocarbons==
In [[organic synthesis]], SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used to convert COH and C=O groups into CF and CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Hasek, W. R.
| title = 1,1,1-Trifluoroheptane
| collvol = 5
| collvolpages = 1082 | prep = cv5p1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[alcohol]]s readily give the corresponding [[fluorocarbon]]. [[Ketones]] and [[aldehydes]] give geminal difluorides. The presence of protons alpha to the carbonyl leads to side reactions and diminished (30–40%) yield. Also diols can give cyclic sulfite esters, (RO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO. Carboxylic acids convert to trifluoromethyl derivatives. For example, treatment of heptanoic acid with SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 100-130&amp;nbsp;°C produces 1,1,1-trifluoroheptane. [[Hexafluoro-2-butyne]] can be similarly produced from [[acetylenedicarboxylic acid]]. The coproducts from these fluorinations, including unreacted SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; together with SOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are toxic but can be neutralized by their treatment with aqueous KOH.

The use of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is being superseded in recent years by the more conveniently handled [[diethylaminosulfur trifluoride]], Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, "DAST", where Et = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Fauq, "N,N-Diethylaminosulfur Trifluoride" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This reagent is prepared from SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = W. J. Middleton | author2 = E. M. Bingham | title = Diethylaminosulfur Trifluoride | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 440 | prep = cv6p0440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiNEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NSF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiF

==Other reactions==
[[Sulfur chloride pentafluoride]] ({{chem|SF|5|Cl}}), a useful source of the SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; group, is prepared from SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nyman&gt;Nyman, F., Roberts, H. L., Seaton, T. Inorganic Syntheses, 1966, Volume 8, p. 160 McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., 1966, {{doi|10.1002/9780470132395.ch42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrolysis of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives [[sulfur dioxide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 HF

This reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of [[thionyl fluoride]], which usually does not interfere with the use of SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a reagent.&lt;ref name=IS/&gt;

[[Image:Blighty.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A shell case embossed with an image of two wounded Tommies approaching the White Cliffs of Dover]]

'''Trench art''' is any decorative item made by soldiers, prisoners of war, or civilians where the manufacture is directly linked to armed conflict or its consequences. It offers an insight not only to their feelings and emotions about the war, but also their surroundings and the materials they had available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/whats-on/world-war-one-centenary/personal-treasures-wwi-trench-art/|title=Personal Treasures: WWI Trench Art|website=New Zealand Army Museum|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not limited to the World Wars, the history of trench art spans conflicts from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to the present day. Although the practice flourished during World War I, the term 'trench art' is also used to describe souvenirs manufactured by service personnel during World War II. Some items manufactured by soldiers, prisoners of war or civilians during earlier conflicts have been retrospectively described as trench art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Categorisation ==
There are four broad categories of trench art:

===Items made by soldiers===
{{multiple image

 | image1 = "Andrée".jpg
 | image2 = "Eléonore".jpg
 }}
There is much evidence to prove that some trench art was made in the trenches, by soldiers, during war.

In ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', [[George Coppard]] tells of pressing his uniform buttons into the clay floor of his trench, then pouring molten lead from shrapnel into the impressions to cast replicas of the regimental crest.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Chalk carvings were also popular, with contemporary postcards showing carvings in the rocky outcrops of [[Dugout (military)|dug-outs]].{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Many smaller items such as rings and knives were made by soldiers either in front line or support trenches, especially in quieter parts of the line.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Wounded soldiers were encouraged to work at crafts as part of their recuperation, with embroidery and simple forms of woodwork being common. Again from ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', George Coppard recalls that, while recuperating from wounds at a private house in [[Birkenhead]], "one kind old lady brought a supply of coloured silks and canvas and instructed us in the art of [[embroidery]]. A sampler which I produced under her guidance so pleased her that she had it framed for me."

An example of therapeutic embroidery during World War I is the work of British military in Egypt, who were photographed sewing and embroidering for Syrian refugees. There was also the Bradford Khaki Handicrafts Club, which was funded in Bradford, UK, in 1918, to provide occupational therapy and employment for men returning from the trenches in France|url=https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/organisations-and-movements/charities/bradford-khaki-handicrafts-club.

===Items made by POWs and internees===
The second category consists of items made by prisoners of war and interned civilians.

[[Prisoners of war|POWs]] had good reasons to make decorative objects: free time and limited resources. Much POW work was therefore done with the express intention of trading the finished article for food, money or other privileges.

Reference to POW work is made in the recollections of A B Baker, W.A.A.C., contained in the book ''Everyman at War'', published by Purdom in 1930:
"Part of my work had to do with prisoners quartered in a camp near to our own. Those Germans were friendly men. They were clever with their hands, and would give me little carvings which they had made."

===Items made by civilians===
[[File:Trench Art.JPG|left|thumb|Chromed metal trench art ashtray made from a 25 pounder shell casing, 1942]]
The third category is items made by civilians, which mainly means civilians in and around the conflict zone, but would also include items made by sweethearts at home.

In 1914, the US set up the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]], headed by [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped staple foodstuffs, mainly flour, in the printed cotton flour sacks typical of the period. As thanks, the Belgians would embroider and paint in the designs, elaborating them with dates and flags and send them back to the US. Examples of these are now in the [[Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|Herbert Hoover Museum]], but some were sold to soldiers in Paris or given as gifts.

Civilians in France, in the zones occupied by troops, were quick to exploit a new market. Embroidered [[postcard]]s were produced in what quickly became a [[cottage industry]], with civilians buying the surrounds and embroidering a panel of gauze. These postcards depicted regimental crests or patriotic flags and national symbols in abundance, and millions were produced over the course of the war.

At war's end, when civilians began to reclaim their shattered communities, a new market appeared in the form of pilgrims and tourists. Over the ensuing twenty years mountains of discarded debris, shell casings, and castoff equipment were slowly recycled, with mass-produced town crest motifs being stuck onto bullets, shell casings, fuse caps, and other [[wikt:paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] to be sold to tourists.

===Commercial items===
The fourth category is purely commercial production. After the war, [[tonne]]s of surplus materials were sold by the government and converted to souvenirs of the conflict.

Ship breaking, particularly if the ship had been involved in significant events such as the [[Battle of Jutland]], resulted in much of the wood from the ship being turned into miniature barrels, letter racks, and boxes, with small brass plaques attached announcing, for example, "Made of [[teak]] from HMS ''Shipsname'', which fought at the Battle of Jutland".

Worldwide more human beings gain their livelihood from [[agriculture]] than any other endeavor; the majority are self-employed subsistence [[farmer]]s living in the [[tropics]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}. While growing food for local consumption is the core of '''tropical agriculture''', [[cash crop]]s (normally crops grown for [[export]]) are also included in the definition.

When people discuss the tropics, it is normal to use generalized labels to group together similar tropical areas. Common terms would include the [[humid]]-tropics ([[rainforest]]s); the arid-tropics ([[desert]]s and dry areas); or [[monsoon]] zones (those areas that have well defined wet/dry [[season]]s and experience monsoons). Such labeling is very useful when discussing agriculture, because what works in one area of the world will normally work in a similar area somewhere else, even if that area is on the opposite side of the globe.

Most temperate zone agricultural techniques are inappropriate for tropical areas. The second half of the 20th century saw many attempts to duplicate in the tropics [[farming]] practices that had been successful in temperate climates. Due to differences in [[climate]], [[soil]]s, and patterns of [[land ownership]], these largely failed. When they did succeed they tended to heavily favor farmers with substantial land holdings, as a high percentage of temperate agricultural practices are [[economically]] "scale-based" and favor large scale production. This in turn pushed many small-scale farmers on to ever more marginal land, as the better quality land was consolidated into larger farms.

==Green Revolution==
The "[[Green Revolution]]" was an agricultural improvement program undertaken in the tropics. Funded initially by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], it aimed to improve [[maize|corn]], [[rice]], and other [[cereal]] cultivators – [[Plant breeding|breeding]] plants that would produce more grain for the same amount of effort.

From that point, it expanded out to improved basic farming practices, particularly for rice farmers.  The growth of crop yields was such that agriculture was able to outstrip population growth — per capita production increased every year following 1950 - with Asia leading the way. The total cost of the Green Revolution by 1990 was about US$100 million.

The [[Green Revolution]] had a flaw; although the crops gave more yield, they were more subject to disease, since this was not a primary concern of the program.  To address this problem together with an approach to more small-scale farming crops, substantial interest exists today in creating a second Green Revolution, based on [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] agricultural practices and geared towards (small-scale) farmers with limited [[financial]] resources.

==Plant propagation==
Many tropical food plants are propagated by [[cutting]]s. Seeds are necessary for plant [[embryo]]s to survive the winter and other harsh conditions such as [[drought]]. However, where the weather is normally conducive to growth year-round,  plants reproducing plants through means other than seeds is often advantageous. By bypassing the seed stage, plants can greatly accelerate their [[reproductive cycle]]s. Despite this, anyone who wishes so, may still grow tropical crops, e.g., fruits, from seeds. To do so, some [[Sowing#Pre-treatment of seed and soil before sowing|special seed germination techniques]] to germinate them more quickly may be best used.

==Plant defenses==
"Plants are faced with a dilemma; while they need to attract beneficial pollinators and seed dispensers, they must also minimize the damage caused by the marauding army of herbivores. Without some form of protection the trees would be stripped bare and smaller plants would be completely devastated, and because plants stand still, they cannot run away. This is as true in Amazonian rainforest as it is in Northern coniferous forest." - Marcus Wischik.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wischik.com/marcus/essay/def.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Many (tropical) plants use [[toxin]]s to protect themselves. [[Cassava]], one of the most important tropical [[food crop]]s, produces [[cyanide]] upon [[ingestion]] unless processed to remove/reduce the cyanide content.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, "Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition", Rome, 1990, Ch. 7 "Toxic substances and antinutritional factors", third paragraph. Document available online at http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E00.htm#Contents. Ch. 7 appears at http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E08.htm#Cassava%20toxicity. (Accessed 25 June 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants are high in [[oxalate]]s (the agent that binds [[calcium]] to form [[kidney stone]]s); [[castor bean]]s are the source of [[ricin]], one of the most powerful [[poison]]s in existence; and [[Mucuna pruriens|velvet beans]] contain 3.1-6.1% [[L-DOPA]], which can be toxic in large quantities.&lt;ref name="toxicology"&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The list of toxic plants is long, but toxicity does not always mean a particular plant should be avoided, the knowledge needed to render toxic plants safe to use already exists in most communities.

==Slash/mulch==
The contents of a bag of [[commerce|commercial]] [[fertilizer]] is described in terms of NPK -[[nitrogen]] (N), [[phosphorus]] (P) and [[potassium]] (K); with nitrogen being the main component of most commercial fertilizers.

[[Oxygen]] is only a [[Atmosphere of Earth|small part]] of the air; the largest component of air is nitrogen. Nitrogen compounds are the main building block of [[protein]]; [[muscle]] in [[mammal]]s and plant [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in plants. If the level of nitrogen compounds in the [[soil]] is increased, plant growth can be significantly increased. [[Legume]]s are a group of plants that interact with [[bacteria]] ([[rhizobia]]) in the soil to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] from the air into usable compounds, and deposit them into the soil where it is available for other plants to use. The nitrogen compounds deposited by legumes can be readily converted into larger harvests.

[[Green manure]]s are plants grown to improve the soil, suppress [[weed]]s, limit [[erosion]], and &amp;mdash; when legumes are used &amp;mdash; to increase the nitrogen content of the soil. The most common type of green manure used in the tropics is [[Mucuna pruriens|velvet bean]]. It produces a thick [[blanket]] of [[vine]]s and [[leaves]] that in addition to infusing the soil with nitrogen, also smothers most weeds. It has reasonable tolerance to drought, low soil fertility, and highly [[acid]]ic soil. Alternatives to the velvet bean include the [[Lablab purpureus|lablab bean]], the [[Canavalia ensiformis|jack bean]], and for use above 500 m altitude, the [[Phaseolus coccineus|scarlet runner bean]].

Once the blanket is several centimeters thick, it is chopped down with a [[machete]], and the vines are chopped up. This produces thick [[mulch]] on top of the ground that both inhibits weed growth and adds vital [[nutrient]]s to the soil. Corn or other crops are then planted directly into this mulch.

Slash/mulch is popular in southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]]; and in recent years has gained a following in many areas of the tropics, from Brazil to central Africa. Where it has been embraced it has pushed aside [[slash and burn]] agriculture, and allowed farmers to use the same land continuously for many years.

[[Cornell University]] has taken a leading role in [[research]]ing the effects of mulches and slash/mulch practices in the tropics.[http://ppathw3.cals.cornell.edu/mba_project/moist/home2.html]

== Small-scale irrigation ==
In most places in the tropics sufficient [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs to grow enough food to feed the local population; however, it may not fall in a timely or [[convenient]] manner. Making maximum use of the water that does fall is an ongoing challenge.

Water is a particularly important issue in [[dryland farming]]. The ability to collect and store water at a low cost and without damaging the environment, is what opens up deserts and other [[arid]] regions to farmers. When it rains in dryland areas, the rain storms are normally heavy, and the soil unable to absorb the large amounts of rain that comes down. This leads to excessive surface run-off that needs to be captured and retained.

Commercial farms growing cash crops often use irrigation techniques similar to or identical to what would be found on large scale commercial farms located in temperate regions; as an example, the Israeli drip-irrigation lines.

===Water harvesting pits===
One of the simplest forms of [[irrigation]] - the farmer digs [[bathtub]]-sized pits into his fields and lines them with plastic sheets to collect rainwater. Then, once the [[dry season]] sets in, the farmer uses the collected water to irrigate his crops. The technique is especially useful in mountainous areas, where rapid [[Surface runoff|run-off]] otherwise occurs.

During years with normal precipitation, the growing season can be increased by an extra month or more by using harvesting pits. An extra month in many places means an extra crop can be grown. For instance, if the local [[growing season]] is 5 months long, and the farmers' main crops take 3 or 4 months to grow, an extra month may be enough time to grow a secondary crop. During times of drought, what rain does fall can be collected in the pits and used to secure the farmers' main crops.

===Bucket drip irrigation===
An irrigation system consisting of a [[bucket]] hung from a [[Utility pole|pole]], with a [[hose (tubing)|hose]] coming out of the bottom, and holes punched into the hose. The bucket is filled, and [[gravity]] feeds the water to the plants. &lt;!-- uncited how-to, not specific As a rule about 40 litres of water per day are needed for every 100 plants, although this can vary depending upon what is being grown.
 --&gt;

===Treadle pumps===
The [[treadle pump]] is a human-powered pump designed to lift water from a depth of seven metres or less. A treadle is lever device pressed by the foot to drive a machine, in this case a pump. The treadle pump can do most of the work of a motorized pump, but costs considerably less to purchase, and needs no [[fossil fuel]], as it is driven by the operator's body weight and leg [[muscle]]s. It can lift 5-7 metres&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water per hour from [[Water well|wells]] and [[borehole]]s up to seven metres deep and can also be used to draw water from lakes and rivers. Most treadle pumps used are of local [[manufacture]], as they are simple and inexpensive to build.

Standard treadle pumps are [[suction]] pumps, and were first developed in the early 1980s in [[Bangladesh]].  Most treadle pumps manufactured in Africa are [[pressure]] treadle pumps, a modification to the original design that means water is forced out of the pump under pressure. Pressure treadle pumps are more versatile as they allow farmers to pump water uphill, or over long distances, or fill elevated tanks.

==Pest control==

===Crop rotation===
[[Crop rotation]] is the cornerstone [[pest control]] in the tropics. When a single crop is planted repeatedly in the same soil, [[insect]]s and [[disease]]s that attack that crop are allowed to build up to unmanageable levels, greatly reducing the farmer's [[harvest]].

The most basic form of crop rotation is also the simplest: never plant the same thing in the same place twice. This results in naturally breaking the [[Biological life cycle|cycles]] of [[weed]]s, insects and diseases that attack food crops. Rotations are used to prevent or at least partially control several pests and at the same time to reduce the farmer's reliance on chemical [[pesticide]]s. Crop rotations often are the only economically feasible method for reducing insect and disease damage.

Crop rotation replaces a crop that is [[susceptible]] to a serious pest with another crop that is not susceptible. Each food crop comes with its own set of pests that attack that particular crop. By planting a different crop each time, the farmer is able to starve out those pests. Often a set of three or four crops are planted on a rotating basis, ensuring that by the time the first crop is replanted, the pests that attack it are substantially reduced.

Another side benefit of crop rotation is it improves the soil. Constantly growing the same crop in the same location will strip the soil of the [[nutrient]]s that particular crop requires. Rotating to a different crop will reduce the pressure placed on the soil. Or if a green manure is used as part of the rotation sequence, the soil can actually be improved.

===Integrated pest management===
[[Integrated pest management]] (IPM) was developed as an alternative to the heavy use of chemical pesticides. Eliminating all insect pests requires the extensive use of chemical pesticides, which over time can become self-defeating. Farmers end up using more and more chemicals with diminishing effect as pests quickly adapt –while at the same time natural [[predator]] insects are eliminated from the farm. Under IPM, chemicals should be a secondary line of defense, while building up the number of natural predators on a farm is the main goal. The IPM approach calls for keeping the pest populations below the levels at which they cause economic injury, not total eradication.

IPM in its pure form is complex, and beyond the ability of most farmers to manage; however, the underlying principles have gained widespread acceptance in the tropics, with most governments sponsoring IPM educational programs.

==Pioneering crops==
Pioneering crops are used in places where the land has been striped bare, and the [[topsoil]] has been entirely lost to erosion, or where [[desertification]] has started. The intent is not to grow food or cash crops, but to [[repair]] and reinvigorate the soil in order to prepare the way for the later planting of food or cash crops. [[Nitrogen fixing]] plants and trees normally form the basis of such a [[land reclamation|reclamation]] project.

==Hunger season==
The hunger season is that period of time when all the food from the previous [[harvest]] has been consumed, and the next harvest is still some time away. Even in normal years, many households face an [[Year|annual]] reduction in the amount of food they have available. Typically the hunger season will coincide with the start of [[planting]] the new crop, or shortly thereafter. So farmers are faced with a shortage of food at the very time they are expected to perform their heaviest labor.

One way of mitigating the effects of the hunger season is growing some non-seasonal crops close to the family home, such as [[banana]]s in humid areas, or cassava where it is arid. As an example, a family that has ten banana plants producing fruit during the hunger season is unlikely to experience excessive hardship. [[Sweet potato]], [[pigeon pea]], and ''[[Moringa oleifera]]'' should also be considered.

==Major constraints==

===Mild winters===

Winters are mild in the tropics; with no frost, snow, or ice, insect populations flourish year-round. In temperate areas, winter reduces most insect pest populations prior to the emergence of new crops, so plants coming up in the spring have a chance to take hold and grow prior to being attacked. In the tropics, plants enter a world already full of adult insects.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Mild winters allow [[Rabi crops|winter crops]] to be grown in some areas, such as India.

===Acidic soils===
Soils in the humid tropics are normally highly acidic and nutrient poor; [[decomposition]] is rapid because of high temperatures, high [[humidity]], and frequent heavy rains.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Heavy rains, especially monsoon rains, lead to rapid nutrient [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and [[chemical weathering]] of the soil. Standard temperate [[strategies]] for improving nutrient-poor soil, such as [[composting]], have limited application in such an environment due to rapid leaching.

[[Aluminum]] is the most common metal found in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. It is found in all soils and in all environments, from temperate to tropical. In a [[soluble]] state, it is highly [[toxic]] to plant life, as it inhibits [[root]] growth; however, in [[pH|neutral]] and [[alkaline]] soils common to the temperate zones, it is [[insoluble]] and therefore [[Chemically inert|inert]]. Soil [[fertility]] is directly influenced by how acidic it is, as the more acidic, the higher the level of aluminum toxicity; in areas where the [[pH]] drops below 5, aluminum becomes soluble and can enter into plant roots where it accumulates.

Around a third of all tropical soils are too acidic to support traditional food crops.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These highly acidic tropical soils represent the largest untapped [[arable land]] left in the world, so more productive use of these lands is key to expanding the world [[food supply]].

Winrock International states, "In the humid tropics, the relative importance of acid soils is greatest in Latin America (81%), but also significant in Africa (56%) and Asia (38%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winrock.org/forestry/FACTPUB/AIS_web/AIS10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407132715/http://www.winrock.org/forestry/FACTPUB/AIS_web/AIS10.html |archivedate=2005-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally on commercial farms, aluminum toxicity is countered by adding [[Agricultural lime|lime]] to the soil, which neutralizes the acid and renders the aluminum inert. However, many small land holders and resource-poor farmers cannot afford lime, and instead rely on slash-and-burn agriculture. As the original plant life is burnt, the ash acts to neutralize the acidic soil and makes the area acceptable for food plants. In time, acidity increases and only [[wiktionary:native|native]] plants will grow, forcing the farmer to move on and clear a new area.

Soil color in humid areas is related to the level of [[oxidation]] that has occurred in the soil, with red soil being the result of [[iron]] oxidation, and yellow soil being the result of aluminum oxidation.

===Salinization===
[[Soil salinity|Salinization]] occurs naturally in arid areas where not enough rain falls to wash soluble salts down and out of the root zone.  Salinization is a common side effect of irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; As water is used by plants and [[evaporates]] from the soil surface, the salt in the water [[concentrate]]s in the soil. The high temperatures and low humidity in arid regions means that salinization often accompanies irrigation.

===Day-length sensitive plants===
Some plants have a photoperiod ([[phototropism]]) requirement for a certain number of hours of daylight before they will grow, [[flower]], or produce [[fruit]]. Without this, they will not complete their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] and will not produce fruit and seeds. So, seeds brought from the temperate zones may not perform as expected, or at all in the tropics. Some plants are genetically keyed to only start producing when a certain number of hours of daylight is reached, the same number of hours as is found in their native habitat. With the shorter daylight hours experienced in the tropics, that switch never gets thrown.

==Vulnerability to climate change==

A combination of factors make the tropics one of the world's most vulnerable regions to the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture. These include:

* High population density across much of the tropics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=J. E. |last2=Small |first2=C. |year=1998 |title=Hypsographic demography: The distribution of human population by altitude |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=95 |issue=24 |pages=14009–14014 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.24.14009 |pmc=24316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High proportion of developing nations with high incidence of poverty and underdevelopment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachs |first=J. D. |year=2001 |title=Tropical Underdevelopment |work=NBER Working Paper No. 8119 |doi=10.3386/w8119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large percentage of population in these countries highly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood
* Dependence on rain-fed agricultural systems, especially in the arid/semiarid tropics
* Shortening of growing seasons and increases in temperature beyond the extremes already experienced in some areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Battisti |first=D. S. |last2=Naylor |first2=R. L. |year=2009 |title=Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5911 |pages=240–244 |doi=10.1126/science.1164363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Projected decrease in crop yields at low latitudes in contrast to high latitudes&lt;ref&gt;Easterling WE, Aggarwal PK,  Batima P, Brander KM, Erda L, Howden SM, Kirilenko A, Morton J, Soussana JF, Schmidhuber J, et al. (2007). Food, fibre and forest products. In Solomon S, Qin D, Manning M, Chen Z, Marquis M, Averyt KB, Tignor M, Miller HL, eds, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, pp 273–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that climate change and temperature increases are expected to negatively affect crop yields in the tropics could have troublesome implications for poverty and food security, mainly because populations in the area are so dependent on agriculture as their only means of survival. A 2008 study by the [[CGIAR]] Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security matched future climate change "hotspots" with regions that are already suffering from chronic poverty and food insecurity to pinpoint regions in the tropics that could be especially vulnerable to future changes in climate.&lt;ref name="regency.org"&gt;[http://www.regency.org/news_august11_2.html "Climate change threatens world food supply"] (2008). Regency Foundation Networx, London, UK. Accessed 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ericksen P, Thornton P, Notenbaert A, Cramer L, Jones P, Herrero M. 2011. [http://ccafs.cgiar.org/resources/climate_hotspots "Mapping hotspots of climate change and food insecurity in the global tropics"]. CCAFS Report no. 5. CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; These include regions such as West Africa which are already dependent on drought- and stress-resistant crop varieties and thus left with little room to manoeuvre when the climate becomes even drier.&lt;ref name="regency.org"/&gt; The study says that East and West Africa, India, parts of Mexico and Northeastern Brazil will experience a shortening of growing seasons by more than 5%, negatively impacting a number of important crop staples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/ccafs-releases-study-on-hotspots-of-vulnerability-to-climate-induced-food-insecurity/ "CCAFS releases study on hotspots of vulnerability to climate-induced food insecurity"] (2011).

==History==
Earlier this river was called as (Bengali: "Kohor Doriya"), "Kohor river".

==Religious significance==

[[Tablighi Jamaat|Tabligh Jam'at]], a popular [[Islam]]ic movement originating in [[South Asia]], initially took hold in Dhaka in the 1950s as Maulana Abdul Aziz and other leaders set up the regional headquarters at the [[Kakrail Mosque]] near [[Ramna Park]]. An initiative of the movement is an emphasis on the six ''uṣūl'' or "basic principles," two of which include ''ilm'', the pursuit of knowledge, and ''dhikr'' or ''zikr'', a method of prayer involving repetitive invocation of [[hadith]] and [[Qur'an]] passages. To this end, the movement places importance on ''ijtema'' or assembly, where members gather to practice and participate in ''dhikr'', hear religious sermons and discuss their activities.

The largest of these, the [[Bishwa Ijtema]], is situated by the Turag River in Tongi and attracts estimates of between two and four million [[Muslim]]s annually as well as representatives from over sixty countries, making it the second biggest Islamic congregation after the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name="biswa"&gt;{{cite news

'''Ultrafine particles''' ('''UFPs''') are [[particulates|particulate matter]] of [[nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] size (less than 0.1 [[micrometre|μm]] or 100 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter).&lt;ref name="Iijima"&gt;

There are two main divisions that categorize types of UFPs. UFPs can either be carbon-based or metallic, and then can be further subdivided by their magnetic properties. [[Electron microscopy]] and special physical lab conditions allow scientists to observe UFP morphology.&lt;ref name="Iijima"/&gt; Airborne UFPs can be measured using a [[condensation particle counter]], in which particles are mixed with alcohol vapor and then cooled allowing the vapor to condense around them which are then counted using a light scanner.&lt;ref name=IAQH&gt;

== Sources and applications ==
UFPs are both manufactured and naturally occurring. Hot [[volcanic lava]], ocean [[Spray (liquid drop)|spray]], and [[smoke]] are common natural UFPs sources. UFPs can be intentionally fabricated as are [[aerosol|fine particles]] to serve a vast range of applications in both medicine and technology. Other UFPs are byproducts, like emissions, from specific processes, combustion reactions, or equipment such as [[printer toner]] and [[automobile exhaust]].&lt;ref&gt;

UFPs have a variety of applications in the medical and technology fields. They are used in diagnostic imagining, and novel drug delivery systems that include targeting the circulatory system, and or passage of the blood brain barrier to name just a few.&lt;ref&gt;

==Exposure, risk, and health effects==
The main exposure to UFPs is through inhalation. Owing to their size, UFPs are considered to be respirable particles. Contrary to the behaviour of inhaled PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, ultrafine particles are deposited in the lungs,&lt;ref name="Int Panis"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The World Nuclear Industry Status Report''''' is a yearly report that explores the global challenges facing the [[nuclear power]] industry. It is produced by Mycle Schneider, an independent energy expert, and gives a detailed overview of the global nuclear industry and special analysis on key events and trends.

==2017 Data-visualization tool==
In January a fully interactive visualization on nuclear power construction was launched. This contains information on the 754 reactors that are or have been under-construction since 1951.  The Global Nuclear Power Database is hosted by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulletin.org/global-nuclear-power-database UPDATE: Global Nuclear Power Database], Thursday 23 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 report==
As of the middle of 2016, 31 countries were operating nuclear reactors for energy purposes. Nuclear power plants generated 2,441 net terawatt-hours (TWh or billion kilowatt-hours) of electricity in 2015 , a 1.3 percent increase, but still less than in 2000 and 8.2 percent below the historic peak nuclear generation in 2006. 59 reactors are considered here as under construction, three fewer than WNISR reported a year ago, and eight less than in mid-2014. Eighty percent of all new-build units (47) are in Asia and Eastern Europe, of which 22 in China alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/The-World-Nuclear-Industry-Status-Report-2016-HTML.html UPDATE2: World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2016], Thursday 23 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 report==
Globally, the nuclear industry’s situation continued to deteriorate in 2015, except in China. Eight out of the ten nuclear power reactor startups in 2015 were in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/UPDATE1-World-Nuclear-Industry-Status-as-of-1-January-2016-Mind-the-China.html UPDATE1: World Nuclear Industry Status as of 1 January 2016: Mind the China Effect], Monday 4 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 report==
The latest report, written by [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Antony Froggatt]] with contributions of four other experts from Japan, the UK and France, says that the nuclear industry was struggling with grave problems prior to the Fukushima accident, but that the impact of the accident has become increasingly visible. Global electricity generation from nuclear plants dropped by a historic 7 percent in 2012, adding to the record drop of 4 percent in 2011.

The 427 operating reactors worldwide, as of 1 July 2013, are 17 lower than the peak in 2002. The nuclear share in the world’s power generation declined steadily from a historic peak of 17 percent in 1993 to about 10 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stay informed today  |author2=every day  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21582333 |title=Daily chart: Critical reactions |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=2013-07-25 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report details a range of restart scenarios for Japan's nuclear reactor fleet which, as of September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnuclearreport.org/Japan-Nuclear-Free-Last-Operating.html |title=Japan Nuclear Free, Last Operating Reactor Shut Down - World Nuclear Industry Status Report |publisher=Worldnuclearreport.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; were all shutdown. Nuclear power’s share of global commercial primary energy production plunged to 4.5 percent, a level last seen in 1984.

Besides an extensive update on nuclear economics, the report also includes an assessment of the major challenges at the Fukushima nuclear site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheldrick |first=Aaron |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/us-japan-fukushima-insight-idUSBRE97D00M20130814 |title=Insight: After disaster, the deadliest part of Japan's nuclear clean-up |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the highly contaminated water on site. This water contained in the basement of reactors and in storage tanks contains 2.5 times the total amount of [[caesium-137]] released at the Chernobyl accident.

The report says that China, Germany and Japan, three of the world’s four largest economies, as well as India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/1103398.aspx |title=Nuclear growth in India has been slow: report |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; now generate more power from renewables than from nuclear power. For the first time in 2012 China and India generated more power from wind alone than from nuclear plants, while in China solar electricity generation grew by 400 percent in one year.

==2012 report==
According to the ''World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2012'', written by [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Antony Froggatt]], nuclear power accounted for 11 percent of worldwide electricity generation. World atomic power production dropped by a record 4.3 percent in 2011 as the [[global financial crisis]] and the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in Japan prompted plant shutdowns and slowed construction of new sites. Seven reactors began operating in 2011 and 19 were shuttered.&lt;ref name=ms2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-06/world-atomic-power-output-falls-by-record-in-fukushima-aftermath |title=World Atomic Output Falls by Record in Fukushima’s Aftermath |author=Kari Lundgren  |date=July 6, 2012  |work=Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report shows that following the Fukushima crisis in March 2011, Germany, Switzerland and Taiwan announced their withdrawal from nuclear power. Output was further restricted as nations suspended construction plans amid safety concerns and economic stagnation, forcing utilities to study extending lifetimes, which raises considerable safety issues.&lt;ref name=ms2012/&gt;

At least five countries, including Egypt, Italy and Kuwait, have suspended plans to build their first nuclear reactors. In the U.K., major companies like RWE, EON, and SSE have all abandoned new-build proposals in 2011/12, while companies in Japan and Bulgaria have suspended construction. The Fukushima disaster also created certification and licensing delays.&lt;ref name=ms2012/&gt;

==2010–11 report==
The ''World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010-2011'' is authored by Mycle Schneider, Antony Froggatt, and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]]  and published by the Washington-based [[Worldwatch Institute]]. The foreword is written by [[Amory Lovins]].&lt;ref name=myschnied/&gt;

According to the report, the international nuclear industry has been unable to stop the slow decline of nuclear energy. The world’s reactor fleet is aging quickly and not enough new units are coming online. As of April 1, 2011, there were 437 nuclear reactors operating in the world, which was seven fewer than in 2002.&lt;ref name=myschnied/&gt; The Olkiluoto plant has had particular problems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

The flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in Finland, managed by the largest nuclear builder in the world, AREVA NP, has turned into a financial fiasco. The project is four years behind schedule and at least 90 percent over budget, reaching a total cost estimate of €5.7 billion ($8.3 billion) or close to €3,500 ($5,000) per kilowatt.&lt;ref name=myschnied&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/WorldNuclearIndustryStatusReport2011_%20FINAL.pdf |title=World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010-2011: Nuclear Power in a Post-Fukushima World,  |author1=Mycle Schneider |author2=Antony Froggatt |author3=Steve Thomas  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2011 |publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |pages=7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report says that the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] is exacerbating many of the problems that nuclear energy is facing. There is "no obvious sign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn empirically evident downward trend into a promising future", and the Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to accelerate the decline. With long lead times of 10 years and more, it will be difficult to maintain, let alone increase, the number of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. Moreover, says the report, it is clear that nuclear power development cannot keep up with the pace of [[renewable energy commercialization]].&lt;ref name=myschnied/&gt; For the first time, in 2010 total installed nuclear power capacity in the world (375 gigawatts) fell behind aggregate installed capacity (381 GW) of three specific renewables — wind turbines (193 GW), [[biomass]] and [[waste-to-energy]] plants (65 GW), and solar power (43 GW).&lt;ref name=myschnied/&gt;

==2009 report==
The ''World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009'' presents quantitative and qualitative information on the [[nuclear power plant]]s in operation, under construction and in planning phases throughout the world. A detailed analyses of the economic performance of past and current nuclear projects is also given. The report was commissioned by the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mycle Schneider]], [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]], Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009).
