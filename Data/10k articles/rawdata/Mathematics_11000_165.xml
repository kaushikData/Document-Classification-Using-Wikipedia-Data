'''Access structures''' are used in the study of security system where multiple parties need to work together to obtain a resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shamir|first=Adi|date=1979-11-01|title=How to share a secret|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359168.359176|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=22|issue=11|pages=612–613|doi=10.1145/359168.359176|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of parties that are granted access are called qualified. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms they are referred to as qualified sets. In turn, the set of all such qualified sets is called the access structure of the system. Less formally it is a description of who needs to cooperate with whom in order to access the resource. In its original use in [[cryptography]], the resource was a secret [[secret sharing|shared]] among the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220334562_Extended_Access_Structures_and_Their_Cryptographic_Applications|title=Extended Access Structures and Their Cryptographic Applications.|last=Daza|first=Vanesa|last2=Herranz|first2=Javier|last3=Morillo|first3=Paz|last4=Ràfols|first4=Carla|date=2008-01-01|volume=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure, are able to join their shares to recompute the secret. More generally, the resource can also be a task that a group of people can complete together, such as creating a [[digital signature]], or decrypting an encrypted message.

It is reasonable to assume that access structures are [[wikt:monotone|monotone]] in the sense that, if a subset S is in the access structure, all sets that contain S as a subset should also form part of the access structure.

The 1889 treatise '''''Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita''''' (''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method''; 1889) by [[Giuseppe Peano]] is a seminal document in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]],&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segre|first=Michael|date=1994-01-01|title=Peano's Axioms in their Historical Context|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Segre/publication/240358753_Peano%27s_axioms_in_their_historical_context/links/54bb8fbe0cf253b50e2d0fa9/Peanos-axioms-in-their-historical-context.pdf|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=48|issue=3/4|pages=201–342|doi=10.1007/bf00375085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=wRWeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=Arithmetices+principia,+nova+methodo+exposita&amp;ots=T0z8EAS1Pr&amp;sig=87PfhSwT0BxZiVdod5vF_MuMf94&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtzcS61Y_SAhWGPZoKHcDSC2Q4HhDoAQgZMAA&amp;q=Arithmetices%20principia,%20nova%20methodo%20exposita|title=A Brief History of Infinity: The Quest to Think the Unthinkable|last=Clegg|first=Brian|date=2013-02-07|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781472107640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing what is now the standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s, and known as the [[Peano axioms]], as well as some pervasive notations, such as the symbols for the basic set operations [[element (set theory)|∈]], [[subset|⊂]], [[intersection (set theory)|∩]], [[union (set theory)|∪]], and [[set theoretic difference|''A''&amp;minus;''B'']].

The treatise is written in [[Latin]], which was already somewhat unusual at the time of publication, Latin having fallen out of favour as the [[lingua franca]] of scholarly communications by the end of the 19th century. The use of Latin in spite of this reflected Peano's belief in the universal importance of the work – which is now generally regarded as his most important contribution to arithmetic – and in that of universal communication. Peano would publish later works both in Latin and in his own artificial language, [[Latino sine flexione]], which is a grammatically simplified version of Latin.

Peano also continued to publish [[mathematical notation]]s in a series from 1895 to 1908 collectively known as [[Formulario mathematico]].

The '''aspect ratio''' of a [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]] is the [[ratio]] of its sizes in different dimensions. For example, the aspect ratio of a [[rectangle]] is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side{{snds}}the ratio of width to height,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio |title=What is aspect ratio? |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2013 |work=WhatIs? |publisher=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the rectangle is oriented as a "landscape".

The aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by a colon (x:y), less commonly as a simple or decimal [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. The values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but, rather, the proportion between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10, 1.6:1, {{Frac|8|5}} and 1.6 are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio.

In objects of more than two dimensions, such as [[hyperrectangle]]s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side.

==Applications and uses==
The term is most commonly used with reference to:
* Graphic / image
** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]
** [[Display aspect ratio]]: the aspect ratio for computer displays.
** [[Paper size]]
** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]
** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]]
** [[Standard ad size]]
** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]
** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.
*** [[HARMST]] High Aspect Ratios allow the construction of tall structures without slant
* [[Tire code]]
* [[Tire sizing]]
* [[Aspect ratio (wing)|Wing aspect ratio]] of an aircraft or bird
* [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]] of an [[optical lens]]
* Nanorod dimensions

==Aspect ratios of simple shapes==

===Rectangles===
{{Main article|Aspect ratio (image)}}
For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle. A [[square]] has the smallest possible aspect ratio of 1:1.

Examples:
* 4:3 = 1.{{overline|3}}: Some (not all) 20th century computer monitors ([[VGA]], [[XGA]], etc.), [[standard-definition television]]
* {{radic|2}}:1 = 1.414…: international paper sizes ([[ISO 216]])
* 3:2 = 1.5: [[135 film|35mm still camera film]], [[iPhone#Model comparison|iPhone]] (until [[iPhone 5]]) displays
* [[16:10]] = 1.6 (not shown above): commonly used [[widescreen]] [[computer display]]s ([[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]])
* Φ:1 = 1.618…: [[golden ratio]], close to 16:10
* 5:3 = 1.{{overline|6}}: [[super 16 mm]],  a standard [[film gauge]] in many European countries
* 16:9 = 1.{{overline|7}}: [[widescreen]] TV
* 2:1 = 2: [[Domino (mathematics)|dominoes]]
* 64:27 = 2.{{overline|370}}:1 (ultra-widescreen, [[21:9 aspect ratio|21:9]])
* 32:9 = 3.{{overline|5}}:1 (super ultra-widescreen)

===Ellipses===
For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the [[major axis]] to the [[minor axis]]. An ellipse with an aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle.

==Aspect ratios of general shapes==

In [[geometry]], there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general [[compact set]]s in a d-dimensional space:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998&gt;{{Cite book 
| last1 = Smith | first1 = W. D. 
| last2 = Wormald | first2 = N. C. 
| doi = 10.1109/sfcs.1998.743449 
| chapter = Geometric separator theorems and applications 
| title = Proceedings 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat. No.98CB36280) 
| pages = 232 
| year = 1998 
| isbn = 0-8186-9172-7 
| pmid =  
| pmc = 
| url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~nwormald/papers/geomsep.ps.gz
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The diameter-width aspect ratio (DWAR) of a compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width. A circle has the minimal DWAR which is 1. A square has a DWAR of sqrt(2).
* The cube-volume aspect ratio (CVAR) of a compact set is the d-th root of the ratio of the d-volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel d-cube, to the set's own d-volume. A square has the minimal CVAR which is 1. A circle has a CVAR of sqrt(2). An axis-parallel rectangle of width W and height H, where W&gt;H, has a CVAR of sqrt(W^2/WH) = sqrt(W/H).

If the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.

==Notations==
Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced "x-to-y").

Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the ''display'' aspect ratio (the image as displayed) and the [[Storage aspect ratio|''storage'' aspect ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions|Distinctions]].

Sample of Bak–Sneppen model evolution: on the ''x''-axis the population status, on the
''y''-axis (from top to the bottom) the history of the population. Each discontinuity
represents an evolution. The color codes the age of the species.]]

The '''Bak–Sneppen model''' is a simple model of [[co-evolution]] between interacting [[species]]. It was developed to show how [[self-organized criticality]] may explain key features of the [[fossil]] record, such as the distribution of sizes of [[extinction events]] and the phenomenon of [[punctuated equilibrium]]. It is named after [[Per Bak]] and Kim Sneppen.

The model dynamics repeatedly eliminates the least adapted species and mutates it and its neighbors to recreate the interaction between species. A comprehensive study of the details of this model can be found in [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v53/p414 ''Phys. Rev. E'' '''53''', 414–443 (1996)].   A solvable version of the model has been proposed in [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v76/p348 ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''76''', 348–351 (1996)], which [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v54/p1082 shows] that the dynamics evolves sub-diffusively, driven by a long-range memory.

== Description ==

We consider ''N'' species, which are associated with a '''[[fitness (biology)|fitness]]''' factor ''f''(''i''). They are indexed by integers ''i'' around a ring. The algorithm consists in choosing the least fit species, and then replacing it and its two closest neighbors (previous and next integer) by new species, with a new random fitness. After a long run there will be a minimum required fitness, below which species don't survive. These "long-run" events are referred to as avalanches, and the model proceeds through these avalanches until it reaches a state of relative stability where all species' fitness are above a certain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Wei1, Li; Yang, Luo; YuanFang, Wang &amp; AiPing, Cai.

[[Image:Bounded and unbounded functions.svg|right|thumb|A schematic illustration of a bounded function (red) and an unbounded one (blue). Intuitively, the graph of a bounded function stays within a horizontal band, while the graph of an unbounded function does not.]]
In [[mathematics]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' defined on some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' with [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] values is called '''bounded''', if the set of its values is [[bounded set|bounded]]. In other words, [[there exists]] a real number ''M'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
[[for all]] ''x'' in ''X''. A function that is ''not'' bounded is said to be '''unbounded'''.

Sometimes, if ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''A'' for all ''x'' in ''X'', then the function is said to be '''bounded above''' by ''A''. On the other hand, if ''f''(''x'') ≥ ''B'' for all ''x'' in ''X'', then the function is said to be '''bounded below''' by ''B''.

The concept should not be confused with that of a [[bounded operator]].

An important special case is a '''bounded sequence''', where ''X'' is taken to be the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s. Thus a [[sequence]] ''f'' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  
''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) is bounded if there exists a real number ''M'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;|a_n|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
for every natural number ''n''. The set of all bounded sequences, equipped with a [[vector space]] structure, forms a [[sequence space]].

This definition can be extended to functions taking values in a [[metric space]] ''Y''. Such a function ''f'' defined on some set ''X'' is called bounded if for some ''a'' in ''Y'' there exists a real number ''M'' such that its distance function ''d'' ("distance") is less than ''M'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x), a)\le M&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in ''X''.

If this is the case, there is also such an ''M'' for each other ''a'', by the triangle Here we saw the examples below

==Examples==
* The function ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'') = sin(''x'') is bounded. The [[sine]] function is no longer bounded if it is defined over the set of all complex numbers.
* The function 
:: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
: defined for all real ''x'' except for −1 and 1 is unbounded. As ''x'' gets closer to −1 or to 1, the values of this function get larger and larger in magnitude. This function can be made bounded if one considers its domain to be, for example, [2, ∞) or (−∞, −2].
* The function 
:: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;
: defined for all real ''x'' ''is'' bounded. 
* Every [[continuous function]] ''f'' : [0, 1] → '''R''' is bounded.   This is really a special case of a more general fact:  Every continuous function from a [[compact space]] into a metric space is bounded.
** Note that for example &lt;math&gt;f(x) \neq \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}f(h) = \infty \notin \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; 
* The function ''f'' which takes the value 0 for ''x'' [[rational number]] and 1 for ''x'' [[irrational number]] (cf. [[Nowhere continuous function#Dirichlet function|Dirichlet function]]) ''is'' bounded. Thus, a function does not need to be "nice" in order to be bounded. The set of all bounded functions defined on [0, 1] is much bigger than the set of [[continuous function]]s on that interval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5464">The '''carpenter's rule problem''' is a [[discrete geometry]] problem, which can be stated in the following manner: ''Can a [[simple polygon|simple planar polygon]] be moved continuously to a position where all its vertices are in [[convex position]], so that the edge lengths and simplicity are preserved along the way?'' A closely related problem is to show that any non-self-crossing [[polygonal chain]] can be straightened, again by a continuous transformation that preserves edge distances and avoids crossings.

Both problems were successfully solved by {{harvtxt|Connelly|Demaine|Rote|2003}}.

==Combinatorial proof==
Subsequently to their work, [[Ileana Streinu]] provided a simplified combinatorial proof formulated in the terminology of robot arm [[motion planning]]. Both the original proof and Streinu's proof work by finding non-expansive motions of the input, continuous transformations such that no two points ever move towards each other. Streinu's version of the proof adds edges to the input to form a [[pointed pseudotriangulation]], removes one added convex hull edge from this graph, and shows that the remaining graph has a one-parameter family of motions in which all distances are nondecreasing. By repeatedly applying such motions, one eventually reaches a state in which no further expansive motions are possible, which can only happen when the input has been straightened or convexified.

{{harvtxt|Streinu|Whiteley|2005}} provide an application of this result to the [[mathematics of paper folding]]: they describe how to fold any single-vertex [[origami]] shape using only simple non-self-intersecting motions of the paper. Essentially, this folding process is a time-reversed version of the problem of convexifying a polygon of length smaller than π, but on the surface of a sphere rather than in the Euclidean plane. This result was extended by {{harvtxt|Panina|Streinu|2010}} for spherical polygons of edge length smaller than 2π.

==Generalization==
{{harvs|first=John|last=Pardon|authorlink=John Pardon|year=2009|txt}} generalized the Carpenter's rule problem to [[rectifiable curve]]s. He showed that every rectifiable [[Jordan curve]] can be made convex, without increasing its length and without decreasing the distance between any pair of points. This research, performed while he was still a high school student, won the second-place prize for Pardon in the 2007 [[Intel Science Talent Search]] {{harv|Cunningham|2007}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4901">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''certifying algorithm''' is an algorithm that outputs, together with a solution to the problem it solves, a proof that the solution is correct. A certifying algorithm is said to be ''efficient'' if the combined runtime of the algorithm and a proof checker is slower by at most a constant factor than the best known non-certifying algorithm for the same problem.&lt;ref name="mmns"&gt;{{citation

The proof produced by a certifying algorithm should be in some sense simpler than the algorithm itself, for otherwise any algorithm could be considered certifying (with its output verified by running the same algorithm again). Sometimes this is formalized by requiring that a verification of the proof take less time than the original algorithm, while for other problems (in particular those for which the solution can be found in [[linear time]]) simplicity of the output proof is considered in a less formal sense.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt; For instance, the validity of the output proof may be more apparent to human users than the correctness of the algorithm, or a checker for the proof may be more amenable to [[formal verification]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Implementations of certifying algorithms that also include a checker for the proof generated by the algorithm may be considered to be more reliable than non-certifying algorithms. For, whenever the algorithm is run, one of three things happens: it produces a correct output (the desired case), it detects a bug in the algorithm or its implication (undesired, but generally preferable to continuing without detecting the bug), or both the algorithm and the checker are faulty in a way that masks the bug and prevents it from being detected (undesired, but unlikely as it depends on the existence of two independent bugs).&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of problems with checkable algorithms come from [[graph theory]].
For instance, a classical algorithm for testing whether a graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] would simply output a Boolean value: true if the graph is bipartite, false otherwise. In contrast, a certifying algorithm might output a 2-coloring of the graph in the case that it is bipartite, or a cycle of odd length if it is not. Any graph is bipartite if and only if it can be 2-colored, and non-bipartite if and only if it contains an odd cycle. Both checking whether a 2-coloring is valid and checking whether a given odd-length sequence of vertices is a cycle may be performed more simply than testing bipartiteness.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

Analogously, it is possible to test whether a given directed graph is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a [[topological sorting|topological order]] or a directed cycle. It is possible to test whether an undirected graph is a [[chordal graph]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either an elimination ordering (an ordering of all vertices such that, for every vertex, the neighbors that are later in the ordering form a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]]) or a chordless cycle. And it is possible to test whether a graph is [[planar graph|planar]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a planar embedding or a [[Kuratowski's theorem|Kuratowski subgraph]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] for the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is certifying: it outputs three integers {{mvar|g}} (the divisor), {{mvar|a}}, and {{mvar|b}}, such that {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} ''g''}}. This equation can only be true of multiples of the greatest common divisor, so testing that {{mvar|g}} is the greatest common divisor may be performed by checking that {{mvar|g}} divides both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and that this equation is correct.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

'''Cesare Arzelà''' (6 March 1847 – 15 March 1912) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] who taught at the [[University of Bologna]] and is recognized for his contributions in the [[Functions (mathematics)|theory of functions]], particularly for his characterization of [[Sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of [[continuous function]]s, generalizing the one given earlier by [[Giulio Ascoli]] in the [[Arzelà-Ascoli theorem]].

==Life==
He was a pupil of the [[Scuola Normale Superiore]] of [[Pisa]] where he graduated in 1869. Arzelà came from a poor household; therefore he could not start his study until 1871, when he studied in Pisa under [[Enrico Betti]] and [[Ulisse Dini]].

He was working in [[Florence]] (from 1875) and in 1878 obtained the Chair of Algebra at the [[University of Palermo]].

After that he became a professor in 1880 at the [[University of Bologna]] at the department of analysis. He conducted research in the field of [[Functions (mathematics)|theory of functions]]. His most famous student was [[Leonida Tonelli]].

In 1889 he generalized the [[Giulio Ascoli|Ascoli]] theorem to [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]], an important [[theorem]] in theory of functions.

He was a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], and of several other academies.

[[Vector algebra]] and [[geometric algebra]] are complementary approaches to providing additional algebraic structures on vector spaces, with geometric interpretations, particularly [[vector field]]s in [[multivariable calculus]] and applications in [[mathematical physics]].

Vector algebra is specific to Euclidean 3-space, while geometric algebra uses [[multilinear algebra]] and applies in all dimensions and signatures, notably 3+1 [[spacetime]] as well as 2 dimensions. They are mathematically equivalent in 3 dimensions, where this article is focused, though the approaches differ. Vector algebra is more widely used in elementary multivariable calculus, while geometric algebra is used in more advanced treatments, and is proposed for elementary use as well.

== Basic concepts and operations ==
Geometric algebra (GA) is an extension or completion of vector algebra (VA).{{sfn|Vold|1993|p=1}} The reader is herein assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts and operations of VA and this article will mainly concern itself with operations in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G_{3}&lt;/math&gt; the GA of 3D space (nor is this article intended to be mathematically rigorous). In GA, vectors are not normally written boldface as the meaning is usually clear from the context.

The fundamental difference is that GA provides an additional product of vectors called the "geometric product". Elements of GA are graded [[multivector]]s, scalars are grade 0, the usual vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2 and the highest grade (3 in the 3D case) is traditionally called the pseudoscalar and designated &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The ungeneralized 3D vector form of the geometric product is {{sfn|Gull|Lasenby|Doran|1993|p=6}}:

:&lt;math&gt;ab=a \cdot b + a \wedge b &lt;/math&gt;

that is the sum of the usual dot (inner) product and the outer (exterior) product (this last is closely related to the cross product and will be explained below).

In VA, entities such as [[pseudovector]]s  and [[pseudoscalar]]s need to be bolted on, whereas in GA the equivalent bivector and pseudovector respectively exist naturally as subspaces of the algebra.

For example, applying vector calculus in 2 dimensions, such as to compute torque or curl, requires adding an artificial 3rd dimension and extending the vector field to be constant in that dimension, or alternately considering these to be scalars. The torque or curl is then a normal vector field in this 3rd dimension. By contrast, geometric algebra in 2 dimensions defines these as a pseudoscalar field (a bivector), without requiring a 3rd dimension. Similarly, the [[scalar triple product]] is ad hoc, and can instead be expressed uniformly using the exterior product and the geometric product.

== Translations between formalisms ==

Here are some comparisons between standard &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; vector relations and their corresponding [[exterior product]] and geometric product equivalents.  All the exterior and geometric product equivalents here are good for more than three dimensions, and some also for two.  In two dimensions the cross product is undefined even if what it describes (like torque) is perfectly well defined in a plane without introducing an arbitrary normal vector outside of the space.

Many of these relationships only require the introduction of the exterior product to generalize, but since that may not be familiar to somebody with only a background in vector algebra and calculus, some examples are given.

=== Cross and exterior products ===
[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|The cross product in relation to the exterior product. In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the "parallel" unit bivector.]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \times \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the plane containing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is an oriented representation of the same plane.

We have the pseudoscalar &lt;math&gt;I = e_{1}e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; (right handed orthonormal frame) and so

: &lt;math&gt;e_{1}I = Ie_{1}=  e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; returns a bivector and

: &lt;math&gt;I (e_{2} \wedge e_{3}) = Ie_2e_3 = -e_1&lt;/math&gt; returns a vector perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;e_{2} \wedge e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; plane.

This yields a convenient definition for the [[cross product]] of traditional vector algebra:

:&lt;math&gt;{u}\times{v} = -I({u}\wedge{v})&lt;/math&gt;

(this is antisymmetric). Relevant is the distinction between axial and polar vectors in vector algebra, which is natural in geometric algebra as the distinction between vectors and bivectors (elements of grade two).

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; here is a unit [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space, which establishes a duality between the vectors and the bivectors, and is named so because of the expected property

:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3)^2 
=  e_1 e_2 e_3 e_1 e_2 e_3
= - e_1 e_2 e_1 e_3 e_2 e_3
=  e_1 e_1 e_2 e_3 e_2 e_3
= - e_3 e_2 e_2 e_3
= -1&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; cross product and the exterior product expression above can be confirmed by direct multiplication of &lt;math&gt;-i = - {e_1} {e_2} {e_3}&lt;/math&gt; with a determinant expansion of the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i} \wedge {e_j}
= \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i}  {e_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Cross product#Cross product as an exterior product|Cross product as an exterior product]].  Essentially, the geometric product of a bivector and the [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space provides a method of calculation of the [[Hodge dual]].

=== Norm of a vector ===

Ordinarily:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

Making use of the geometric product and the fact that the exterior product of a vector wedge with itself is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf u \, \mathbf u = {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = {\mathbf u}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u + \mathbf u \wedge \mathbf u = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lagrange identity ===

In three dimensions the product of two vector lengths can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
=
({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 + {\Vert \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding generalization expressed using the geometric product is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 - (\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v})^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from expanding the geometric product of a pair of vectors with its reverse

:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{u} \mathbf{v})(\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}) 
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} + {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}}) ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} - {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}})
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Determinant expansion of cross and wedge products ===

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \times \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \times {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;

Linear algebra texts will often use the determinant for the solution of linear systems by [[Cramer's rule]] or for and matrix inversion.

An alternative treatment is to axiomatically introduce the wedge product, and then demonstrate that this can be used directly to solve linear systems.  This is shown below, and does not require sophisticated math skills to understand.

It is then possible to define determinants as nothing more than the coefficients of the wedge product in terms of "unit ''k''-vectors" (&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j&lt;/math&gt; terms) expansions as above.

:A one-by-one determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^1&lt;/math&gt; 1-vector.
:A two-by-two determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; bivector
:A three-by-three determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; trivector
:...

When linear system solution is introduced via the wedge product, Cramer's rule follows as a side-effect, and there is no need to lead up to the end results with definitions of minors, matrices, matrix invertibility, adjoints, cofactors, Laplace expansions, theorems on determinant multiplication and row column exchanges, and so forth.

=== Matrix Related===

Matrix inversion (Cramer's rule) and determinants can be naturally expressed in terms of the wedge product.

The use of the wedge product in the solution of linear equations can be quite useful for various geometric product calculations.

Traditionally, instead of using the wedge product, Cramer's rule is usually presented as a generic algorithm that can be used to solve linear equations of the form &lt;math&gt; A  x =  b&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently to invert a matrix).  Namely

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{|A|}\operatorname{adj}( A) b .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a useful theoretic result.  For numerical problems row reduction with pivots and other methods are more stable and efficient.

When the wedge product is coupled with the Clifford product and put into a natural geometric context, the fact that the determinants are used in the expression of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^N&lt;/math&gt; parallelogram area and parallelepiped volumes (and higher-dimensional generalizations thereof) also comes as a nice side-effect.

As is also shown below, results such as Cramer's rule also follow directly from the wedge product's selection of non-identical elements.  The end result is then simple enough that it could be derived easily if required instead of having to remember or look up a rule.

Two variables example
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = a x + b y = c .&lt;/math&gt;

Pre- and post-multiplying by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;      (  a x +  b y ) \wedge  b = ( a \wedge  b) x =        c \wedge  b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a \wedge (  a x +  b y )       = ( a \wedge  b) y =  a \wedge  c      &lt;/math&gt;

Provided &lt;math&gt; a \wedge  b \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b} \begin{bmatrix} c \wedge  b \\  a \wedge  c\end{bmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; a,  b \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt; factors of the wedge products

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \begin{vmatrix}u_1 &amp; u_2 \\ v_1 &amp; v_2 \end{vmatrix} {e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

divide out.

Similarly, for three, or ''N'' variables, the same ideas hold

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp;  b &amp; c \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = d &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b \wedge  c}
\begin{bmatrix}
 d \wedge  b \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  d \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  b \wedge  d
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, for the three variable three equation case this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2 \wedge {e}_3&lt;/math&gt; factors of all the wedge products divide out, leaving the familiar determinants.

A numeric example with three equations and two unknowns:
In case there are more equations than variables and the equations have a solution, then each of the k-vector quotients will be scalars.

To illustrate here is the solution of a simple example with three equations and two unknowns.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
x + 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
x = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and a left wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that both of these equations have the same factor, so
one can compute this only once (if this was zero it would
indicate the system of equations has no solution).

Collection of results for
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; yields a Cramer's rule-like form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 1)}
\begin{bmatrix}
(1, 1, 2) \wedge (1, 1, 1) \\
(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 2)
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing &lt;math&gt;{e} _i \wedge {e} _j = {e} _{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, we have the end result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{{e}_{13} + {e}_{23}}
\begin{bmatrix}
{-{e}_{13} - {e}_{23}} \\
{2{e}_{13} +2{e}_{23}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equation of a plane ===
For the plane of all points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; through the plane passing through three independent points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the normal form of the equation is

:&lt;math&gt;(({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \times ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0)) \cdot ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent wedge product equation is
:&lt;math&gt;({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Projection and rejection ===

Using the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] a single vector can be decomposed into two components with respect to a reference vector, namely the projection onto a unit vector in a reference direction, and the difference between the vector and that projection.

With, &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u} =  u / {\Vert  u \Vert}&lt;/math&gt;, the projection of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Proj}_{{\hat{u}}}\,{v} =  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v)&lt;/math&gt;

Orthogonal to that vector is the difference, designated the rejection,

:&lt;math&gt;  v -  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) = \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2} ( {\Vert  u \Vert}^2  v -  u ( u \cdot  v))&lt;/math&gt;

The rejection can be expressed as a single geometric algebraic product in a few different ways

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{  u }{{ u}^2} (  u  v -  u \cdot  v)
= \frac{1}{ u} (  u \wedge  v )
=  \hat{u} (  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
= (  v \wedge  \hat{u} )  \hat{u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The similarity in form between the projection and the rejection is notable. The sum of these recovers the original vector

:&lt;math&gt; v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) + \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \wedge v ) &lt;/math&gt;

Here the projection is in its customary vector form.  An alternate formulation is possible that puts the projection in a form that differs from the usual vector formulation

:&lt;math&gt;  v
=  \frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \cdot  v) + \frac{1}{ u} (  {u} \wedge  v )
=  ( {v} \cdot  u) \frac{1}{ u}  + (  v \wedge  u ) \frac{1}{ u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Working backwards from the end result, it can be observed that this orthogonal decomposition result can in fact follow more directly from the definition of the geometric product itself.

:&lt;math&gt; v =  \hat{u} \hat{u} v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v +  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
&lt;/math&gt;

With this approach, the original geometrical consideration is not necessarily obvious, but it is a much quicker way to get at the same algebraic result.

However, the hint that one can work backwards, coupled with the knowledge that the wedge product can be used to solve sets of linear equations (see: [http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/bookpdf/TheExteriorProduct.pdf] ), the problem of orthogonal decomposition can be posed directly,

Let &lt;math&gt; v = a  u +  x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  To discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, take the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge (a  u +  x) =  u \wedge  x&lt;/math&gt;

Here the geometric product can be employed

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge  x =  u  x -  u \cdot  x =  u  x&lt;/math&gt;

Because the geometric product is invertible, this can be solved for ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{u}( u \wedge v ) .&lt;/math&gt;

The same techniques can be applied to similar problems, such as calculation of the component of a vector in a plane and perpendicular to the plane.

For three dimensions the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to an arbitrary non-zero unit vector, can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + \hat{\mathbf u} \times (\mathbf v \times \hat{\mathbf u}) .&lt;/math&gt;

For the general case the same result can be written in terms of the dot and wedge product and the geometric product of that and the unit vector

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \hat{\mathbf u}) \hat{\mathbf u}. &lt;/math&gt;

It's also worthwhile to point out that this result can also be expressed using right or left vector division as defined by the geometric product:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf u)\frac{1}{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \mathbf u) \frac{1}{\mathbf u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v) + \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v) .&lt;/math&gt;

Like vector projection and rejection, higher-dimensional analogs of that calculation are also possible using the geometric product.

As an example, one can calculate the component of a vector perpendicular to a plane and the projection of that vector onto the plane.

Let &lt;math&gt; w = a u + b v + x &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x =  v \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  As above, to discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; w&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;, take the wedge product

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = (a u + b v + x) \wedge u \wedge v = x \wedge u \wedge v .&lt;/math&gt;

Having done this calculation with a vector projection, one can guess that this quantity equals &lt;math&gt; x ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt;. One can also guess there is a vector and bivector dot product like quantity such that the allows the calculation of the component of a vector that is in the "direction of a plane".  Both of these guesses are correct, and validating these facts is worthwhile. However, skipping ahead slightly, this to-be-proven fact allows for a nice closed form solution of the vector component outside of the plane:

:&lt;math&gt; x
= ( w \wedge u \wedge v)\frac{1}{ u \wedge v}
= \frac{1}{ u \wedge v}( u \wedge v \wedge w).
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the similarities between this planar rejection result and the vector rejection result. To calculate the component of a vector outside of a plane we take the volume spanned by three vectors (trivector) and "divide out" the plane.

Independent of any use of the geometric product it can be shown that this rejection in terms of the standard basis is

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ { e}_i &amp; { e}_j &amp; { e}_k \\ \end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;(A_{u,v})^2
= \sum_{i&lt;j} \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
= -( u \wedge  v)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

The (squared) magnitude of &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;{\Vert  x \Vert}^2 =
 x \cdot  w =
\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the (squared) volume of the parallelopiped (base area times perpendicular height) is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note the similarity in form to the ''w'', ''u'', ''v'' trivector itself

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} {e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k ,&lt;/math&gt;

which, if you take the set of &lt;math&gt;{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k&lt;/math&gt; as a basis for the trivector space, suggests this is the natural way to define the length of a trivector.  Loosely speaking the length of a vector is a length, length of a bivector is area, and the length of a trivector is volume.

If a vector is factored directly into projective and rejective terms using the geometric product &lt;math&gt; v = \frac{1}{u}( u \cdot v +  u \wedge v)&lt;/math&gt;, then it is not necessarily obvious that the rejection term, a product of vector and bivector is even a vector.  Expansion of the vector bivector product in terms of the standard basis vectors has the following form

:Let &lt;math&gt;
 r
= \frac{1}{ u} ( u \wedge  v )
= \frac{ u}{ u^2} (  u \wedge  v ) 
= \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2}  u (  u \wedge  v ) 
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
 r = \frac{1}{{\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\  e_i &amp;  e_j\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(a result that can be shown more easily straight from &lt;math&gt; r = v - \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot v)&lt;/math&gt;).

The rejective term is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\ u_i &amp; u_j\end{vmatrix} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; r \cdot u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert r \Vert}^2 =  r \cdot  v = \frac{1}{{\Vert{u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

So, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert  r \Vert}^2 {\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also noteworthy that the bivector can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix} e_i \wedge  e_j } .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus is it natural, if one considers each term &lt;math&gt; e_i \wedge  e_j&lt;/math&gt; as a basis vector of the bivector space, to define the (squared) "length" of that bivector as the (squared) area.

Going back to the geometric product expression for the length of the rejection &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u} ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt; we see that the length of the quotient, a vector, is in this case is the "length" of the bivector divided by the length of the divisor.

This may not be a general result for the length of the product of two '''''k''-vectors''', however it is a result that may help build some intuition about the significance of the algebraic operations.  Namely,

:When a vector is divided out of the plane (parallelogram span) formed from it and another vector, what remains is the perpendicular component of the remaining vector, and its length is the planar area divided by the length of the vector that was divided out.

=== Area of the parallelogram defined by u and v ===

If A is the area of the parallelogram defined by '''u''' and '''v''', then 
:&lt;math&gt; A^2 = {\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;A^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this squared bivector is a geometric multiplication; this computation can alternatively be stated as the [[Gram determinant]] of the two vectors.

=== Angle between two vectors ===

:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = \frac{{\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2}{{\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf v \Vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = -\frac{(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2}{{ \mathbf u }^2 { \mathbf v }^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Volume of the parallelopiped formed by three vectors ===
In vector algebra, the volume of a parallelopiped is given by the square root of the squared norm of the [[scalar triple product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;V^2 = {\Vert (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) \cdot \mathbf w \Vert}^2
= {\begin{vmatrix}
u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \\ 
v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3 \\ 
w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; w_3 \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v \wedge \mathbf w)^2
= -\left(\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf e}_i \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_j \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_k 
\right)^2

= \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

====Product of a vector and a bivector====
In order to justify the normal to a plane result above, a general examination of the product of a vector and bivector is required.  Namely,

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v )
= \sum_{i,j&lt;k}w_i {e}_i {\begin{vmatrix}u_j &amp; u_k \\ v_j &amp; v_k \\ \end{vmatrix}} {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

This has two parts, the vector part where &lt;math&gt;i=j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i=k&lt;/math&gt;, and the trivector parts where no indexes equal.  After some index summation trickery, and grouping terms and so forth, this is

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) = 
\sum_{i&lt;j}(w_i { e}_j 
- w_j {e}_i )
{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j \\v_i &amp; v_j \\\end{vmatrix}}
+
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} 
{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

The trivector term is &lt;math&gt; w \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;.  Expansion of &lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v) w&lt;/math&gt; yields the same trivector term (it is the completely symmetric part), and the vector term is negated.  Like the geometric product of two vectors, this geometric product can be grouped into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, one of which is a pure k-vector.  In analogy the antisymmetric part of this product can be called a generalized dot product, and is roughly speaking the dot product of a "plane" (bivector), and a vector.

The properties of this generalized dot product remain to be explored, but first here is a summary of the notation

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) =  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v)  w = -  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v  ) + ( u \wedge v ) w) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \cdot ( u \wedge v) = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v ) - ( u \wedge v ) w)
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; w =  x + y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x = a u + b  v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y \cdot u = y \cdot v = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressing &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;, products in terms of these components is

:&lt;math&gt;  w ( u \wedge v ) =  x ( u \wedge v ) +  y ( u \wedge v ) =  x \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;

With the conditions and definitions above, and some manipulation, it can be shown that the term &lt;math&gt; y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) =  0&lt;/math&gt;, which then justifies the previous solution of the normal to a plane problem.  Since the vector term of the vector bivector product the name dot product is zero
when the vector is perpendicular to the plane (bivector), and this vector, bivector "dot product" selects only the components that are in the plane, so in analogy to the vector-vector dot product this name itself is justified by more than the fact this is the non-wedge product term of the geometric vector-bivector product.

=== Derivative of a unit vector ===

It can be shown that a unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\left(\mathbf r \times \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \mathbf r
= \left(\hat{\mathbf r} \times \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}} \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \hat{\mathbf r}
&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent geometric product generalization is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\mathbf r \left(\mathbf r \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
= \frac{1}{{ \mathbf r }}\left(\hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus this derivative is the component of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, this is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; minus the projection of that vector onto &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt;.

This intuitively makes sense (but a picture would help) since a unit vector is constrained to circular motion, and any change to a unit vector due to a change in its generating vector has to be in the direction of the rejection of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  That rejection has to be scaled by 1/|r| to get the final result.

When the objective isn't comparing to the cross product, it's also notable that this unit vector derivative can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
{{ \mathbf r }} \frac{d \hat{\mathbf r}}{dt}
= \hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25821">A '''context-sensitive grammar''' ('''CSG''') is a [[formal grammar]] in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] may be surrounded by a context of [[terminal symbol|terminal]] and [[nonterminal symbol]]s. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than [[context-free grammar]]s, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by CSG but not by context-free grammars. Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than [[unrestricted grammar]]s. Thus, CSG are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

A [[formal language]] that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a [[noncontracting grammar]] or a [[linear bounded automaton]], is called a [[context-sensitive language]]. Some textbooks actually define CSGs as non-contracting,&lt;ref name="Linz2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Linz|title=An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsxDiWvVdBcC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1552-9|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meduna2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Meduna|authorlink=Alexander Meduna|title=Automata and Languages: Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7gEErax71cC&amp;pg=PA730|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-85233-074-3|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisSigal1994"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin|last=Davis|authorlink1=Martin Davis|first2=Ron|last2=Sigal|first3=Elaine J.|last3=Weyuker|authorlink3=Elaine Weyuker|title=Computability, Complexity, and Languages: Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSHIIx0uGx0C&amp;pg=PA189|year=1994|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-050246-5|page=189|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John C.|title=Introduction to Languages and the Theory of Computation|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780073191461|edition=4th|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not how [[Noam Chomsky]] defined them in 1959.&lt;ref name="Levelt2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Willem J.

Chomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of [[natural language]] where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context. [[Walter Savitch]] has criticized the terminology "context-sensitive" as misleading and proposed "non-erasing" as better explaining the distinction between a CSG and an [[unrestricted grammar]].&lt;ref name="Vide1999"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Carlos Martín Vide|title=Issues in Mathematical Linguistics: Workshop on Mathematical Linguistics, State College, Pa., April 1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW2QNSvH2CoC&amp;pg=PA186|year=1999|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-1556-1|pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is well-known that certain features of languages (e.g. [[cross-serial dependency]]) are not context-free, it is an open question how much of CSG's expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages. Subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable [[mildly context-sensitive language]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The syntaxes of some [[visual programming language]]s can be described by context-sensitive [[graph grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Da-Qian, Kang Zhang, and Jiannong Cao.

==Formal definition==
A [[formal grammar]] ''G'' = (''N'', Σ, ''P'', ''S''), where ''N'' is a set of nonterminal symbols, Σ is a set of terminal symbols, ''P'' is a set of production rules, and ''S'' is the [[Start_symbol_(formal_languages)|start symbol]], is '''context-sensitive''' if all rules in ''P'' are of the form
: α''A''β → αγβ
where ''A'' ∈ ''N'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e., ''A'' is a single [[nonterminal]]&lt;/ref&gt; α,β ∈ (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e., α and β are strings of nonterminals and [[Terminal symbol|terminal]]s&lt;/ref&gt; and γ ∈ (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e., γ is a nonempty string of nonterminals and terminals&lt;/ref&gt;

A string ''u'' ∈ (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; '''directly yields''', or '''directly derives to''', a string ''v'' ∈ (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, denoted as ''u'' ⇒ ''v'', if ''u'' can be written as ''l''α''A''β''r'', and ''v'' can be written as ''l''αγβ''r'', for some production rule (α''A''β→αγβ) ∈ ''P'', and some context strings ''l'', ''r'' ∈ (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.
More generally, ''u'' is said to '''yield''', or '''derive to''', ''v'', denoted as ''u'' ⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''v'', if ''u'' = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ... ⇒ ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''v'' for some ''n''≥0 and some strings ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; (''N''∪Σ)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. That is, the relation (⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of the relation (⇒).

The '''language''' of the grammar ''G'' is the set of all terminal symbol strings derivable from its start symbol, formally: ''L''(''G'') = { ''w'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''S'' ⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''w'' }.
Derivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible, but don't contribute to ''L''(''G'').

The only difference between this definition of Chomsky and that of [[unrestricted grammar]]s is that γ can be empty in the unrestricted case.&lt;ref name="Vide1999"/&gt;

Some definitions of a context-sensitive grammar only require that for any production rule of the form u → v, the length of u shall be less than or equal to the length of v.  This seemingly weaker requirement is in fact [[weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John E.|last1=Hopcroft|authorlink1=John Hopcroft|first2=Jeffrey D.|last2=Ullman|authorlink2=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1979}}; p.&amp;nbsp;223–224; Exercise 9, p.&amp;nbsp;230. In the 2003 edition, the chapter on CSG has been omitted.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Noncontracting grammar#Transforming into context-sensitive grammar]].

In addition, a rule of the form
: ''S'' → λ
where λ represents the [[empty string]] and ''S'' does not appear on the right-hand side of any rule is permitted.  The addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context-free languages, rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context-free grammars with no →λ productions are also context sensitive grammars.

The name ''context-sensitive'' is explained by the α and β that form the context of ''A'' and determine whether ''A'' can be replaced with γ or not. This is different from a [[context-free grammar]] where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration. Indeed, every production of a context-free grammar is of the form ''V'' → ''w'' where ''V'' is a ''single'' nonterminal symbol, and ''w'' is a string of terminals and/or nonterminals; ''w'' can be empty.

If the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars (which can never include the empty string) then the languages in these two definitions are identical.

The '''left-context'''- and '''right-context'''-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form α''A'' → αγ and to just ''A''β → γβ, respectively. The languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages.&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel1989"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michiel|last=Hazewinkel|authorlink=Michiel Hazewinkel|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9F71NJxwzoC&amp;pg=PA297|year=1989|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-55608-003-6|page=297|volume=4}} also at http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Grammar,_context-sensitive&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalence was established by [[Penttonen normal form]].&lt;ref name="ItoKobayashi2010"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Masami|last1=Ito|first2=Yūji|last2=Kobayashi|first3=Kunitaka|last3=Shoji|title=Automata, Formal Languages and Algebraic Systems: Proceedings of AFLAS 2008, Kyoto, Japan, 20–22 September 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuaR2bJq0rcC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4317-60-3|page=183}} citing {{Cite journal | last1 = Penttonen | first1 = Martti | last2 = | first2 =  | date = Aug 1974 | title = One-sided and two-sided context in formal grammars | journal = Information and Control | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–392 | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(74)91049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following grammar, with start symbol ''S'', generates the canonical non-[[context-free language]] { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; : ''n'' ≥ 1 } :

More complicated grammars &lt;math&gt;CSG&lt;/math&gt;can be used to parse { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''d''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''n'' ≥ 1 }, and other languages with even more letters. Here we show a simpler approach using non-contracting grammars:
Start with a kernel of regular productions generating the sentential forms
&lt;math&gt;(ABCD)^{n}abcd&lt;/math&gt; and then include the non contracting productions
&lt;math&gt;p_{Da} : Da\rightarrow aD&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Db} : Db\rightarrow bD&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Dc} : Dc\rightarrow cD&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Dd} : Dd\rightarrow dd&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Ca} : Ca\rightarrow aC&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Cb} : Cb\rightarrow bC&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Cc} : Cc\rightarrow cc&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Ba} : Ba\rightarrow aB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Bb} : Bb\rightarrow bb&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_{Aa} : Aa\rightarrow aa&lt;/math&gt;.


A non contracting grammar (for which there is an equivalent &lt;math&gt;CSG&lt;/math&gt;) for the language &lt;math&gt;L_{Cross} = \{ a^mb^nc^{m}d^{n} : m \ge 1, n \ge 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
&lt;math&gt;p_1 : R\rightarrow aRC | aC&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;p_3 : T\rightarrow BTd | Bd&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_5 : CB\rightarrow BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_0 : S \rightarrow RT&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_6 : aB\rightarrow ab&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_7 : bB\rightarrow bb&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_8 : Cd\rightarrow cd&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_9 : Cc\rightarrow cc&lt;/math&gt;.

With these definitions, a derivation for &lt;math&gt;a^3b^2c^3d^2&lt;/math&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;S
\Rightarrow_{p_0} RT
\Rightarrow_{p^{2}_{1}p_{2}} a^3C^3T
\Rightarrow_{p_{3}p_{4}    } a^3C^3B^2d^2
\Rightarrow_{p^{6}_{5}     } a^3B^2C^3d^2
\Rightarrow_{p_{6}p_{7}    } a^3b^2C^3d^2
\Rightarrow_{p_{8}p^{2}_{9}} a^3b^2c^3d^2
&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=November 2018}}


A noncontracting grammar for the language { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; : i ≥ 1 } is constructed in Example 9.5 (p.&amp;nbsp;224) of (Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979):&lt;ref&gt;They obtained the grammar by systematic transformation of an [[unrestricted grammar]], given in Exm. 9.4, viz.:
&lt;math&gt;1) S\rightarrow ACaB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;2) Ca\rightarrow aaC&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;3) CB\rightarrow DB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;4) CB\rightarrow E&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;5) aD\rightarrow Da&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;6) AD\rightarrow AC&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;7) aE\rightarrow Ea&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;8) AE\rightarrow \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
In the context-sensitive grammar, a string enclosed in square brackets, like &lt;math&gt;[ACaB]&lt;/math&gt;, is considered a single symbol (similar to e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;name-part&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in [[Backus–Naur form#Example|Backus–Naur form]]). The symbol names are chosen to resemble the unrestricted grammar. Likewise, rule groups in the context-sensitive grammar are numbered by the unrestricted-grammar rule they originated from.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1) S\rightarrow [ACaB]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2) [Ca]a\rightarrow aa[Ca],
[Ca][aB]\rightarrow aa[CaB],
[ACa]a\rightarrow [Aa]a[Ca],
[ACa][aB]\rightarrow [Aa]a[CaB],
[ACaB]\rightarrow [Aa][aCB],
[CaB]\rightarrow a[aCB]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3) [aCB]\rightarrow [aDB]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4) [aCB]\rightarrow [aE]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5) a[Da]\rightarrow [Da]a,
[aDB]\rightarrow [DaB], 
[Aa][Da]\rightarrow [ADa]a, 
a[DaB]\rightarrow [Da][aB],
[Aa][DaB]\rightarrow [ADa][aB]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6) [ADa]\rightarrow [ACa]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;7) a[Ea]\rightarrow [Ea]a,
[aE]\rightarrow [Ea],
[Aa][Ea]\rightarrow [AEa]a&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8) [AEa]\rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;
.

== Kuroda normal form ==
Every context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a [[weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] one in [[Kuroda normal form]]. "Weakly equivalent" here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a [[noncontracting grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Sige-Yuki | last=Kuroda | authorlink=S.-Y.

The Kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars.

== Properties and uses ==
{{see also|context-sensitive language}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

=== Equivalence to linear bounded automaton ===
A formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some [[linear bounded automaton]] (LBA).&lt;ref&gt;(Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979); Theorem 9.5, 9.6, p.&amp;nbsp;225–226&lt;/ref&gt; In some textbooks this result is attributed solely to Landweber and [[S.-Y. Kuroda|Kuroda]].&lt;ref name="DavisSigal1994b"/&gt; Others call it the [[John Myhill|Myhill]]-Landweber-Kuroda Theorem.&lt;ref name="flac"&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~flac/pdf/ContSens.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Myhill introduced the concept of deterministic LBA in 1960. Peter S. Landweber published in 1963 that the language accepted by a deterministic LBA is context sensitive. Kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic LBA and the equivalence between LBA and CSGs in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Meduna|authorlink=Alexander Meduna|title=Automata and Languages: Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7gEErax71cC&amp;pg=PA755|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-85233-074-3|page=755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Willem J. M.|last=Levelt|authorlink=Willem Levelt|title=An Introduction to the Theory of Formal Languages and Automata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFvtwGYNe7kC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3250-4|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

{{As of|2010}} it is still an open question whether every context-sensitive language can be accepted by a ''deterministic'' LBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John C.|title=Introduction to Languages and the Theory of Computation|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780073191461|edition=4th|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closure properties ===
Context-sensitive languages are closed under [[complement (set theory)|complement]]. This 1988 result is known as the [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]].&lt;ref name="flac"/&gt;
Moreover, they are closed under [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]], [[String substitution|substitution]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;more formally: if ''L'' ⊆ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a context-sensitive language and ''f'' maps each ''a''∈Σ to a context-sensitive language ''f''(''a''), the ''f''(''L'') is again a context-sensitive language&lt;/ref&gt; [[inverse string homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]], and [[Kleene plus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979); Exercise S9.10, p.&amp;nbsp;230–231&lt;/ref&gt;

Every [[recursively enumerable language]] ''L'' can be written as ''h''(''L'') for some context-sensitive language ''L'' and some [[string homomorphism]] ''h''.&lt;ref&gt;(Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979); Exercise S9.14, p.&amp;nbsp;230–232. ''h'' maps each symbol to itself or to the empty string.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computational problems ===
The [[decision problem]] that asks whether a certain string ''s'' belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar ''G'', is [[PSPACE-complete]]. Moreover, there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are PSPACE-complete. In other words, there is a context-sensitive grammar ''G'' such that deciding whether a certain string ''s'' belongs to the language of ''G'' is PSPACE-complete (so ''G'' is fixed and only ''s'' is part of the input of the problem).&lt;ref&gt;An example of such a grammar, designed to solve the [[QSAT]] problem, is given in {{Cite journal|last=Lita|first=C. V.|date=2016-09-01|title=On Complexity of the Detection Problem for Bounded Length Polymorphic Viruses|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/7829636/?reload=true|journal=2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)|pages=371–378|doi=10.1109/SYNASC.2016.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar ''G'', is ''L''(''G'')=∅ ?) is [[Undecidable language|undecidable]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979); Exercise S9.13, p.&amp;nbsp;230–231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This also follows from (1) [[#top|context-free languages being also context-sensitive]], (2) [[#Closure properties|context-sensitive language being closed under intersection]], but (3) [[Context-free grammar#Language disjointness|disjointness of context-free languages being undecidable]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Luzc|LuZc]] parser is a working example of a program which can parse Context-sensitive grammars.

=== As model of natural languages ===
Savitch has proven the following theoretical result, on which he bases his criticism of CSGs as basis for natural language: for any [[recursively enumerable]] set ''R'', there exists a context-sensitive language/grammar ''G'' which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in ''R'' in the following way: given a string ''s'', ''s'' is in ''R'' if and only if there exists a positive integer ''n'' for which ''sc&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is in G, where ''c'' is an arbitrary symbol not part of ''R''.&lt;ref name="Vide1999"/&gt;

It has been shown that nearly all [[natural language]]s may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSG's seems to be much bigger than natural languages.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSG's is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply [[P=NP problem|P=NP]].

It was proven that some natural languages are not context-free, based on identifying so-called [[cross-serial dependency|cross-serial dependencies]] and [[unbounded scrambling]] phenomena. However this does not necessarily imply that all the class CSG is necessary to capture "context sensitivity" in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, the strictly weaker (than CSG) [[linear context-free rewriting system]]s (LCFRS) can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' | ''n'' ≥ 1} for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4nl-cfg.pdf|title=Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar Formalisms: Natural Languages are not Context-Free|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4lcfrs-intro.pdf|title=Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar Formalisms: Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research on [[computational linguistics]] has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are "[[mildly context-sensitive language|mildly context-sensitive]]" whose decision problems are feasible, such as [[tree-adjoining grammar]]s, [[combinatory categorial grammar]]s, [[coupled context-free language]]s, and [[Generalized context-free grammar#Linear Context-free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs)|linear context-free rewriting system]]s.  The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.

More recently, the class [[PTIME]] has been identified with [[range concatenation grammars]], which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive languages.&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010"/&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''decorrelation theory''' is a system developed by [[Serge Vaudenay]] in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selected Areas in Cryptography: 7th Annual International Workshop, SAC 2000, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, August 14-15, 2000. Proceedings|last=Stinson|first=Douglas|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2001|isbn=354042069X|location=Berlin|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; for designing [[block cipher]]s to be [[provable security|provably secure]] against [[differential cryptanalysis]], [[linear cryptanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information Security and Cryptology - ICISC'99: Second International Conference Seoul, Korea, December 9-10, 1999 Proceedings|last=Song|first=Joo Seok|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=3540673806|location=Berlin|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even undiscovered cryptanalytic attacks meeting certain broad criteria. Ciphers designed using these principles include [[COCONUT98]] and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES candidate]] [[DFC (cipher)|DFC]], both of which have been shown to be vulnerable to some forms of [[cryptanalysis]] not covered by the theory.

According to Vaudenay, the decorrelation theory has four tasks: 1) the definition of a measurement for the decorrelation, which usually relies on a matrix norm; 2) the construction of simple primitive or "decorrelation module" with a quite good decorrelation; 3) the construction of [[Encryption|cryptographic algorithms]] with decorrelation modules so that the primitive can be inherited by the algorithm; and, 4) proving that the decorrelation provides security against attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Serve Vaudenay (May 2003).

'''Delegated Path Validation''' ('''DPV''') is a method for offloading to a trusted server the work involved in validating a [[public key certificate]].

Combining certificate information supplied by the DPV [[Client (computing)|client]] with certificate path and revocation status information obtained by itself, a DPV [[Server (computing)|server]] is able to apply complex validation policies that are prohibitive for each client to perform. 

The requirements for DPV are described in RFC 3379.

In [[algebra]], the '''distribution algebra''' &lt;math&gt;D(G, K)&lt;/math&gt; of a [[p-adic Lie group|''p''-adic Lie group]] ''G'' is the ''K''-algebra of ''K''-valued distributions on ''G''. (See the reference for a more precise definition.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3511">In [[graph theory]], '''eigenvector centrality''' (also called '''eigencentrality''') is a measure of the influence of a [[Node (networking)|node]] in a [[Network (mathematics)|network]]. Relative scores are assigned to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who themselves have high scores.

[[Google]]'s [[PageRank]] and the [[Katz centrality]] are variants of the eigenvector centrality.&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-pagerank|title=How Google Finds Your Needle in the Web's Haystack|author=David Austin|publisher=AMS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using the adjacency matrix to find eigenvector centrality ==
For a given graph &lt;math&gt;G:=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt; vertices let &lt;math&gt;A = (a_{v,t})&lt;/math&gt; be the [[adjacency matrix]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;a_{v,t} = 1&lt;/math&gt; if vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is linked to vertex &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_{v,t} = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. The relative centrality score of vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;x_v = \frac 1 \lambda \sum_{t \in M(v)} x_t = \frac 1 \lambda \sum_{t \in G} a_{v,t} x_t &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M(v)&lt;/math&gt; is a set of the neighbors of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. With a small rearrangement this can be rewritten in vector notation as the [[eigenvector]] equation

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, there will be many different [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which a non-zero eigenvector solution exists. However, the additional requirement that all the entries in the eigenvector be non-negative implies (by the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]]) that only the greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The mathematics of networks|url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/palgrave.pdf|format = PDF|author = M. E. J. Newman|accessdate = 2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;math&gt;v^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; component of the related eigenvector then gives the relative centrality score of the vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only the ratios of the centralities of the vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the eigen vector e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or the total number of vertices&amp;nbsp;''n''. [[Power iteration]] is one of many [[Eigenvalue algorithm|eigenvalue algorithms]] that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector.&lt;ref name="ams" /&gt; Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries in ''A'' can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a [[stochastic matrix]].

== Applications ==
In [[neuroscience]], the eigenvector centrality of a [[neuron]] in a model neural network has been found to correlate with its relative firing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">In [[mathematics]], an '''elementary proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in [[number theory]] to refer to proofs that make no use of [[complex analysis]]. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the [[prime number theorem]], could only be proved using "higher" mathematics.  However, over time, many of these results have been reproved using only elementary techniques.

While the meaning has not always been defined precisely, the term is commonly used in [[mathematical jargon]]. An elementary proof is not necessarily simple, in the sense of being easy to understand: some elementary proofs can be quite complicated.&lt;ref name="Diamond1982"&gt;{{citation|first=Harold G.|last=Diamond|title=Elementary methods in the study of the distribution of prime numbers|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=7|issue=3|year=1982|pages=553–89|mr=670132|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1982-15057-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime number theorem==
The distinction between elementary and non-elementary proofs has been considered especially important in regard to the [[prime number theorem]]. This theorem was first proved in 1896 by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin]] using complex analysis. Many mathematicians then attempted to construct elementary proofs of the theorem, without success. [[G. H. Hardy]] expressed strong reservations; he considered that the essential "[[Mathematical jargon#deep|depth]]" of the result ruled out elementary proofs:
{{quote|No elementary proof of the prime number theorem is known, and one may ask whether it is reasonable to expect one. Now we know that the theorem is roughly equivalent to a theorem about an analytic function, the theorem that Riemann's zeta function has no roots on a certain line. A proof of such a theorem, not fundamentally dependent on the theory of functions, seems to me extraordinarily unlikely. It is rash to assert that a mathematical theorem ''cannot'' be proved in a particular way; but one thing seems quite clear. We have certain views about the logic of the theory; we think that some theorems, as we say "lie deep" and others nearer to the surface. If anyone produces an elementary proof of the prime number theorem, he will show that these views are wrong, that the subject does not hang together in the way we have supposed, and that it is time for the books to be cast aside and for the theory to be rewritten.|G. H. Hardy (1921). Lecture to Mathematical Society of Copenhagen. Quoted in Goldfeld (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;ref name="Goldfeld_2003_page_3"/&gt;}}
However, in 1948, [[Atle Selberg]] produced new methods which led him and [[Paul Erdős]] to find elementary proofs of the prime number theorem.&lt;ref name="Goldfeld_2003_page_3"&gt;{{ Citation| last = Goldfeld | first = Dorian M. | authorlink = Dorian M. Goldfeld | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: An Historical Perspective | year = 2003 | page = 3
| url = http://www.math.columbia.edu/~goldfeld/ErdosSelbergDispute.pdf | format = [[PDF]]
| accessdate = October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A possible formalization of the notion of "elementary" in connection to a proof of a number-theoretical result is the restriction that the proof can be carried out in [[Peano axioms#Arithmetic|Peano arithmetic]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Also in that sense, these proofs are elementary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Friedman's conjecture==
{{main|Grand conjecture}}
[[Harvey Friedman]] conjectured, "Every theorem published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e., what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in elementary arithmetic."&lt;ref name="Avigad2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Avigad|first=Jeremy|title=Number theory and elementary arithmetic|url=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~avigad/Papers/elementary.pdf|journal=Philosophia Mathematica|year=2003|volume=11|issue=3|page=257, at 258|doi=10.1093/philmat/11.3.257}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form of elementary arithmetic referred to in this conjecture can be formalized by a small set of axioms concerning integer arithmetic and mathematical induction. For instance, according to this conjecture, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] should have an elementary proof; [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] is not elementary. However, there are other simple statements about arithmetic such as the existence of [[Tetration|iterated exponential]] functions that cannot be proven in this theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5258">The following '''examples of [[generating function]]s''' are in the spirit of [[George Pólya]], who advocated learning mathematics by doing and re-capitulating as many examples and proofs as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The purpose of this article is to present common ways of creating generating functions.

== Worked example A: basics ==
New [[generating function]]s can be created by extending simpler generating functions. For [[Worked-example effect|example]], starting with

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ax&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;G(1;ax)=\frac{1}{1-ax} = 1+(ax)+(ax)^2+\cdots+(ax)^n+\cdots =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a^n x^n = G(a^n;x).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bivariate generating functions ===
One can define generating functions in several variables, for series with several indices. These are often called '''super generating functions,''' and for 2 variables are often called '''bivariate generating functions.'''

For instance, since &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; is the generating function for [[binomial coefficients]] for a fixed ''n,'' one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k'' and ''n.''
To do this, consider &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt; as ''itself'' a series (in ''n''), and find the generating function in ''y'' that has these as coefficients. Since the generating function for &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;1/(1-ay)&lt;/math&gt;, the generating function for the binomial coefficients is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-(1+x)y}=1+(1+x)y+(1+x)^2y^2+\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
and the coefficient on &lt;math&gt;x^ky^n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficient.

== Worked example B: Fibonacci numbers ==

Consider the problem of finding a [[Closed-form expression|closed formula]] for the [[Fibonacci number]]s ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' ≥ 2. We form the ordinary generating function

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \sum_{n \ge 0} F_n x^n
&lt;/math&gt;

for this sequence. The generating function for the sequence (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''xf'' and that of (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f''. From the recurrence relation, we therefore see that the power series ''xf'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' agrees with ''f'' except for the first two coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrcrcr}
f    &amp; = &amp; F_0x^0 &amp; + &amp; F_1x^1 &amp; + &amp; F_2x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
xf   &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; F_1x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-1}x^i &amp; + &amp;\cdots\\
x^2f &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_0x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp;F_{i-2}x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
(x+x^2)f &amp; = &amp;    &amp;  &amp; F_0x^1  &amp; + &amp; (F_0+F_1)x^2 &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; (F_{i-1}+F_{i-2})x^i &amp; +&amp;\cdots\\
     &amp; = &amp;        &amp;  &amp;         &amp;   &amp; F_2x^2       &amp; + &amp; \cdots &amp; + &amp; F_ix^i &amp; +&amp; \cdots\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking these into account, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;
f = xf + x^2 f + x .
&lt;/math&gt;

(This is the crucial step; recurrence relations can almost always be translated into equations for the generating functions.) Solving this equation for ''f'', we get

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{x} {1 - x - x^2} .
&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator can be factored using the [[golden ratio]] φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 + {{radic|5}})/2 and φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 &amp;minus; {{radic|5}})/2, and the technique of [[partial fraction decomposition]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left (\frac{1}{1-\varphi_1 x} - \frac{1} {1- \varphi_2 x} \right ) .
&lt;/math&gt;

These two formal power series are known explicitly because they are [[geometric series]]; comparing coefficients, we find the explicit formula

:&lt;math&gt;
F_n = \frac{1} {\sqrt{5}} (\varphi_1^n - \varphi_2^n).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Worked example C: Number of ways to make change==
The number of {{em|unordered}} ways ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(a_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n = \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^5)(1-x^{10})(1-x^{25})}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are two unordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, the other way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin.  See {{oeis|A001299}}.

On the other hand, the number of {{em|ordered}} ways ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to make change for ''n'' cents using coins with values 1, 5, 10, and 25 is given by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;G(b_n, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n x^n = \frac{1}{1-x-x^5-x^{10}-x^{25}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For example there are three ordered ways to make change for 6 cents; one way is six 1-cent coins, a second way is one 1-cent coin and one 5-cent coin, and a third way is one 5-cent coin and one 1-cent coin.  Compare to {{oeis|A114044}}, which differs from this example by also including coins with values 50 and 100.

'''''Experimental Mathematics''''' is a quarterly [[scientific journal]] of [[mathematics]] published by [[A K Peters, Ltd.]] until 2010, now by Taylor &amp; Francis. The journal publishes papers in [[experimental mathematics]], broadly construed. The journal's mission statement describes its scope as follows: "Experimental Mathematics publishes original papers featuring formal results inspired by experimentation, conjectures suggested by experiments, and data supporting significant hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expmath.org/expmath/philosophy.html Statement of Philosophy &amp; Publishing Criteria.] ''Experimental Mathematics''&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}} the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Sergei Tabachnikov]] ([[ICERM]], Brown University).

==History==
''Experimental Mathematics'' was established in 1992 by [[David Epstein (mathematician)|David Epstein]], Silvio Levy, and Klaus Peters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msp.warwick.ac.uk/gtm/1998/01/biog.html Foreword] by [[Igor Rivin]], [[Colin Rourke]] and [[Caroline Series]].

Geometry &amp; Topology Publications, Coventry, 1998. {{doi|10.2140/gtm.1998.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Experimental Mathematics'' was the first mathematical research journal to concentrate on [[experimental mathematics]] and to explicitly acknowledge its importance for [[mathematics]] as a general research field. The journal's launching was described as "something of a watershed".&lt;ref name="JRB"/&gt; Indeed, the launching of the journal in 1992 was surrounded by some controversy in the mathematical community about the value and validity of experimentation in mathematical research.&lt;ref name="JRB"&gt;James Robert Brown.

Horgan, ''The death of proof'', [[Scientific American]], Vol. 269 (1993), Issue 4, pp. 92&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 article in the ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', in part responding to such criticism, Epstein and Levy described the journal's aims as follows:&lt;ref&gt;David Epstein and Silvio Levy. [http://www.ams.org/notices/199506/index.html Experimentation and Proof in Mathematics.] ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society''. vol. 42 (1995), no. 6, pp. 670–674&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the main difference reflects the philosophy above: we are interested not only in theorems and proofs but also in the way in which they have been or can be reached. Note that we do value proofs: experimentally inspired results that can be proved are more desirable than conjectural ones. However, we do publish significant conjectures or explorations in the hope of inspiring other, perhaps better-equipped researchers to carry on the investigation. The objective of Experimental Mathematics is to play a role in the discovery of formal proofs, not to displace them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In recent years a number of other research journals in pure mathematics have substantially expanded their coverage of experimental mathematics and new journals devoted in large part to experimental mathematics have been launched. Thus, in 1998 the [[London Mathematical Society]] launched ''[[LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lms.ac.uk/jcm/ LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics,] [[London Mathematical Society]]. Accessed January 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 the ''[[Journal of Algebra]]'' started a new section called "Computational Algebra".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/framework_products/promis_misc/yjabr.pdf Announcement. Launch of a new section: Computational Algebra.] ''Journal of Algebra''. vol. 276 (2004), pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; ''LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics'' was closed to new submissions in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lms.ac.uk/publications/jcm  LMS Journal of Computation and Mathematics.] Accessed April 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial controversy, ''Experimental Mathematics'' quickly established a solid reputation and is now a highly respected mathematical publication. The journal is reviewed cover-to-cover in ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and ''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]'' and is indexed in the [[Web of Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28569">In [[geometry]], a '''fat object''' is an object in two or more dimensions, whose lengths in the different dimensions are similar. For example, a [[square]] is fat because its length and width are identical. A 2-by-1 [[rectangle]] is thinner than a square, but it is fat relative to a 10-by-1 rectangle. Similarly, a [[circle]] is fatter than a 1-by-10 [[ellipse]] and an [[equilateral triangle]] is fatter than a very [[obtuse triangle]].

Fat objects are especially important in [[computational geometry]]. Many algorithms in computational geometry can perform much better if their input consists of only fat objects; see the [[#Applications|applications]] section below.

== Global fatness ==
[[File:Two-cubes-slimness.png|thumb|right]]
Given a constant ''R''≥1, an object ''o'' is called '''''R''-fat''' if its "slimness factor" is at most ''R''. The "slimness factor" has different definitions in different papers. A common definition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0925-7721(96)00027-2| title = 3-D vertical ray shooting and 2-D point enclosure, range searching, and arc shooting amidst convex fat objects| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 8| issue = 6| pages = 299–316| year = 1997| last1 = Katz | first1 = M. J. }}, {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0925-7721(95)00005-8| title = Computing depth orders for fat objects and related problems| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 5| issue = 4| pages = 187| year = 1995| last1 = Agarwal | first1 = P. K. | last2 = Katz | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Sharir | first3 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{side of smallest cube enclosing} \ o}{\text{side of largest cube enclosed in} \ o}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''o'' and the [[cube]]s are ''d''-dimensional. A 2-dimensional cube is a [[square]], so the slimness factor of a square is 1 (since its smallest enclosing square is the same as its largest enclosed disk). The slimness factor of a 10-by-1 rectangle is 10. The slimness factor of a circle is √2. Hence, by this definition, a square is 1-fat but a disk and a 10×1 rectangle are not 1-fat. A square is also 2-fat (since its slimness factor is less than 2), 3-fat, etc. A disk is also 2-fat (and also 3-fat etc.), but a 10×1 rectangle is not 2-fat. Every shape is ∞-fat, since by definition the slimness factor is always at most ∞.

The above definition can be termed '''two-cubes''' fatness since it is based on the ratio between the side-lengths of two cubes. Similarly, it is possible to define '''two-balls''' fatness, in which a [[Ball (mathematics)|d-dimensional ball]] is used instead.&lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0925-7721(99)00059-0| title = Dynamic data structures for fat objects and their applications| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 215| year = 2000| last1 = Efrat | first1 = A. | last2 = Katz | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Nielsen | first3 = F. | last4 = Sharir | first4 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2-dimensional ball is a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]. According to this alternative definition, a disk is 1-fat but a square is not 1-fat, since its two-balls-slimness is √2.

An alternative definition, that can be termed '''enclosing-ball''' fatness (also called "thickness"&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0925-7721(93)90007-s| title = The complexity of the free space for a robot moving amidst fat obstacles| journal = Computational Geometry| volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = 353| year = 1993| last1 = Van Der Stappen | first1 = A. F. | last2 = Halperin | first2 = D. | last3 = Overmars | first3 = M. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is based on the following slimness factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\text{volume of smallest ball enclosing} \ o}{\text{volume of} \ o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

The exponent 1/''d'' makes this definition a ratio of two lengths, so that it is comparable to the two-balls-fatness.

Here, too, a cube can be used instead of a ball.

Similarly it is possible to define the '''enclosed-ball''' fatness based on the following slimness factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\text{volume of} \ o}{\text{volume of largest  ball enclosed in} \ o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Enclosing-fatness vs. enclosed-fatness ===

The enclosing-ball/cube-slimness might be very different from the enclosed-ball/cube-slimness.

For example, consider a [[lollipop]] with a candy in the shape of a 1×1 square and a stick in the shape of a ''b''×(1/''b'') rectangle (with ''b''&gt;1&gt;(1/''b'')). As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosing cube (≈''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) increases, but the area of the enclosed cube remains constant (=1) and the total area of the shape also remains constant (=2). Thus the enclosing-cube-slimness can grow arbitrarily while the enclosed-cube-slimness remains constant (=√2). See this [http://www.geogebratube.org/student/m100814 GeoGebra page] for a demonstration.

On the other hand, consider a rectilinear 'snake' with width ''1/b'' and length ''b'', that is entirely folded within a square of side length 1. As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosed cube(≈1/''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) decreases, but the total areas of the snake and of the enclosing cube remain constant (=1). Thus the enclosed-cube-slimness can grow arbitrarily while the enclosing-cube-slimness remains constant (=1).

With both the lollipop and the snake, the two-cubes-slimness grows arbitrarily, since in general:

::'''enclosing-ball-slimness ⋅ enclosed-ball-slimness = two-balls-slimness'''
::'''enclosing-cube-slimness ⋅ enclosed-cube-slimness = two-cubes-slimness'''

Since all slimness factor are at least 1, it follows that if an object ''o'' is R-fat according to the two-balls/cubes definition, it is also R-fat according to the enclosing-ball/cube and enclosed-ball/cube definitions (but the opposite is not true, as exemplified above).

=== Balls vs. cubes ===
The [[Volume of an n-ball|volume of a ''d''-dimensional ball of radius ''r'' is]]: &lt;math&gt;V_d\cdot r^d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a dimension-dependent constant:
:&lt;math&gt;V_d = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

A ''d''-dimensional cube with side-length 2''a'' has volume (2''a'')&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. It is enclosed in a ''d''-dimensional ball with radius ''a√d'' whose volume is ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''(''a√d'')&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence for every ''d''-dimensional object:
::enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ enclosing-cube-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;{V_d}^{1/d}\cdot {\sqrt d} / 2&lt;/math&gt;.

For even dimensions (''d''=2''k''), the factor simplifies to: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0.5 \pi k} / {{(k!)}^{1/2k}}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for two-dimensional shapes ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=π and the factor is: √(0.5 π)≈1.25, so:

::enclosing-disk-slimness ≤ enclosing-square-slimness ⋅ 1.25

From similar considerations:

::enclosed-cube-slimness ≤ enclosed-ball-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;{V_d}^{1/d}\cdot {\sqrt d} / 2&lt;/math&gt;
::enclosed-square-slimness ≤ enclosed-disk-slimness ⋅ 1.25

A ''d''-dimensional ball with radius ''a'' is enclosed in a ''d''-dimensional cube with side-length 2''a''. Hence for every ''d''-dimensional object:
::enclosing-cube-slimness ≤ enclosing-ball-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;2 / {V_d}^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

For even dimensions (''d''=2''k''), the factor simplifies to: &lt;math&gt;2 / {(k!)}^{1/2k} / {\sqrt{\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for two-dimensional shapes the factor is: 2/√π≈1.13, so:

::enclosing-square-slimness ≤ enclosing-disk-slimness ⋅ 1.13

From similar considerations:

::enclosed-ball-slimness ≤ enclosed-cube-slimness ⋅ &lt;math&gt;2 / {V_d}^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;
::enclosed-disk-slimness ≤ enclosed-square-slimness ⋅ 1.13

Multiplying the above relations gives the following simple relations:

::'''two-balls-slimness ≤ two-cubes-slimness ⋅ √''d'''''
::'''two-cubes-slimness ≤ two-balls-slimness ⋅ √''d'''''

Thus, an ''R''-fat object according to the either the two-balls or the two-cubes definition is at most ''R''√''d''-fat according to the alternative definition.

== Local fatness ==

The above definitions are all ''global'' in the sense that they don't care about small thin areas that are part of a large fat object.

For example, consider a [[lollipop]] with a candy in the shape of a 1×1 square and a stick in the shape of a 1×(1/''b'') rectangle (with ''b''&gt;1&gt;(1/''b'')). As ''b'' increases, the area of the enclosing cube (=4) and the area of the enclosed cube (=1) remain constant, while the total area of the shape changes only slightly (=1+1/''b''). Thus all three slimness factors are bounded: enclosing-cube-slimness≤2, enclosed-cube-slimness≤2, two-cube-slimness=2. Thus by all definitions the lollipop is 2-fat. However, the stick-part of the lollipop obviously becomes thinner and thinner.

In some applications, such thin parts are unacceptable, so '''local fatness''', based on a local slimness factor, may be more appropriate. For every global slimness factor, it is possible to define a local version. For example, for the enclosing-ball-slimness, it is possible to define the '''local-enclosing-ball''' slimness factor of an object ''o'' by considering the set ''B'' of all balls whose center is inside ''o'' and whose boundary intersects the boundary of ''o'' (i.e. not entirely containing ''o''). The local-enclosing-ball-slimness factor is defined as:&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-58218-5_6| chapter = New results on binary space partitions in the plane (extended abstract)| title = Algorithm Theory — SWAT '94| volume = 824| pages = 61| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 1994| last1 = Berg | first1 = M. | last2 = Groot | first2 = M. | last3 = Overmars | first3 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-58218-2}}, {{Cite book| doi = 10.1145/177424.177453| chapter = Motion planning amidst fat obstacles (extended abstract)| title = Proceedings of the tenth annual symposium on Computational geometry  - SCG '94| pages = 31| year = 1994| last1 = Van Der Stappen | first1 = A.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\cdot \sup_{b \in B}\left(\frac{\text{volume of} \ B}{\text{volume of} \ B\cap o}\right)^{1/d}&lt;/math&gt;

The 1/2 is a normalization factor that makes the local-enclosing-ball-slimness of a ball equal to 1. The local-enclosing-ball-slimness of the lollipop-shape described above is dominated by the 1×(1/''b'') stick, and it goes to ∞ as ''b'' grows. Thus by the local definition the above lollipop is not 2-fat.

=== Global vs. local definitions ===

Local-fatness implies global-fatness. Here is a proof sketch for fatness based on enclosing balls. By definition, the volume of the smallest enclosing ball is ≤ the volume of any other enclosing ball. In particular, it is ≤ the volume of any enclosing ball whose center is inside ''o'' and whose boundary touches the boundary of ''o''. But every such enclosing ball is in the set ''B'' considered by the definition of local-enclosing-ball slimness. Hence:

::enclosing-ball-slimness&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = 
::= volume(smallest-enclosing-ball)/volume(''o'') 
::≤ volume(enclosing-ball-''b''-in-''B'')/volume(''o'')
::= volume(enclosing-ball-''b''-in-''B'')/volume(''b'' ∩ ''o'')
::≤ (2 local-enclosing-ball-slimness)&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;

Hence:

::'''enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ 2⋅local-enclosing-ball-slimness'''

For a [[convex body]], the opposite is also true: local-fatness implies global-fatness. The proof&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt; is based on the following lemma. Let ''o'' be a convex object. Let ''P'' be a point in ''o''. Let ''b'' and ''B'' be two balls centered at ''P'' such that ''b'' is smaller than ''B''. Then ''o'' intersects a larger portion of ''b'' than of ''B'', i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\text{volume} \ (b \cap o)}{\text{volume} \ (b)} \geq \frac{\text{volume} \ (B \cap o)}{\text{volume} \ (B)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Proof sketch: standing at the point ''P'', we can look at different angles ''θ'' and measure the distance to the boundary of ''o''. Because ''o'' is convex, this distance is a function, say ''r''(''θ''). We can calculate the left-hand side of the inequality by integrating the following function (multiplied by some determinant function) over all angles:
::&lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = \min{(\frac{r(\theta)}{\text{radius} \ (b)},1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we can calculate the right-hand side of the inequality by integrating the following function:
::&lt;math&gt;F(\theta) = \min{(\frac{r(\theta)}{\text{radius} \ (B)},1)}&lt;/math&gt;

By checking all 3 possible cases, it is possible to show that always &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)\geq F(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the integral of ''f'' is at least the integral of ''F'', and the lemma follows.

The definition of local-enclosing-ball slimness considers ''all'' balls that are centered in a point in ''o'' and intersect the boundary of ''o''. However, when ''o'' is convex, the above lemma allows us to consider, for each point in ''o'', only balls that are maximal in size, i.e., only balls that entirely contain ''o'' (and whose boundary intersects the boundary of ''o''). For every such ball ''b'':

::&lt;math&gt;\text{volume} \ (b)\leq C_d\cdot \text{diameter} \ (o)^d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; is some dimension-dependent constant.

The diameter of ''o'' is at most the diameter of the smallest ball enclosing ''o'', and the volume of that ball is: &lt;math&gt;C_d\cdot(\text{diameter(smallest ball enclosing} \ o)/2)^d&lt;/math&gt;. Combining all inequalities gives that for every ''convex'' object:

::'''local-enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ enclosing-ball-slimness'''

For non-convex objects, this inequality of course doesn't hold, as exemplified by the lollipop above.

== Fatness of a triangle ==

Slimness is invariant to scale, so the slimness factor of a triangle (as of any other polygon) can be presented as a function of its angles only. The three ball-based slimness factors can be calculated using well-known trigonometric identities.

=== Enclosed-ball slimness ===
The largest circle contained in a triangle is called its [[incircle]]. It is [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Relation to area of the triangle|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta = r^2\cdot(\cot \frac{\angle A}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle B}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle C}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Δ'' is the area of a triangle and ''r'' is the radius of the incircle. Hence, the enclosed-ball slimness of a triangle is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ \frac{\cot \frac{\angle A}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle B}{2} + \cot \frac{\angle C}{2}}{\pi} }&lt;/math&gt;


=== Enclosing-ball slimness ===

The smallest containing circle for an [[acute triangle]] is its [[circumcircle]], while for an [[obtuse triangle]] it is the circle having the triangle's longest side as a diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How fat is a triangle?|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/a/915187/29780|website=Math.SE|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Circumscribed_circle#Triangles|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = R^2 \cdot 2 \sin A \sin B \sin C&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''Δ'' is the area of a triangle and ''R'' is the radius of the circumcircle. Hence, for an acute triangle, the enclosing-ball slimness factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2 \sin A \sin B \sin C}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is also [[Triangle#Using trigonometry|known]] that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = \frac{c^{2}}{2(\cot \angle{A} + \cot \angle{B})} = \frac{c^{2} (\sin \angle{A})(\sin \angle{B})}{2\sin(\angle{A} + \angle{B})}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is any side of the triangle and ''A'',''B'' are the adjacent angles. Hence, for an obtuse triangle with acute angles A and B (and longest side ''c''), the enclosing-ball slimness factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{\pi\cdot(\cot \angle{A} + \cot \angle{B})}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi\cdot\sin(\angle{A} + \angle{B})}{2 (\sin \angle{A}) (\sin \angle{B})}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in a [[right triangle]], &lt;math&gt;\sin{\angle{C}}=\sin{\angle{A}+\angle{B}}=1&lt;/math&gt;, so the two expressions coincide.

=== Two-balls slimness ===

The inradius ''r'' and the circumradius ''R'' are connected via a couple of formulae which provide two alternative expressions for the two-balls slimness of an acute triangle:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W|title=Inradius|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Inradius.html|website=MathWorld|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{r} = \frac{1}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{C}} {2})} = \frac{1}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  + \cos \angle{C} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

For an obtuse triangle, ''c''/2 should be used instead of ''R''. By the [[Law of sines]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{2} = R \sin{\angle{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the slimness factor of an obtuse triangle with obtuse angle ''C'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c/2}{r} = \frac{\sin{\angle{C}}}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{C}} {2})} = \frac{\sin{\angle{C}}}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  + \cos \angle{C} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in a [[right triangle]], &lt;math&gt;\sin{\angle{C}}=1&lt;/math&gt;, so the two expressions coincide.

The two expressions can be combined in the following way to get a single expression for the two-balls slimness of any triangle with smaller angles ''A'' and ''B'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin{\max(\angle{A},\angle{B},\angle{C},\pi/2)}}{4 \sin(\frac{\angle{A}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\angle{B}}{2}) \sin(\frac{\pi-\angle{A}-\angle{B}} {2})} = \frac{\sin{\max(\angle{A},\angle{B},\angle{C},\pi/2)}}{\cos \angle{A}  + \cos \angle{B}  - \cos (\angle{A}+\angle{B}) - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

To get a feeling of the rate of change in fatness, consider what this formula gives for an [[isosceles triangle]] with head angle ''θ'' [[Small-angle approximation|when ''θ'' is small]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin{\max(\theta,\pi/2)}}{4 \sin^2(\frac{\pi-\theta}{4}) \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})} \approx \frac{1}{4 {\sqrt{1/2}}^2 \theta/2}=\frac{1}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--van der Stappen et al. give the following formula for the enclosing-ball slimness: (√(π/tan''θ'')&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;) --&gt;

The following graphs show the 2-balls slimness factor of a triangle:
* Slimness of a general triangle [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zsn0i0hvmr when one angle (''a'') is a constant parameter while the other angle (''x'') changes].
* Slimness of an isosceles triangle [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rkpz7pscra as a function of its head angle (''x'')].

&lt;!--
=== Cube-based slimness ===
The cube-based slimness of a triangle is much more difficult to calculate than its ball-based slimness.  It can be calculated for an [[isosceles triangle]] with base angles ''θ''.
* When 60°≤''θ''≤arctan(2)=63.5°: enclosing-cube = 2/(√tan''θ''), enclosed-cube = (√tan''θ'')/2+(1/√tan''θ''), two-cubes = 1+2/tan''θ''.
* When arctan(2)=63.5°≤''θ''&lt;90°: two-cubes = 1+tan''θ''/2.
--&gt;

== Fatness of circles, ellipses and their parts ==
The ball-based slimness of a circle is of course 1 - the smallest possible value. 

[[File:Circularsegment.svg|right|150px]]
For a [[circular segment]] with central angle ''θ'', the circumcircle diameter is the length of the chord and the incircle diameter is the height of the segment, so the two-balls slimness (and its approximation [[Small-angle approximation|when ''θ'' is small]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{length of chord}}{\text{height of segment}}=\frac{2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{R\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}=\frac{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{\theta}{\theta^2/8} = \frac{8}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Circle arc.svg|right|150px]]
For a [[circular sector]] with central angle ''θ'' (when ''θ'' is small), the circumcircle diameter is the radius of the circle and the incircle diameter is the chord length, so the two-balls slimness is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{radius of circle}}{\text{length of chord}}=\frac{R}{2R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}=\frac{1}{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2 \theta / 2} = \frac{1}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

For an [[ellipse]], the slimness factors are different in different locations. For example, consider an ellipse with short axis ''a'' and long axis ''b''. the length of a chord ranges between &lt;math&gt;2a\sin\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; at the narrow side of the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;2b\sin\frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; at its wide side; similarly, the height of the segment ranges between &lt;math&gt;b\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; at the narrow side and &lt;math&gt;a\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; at its wide side. So the two-balls slimness ranges between:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2a\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{b\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{8a}{b\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

and:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2b\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{a\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{8b}{a\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, when the secant starts at angle Θ the slimness factor can be approximated by:&lt;ref&gt;See graph at: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fhfqju02sn&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}}{\left(1-\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{b}{a}\cos^2(\Theta+\frac{\theta}{2}) + \frac{a}{b}\sin^2(\Theta+\frac{\theta}{2})\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Fatness of a convex polygon ==
A convex polygon is called ''' ''r''-separated ''' if the angle between each pair of edges (not necessarily adjacent) is at least ''r''. 

Lemma: The enclosing-ball-slimness of an ''r''-separated convex polygon is at most &lt;math&gt;O(1/r)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="bos13"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.20382/jocg.v4i1a9|arxiv=1009.1866|author1=Mark de Berg|title=Fat Polygonal Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings|last2=Onak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Sidiropoulos|first3=Anastasios|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7-8}}

A convex polygon is called ''' ''k,r''-separated ''' if:
# It does not have parallel edges, except maybe two horizontal and two vertical.
# Each non-axis-parallel edge makes an angle of at least ''r'' with any other edge, and with the x and y axes.
# If there are two horizontal edges, then diameter/height is at most ''k''.
# If there are two vertical edges, then diameter/width is at most ''k''.

Lemma: The enclosing-ball-slimness of a ''k,r''-separated convex polygon is at most &lt;math&gt;O(\max(k,1/r))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="dsv2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.comgeo.2013.12.008|arxiv=1012.1749|title=Treemaps with bounded aspect ratio|journal=Computational Geometry|volume=47|issue=6|pages=683|year=2014|last1=De Berg|first1=Mark|last2=Speckmann|first2=Bettina|author2-link=Bettina Speckmann|last3=Van Der Weele|first3=Vincent}}. Conference version: {{cite conference|url=http://alexandria.tue.nl/openaccess/Metis253577.pdf|title=Convex Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio|conference=EuroCG|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve the upper bound to &lt;math&gt;O(d)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Counting fat objects ==
If an object ''o'' has diameter 2''a'', then every ball enclosing ''o'' must have radius at least ''a'' and volume at least ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''. Hence, by definition of enclosing-ball-fatness, the volume of an ''R''-fat object with diameter 2''a'' must be at least: ''V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''/''R&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''. Hence:

:'''Lemma 1''': Let ''R''≥1 and ''C≥0'' be two constants. Consider a collection of non-overlapping ''d''-dimensional objects that are all globally ''R''-fat  (i.e. with enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ ''R''). The number of such objects of diameter at least 2''a'', contained in a ball of radius ''C⋅a'', is at most: 
::&lt;math&gt;V_d\cdot (C a)^d / (V_d \cdot a^d / R^d) = (R C)^d&lt;/math&gt;

For example (taking ''d''=2, ''R''=1 and ''C''=3): The number of non-overlapping disks with radius at least 1 contained in a circle of radius 3 is at most 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=9. (Actually, it is at most 7).

If we consider local-fatness instead of global-fatness, we can get a stronger lemma:&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;

:'''Lemma 2''': Let ''R''≥1 and ''C≥0'' be two constants. Consider a collection of non-overlapping ''d''-dimensional objects that are all locally ''R''-fat (i.e. with local-enclosing-ball-slimness ≤ ''R''). Let ''o'' be a single object in that collection with diameter 2''a''. Then the number of objects in the collection with diameter larger than 2''a'' that lie within distance ''2C⋅a'' from object ''o'' is at most:
::&lt;math&gt;(4 R \cdot (C+1))^d&lt;/math&gt;

For example (taking ''d''=2, ''R''=1 and ''C''=0): the number of non-overlapping disks with radius larger than 1 that touch a given unit disk is at most 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=16 (this is not a tight bound since in this case it is easy to prove an upper bound of 5).

== Generalizations ==
The following generalization of fatness were studied by &lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000 /&gt; for 2-dimensional objects.

A triangle ∆ is a (β, δ)-triangle of a planar object ''o'' (0&lt;β≤π/3, 0&lt;δ&lt; 1), if ∆ ⊆ ''o'', each of the angles of ∆ is at least β, and the length of each of its edges is at least δ·diameter(''o'').  An object ''o'' in the plane is '''(β,δ)-covered''' if for each point P ∈ ''o'' there exists a (β, δ)-triangle ∆ of ''o'' that contains P.

For [[convex body|convex objects]], the two definitions are equivalent, in the sense that if ''o'' is α-fat, for some constant α, then it is also (β,δ)-covered, for appropriate constants β and δ, and vice versa. However, for non-convex objects the definition of being fat is more general than the definition of being (β, δ)-covered.&lt;ref name=EfratEtAl2000 /&gt;

== Applications ==
Fat objects are used in various problems, for example:
* [[Motion planning]] - planning a path for a robot moving amidst obstacles becomes easier when the obstacles are fat objects.&lt;ref name=vanderStappenEtAl1993/&gt;
* [[Fair cake-cutting]] - dividing a cake becomes more difficult when the pieces have to be fat objects. This requirement is common, for example, when the "cake" to be divided is a land-estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2017.01.007|title=Fair and square: Cake-cutting in two dimensions|journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=70|pages=1–28|year=2017|last1=Segal-Halevi|first1=Erel|last2=Nitzan|first2=Shmuel|last3=Hassidim|first3=Avinatan|last4=Aumann|first4=Yonatan|arxiv=1409.4511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz Harress''' (died circa 1915) was a mathematician and contemporary of [[Albert Einstein]] and is best known for his experiment on the propagation of light in a rotating glass device.

'''Gyula O. H.

The area of study known as the '''history of mathematics''' is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in [[mathematics]] and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the [[History of mathematical notation|mathematical methods and notation of the past]]. Before the [[modern age]] and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the [[Mesopotamian]] states of [[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]] and [[Assyria]], together with [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ebla]] began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the field of [[astronomy]] and to formulate [[calendars]] and record time.

The most ancient mathematical texts available are from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] - ''[[Plimpton 322]]'' ([[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] c. 1900 BC),&lt;ref&gt;J. Friberg, "Methods and traditions of Babylonian mathematics. Plimpton 322, Pythagorean triples, and the Babylonian triangle parameter equations", Historia Mathematica, 8, 1981, pp. 277–318.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]'' ([[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] c. 2000–1800 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0486223322 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C}} Chap. IV "Egyptian Mathematics and Astronomy", pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]]'' (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All of these texts mention the so-called [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.

The study of mathematics as a "demonstrative discipline" begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning "subject of instruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|journal=Nature|volume=128|issue=3235|page=5|bibcode=1931Natur.128..739T|year=1931|doi=10.1038/128739a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: "In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who first made mathematics a science."&lt;/ref&gt; Although they made virtually no contributions to [[theoretical mathematics]], the [[ancient Romans]] used [[applied mathematics]] in [[surveying]], [[structural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[bookkeeping]], creation of [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s, and even [[Roman art|arts and crafts]]. [[Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]] and the first use of [[negative numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp. 140–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp. 428–37&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]] through the work of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius." – Pierre Simon Laplace http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Yushkevich|A.P. Juschkewitsch]], "Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous with but independent of these traditions were the mathematics developed by the [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], where the concept of [[zero]] was given a standard symbol in [[Maya numerals]].

Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] from the 12th century onward, leading to further development of mathematics in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]]. From ancient times through the [[Postclassical age|Middle Ages]], periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an [[exponential growth|increasing pace]] that continues through the present day. This includes the groundbreaking work of both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the development of infinitesimal [[calculus]] during the course of the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Babylonia]]n mathematics refers to any mathematics of the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) from the days of the early [[Sumer]]ians through the [[Hellenistic period]] almost to the dawn of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Babylonian mathematical work comes from two widely separated periods: The first few hundred years of the second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period), and the last few centuries of the first millennium BC ([[Seleucid]] period).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of [[Babylon]] as a place of study. Later under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]], Mesopotamia, especially [[Baghdad]], once again became an important center of study for [[Islamic mathematics]].

[[File:Geometry problem-Sb 13088-IMG 0593-white.jpg|thumb|Geometry problem on a clay tablet belonging to a school for scribes; [[Susa]], first half of the 2nd millennium BCE]]
In contrast to the sparsity of sources in [[Egyptian mathematics]], our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003).

[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|thumb|left|The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.]]
Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"/&gt; From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"/&gt; Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27"/&gt; The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt;

Other topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation]]s and [[cubic equation]]s, a remarkable achievement for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for [[mathematical proof|proofs]] or logical principles.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41"/&gt;

[[File:Moskou-papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Image of Problem 14 from the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]]. The problem includes a diagram indicating the dimensions of the truncated pyramid.]]
[[Egypt]]ian mathematics refers to mathematics written in the [[Egyptian language]]. From the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Greek language|Greek]] replaced Egyptian as the written language of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] scholars. Mathematical study in [[Egypt]] later continued under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] as part of [[Islamic mathematics]], when [[Arabic]] became the written language of Egyptian scholars.

The most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Rhind papyrus]] (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of about 2000–1800 BC.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 11"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions] at MathPages&lt;/ref&gt; including [[composite number|composite]] and [[prime number]]s; [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]], [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean]]s; and simplistic understandings of both the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] and [[Perfect number|perfect number theory]] (namely, that of the number 6).&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://mathpages.com/home/rhind.htm --&gt;http://mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions]&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows how to solve first order [[linear equation]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Egyptian_papyri.html Egyptian Papyri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[arithmetic series|arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egypt_algebra.html#areithmetic%20series Egyptian Algebra – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Moscow papyrus]], also from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period, dated to c. 1890 BC.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 19"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of what are today called ''word problems'' or ''story problems'', which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a [[frustum]] (truncated pyramid).

Finally, the [[Berlin Papyrus 6619]] (c. 1800 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order [[algebraic equation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin Egyptian Mathematical Papyri – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek ==
{{Main|Greek mathematics}}
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|left|The [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] are generally credited with the first proof of the theorem.]]
Greek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the [[Greek language]] from the time of [[Thales of Miletus]] (~600 BC) to the closure of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] in 529 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following [[Alexander the Great]] is sometimes called [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used [[mathematical rigor]] to [[mathematical proof|prove]] them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal, "Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science", pp. 72–83 in Michael H. Shank, ed., ''The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 2000, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics is thought to have begun with [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624–c.546 BC) and [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] and [[Babylonian mathematics]]. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.

Thales used [[geometry]] to solve problems such as calculating the height of [[pyramids]] and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]]. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of [[irrational numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R. Choike|year=1980|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was preceded by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]],&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; the [[Neopythagorean]] mathematician [[Nicomachus]] (60–120 AD) provided one of the earliest [[Greco-Roman]] [[multiplication table]]s, whereas the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the [[British Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics'', New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{ISBN|0486204294}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the Neopythagoreans with the Western invention of the multiplication table is evident in its later [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] name: the ''mensa Pythagorica''.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics'', New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{ISBN|0486204294}}, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Platonic Academy]], in [[Athens]], became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], came.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=The Age of Plato and Aristotle p. 88"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calian |first=George F. |year=2014 |url=http://www.nec.ro/pdfs/publications/odobleja/2013-2014/FLORIN%20GEORGE%20CALIAN.pdf |title=One, Two, Three… A Discussion on the Generation of Numbers |publisher=New Europe College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015233836/http://www.nec.ro/pdfs/publications/odobleja/2013-2014/FLORIN%20GEORGE%20CALIAN.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as "breadthless length"), and reorganized the assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mathematical analysis|analytic method]] is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=The Age of Plato and Aristotle p. 88"/&gt;

[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–c. 355 BC) developed the [[method of exhaustion]], a precursor of modern [[Integral|integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of [[incommensurable magnitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, [[Aristotle]] (384–c. 322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conic sections 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Apollonius of Perga]] made significant advances in the study of [[conic sections]].]]
[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262–190 BC) made significant advances to the study of [[conic sections]], showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely [[parabola]] ("place beside" or "comparison"), "ellipse" ("deficiency"), and "hyperbola" ("a throw beyond").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''Conics'' is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (c. 276–194 BC) devised the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding [[prime numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the "Golden Age" of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably [[trigonometry]], largely to address the needs of astronomers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; [[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (c. 190–120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) is credited with [[Heron's formula]] for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.&lt;ref&gt;S.C.

AD 90–168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy is also credited with [[Ptolemy's theorem]] for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of π outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus' ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]].]]
Following a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the "Silver Age" of Greek mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Diophantus]] made significant advances in [[algebra]], particularly [[indeterminate equation|indeterminate analysis]], which is also known as "Diophantine analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[Diophantine equations]] and [[Diophantine approximations]] is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the ''Arithmetica'', a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and [[indeterminate equation]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arithmetica'' had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as [[Pierre de Fermat]], who arrived at his famous [[Fermat's Last Theorem|Last Theorem]] after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the ''Arithmetica'' (that of dividing a square into two squares).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the ''Arithmetica'' being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Haghia Sophia]] was designed by mathematicians [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]].]]
Among the last great Greek mathematicians is [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (4th  century AD).  He is known for his [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|hexagon theorem]] and [[Pappus's centroid theorem|centroid theorem]], as well as the [[Pappus configuration]] and [[Pappus graph]]. His ''Collection'' is a major source of knowledge on Greek mathematics as most of it has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" pp. 183–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pappus is considered the last major innovator in Greek mathematics, with subsequent work consisting mostly of commentaries on earlier work.

The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350–415). She succeeded her father ([[Theon of Alexandria]]) as Librarian at the Great Library{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the [[Christianity in the Roman Empire|Christian community]] in Alexandria had her stripped publicly and executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.asp Medieval Sourcebook: Socrates Scholasticus: The Murder of Hypatia (late 4th Cent.) from Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Her death is sometimes taken as the end of the era of the Alexandrian Greek mathematics, although work did continue in Athens for another century with figures such as [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] and [[Eutocius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" pp. 190–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Proclus and Simplicius were more philosophers than mathematicians, their commentaries on earlier works are valuable sources on Greek mathematics.  The closure of the neo-Platonic [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] by the emperor [[Justinian]] in 529 AD is traditionally held as marking the end of the era of Greek mathematics, although the Greek tradition continued unbroken in the [[Byzantine empire]] with mathematicians such as [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]], the architects of the [[Haghia Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Byzantine mathematics consisted mostly of commentaries, with little in the way of innovation, and the centers of mathematical innovation were to be found elsewhere by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Greeks|ethnic Greek]] mathematicians continued to live under the rule of the late [[Roman Republic]] and subsequent [[Roman Empire]], there were no noteworthy [[Latins (Italic tribe)|native Latin]] mathematicians in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|pp=194, 204–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC), an influential Roman statesman who studied mathematics in Greece, believed that Roman [[surveyor]]s and [[Mental calculator|calculators]] were far more interested in [[applied mathematics]] than the [[theoretical mathematics]] and geometry that were prized by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|pp=192–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if the Romans first derived [[Roman numerals|their numerical system]] directly from [[Greek numerals|the Greek precedent]] or from [[Etruscan numerals]] used by the [[Etruscan civilization]] centered in what is now [[Tuscany]], [[central Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|pp=120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using calculation, Romans were adept at both instigating and detecting financial [[fraud]], as well as [[List of Roman taxes|managing taxes]] for the [[treasury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siculus Flaccus]], one of the Roman ''[[gromatici]]'' (i.e. land surveyor), wrote the ''Categories of Fields'', which aided Roman surveyors in measuring the [[surface area]]s of allotted lands and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|pp=207–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from managing trade and taxes, the Romans also regularly applied mathematics to solve problems in [[Roman engineering|engineering]], including the erection of [[Roman architecture|architecture]] such as [[Roman bridge|bridges]], [[Roman roads|road-building]], and [[Roman military engineering|preparation for military campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|pp=119–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman art|Arts and crafts]] such as [[Roman mosaic]]s, inspired by previous [[Mosaics of Delos|Greek designs]], created illusionist geometric patterns and rich, detailed scenes that required precise measurements for each [[tessera]] tile, the [[opus tessellatum]] pieces on average measuring eight millimeters square and the finer [[opus vermiculatum]] pieces having an average surface of four millimeters square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Tang|2005|pp=14–15, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Joyce|1979|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Roman calendar]] also necessitated basic mathematics. The first calendar allegedly dates back to 8th century BC during the [[Roman Kingdom]] and included 356 days plus a [[leap year]] every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[lunar calendar]] of the Republican era contained 355 days, roughly ten-and-one-fourth days shorter than the [[solar year]], a discrepancy that was solved by adding an extra month into the calendar after the 23rd of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calendar was supplanted by the [[Julian calendar]], a [[solar calendar]] organized by [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BC) and devised by [[Sosigenes of Alexandria]] to include a [[leap day]] every four years in a 365-day cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calendar, which contained an error of 11 minutes and 14 seconds, was later corrected by the [[Gregorian calendar]] organized by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] ({{reign|1572|1585}}), virtually the same solar calendar used in modern times as the international standard calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At roughly the same time, [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|the Han Chinese]] and the Romans both invented the wheeled [[odometer]] device for measuring [[distance]]s traveled, the Roman model first described by the Roman civil engineer and architect [[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC - c. 15 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|2000|pp=281–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was used at least until the reign of emperor [[Commodus]] ({{reign|177|192 AD}}), but its design seems to have been lost until experiments were made during the 15th century in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|2000|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps relying on similar gear-work and [[Roman technology|technology]] found in the [[Antikythera mechanism]], the odometer of Vitruvius featured chariot wheels measuring 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter turning four-hundred times in one [[Roman mile]] (roughly 4590&amp;nbsp;ft/1400 m). With each revolution, a pin-and-axle device engaged a 400-tooth [[cogwheel]] that turned a second gear responsible for dropping pebbles into a box, each pebble representing one mile traversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sleeswyk|1981|pp=188–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|left|[[Counting rod numerals]]]]
Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called "rod numerals" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|2007|pp=194–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for "1", followed by the symbol for "100", then the symbol for "2" followed by the symbol for "10", followed by the symbol for "3". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counting rods|Rod numerals]] allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the ''[[suanpan|suan pan]]'', or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the ''suan pan'' is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in [[Xu Yue]]'s ''Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures''.

The oldest existent work on [[geometry]] in China comes from the philosophical [[Mohism|Mohist]] canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of [[Mozi]] (470–390 BC). The ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined the concepts of [[circumference]], [[diameter]], [[radius]], and [[volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:九章算術.gif|thumb|upright|right|''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from [[China]] (2nd century AD).]]
In 212 BC, the Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] commanded all books in the [[Qin Empire]] other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] of 212 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for [[Chinese pagoda]] towers, engineering, [[surveying]], and includes material on [[right triangle]]s.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196"/&gt; It created mathematical proof for the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mathematical formula for [[Gaussian elimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Straffin|1998|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise also provides values of [[π]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196"/&gt; which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139) approximated pi as 3.1724,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 3.162 by taking the [[square root]] of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Hui]] commented on the ''Nine Chapters'' in the 3rd century AD and [[Liu Hui's π algorithm|gave a value of π]] accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=100–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD [[Zu Chongzhi]] computed [[Milü|the value of π]] to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|2004|pp=20, 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a method which would later be called [[Cavalieri's principle]] to find the volume of a [[sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurred in the 13th century during the latter half of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the ''[[Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns|Precious Mirror of the Four Elements]]'' by [[Zhu Shijie]] (1249–1314), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to [[Horner's method]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"/&gt; The ''Precious Mirror'' also contains a diagram of [[Pascal's triangle]] with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the [[magic square]] and [[Magic circle (mathematics)|magic circles]], described in ancient times and perfected by [[Yang Hui]] (AD 1238–1298).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205" /&gt;

Even after European mathematics began to flourish during the [[Renaissance]], European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. [[Jesuit]] missionaries such as [[Matteo Ricci]] carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205"/&gt;

[[Japanese mathematics]], [[Korean numerals|Korean mathematics]], and [[Vietnamese numerals|Vietnamese mathematics]] are traditionally viewed as stemming from Chinese mathematics and belonging to the [[Confucian]]-based [[East Asian cultural sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=153–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean and Japanese mathematics were heavily influenced by the algebraic works produced during China's Song dynasty, whereas Vietnamese mathematics was heavily indebted to popular works of China's [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=154–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although Vietnamese mathematical treatises were written in either [[Chinese characters|Chinese]] or the native Vietnamese [[Chữ Nôm]] script, all of them followed the Chinese format of presenting a collection of problems with [[algorithm]]s for solving them, followed by numerical answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics in Vietnam and Korea were mostly associated with the professional court bureaucracy of [[History of astronomy|mathematicians and astronomers]], whereas in Japan it was more prevalent in the realm of [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant mathematical documents from India after the ''Sulba Sutras'' are the ''Siddhantas'', astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD ([[Gupta period]]) showing strong Hellenistic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of translation errors, the words "sine" and "cosine" derive from the Sanskrit "jiya" and "kojiya".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Around 500 AD, [[Aryabhata]] wrote the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', a slim volume, written in verse, intended to supplement the rules of calculation used in astronomy and mathematical mensuration, though with no feeling for logic or deductive methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though about half of the entries are wrong, it is in the ''Aryabhatiya'' that the decimal place-value system first appears.

Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs. In the 10th century, [[Halayudha]]'s commentary on [[Pingala]]'s work contains a study of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] and [[Pascal's triangle]], and describes the formation of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the 12th century, [[Bhāskara II]]&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 182–207&lt;/ref&gt; lived in southern India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, [[Mean value theorem|the mean value theorem]] and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 pp. 197–98; George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991 pp. 298–300; Takao Hayashi, ''Indian Mathematics'', pp. 118–30 in ''Companion History of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', ed.

The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] established across [[Persia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and in parts of [[History of India|India]] in the 8th century made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], most of them were not written by [[Arab]]s, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. [[Persian people|Persians]] contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.

In the 9th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]], were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing''). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230}} "The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwārizmī's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions."&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, pp. 263–77: "In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the fundamental method of "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229}} "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing" – that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation."&lt;/ref&gt; His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of problems to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." He also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=978-0792325659 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, [[Abu Kamil]] extended algebra to the set of [[irrational numbers]], accepting square roots and fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works was trying to find all the possible solutions to some of his problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions.&lt;ref name="HSTM"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Springer|  pages = 4–5| last = Sesiano| first = Jacques| title = Abū Kāmil | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures| year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.

Further developments in algebra were made by [[Al-Karaji]] in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Katz|1998|loc=pp. 255–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historian]] of mathematics, F. Woepcke,&lt;ref&gt;F. Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. [[Paris]].&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]]." Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]]. He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = Victor J. | year = 1995 | title = Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India | url = | journal = Mathematics Magazine | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 163–74 | doi=10.2307/2691411| jstor = 2691411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'', a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]. He was also the first to find the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. He was also very influential in [[calendar reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alam|first=S|year=2015|title=Mathematics for All and Forever|url=http://www.iisrr.in/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IISRR-IJR-1-Mathematics-for-All-...-Syed-Samsul-Alam.pdf|journal=Indian Institute of Social Reform &amp; Research International Journal of Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. He also wrote influential work on [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]]. In the 15th century, [[Ghiyath al-Kashi]] computed the value of [[π]] to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating ''n''th roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] and [[William George Horner|Horner]].

Other achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]], the discovery of all the modern [[trigonometric function]]s besides the sine, [[al-Kindi]]'s introduction of [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]], the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Ibn al-Haytham]], the beginning of [[algebraic geometry]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and the development of an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] by [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī|al-Qalasādī]].&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Empire]] from the 15th century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.

In the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], the [[Maya civilization]] that flourished in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] during the 1st millennium AD developed a unique tradition of mathematics that, due to its geographic isolation, was entirely independent of existing European, Egyptian, and Asian mathematics.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya numerals]] utilized a [[Radix|base]] of 20, the [[vigesimal]] system, instead of a base of ten that forms the basis of the [[decimal]] system used by most modern cultures.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt; The Mayas used mathematics to create the [[Maya calendar]] as well as to predict astronomical phenomena in their native [[Maya astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt; While the concept of [[zero]] had to be inferred in the mathematics of many contemporary cultures, the Mayas developed a standard symbol for it.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt;

{{see also|Latin translations of the 12th century}}

Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the biblical passage (in the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'') that God had ''ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisdom'', 11:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''[[quadrivium]]'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) "The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''", pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence,'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''"Boethius" Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily [[Latin translations of the 12th century|seeking scientific Arabic texts]], including [[al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]], and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators", pp. 421–62 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beaujouan, "The Transformation of the Quadrivium", pp. 463–87 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics.

Leonardo of Pisa, now known as [[Fibonacci]], serendipitously learned about the [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]] on a trip to what is now [[Béjaïa]], [[Algeria]] with his merchant father.  (Europe was still using [[Roman numerals]].)  There, he observed a system of [[arithmetic]] (specifically [[algorism]]) which due to the [[positional notation]] of Hindu–Arabic numerals was much more efficient and greatly facilitated commerce.  Leonardo wrote ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202 (updated in 1254) introducing the technique to Europe and beginning a long period of popularizing it.  The book also brought to Europe what is now known as the [[Fibonacci sequence]] (known to Indian mathematicians for hundreds of years before that) which was used as an unremarkable example within the text.

The 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward and John E. Murdoch (1987), eds., ''Mathematics and Its Applications to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages,'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) {{ISBN|052132260X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.

[[Thomas Bradwardine]] proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing:
V = log (F/R).&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 421–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradwardine's analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical technique used by [[al-Kindi]] and [[Arnald of Villanova]] to quantify the nature of compound medicines to a different physical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, John E. (1969) "''Mathesis in Philosophiam Scholasticam Introducta:'' The Rise and Development of the Application of Mathematics in Fourteenth Century Philosophy and Theology", in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge'' (Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales), at pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oresme.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicole Oresme]] (1323–1382), shown in this contemporary [[illuminated manuscript]] with an [[armillary sphere]] in the foreground, was the first to offer a mathematical proof for the [[divergent series|divergence]] of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics|first=Clifford A.|last=Pickover|authorlink=Clifford A.

His results were lost for several centuries, and the result was proved again by Italian mathematician [[Pietro Mengoli]] in 1647 and by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]] in 1687.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], [[William Heytesbury]], lacking [[differential calculus]] and the concept of [[Limit of a function|limits]], proposed to measure instantaneous speed "by the path that '''would''' be described by [a body] '''if'''... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant".&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 210, 214–15, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by [[Integral|integration]]), stating that "a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]".&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme]] at the [[University of Paris]] and the Italian [[Giovanni di Casali]] independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332–45, 382–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid's ''Elements'', Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oresme, "Questions on the ''Geometry'' of Euclid" Q. 14, pp. 560–65, in Marshall Clagett, ed., ''Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renaissance ==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
During the [[Renaissance]], the development of mathematics and of [[accounting]] were intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Heeffer, Albrecht: ''On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping'', Foundations of the Formal Sciences, [[Ghent University]], November 2009, p. 7 [http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/FOTFS2008-Heeffer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in [[Flanders]] and [[Germany]]) or [[abacus school]]s (known as ''abbaco'' in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performing [[bookkeeping]] operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of [[compound interest]], a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.

[[Piero della Francesca]] (c. 1415–1492) wrote books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d’Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', ed. G. Nicco Fasola, 2 vols., Florence (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''Trattato d'Abaco'', ed. G. Arrighi, Pisa (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero. ''L'opera "De corporibus regularibus" di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli'', ed. G. Mancini, Rome, (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', a painting traditionally attributed to [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], 1495, ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]
[[Luca Pacioli]]'s ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità]]'' (Italian: "Review of [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Ratio]] and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Proportion]]") was first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494. It included a 27-page [[treatise]] on [[bookkeeping]], ''"Particularis de Computis et Scripturis"'' (Italian: "Details of Calculation and Recording"). It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the [[mathematical puzzles]] it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: [http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf "The market for Luca Pacioli’s Summa Arithmetica"] (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Summa Arithmetica'', Pacioli introduced symbols for [[plus and minus]] for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. ''Summa Arithmetica'' was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain [[algebra]]. Pacioli obtained many of his ideas from Piero Della Francesca whom he plagiarized.

In Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] discovered solutions for [[cubic equation]]s. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] published them in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'', together with a solution for the [[quartic equation]]s, discovered by his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. In 1572 [[Rafael Bombelli]] published his ''L'Algebra'' in which he showed how to deal with the [[imaginary number|imaginary quantities]] that could appear in Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s book ''De Thiende'' ('the art of tenths'), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of [[decimal notation]], which influenced all later work on the [[real number system]].

Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, [[trigonometry]] grew to be a major branch of mathematics. [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] was the first to use the word, publishing his ''Trigonometria'' in 1595. Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grattan-Guinness | first = Ivor | year = 1997 | title = The Rainbow of Mathematics: A History of the Mathematical Sciences | publisher = W.W. Norton | isbn = 978-0393320305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;

==Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution==
===17th century===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].]]
The 17th century saw an unprecedented increase of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. [[Galileo]] observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. [[Tycho Brahe]] had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, [[Johannes Kepler]] was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of [[logarithm]]s by [[John Napier]] and [[Jost Bürgi]]. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[analytic geometry]] developed by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in [[Cartesian coordinates]].

Building on earlier work by many predecessors, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered the laws of physics explaining [[Kepler's Laws]], and brought together the concepts now known as [[calculus]]. Independently, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}, p. 379, "...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, [[applied mathematics]] began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of [[probability theory]] and the corresponding rules of [[combinatorics]] in their discussions over a game of [[gambling]]. Pascal, with his [[Pascal's Wager|wager]], attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th–19th century.

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]

The most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|&lt;span style="font-family:times new Roman;"&gt;''i''&lt;/span&gt;]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.

Other important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].

== Modern ==

=== 19th century ===
&lt;!-- Modern period stars here:
 * Mathematical analysis: Bolzano, Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass
 * "Purely existential" proofs by Dedekind and Hilbert
 * Dirichlet's "arbitrary function"
 * Cantor's different kinds of infinity
 * Concentration on structures instead of calculation (abstract algebra, non-Euclidean geometry)
 * Institutionalization
--&gt;
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]
Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].

[[Image:noneuclid.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]
This century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.
The Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180°. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].

The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[computer science]].

[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.

Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[Évariste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.

Abel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].

In the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].

The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Société Mathématique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].

In 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.

=== 20th century === &lt;!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki --&gt;
The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].

In a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.

[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|left|upright|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]
Notable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] proved the [[four color theorem]], controversial at the time for the use of a computer to do so. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt Gödel]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].

Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the "enormous theorem"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[André Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] "[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0821839675|978-0821839676}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]
[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had begun in the 1890s.
[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.

[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.

The development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[Rózsa Péter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].

At the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of Gödel's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.

[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]
One of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887–1920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.

[[Paul Erdős]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erdős number]] of a mathematician. This describes the "collaborative distance" between a person and Paul Erdős, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.

[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 978-0824715502 |pages= 99–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].

As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf Mathematics Subject Classification 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.

=== 21st century ===
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}
In 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincaré conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).

Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards [[Open access (publishing)|open access publishing]], first popularized by the [[arXiv]].

He was born in [[Zagreb]]. He graduated [[theoretical physics]] in 1966 and received his PhD in [[mathematics]] in 1973 at the [[Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb]]. He worked at the Faculty since 1966, becoming a full professor in 1982. He was awarded fellowships in the [[United States]] ([[Princeton University|Princeton]], 1974/75), [[France]] ([[Palaiseau]], 1978) and [[Italy]] ([[Trento]] in 1979, 1981).&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

As a mathematician, he investigates [[representation theory]], [[functional analysis]] and [[algebra]]. His most significant result is the research and of unitary and nonunitary dual group SU(''n'', 1), index generalization  for semisimple [[Banach algebra]]s, contributions to the research of Landau-type inequalities for infinitesimal generators to the theory of almost-summability.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

He was the director of Department of Mathematics at the Faculty of Science (1983–89), dean of the Faculty (1991–98), Editor-in-Chief of the journal ''[[Glasnik matematički]]'' (1990–1992) and editor of the conference proceedings ''Functional Analysis'' (1982, 1986, 1990, 1994). He was awarded Ruđer Bošković Science Award in 1983. He became a corresponding member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

He served as the Minister of Science and Technology in Croatia in 2000–2002, as a Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Science, Higher Education and Culture in 2002–2003.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8059">The '''Infinite sites model''' (ISM) is a mathematical model of [[molecular evolution]] first proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like other mutation models, the ISM provides a basis for understanding how mutation develops new alleles in DNA sequences. Using allele frequencies, it allows for the calculation of [[heterozygosity]], or [[genetic diversity]], in a finite population and for the estimation of [[genetic distance]]s between populations of interest.

The assumptions of the ISM are that (1) there are an infinite number of sites where mutations can occur, (2) every new mutation occurs at a novel site, and (3) there is no [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tajima | first1 = F | year = 1996 | title = Infinite-allele model and infinite-site model in population genetics | url = | journal = Journal of Genetics | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 27–31 | doi=10.1007/bf02931749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watterson | first1 = GA | year = 1975 | title = On the number of segregating sites in genetical models without recombination | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 256–276 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(75)90020-9 | pmid=1145509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ‘site’ refers to a single nucleotide base pair.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Number of Heterozygous Nucleotide Sites Maintained in a Finite Population Due to Steady Flux of Mutations|journal = Genetics|date = 1969-04-01|issn = 0016-6731|pmc = 1212250|pmid = 5364968|pages = 893–903|volume = 61|issue = 4|first = Motoo|last = Kimura}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because every new mutation has to occur at a novel site, there can be no [[homoplasy]], or back-mutation to an allele that previously existed. All identical alleles are [[identical by descent]]. The [[Four-gamete test|four gamete rule]] can be applied to the data to ensure that they do not violate the model assumption of no recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The mutation rate (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) can be estimated as follows, where &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt; is the number of mutations found within a randomly selected DNA sequence (per generation), &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt; is the effective population size.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Futschik | first1 = A | last2 = Gach | first2 = F | year = 2008 | title = On the inadmissibility of Watterson's estimator | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 212–221 | doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coefficient]] is the product of twice the gene copies in individuals of the population; in the case of diploid, biparentally-inherited genes the appropriate coefficient is 4 whereas for uniparental, haploid genes, such as mitochondrial genes, the coefficient would be 2 but applied to the ''female'' [[effective population size]] which is, for most species, roughly half of &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\theta=4N_e\mu^*

&lt;/math&gt;

When considering the length of a DNA sequence, the expected number of mutations is calculated as follows

&lt;math&gt;\mu^*=k\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Where k is the length of a DNA sequence and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the probability a mutation will occur at a site.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Watterson developed an estimator for mutation rate that incorporates the number of segregating sites [[Watterson estimator|(Watterson's estimator)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramirez-Soriano | first1 = A | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = R | year = 2009 | title = Correcting Estimators of Θ and Tajima's D for Ascertainment Biases Caused by the Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Discovery Process | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = | pages = 701–710 | doi=10.1534/genetics.108.094060| pmc = 2644958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to think of the ISM is in how it applies to genome evolution. To understand the ISM as it applies to genome evolution, we must think of this model as it applies to [[chromosome]]s. Chromosomes are made up of ''sites'', which are [[nucleotide]]s represented by either A, C, G, or T. While individual chromosomes are not infinite, we must think of chromosomes as continuous intervals or continuous circles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jian|last2=Ratan|first2=Aakrosh|last3=Raney|first3=Brian J.|last4=Suh|first4=Bernard B.|last5=Miller|first5=Webb|last6=Haussler|first6=David|date=2008-09-23|title=The infinite sites model of genome evolution|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14254|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=105|issue=38|pages=14254–14261|doi=10.1073/pnas.0805217105|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2533685|pmid=18787111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple assumptions are applied to understanding the ISM in terms of genome evolution:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* ''k'' breaks are made in these chromosomes, which leaves ''2k'' free ends available. The ''2k'' free ends will rejoin in a new manner rearranging the set of chromosomes (i.e. [[Chromosomal translocation|reciprocal translocation]], [[Fusion gene|fusion, fission]], [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]], circularized incision, circularized excision).
* No break point is ever used twice.
* A set of chromosomes can be duplicated or lost.
* DNA that never existed before can be observed in the chromosomes, such as [[horizontal gene transfer]] of DNA or viral integration.
* If the chromosomes become different enough, evolution can form a new species.
* Substitutions that alter a single base pair are individually invisible and substitutions occur at a finite rate per site.
* The substitution rate is the same for all sites in a species, but is allowed to vary between species (i.e. no [[molecular clock]] is assumed).
* Instead of thinking about substitutions themselves, think about the effect of the substitution at each point along the chromosome as a continuous increase in evolutionary distance between the previous version of the genome at that site and the next version of the genome at the corresponding site in the descendant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14030">In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse limit''' (also called the '''projective limit''' or '''limit''') is a construction that allows one to "glue together" several related [[mathematical object|objects]], the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects. Inverse limits can be defined in any [[category (mathematics)|category]].

== Formal definition ==

=== Algebraic objects ===

We start with the definition of an '''[[inverse system]]''' (or projective system) of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]]. Let (''I'', ≤) be a [[directed set|directed]] [[poset]] (not all authors require ''I'' to be directed). Let (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[indexed family|family]] of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ≤ ''j'' (note the order), called bonding maps, with the following properties:
# ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity on ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,
# ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ik''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''k''.
Then the pair ((''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''≤ ''j''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;) is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over ''I'', and the morphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the transition morphisms of the system.

We define the '''inverse limit''' of the inverse system ((''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''≤ ''j''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a particular [[subgroup]] of the [[direct product]] of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \varprojlim_{i\in I}{A_i} = \left\{\left.\vec a \in \prod_{i\in I}A_i \;\right|\; a_i = f_{ij}(a_j) \text{ for all } i \leq j \text{ in } I\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse limit ''A'' comes equipped with ''natural projections'' π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''A'' → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which pick out the ''i''th component of the direct product for each ''i'' in ''I''. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a [[universal property]] described in the next section.

This same construction may be carried out if the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]],&lt;ref name="same-construction"&gt;John Rhodes &amp; Benjamin Steinberg. The q-theory of Finite Semigroups. p. 133. {{ISBN|978-0-387-09780-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; semigroups,&lt;ref name="same-construction"/&gt; topological spaces,&lt;ref name="same-construction"/&gt; [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (over a fixed ring), [[algebra over a field|algebras]] (over a fixed ring), etc., and the [[homomorphism]]s are morphisms in the corresponding [[category theory|category]]. The inverse limit will also belong to that category.

=== General definition ===

The inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|category]] by means of a [[universal property]]. Let (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) be an inverse system of objects and [[morphism]]s  in a category ''C'' (same definition as above). The '''inverse limit''' of this system is an object ''X'' in ''C'' together with morphisms π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (called ''projections'') satisfying π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; π&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ≤ ''j''. The pair (''X'', π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)  must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair (''Y'', ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)  (i.e. ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''Y'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ≤ ''j'') there exists a unique morphism ''u'': ''Y'' → ''X'' such that the diagram

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:InverseLimit-01.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

[[commutative diagram|commutes]] for all ''i'' ≤ ''j'', for which it suffices to show that ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''u'' for all ''i''. The inverse limit is often denoted
:&lt;math&gt;X = \varprojlim X_i&lt;/math&gt;
with the inverse system (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) being understood.

In some categories, the inverse limit does not exist. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any other inverse limit ''X''&amp;prime; there exists a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]] ''X''&amp;prime; → ''X'' commuting with the projection maps.

We note that an inverse system in a category ''C'' admits an alternative description in terms of [[functor]]s. Any partially ordered set ''I'' can be considered as a [[small category]] where the morphisms consist of arrows ''i'' → ''j'' [[if and only if]] ''i'' ≤ ''j''. An inverse system is then just a [[contravariant functor]] ''I'' → ''C'', and the inverse limit functor
&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim:C^{I^{op}}\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; is a [[covariant functor]].

== Examples ==

* The ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the inverse limit of the rings '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) with the index set being the [[natural number]]s with the usual order, and the morphisms being "take remainder". That is, one considers sequences of integers &lt;math&gt;(n_0, n_1, \cdots)&lt;/math&gt; such that each element of the sequence "projects" down to the previous ones, namely, that &lt;math&gt;n_i\equiv n_j \mbox{ mod } p^{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;i&lt;j.&lt;/math&gt; The natural topology on the ''p''-adic integers is the one implied here, namely the [[product topology]] with [[cylinder set]]s as the open sets.
* The ring &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R[[t]]&lt;/math&gt; of [[formal power series]] over a commutative ring ''R'' can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]&lt;/math&gt;, indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R[t]/t^{n+j}R[t]&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]&lt;/math&gt; given by the natural projection.
* [[Pro-finite group]]s are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups.
* Let the index set ''I'' of an inverse system (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) have a [[greatest element]] ''m''. Then the natural projection π&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isomorphism.
* Inverse limits in the [[category of topological spaces]] are given by placing the [[initial topology]] on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit.  This is known as the '''limit topology'''.
** The set of infinite [[String (computer science)|strings]] is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are [[discrete topology|discrete]], the limit space is [[totally disconnected]]. This is one way of realizing the [[p-adic|''p''-adic numbers]] and the [[Cantor set]] (as infinite strings).
* Let (''I'', =) be the trivial order (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the [[product (category theory)|product]].
* Let ''I'' consist of three elements ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' with ''i'' ≤ ''j'' and ''i'' ≤ ''k'' (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]].

==Derived functors of the inverse limit==

For an [[abelian category]] ''C'', the inverse limit functor
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Exact functor|left exact]]. If ''I'' is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and [[countable]], and ''C'' is the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; that ensures the exactness of &lt;math&gt;\varprojlim&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] constructed a functor
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim{}^1:\operatorname{Ab}^I\rightarrow\operatorname{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;
(pronounced "lim one") such that if (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;), (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;), and (''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) are three projective systems of abelian groups, and
:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow A_i\rightarrow B_i\rightarrow C_i\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[short exact sequence]] of inverse systems, then
:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow\varprojlim A_i\rightarrow\varprojlim B_i\rightarrow\varprojlim C_i\rightarrow\varprojlim{}^1A_i&lt;/math&gt;
is an exact sequence in '''Ab'''.

===Mittag-Leffler condition===

If the ranges of the morphisms of an inverse system of abelian groups (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) are ''stationary'', that is, for every ''k'' there exists ''j'' ≥ ''k'' such that for all ''i'' ≥ ''j'' :&lt;math&gt; f_{kj}(A_j)=f_{ki}(A_i)&lt;/math&gt; one says that the system satisfies the '''Mittag-Leffler condition'''.

The name "Mittag-Leffler" for this condition was given by Bourbaki in their chapter on uniform structures for a similar result about inverse limits of complete Hausdorff uniform spaces. Mittag-Leffler used a similar argument in the proof of [[Mittag-Leffler's theorem]].

The following situations are examples where the Mittag-Leffler condition is satisfied: 
* a system in which the morphisms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are surjective
* a system of finite-dimensional vector spaces or finite abelian groups or modules of finite length or Artinian modules.

An example where &lt;math&gt;\varprojlim{}^1&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero is obtained by taking ''I'' to be the non-negative [[integer]]s, letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''', ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''Z''', and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z'''. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim{}^1A_i=\mathbf{Z}_p/\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[p-adic integers]].

===Further results===

More generally, if ''C'' is an arbitrary abelian category that has [[Injective object#Enough injectives|enough injectives]], then so does ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the right [[derived functors]] of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The ''n''th right derived functor is denoted
:&lt;math&gt;R^n\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case where ''C'' satisfies [[Grothendieck]]'s axiom [[Abelian category#Grothendieck's axioms|(AB4*)]], [[Jan-Erik Roos]] generalized the functor lim&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; on '''Ab'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; to series of functors lim&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim{}^n\cong R^n\varprojlim.&lt;/math&gt;
It was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ''Sur les foncteurs dérivés de lim. Applications. '') that lim&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and ''I'' the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called "[[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences"). However, in 2002, [[Amnon Neeman]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0. Roos has since shown (in "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited") that his result is correct if ''C'' has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)).

[[Barry Mitchell (mathematician)|Barry Mitchell]] has shown (in "The cohomological dimension of a directed set") that if ''I'' has [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_d&lt;/math&gt; (the ''d''th [[Aleph number|infinite cardinal]]), then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;lim is zero for all ''n'' ≥ ''d'' + 2. This applies to the ''I''-indexed diagrams in the category of ''R''-modules, with ''R'' a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos' "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited" for examples of abelian categories in which lim&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1).

== Related concepts and generalizations ==

The [[dual (category theory)|categorical dual]] of an inverse limit is a [[direct limit]] (or inductive limit). More general concepts are the [[limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: inverse limits are limits, while direct limits are colimits.

In [[logic]], the '''law of identity''' states that each thing is identical with itself. By this it is meant that each thing (be it a [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] or a [[particular]]) is composed of its own unique set of characteristic qualities or features, which the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called its [[essence]]. It is the first of the [[three classical laws of thought]].

In its [[symbol|symbolic]] representation, "''a''=''a''", "E''pp''", or "For all ''x'': ''x'' = ''x''". 

== Overview ==

In logical discourse, violations of the law of identity result in the [[informal logical fallacy]] known as [[equivocation]].&lt;ref&gt;Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each.&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, we cannot use the same term in the same discourse while having it signify different senses or meanings – even though the different meanings are conventionally prescribed to that term.  [[Corollary|Corollaries]] of the law of identity, "E''pp''", "''p'' [[if and only if]] ''p''", are the [[law of noncontradiction]], "NE''p''N''p''", "not that ''p'' if and only if not ''p''"; and the [[law of excluded middle]], "J''p''N''p''", "''p'' or not ''p'', exclusively",&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]] (1959), ''Precis of [[Mathematical Logic]]'', rev., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, New York:  Gordon and Breach, Part II, "The Logic of Sentences", Sect. 3.32, p. 11, and Sect. 3.92, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[prefix]] "J" represents the [[exclusive or]], the [[negation]] of the prefix "E", the [[logical biconditional]].  

In everyday language, violations of the law of identity introduce [[Semantic ambiguity|ambiguity]] into the discourse, making it difficult to form an interpretation at the desired level of specificity. The law of identity also allows for [[Substitution (logic)|substitution]].

== History ==

The earliest recorded use of the law appears to occur in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (185a), wherein [[Socrates]] attempts to establish that what we call "sounds" and "colours" are two different classes of thing:

{{quote|Socrates: With regard to sound and colour, in the first place, do you think this about both: do they exist? &lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Yes.&lt;br&gt;Socrates: Then do you think that each differs to the other, and ''is identical to itself''?&lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Certainly.&lt;br&gt;Socrates: And that both are two and each of them one?&lt;br&gt;Theaetetus: Yes, that too.}}

[[Aristotle]] takes recourse to the law of identity—though he does not identify it as such—in an attempt to negatively demonstrate the [[law of non-contradiction]]. However, in doing so, he shows that the law of non-contradiction is not the more fundamental of the two:

{{quote|First then this at least is obviously true, that the word 'be' or 'not be' has a definite meaning, so that not everything will be 'so and not so'. Again, if 'man' has one meaning, let this be 'two-footed animal'; by having one meaning I understand this:-if 'man' means 'X', then if A is a man 'X' will be what 'being a man' means for him. It makes no difference even if one were to say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number; for to each definition there might be assigned a different word. For instance, we might say that 'man' has not one meaning but several, one of which would have one definition, viz. 'two-footed animal', while there might be also several other definitions if only they were limited in number; for a peculiar name might be assigned to each of the definitions. If, however, they were not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated; for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.|Aristotle|source = ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book IV, Part 4, 1006a–b}}

It is used explicitly only once in Aristotle, in a proof in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6FTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137|title=From Mathematics to Philosophy (Routledge Revivals)|first=Hao|last=Wang|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093891315|title=On a passage of Aristotle.|first=Ivo|last=Thomas|date=1 April 1974|publisher=|journal=Notre Dame J. Formal Logic|volume=15|issue=2|pages=347–348|via=Project Euclid|doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093891315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When A belongs to the whole of B and to C and is affirmed of nothing else, and B also belongs to all C, it is necessary that A and B should be convertible: for since A is said of B and C only, and B is affirmed both of itself and of C, it is clear that B will be said of everything of which A is said, except A itself.|Aristotle|source = ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Book II, Part 22, 68a}}

Both [[Thomas Aquinas]] (''Met.'' IV, lect. 6) and [[Duns Scotus]] (''Quaest. sup. Met.'' IV, Q. 3) follow Aristotle. [[Antonius Andreas]], the Spanish disciple of Scotus (d. 1320), argues that the first place should belong to the law "Every Being is a Being" (''Omne Ens est Ens'', Qq. in Met. IV, Q. 4), but the late scholastic writer [[Francisco Suárez]] (''Disp. Met.'' III, § 3) disagreed, also preferring to follow Aristotle.

Another possible allusion to the same principle may be found in the writings of [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1431-1464) where he says: {{quote|... there cannot be several things exactly the same, for in that case there would not be several things, but the same thing itself. Therefore all things both agree with and differ from one another.&lt;ref&gt;De Venatione Sapientiae, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] claimed that the law of identity (sometimes called "Leibniz'Law"), which he expresses as "Everything is what it is", is the first primitive truth of reason which is affirmative, and the [[law of noncontradiction]] is the first negative truth (''Nouv. Ess.'' IV, 2, § i), arguing that "the statement that a thing is what it is, is prior to the statement that it is not another thing" (''Nouv. Ess.'' IV, 7, § 9). [[Wilhelm Wundt]] credits [[Gottfried Leibniz]] with the symbolic formulation, "A is A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curley |first1=E. M. |date=October 1971 |title=Did Leibniz State "Leibniz'Law"? |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=497-501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Boole]], in the introduction to his treatise ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'' made the following observation with respect to the nature of language and those principles that must inhere naturally within them, if they are to be intelligible:

{{quote|There exist, indeed, certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined. To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions, first, that from the sense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning, depart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.|}}

[[John Locke]] (''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' IV. vii. iv. ("Of Maxims") says:

{{quote|[...] whenever the mind with attention considers any proposition, so as to perceive the two ideas signified by the terms, and affirmed or denied one of the other to be the same or different; it is presently and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition; and this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for more general ideas, or such as are less so: e.g., whether the general idea of Being be affirmed of itself, as in this proposition, "whatsoever is, is"; or a more particular idea be affirmed of itself, as "a man is a man"; or, "whatsoever is white is white" [...]}}

[[Afrikan Spir]] proclaims the law of identity as the fundamental law of knowledge, which is opposed to the changing appearance of the empirical reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forschung nach der Gewissheit in der Erkenntniss der Wirklichkeit'', Leipzig, J.G. Findel, 1869 and ''Denken und Wirklichkeit: Versuch einer Erneuerung der kritischen Philosophie'', Leipzig, J. G. Findel, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lofting''' is a [[Technical drawing|drafting]] technique (sometimes using mathematical tables) whereby curved lines are generated, to be used in plans for streamlined objects such as aircraft and boats. The lines may be drawn on wood and the wood then cut for advanced [[woodworking]]. The technique can be as simple as bending a flexible object, such as a long strip of thin wood or thin plastic, so that it passes over three non-linear points, and [[scribing]] the resultant curved line; or as elaborate as plotting the line using [[computers]] or [[mathematical tables]].

Lofting is particularly useful in [[boat building]], when it is used to draw and cut pieces for [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s and [[keel]]s.  These  are usually curved, often in three [[dimension]]s. Loftsmen at the mould lofts of [[shipyard]]s were responsible for taking the dimensions and details from drawings and plans, and translating this information into templates, [[Batten|battens]], [[Abscissa and ordinate|ordinates]], cutting sketches, profiles, margins and other data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/lofting.html The Mould Loft]&lt;/ref&gt;  From the early 1970s onward [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/computer-aided-design.html# CAD-Computer Aided Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lofting was also commonly used in aircraft design before the widespread adoption of computer-generated shaping programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aircraftdesign.com/shortcrs2.html Aircraft Design Short Courses (website), ''Aircraft Design: Configuration Layout &amp; Loft'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melmoth2.com/texts/Lofting.htm] Melmoth 2 (website), ''Lofting'' (by [[Peter Garrison]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://visionarylofts.co.uk| title= Loft conversion }} Friday, March 30, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic lofting==
[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Tyneside Shipyards, 1943 DB23.jpg|thumb|left|Two men cutting templates in the mould loft, Tyneside Shipyards, 1943.]]

As ship design evolved from craft to science, designers learned various ways to produce long curves on a flat surface. Generating and drawing such curves became a part of ship lofting; "lofting" means drawing full-sized patterns, so called because it was often done in large, lightly constructed mezzanines or lofts above the factory floor. When aircraft design progressed beyond the stick-and-fabric boxes of its first decade of existence, the practice of lofting moved naturally into the aeronautical realm. As the storm clouds of [[World War II]] gathered in Europe, a US aircraft company, [[North American Aviation]], took the practice into the purely mathematical realm. One of that war's outstanding warplanes, the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], was designed using mathematical charts and tables rather than lofting tables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melmoth2.com/texts/Lofting.htm Melmoth 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lofting is the transfer of a ''Lines Plan'' to a ''Full Sized Plan''. This helps to assure that the boat will be accurate in its layout and pleasing in appearance. There are many methods to loft a set of plans.

Generally, boat building books have a detailed description of the lofting process, beyond the scope of this article. Plans can be lofted on a level wooden floor, marking heavy paper such as Red Rosin for the full-sized plans or directly on plywood sheets.

[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Tyneside Shipyards, 1943 DB88.jpg|thumb|Two men lifting templates in the mould loft, Tyneside Shipyards, 1943.]]

The first step is to lay out the grid, mark the Base Line along the length of the paper or plywood sheet. Then nail [[Battens]] every 12&amp;nbsp;inches (or more in some cases) where the station lines are to be set as a mark for the perpendicular line, which is marked with a T-square. The previous steps are followed in turn by marking the Top Line and the Water Line. Before continuing make sure to check the lines by using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and make sure the grid is square.

The second step is to mark the points from the table of offsets. All measurements off the table of offsets are listed in Millimeters or the  Feet, Inches and Eighths. The points are plotted at each station then use a small nail and a batten to Fair (draw with a fair curve) the boat's lines.

==Definitions==
;Full sized plan: A 1:1 scale construction drawing of a boat and its parts
;Lines plan: A scaled-down version of a full-sized drawing often including the body, plan, profile and section views

'''Michel Marie Deza''' (27 April 1939&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;{{citation|title=Preface to special issue in honor of Deza's 70th birthday|url=http://www.liga.ens.fr/~deza/PrefaceYannis.pdf|first=Yannis|last=Manoussakis|journal=European Journal of Combinatorics|doi=10.1016/j.ejc.2009.03.020|year=2010|volume=31|issue=2|pages=419|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719223915/http://www.liga.ens.fr/~deza/PrefaceYannis.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;-23 November 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ithea.org/pipermail/ithea-iss/2016-December/000782.html|title=[ITHEA ISS] Michel Deza|last=Deza|first=Elena|date=2016-12-02|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], specializing in [[combinatorics]], [[discrete geometry]] and [[graph theory]]. He was the retired director of research at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS), the vice president of the [[European Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasc.org/committees/presidium.asp European Academy of Sciences Presidium], retrieved 2009-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; a research professor at the [[Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaist.ac.jp/profiles/info_e.php?profile_id=536&amp;syozoku=12 Faculty profile at JAIST].&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the three founding editors-in-chief of the [[European Journal of Combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;

Deza graduated from [[Moscow University]] in 1961, after which he worked at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] until emigrating to France in 1972.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; In France, he worked at CNRS from 1973 until his 2005 retirement.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;
He has written eight books and about 280 academic papers with 75 different co-authors,&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; including four papers with [[Paul Erdős]], giving him an [[Erdős number]] of 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos0d.html Erdos0d, Version 2007, September 3, 2008], from the Erdős number project.&lt;/ref&gt;

The papers from a conference on combinatorics, geometry and computer science, held in Luminy, France in May 2007, have been collected as a special issue of the European Journal of Combinatorics in honor of Deza's 70th birthday.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt;

==Selected papers==
*{{citation|year=1974|title=Solution d'un problème de Erdös-Lovász|first=M.|last=Deza|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B|volume=16|issue=2|pages=166–167|doi=10.1016/0095-8956(74)90059-8|mr=0337635}}. This paper solved a [[Erdős conjecture|conjecture]] of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[László Lovász]] (in [http://www.math-inst.hu/~p_erdos/1975-32.pdf], p.&amp;nbsp;406) that a sufficiently large family of ''k''-subsets of any ''n''-element universe, in which the intersection of every pair of ''k''-subsets has exactly ''t'' elements, has a common ''t''-element set shared by all the members of the family. Manoussakis&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; writes that Deza is sorry not to have kept and framed the US$100 check from Erdős for the prize for solving the problem, and that this result inspired Deza to pursue a lifestyle of mathematics and travel similar to that of Erdős.
*{{citation|year=1983|title=On functions of strength ''t''|first1=M.|last1=Deza|first2=P.|last2=Frankl|author2-link=Péter Frankl|first3=N. M.|last3=Singhi|author3-link=Navin M. Singhi|journal=[[Combinatorica]]|volume=3|issue=3–4|pages=331–339|doi=10.1007/BF02579189|mr=0729786}}. This paper considers functions ƒ from subsets of some ''n''-element universe to integers, with the property that, when ''A'' is a small set, the sum of the function values of the supersets of ''A'' is zero. The strength of the function is the maximum value ''t'' such that all sets ''A'' of ''t'' or fewer elements have this property. If a [[family of sets]] ''F'' has the property that it contains all the sets that have nonzero values for some function ƒ of strength at most ''t'', ''F'' is ''t''-dependent; the ''t''-dependent families form the dependent sets of a [[matroid]], which Deza and his co-authors investigate.
*{{citation|year=1992|title=Facets for the cut cone I|first1=M.|last1=Deza|first2=M.|last2=Laurent|journal=Mathematical Programming|volume=56|issue=1–3|pages=121–160|doi=10.1007/BF01580897|mr=1183645}}. This paper in [[polyhedral combinatorics]] describes some of the facets of a [[polytope]] that encodes cuts in a [[complete graph]]. As the [[maximum cut]] problem is [[NP-complete]], but could be solved by [[linear programming]] given a complete description of this polytope's facets, such a complete description is unlikely.
*{{citation|year=1996|contribution=On skeletons, diameters and volumes of metric polyhedra|first1=A.|last1=Deza|first2=M.|last2=Deza|first3=K.|last3=Fukuda|title=Combinatorics and Computer Science|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=1120|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=112–128|doi=10.1007/3-540-61576-8_78|url=http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~deza/lncs1996.pdf|mr=1448925}}. This paper with Antoine Deza, who holds a [[Canada Research Chair]] in Combinatorial Optimization at [[McMaster University]], combines Michel Deza's interests in polyhedral combinatorics and metric spaces; it describes the metric polytope, whose points represent symmetric distance matrices satisfying the triangle inequality. For metric spaces with seven points, for instance, this polytope has 21 dimensions (the 21 pairwise distances between the points) and 275,840 vertices.
*{{citation|year=1997|title=Clin d'oeil on ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-embeddable planar graphs|first1=V.|last1=Chepoi|first2=M.|last2=Deza|first3=V.|last3=Grishukhin|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|volume=80|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1016/S0166-218X(97)00066-8|mr=1489057}}. Much of Deza's work concerns [[Isometry|isometric]] embeddings of graphs (with their [[shortest path]] metric) and metric spaces into vector spaces with the ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distance; this paper is one of many in this line of research. An earlier result of Deza showed that every ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; metric with rational distances could be scaled by an integer and embedded into a [[hypercube]]; this paper shows that for the metrics coming from [[planar graph]]s (including many graphs arising in [[chemical graph theory]]), the scale factor can always be taken to be&amp;nbsp;2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4780">In [[mathematics]], in the theory of [[rewriting]] systems, '''Newman's [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''', also commonly called the '''diamond lemma''', states that a [[Abstract rewriting system#Termination and convergence|terminating]] (or strongly normalizing) [[abstract rewriting system]] (ARS), that is, one in which there are no infinite reduction sequences, is [[confluence (term rewriting)|confluent]] if it is [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)#Local confluence|locally confluent]]. In fact a terminating ARS is confluent [[precisely when]] it is locally confluent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Baader]], [[Tobias Nipkow]], (1998) ''Term Rewriting and All That'', Cambridge University Press {{isbn|0-521-77920-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently, for every [[binary relation]] with no decreasing infinite chains and satisfying a weak version of the diamond property, there is a unique [[minimal element]] in every [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of the relation considered as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].

Today, this is seen as a purely combinatorial result based on [[well-foundedness]] due to a proof of [[Gérard Huet]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Huet]], "Confluent Reductions: Abstract Properties and Applications to Term Rewriting Systems", ''Journal of the ACM'' ([[JACM]]), October 1980, Volume '''27''', Issue 4, pp. 797 - 821.&lt;/ref&gt; Newman's original proof was considerably more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 260, Paterson(1990), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diamond lemma==
In general, Newman's lemma can be seen as a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] result about binary relations → on a set ''A'' (written backwards, so that ''a'' → ''b'' means that ''b'' is below ''a'') with the following two properties:

* → is a [[well-founded relation]]: every non-empty subset ''X'' of ''A'' has a minimal element (an element ''a'' of ''X'' such that ''a'' → ''b'' for no ''b'' in ''X''). Equivalently, there is no infinite chain {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ...}}. In the terminology of rewriting systems, → is terminating.
* Every covering is bounded below.  That is, if an element ''a'' in ''A'' covers elements ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'' in the sense that {{math|''a'' → ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' →  ''c''}}, then there is an element ''d'' in ''A'' such that {{math|''b'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''d''}} and {{math|''c'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''d''}}, where {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} denotes the [[reflexive closure|reflexive]] [[transitive closure]] of →.  In the terminology of rewriting systems, → is locally confluent.

If the above two conditions hold, then the lemma states that → is confluent: whenever {{math|''a'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''c''}}, there is an element ''d'' such that {{math|''b'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''d''}} and {{math|''c'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''d''}}. In view of the termination of →, this implies that every connected component of → as a graph contains a unique minimal element ''a'', moreover {{math|''b'' {{overset|&amp;lowast;|→}} ''a''}} for every element ''b'' of the component.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Cohn, (1980) ''Universal Algebra'', D. Reidel Publishing, {{isbn|90-277-1254-9}} (''See pp. 25-26'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Mathematical Society''' ({{lang-no|Norsk matematisk forening}}) is a professional society for mathematicians. It also organizes mathematical contests and the annual  [[Abel prize|Abel symposium]]. It was formed in 1918, with [[Carl Størmer]] elected as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Some History |url=http://matematikkforeningen.no:80/enghist.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121212504/http://matematikkforeningen.no:80/enghist.html|archive-date=2007-12-12 |website=Norwegian Mathematical Society |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8419">In [[geometry]] and in its applications to [[drawing]], a '''perspectivity''' is the formation of an image in a [[picture plane]] of a scene viewed from a fixed point.

==Graphics==
The science of [[graphical perspective]] uses perspectivities to make realistic images in proper proportion. According to [[Kirsti Andersen]], the first author to describe perspectivity was [[Leon Alberti]] in his ''De Pictura'' (1435).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kirsti Andersen]] (2007) The Geometry of an Art, page 1,Springer {{isbn|978-0-387-25961-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, [[Brook Taylor]] presented his ''Linear Perspective'' in 1715, where he explained "Perspective is the Art of drawing on a Plane the Appearances of any Figures, by the Rules of Geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|1992|loc=p. 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second book, ''New Principles of Linear Perspective'' (1719), Taylor wrote
:When Lines drawn according to a certain Law from the several Parts of any Figure, cut a Plane, and by that Cutting or Intersection describe a figure on that Plane, that Figure so described is called the ''Projection'' of the other Figure. The Lines producing that Projection, taken all together, are called the ''System of Rays''. And when those Rays all pass thro’ one and same Point, they are called the ''Cone of Rays''. And when that Point is consider’d as the Eye of a Spectator, that System of Rays is called the ''Optic Cone''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|1992|loc=p. 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projective geometry==
[[File:projection geometry.svg|200px|thumb|A perspectivity:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;ABCD \doublebarwedge A'B'C'D',&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[projective geometry]] the points of a line are called a [[projective range]], and the set of lines in a plane on a point is called a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]].

Given two [[line (geometry)|lines]] &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and a point ''P'' of that plane on neither line, the [[bijection|bijective mapping]] between the points of the range of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and the range of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; determined by the lines of the pencil on ''P'' is called a '''perspectivity''' (or more precisely, a ''central perspectivity'' with center ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=p. 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special symbol has been used to show that points ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by a perspectivity; &lt;math&gt;X \doublebarwedge Y .&lt;/math&gt; In this notation, to show that the center of perspectivity is ''P'', write &lt;math&gt;X \ \overset {P}{\doublebarwedge} \ Y.&lt;/math&gt; Using the language of functions, a central perspectivity with center ''P'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f_P \colon [\ell] \mapsto [m]&lt;/math&gt; (where the square brackets indicate the projective range of the line) defined by &lt;math&gt;f_P (X) = Y \text{ whenever } P \in XY&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This map is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], that is, &lt;math&gt;f_P (f_P (X)) = X \text{ for all }X \in [\ell]&lt;/math&gt;.

The existence of a perspectivity means that corresponding points are in [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]]. The [[duality (projective geometry)|dual]] concept, ''axial perspectivity'', is the correspondence between the lines of two pencils determined by a projective range.

===Projectivity===
The composition of two perspectivities is, in general, not a perspectivity. A perspectivity or a composition of two or more perspectivities is called a '''projectivity''' (''projective transformation'', ''projective collineation'' and ''[[homography]]'' are [[synonym]]s).

There are several results concerning projectivities and perspectivities which hold in any [[pappus's hexagon theorem|pappian]] projective plane:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishback|1969|loc=pp. 65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorem: Any projectivity between two distinct projective ranges can be written as the composition of no more than two perspectivities.

Theorem: Any projectivity from a projective range to itself can be written as the composition of three perspectivities.

Theorem: A projectivity between two distinct projective ranges which fixes a point is a perspectivity.

===Higher-dimensional perspectivities===
The bijective correspondence between points on two lines in a plane determined by a point of that plane not on either line has higher-dimensional analogues which will also be called perspectivities.

Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be two distinct ''m''-dimensional projective spaces contained in an ''n''-dimensional projective space ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt; be an (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional subspace of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with no points in common with either ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. For each point ''X'' of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the space ''L'' spanned by ''X'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-''m''-1&lt;/sub&gt; meets ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; in a point {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}}. This correspondence ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is also called a perspectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=pp. 282–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central perspectivity described above is the case with {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 1}}.

===Perspective collineations===
Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two distinct projective planes in a projective 3-space ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With ''O'' and ''O''* being points of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in neither plane, use the construction of the last section to project ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the perspectivity with center ''O'' followed by the projection of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; back onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the perspectivity with center ''O''*. This composition is a [[bijection|bijective map]] of the points of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto itself which preserves [[collinear]] points and is called a ''perspective collineation'' (''central collineation'' in more modern terminology).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1930|loc=p. 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let φ be a perspective collineation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each point of the line of intersection of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be fixed by φ and this line is called the ''axis'' of φ. Let point ''P'' be the intersection of line ''OO''* with the plane ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''P'' is also fixed by φ and every line of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''P'' is stabilized by φ (fixed, but not necessarily pointwise fixed). ''P'' is called the ''center'' of φ. The restriction of φ to any line of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not passing through ''P'' is the central perspectivity in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with center ''P'' between that line and the line which is its image under φ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">In [[probability theory]], The '''Poisson scatter theorem''' describes a probability model of [[random scattering]]. It implies that the number of points in a fixed region will follow a [[Poisson distribution]].

== Statement ==

Let there exist a chance process realized by a set of points (called hits) over a bounded region &lt;math&gt;K \in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:1) There are only a finite number of hits over the entire region ''K''.
:2) There are no multiple hits at a single point.
:3) There is homogeneity and independence among the hits. i.e. For any non-overlapping subregions &lt;math&gt;B_1,\ldots, B_k \in K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, the numbers of hits in these regions are independent.  

In any region ''B'', let ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of hits in&amp;nbsp;''B''. Then there exists a positive constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that for each subregion &lt;math&gt;B \in K&lt;/math&gt;, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; has a Poisson distribution with parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda |B|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;|B|&lt;/math&gt; is the area of ''B'' (remember that this is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, in other [[measure space]]s, &lt;math&gt;|B|&lt;/math&gt; could mean different things, i.e. length in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;). In addition, for any non-overlapping regions &lt;math&gt;B_1,\ldots,B_k&lt;/math&gt;, the random variables &lt;math&gt;N_{B_1},\ldots,N_{B_k}&lt;/math&gt; are independent from one another.

The positive constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is called the intensity parameter, and is equivalent to the number of hits in a unit area of ''K''. 
 
:&lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;math&gt;E(N_B)/ |B| = \lambda|B|/|B|  = \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Also, 

:&lt;math&gt; P ( \text{ one hit in B } )  = \lambda |B| e ^ {-\lambda|B|}  \rightarrow \lambda |B|  \text { as } |B| \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;

While the statement of the theorem here is limited to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem can be generalized to any-dimensional space. Some calculations change depending on the space that the points are scattered in (as is mentioned above), but the general assumptions and outcomes still hold.

==  Example  == 

Consider raindrops falling on a rooftop. The rooftop is the  region &lt;math&gt;K \in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, while the raindrops can be considered the hits of our system. It is reasonable to assume that the number of raindrops that fall in any particular region of the rooftop follows a poisson distribution.  The Poisson Scatter Theorem, states that if one was to subdivide the rooftops into ''k'' disjoint sub-regions, then the number of raindrops that hits a particular region &lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt; with intensity &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; of the rooftop is independent from the number of raindrops that hit any other subregion. Suppose that 2000 raindrops fall in 1000 subregions of the rooftop, randomly. The expected number of raindrops per subregion would be&amp;nbsp;2. So the distribution of the number of raindrops on the whole rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter&amp;nbsp;2. The distribution of the number of raindrops falling on 1/5 of the rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter&amp;nbsp;2/5. 

Due to the reproductive property of the Poisson distribution, k independent random scatters on the same region can superimpose to produce a random scatter that follows a poisson distribution with parameter &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\cdots+\lambda_k)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">In [[arithmetic]], '''quotition''' and '''partition''' are two ways of viewing fractions and division.

In '''quotition division''' one asks how many parts there are; in '''partition division''' one asks what the size of each part is.

For example, the expression

: &lt;math&gt; 6 \div 2&lt;/math&gt;

can be construed in either of two ways:

* "How many parts of size 2 must be added to get 6?" (Quotition division)
: One can write
:: &lt;math&gt; 6 = \underbrace{2+2+2}_{\text{3 parts}}. &lt;/math&gt;
: Since it takes 3 parts, the conclusion is that
:: &lt;math&gt; 6 \div 2 = 3. &lt;/math&gt;
* "What is the size of 2 equal parts whose sum is 6?".  (Partition division)
: One can write
:: &lt;math&gt; 6 = \underbrace{3+3}_{\text{2 parts}}. &lt;/math&gt;
: Since the size of each part is 3, the conclusion is that
:: &lt;math&gt; 6 \div 2 = 3.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a fact of elementary theoretical mathematics that the numerical answer is always the same either way:&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  This is essentially equivalent to the [[commutative law|commutativity]] of [[multiplication]].

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] involves thinking about a whole in terms of its parts. One frequent division notion, a natural number of equal parts, is known as ''partition'' to educators.
The basic concept behind partition is ''sharing''. In sharing a whole entity becomes an integer number of equal parts.
What quotition concerns is explained by removing the word ''integer'' in the last sentence. Allow ''number'' to be ''any fraction'' and you have quotition instead of partition.

A '''refactorable number''' or '''tau number''' is an integer ''n'' that is divisible by the count of its [[divisor]]s, or to put it algebraically, ''n'' is such that &lt;math&gt;\tau(n)|n&lt;/math&gt;. The first few refactorable numbers are listed in {{OEIS|id=A033950}} as
:[[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[18 (number)|18]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[40 (number)|40]], [[56 (number)|56]], [[60 (number)|60]], [[72 (number)|72]], [[80 (number)|80]], [[84 (number)|84]], [[88 (number)|88]], [[96 (number)|96]], [[104 (number)|104]], [[108 (number)|108]], [[128 (number)|128]], [[132 (number)|132]], [[136 (number)|136]], [[152 (number)|152]], [[156 (number)|156]], [[180 (number)|180]], [[184 (number)|184]], [[204 (number)|204]], [[225 (number)|225]], [[228 (number)|228]], [[232 (number)|232]], [[240 (number)|240]], [[248 (number)|248]], [[252 (number)|252]], [[276 (number)|276]], [[288 (number)|288]], [[296 (number)|296]], ...
For example, 18 has 6 divisors (1 and 18, 2 and 9, 3 and 6) and is divisible by 6. There are infinitely many refactorable numbers.

==Properties==
Cooper and Kennedy proved that refactorable numbers have [[natural density]] zero. Zelinsky proved that no three consecutive integers can all be refactorable.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zelinsky, "[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL5/Zelinsky/zelinsky9.pdf Tau Numbers: A Partial Proof of a Conjecture and Other Results]," ''Journal of Integer Sequences'', Vol. 5 (2002), Article 02.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; Colton proved that no refactorable number is [[perfect number|perfect]]. The equation [[greatest common divisor|GCD]](''n'', ''x'') = τ(''n'') has solutions only if ''n'' is a refactorable number.

Let &lt;math&gt;T(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of refactorable numbers which are at most ''x''.  The problem of determining an asymptotic for &lt;math&gt;T(x)&lt;/math&gt; is open. Spiro has proven that &lt;math&gt;T(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\log x} (\log \log x)^{o(1)}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiro|first1=Claudia|title=How often is the number of divisors of n a divisor of n?|journal=Journal of Number Theory|date=1985|volume=21|issue=1|pages=81-100|doi=10.1016/0022-314X(85)90012-5|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022314X85900125|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zelinsky conjectures that &lt;math&gt;T(x) \sim \frac{1} {4} \int_{3}^{x} (\log u)^{-\log 2} dx&lt;/math&gt;.

There are still unsolved problems regarding refactorable numbers. Colton asked if there are there arbitrarily large ''n'' such that both ''n'' and ''n'' + 1 are refactorable. Zelinsky wondered if there exists a refactorable number &lt;math&gt;n_0 \equiv a \mod m&lt;/math&gt;, does there necessarily exist &lt;math&gt;n &gt; n_0&lt;/math&gt; such that ''n'' is refactorable and &lt;math&gt;n \equiv a \mod m&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
First defined by [[Curtis Cooper (mathematician)|Curtis Cooper]] and Robert E. Kennedy&lt;ref&gt; Cooper, C.N.  and Kennedy, R. E. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/S0161171290000576 "Tau Numbers, Natural Density, and Hardy and Wright's Theorem 437."] Internat. J. Math. Math. Sci. 13, 383-386, 1990 &lt;/ref&gt; where they showed that the tau numbers has [[natural density]] zero, they were later rediscovered by [[Simon Colton]] using a computer program he had made which invents and judges definitions from a variety of areas of mathematics such as [[number theory]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Colton, "[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/colton/joisol.html Refactorable Numbers - A Machine Invention]," ''Journal of Integer Sequences'', Vol. 2 (1999), Article 99.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; Colton called such numbers "refactorable". While computer programs had discovered proofs before, this discovery was one of the first times that a computer program had discovered a new or previously obscure idea. Colton proved many results about refactorable numbers, showing that there were infinitely many and proving a variety of congruence restrictions on their distribution. Colton was only later alerted that Kennedy and Cooper had previously investigated the topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17393">In any [[quantitative science]], the terms '''relative change''' and '''relative difference''' are used to compare two [[quantities]] while taking into account the "sizes" of the things being compared. The comparison is expressed as a [[ratio]] and is a [[unitless]] [[number]]. By multiplying these ratios by 100 they can be expressed as [[percentage]]s so the terms '''percentage change''', '''percent(age) difference''', or '''relative percentage difference''' are also commonly used. The distinction between "change" and "difference" depends on whether or not one of the quantities being compared is considered a ''standard'' or ''reference'' or ''starting'' value. When this occurs, the term ''relative change'' (with respect to the reference value) is used and otherwise the term ''relative difference'' is preferred. Relative difference is often used as a quantitative indicator of [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] for repeated measurements where the outcomes are expected to be the same. A special case of percent change (relative change expressed as a percentage) called ''percent error'' occurs in measuring situations where the reference value is the accepted or actual value (perhaps theoretically determined) and the value being compared to it is experimentally determined (by measurement).

==Definitions==
Given two numerical quantities, ''x'' and ''y'', their ''difference'', {{nowrap|1=Δ = ''x'' − ''y''}}, can be called their ''actual difference''. When ''y'' is a ''reference value'' (a theoretical/actual/correct/accepted/optimal/starting, etc. value; the value that ''x'' is being compared to) then Δ is called their ''actual change''. When there is no reference value, the sign of Δ has little meaning in the comparison of the two values since it doesn't matter which of the two values is written first, so one often works with {{nowrap|1={{abs|Δ}} = {{abs|''x'' − ''y''}}}}, the [[absolute difference]] instead of Δ, in these situations. Even when there is a reference value, if it doesn't matter whether the compared value is larger or smaller than the reference value, the absolute difference can be considered in place of the actual change.

The absolute difference between two values is not always a good way to compare the numbers. For instance, the absolute difference of 1 between 6 and 5 is more significant than the same absolute difference between 100,000,001 and 100,000,000. We can adjust the comparison to take into account the "size" of the quantities involved, by defining, for positive values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''reference''&lt;/sub&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; \text{Relative change}(x, x_\text{reference}) = \frac{\text{Actual change}}{x_\text{reference}} = \frac{\Delta}{x_\text{reference}} = \frac{x - x_\text{reference}}{x_\text{reference}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relative change is not defined if the reference value (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''reference''&lt;/sub&gt;) is zero.

For values greater than the reference value, the relative change should be a positive number and for values that are smaller, the relative change should be negative. The formula given above behaves in this way only if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''reference''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive, and reverses this behavior if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''reference''&lt;/sub&gt; is negative. For example, if we are calibrating a thermometer which reads −6&amp;nbsp;°C when it should read −10&amp;nbsp;°C, this formula for relative change (which would be called ''relative error'' in this application) gives {{nowrap|1=((−6) − (−10)) / (−10) = 4/−10 = −0.4}}, yet the reading is too high. To fix this problem we alter the definition of relative change so that it works correctly for all nonzero values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''reference''&lt;/sub&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; \text{Relative change}(x, x_\text{reference}) = \frac{\text{Actual change}}{|x_\text{reference}|} = \frac{\Delta}{|x_\text{reference}|} = \frac{x - x_\text{reference}}{|x_\text{reference}|}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the relationship of the value with respect to the reference value (that is, larger or smaller) does not matter in a particular application, the absolute difference may be used in place of the actual change in the above formula to produce a value for the relative change which is always non-negative.

Defining relative difference is not as easy as defining relative change since there is no "correct" value to scale the absolute difference with. As a result, there are many options for how to define relative difference and which one is used depends on what the comparison is being used for. In general we can say that the absolute difference {{abs|Δ}} is being scaled by some function of the values ''x'' and ''y'', say {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Törnqvist et al.|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \text{Relative difference}(x, y) = \frac{\text{Absolute difference}}{|f(x,y)|} = \frac{|\Delta|}{|f(x,y)|} = \left |\frac{x - y}{f(x,y)} \right |.&lt;/math&gt;

As with relative change, the relative difference is undefined if {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} is zero.

Several common choices for the function {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} would be:
* max({{abs|''x''}}, {{abs|''y''}}),
* max(''x'', ''y''),
* min({{abs|''x''}}, {{abs|''y''}}),
* min (''x'', ''y''),
* (''x'' + ''y'')/2, and
* ({{abs|''x''}} + {{abs|''y''}})/2.

==Formulae==
Measures of relative difference are [[unitless]] numbers expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. Corresponding values of percent difference would be obtained by multiplying these values by 100 (and appending the % sign to indicate that the value is a percentage).

One way to define the relative difference of two numbers is to take their [[absolute difference]] divided by the [[maximum]] absolute value of the two numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;
d_r=\frac{|x-y|}{\max(|x|,|y|)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

if at least one of the values does not equal zero. This approach is especially useful when comparing [[floating point]] values in [[programming language]]s for [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] with a certain tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c-faq.com/fp/fpequal.html What's a good way to check for ''close enough'' floating-point equality]&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is in the computation of [[approximation error]]s when the relative error of a measurement is required.

Another way to define the relative difference of two numbers is to take their [[absolute value|absolute]] [[Subtraction|difference]] [[ratio|divided]] by some functional value of the two numbers, for example, the absolute value of their [[arithmetic mean]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
d_r=\frac{|x-y|}{\left(\frac{|x+y|}{2}\right)}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

This approach is often used when the two numbers reflect a change in some single underlying entity.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} A problem with the above approach arises when the functional value is zero. In this example, if x and y have the same magnitude but opposite sign, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{|x+y|}{2} = 0 ,
&lt;/math&gt;
which causes division by 0.  So it may be better to replace the denominator with the average of the absolute values of ''x'' and&amp;nbsp;''y'':{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

:&lt;math&gt;
d_r=\frac{|x-y|}{\left(\frac{|x|+|y|}{2}\right)}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Percent error==

'''Percent Error''' is a special case of the percentage form of relative change calculated from the absolute change between the experimental (measured) and theoretical (accepted) values, and dividing by the theoretical (accepted) value.

: &lt;math&gt;\%\text{ Error} = \frac{|\text{Experimental}-\text{Theoretical}|}{|\text{Theoretical}|}\times100&lt;/math&gt;.

The terms "Experimental" and "Theoretical" used in the equation above are commonly replaced with similar terms. Other terms used for ''experimental'' could be "measured," "calculated," or "actual" and another term used for ''theoretical'' could be "accepted."  Experimental value is what has been derived by use of calculation and/or measurement and is having its accuracy tested against the theoretical value, a value that is accepted by the scientific community or a value that could be seen as a goal for a successful result.

Although it is common practice to use the absolute value version of relative change when discussing percent error, in some situations, it can be beneficial to remove the absolute values to provide more information about the result. Thus, if an experimental value is less than the theoretical value, the percent error will be negative. This negative result provides additional information about the experimental result. For example, experimentally calculating the speed of light and coming up with a negative percent error says that the experimental value is a velocity that is less than the speed of light. This is a big difference from getting a positive percent error, which means the experimental value is a velocity that is greater than the speed of light (violating the [[theory of relativity]]) and is a newsworthy result.

The percent error equation, when rewritten by removing the absolute values, becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\%\text{ Error} = \frac{\text{Experimental}-\text{Theoretical}}{|\text{Theoretical}|}\times100.&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the two values in the [[numerator]] do not [[commutative|commute]]. Therefore, it is vital to preserve the order as above: subtract the theoretical value from the experimental value and not vice versa.

==Percentage change==

A '''percentage change''' is a way to express a change in a variable. It represents the relative change between the old value and the new one.

For example, if a house is worth $100,000 today and the year after its value goes up to $110,000, the percentage change of its value can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{110000-100000}{100000} = 0.1 = 10\%.&lt;/math&gt;

It can then be said that the worth of the house went up by 10%.

More generally, if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the old value and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the new one,

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Percentage change} = \frac{\Delta V}{V_1} = \frac{V_2 - V_1}{V_1} \times100 .&lt;/math&gt;

Some calculators directly support this via a {{kbd|%CH}} or {{kbd|Δ%}} function.

When the variable in question is a percentage itself, it is better to talk about its change by using [[percentage point]]s, to avoid confusion between [[relative difference]] and [[absolute difference]].

===Example of percentages of percentages===
If a bank were to raise the interest rate on a savings account from 3% to 4%, the statement that "the interest rate was increased by 1%" is ambiguous and should be avoided. The absolute change in this situation is 1 percentage point (4% − 3%), but the relative change in the interest rate is:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{4\% - 3\%}{3\%} = 0.333\ldots = 33 \frac{1}{3}\%.&lt;/math&gt;
So, one should say either that the interest rate was increased by 1 percentage point, or that the interest rate was increased by &lt;math&gt;33\frac{1}{3}\%.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the term "percentage point(s)" indicates an absolute change or difference of percentages, while the percent sign or the word "percentage" refers to the relative change or difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|Briggs|2005|loc=p. 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Comparisons===
Car ''M'' costs $50,000 and car ''L'' costs $40,000. We wish to compare these costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|Briggs|2005|loc=pp. 137&amp;ndash;139}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to car ''L'', the absolute difference is {{nowrap|1=$10,000 = $50,000 − $40,000}}. That is, car ''M'' costs $10,000 more than car ''L''. The relative difference is,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\$10,000}{\$40,000} = 0.25 = 25\%,&lt;/math&gt;
and we say that car ''M'' costs 25% ''more than'' car ''L''. It is also common to express the comparison as a ratio, which in this example is,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\$50,000}{\$40,000} = 1.25 = 125\%,&lt;/math&gt;
and we say that car ''M'' costs 125% ''of'' the cost of car ''L''.

In this example the cost of car ''L'' was considered the reference value, but we could have made the choice the other way and considered the cost of car ''M'' as the reference value. The absolute difference is now {{nowrap|1=−$10,000 = $40,000 − $50,000}} since car ''L'' costs $10,000 less than car ''M''. The relative difference,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{-\$10,000}{\$50,000} = -0.20 = -20\%&lt;/math&gt;
is also negative since car ''L'' costs 20% ''less than'' car ''M''. The ratio form of the comparison,

It is the use of the words "of" and "less/more than" that distinguish between ratios and relative differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|Briggs|2005|loc=p.140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;!--
===Comparing different groups===

Let's look at a group of people, some males and some females.  Here are the percentages of each subgroup that enjoy watching a particular TV show:

:  Males 35%
:  Females 75%

The absolute difference is 40 [[percentage points]] (75%&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;35%). The relative differences can be stated several ways:

:  47%  = 35%/75%
:  Males enjoy the TV show 47% as frequently as, or 53% less frequently than, females.
:  Or, about half as often as females.

:  214% = 75%/35%
:  Females enjoy the TV show 214% as frequently as, or 114% more frequently than, males.
:  Or, over twice as often as males.

As ratios:

:  0.47 = 35/75 Males relative to females.
:  2.14 = 75/35 Females relative to males.

As percentages:

:   47% = 35/75 Males relative to females.
:  214% = 75/35 Females relative to males.

===Characterizing change===

Now let's look at a group of [[genderless]] [[Martians]], before and after watching that TV show. The percentages of the group favorable to [[Earthling]]s are

:  Before 75%
:  After 35%

The absolute difference is &amp;minus;0.4 or &amp;minus;40% (35%&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;75%), e.g., Martian favorability to Earthlings decreased by 40 percentage points after watching the show. The relative difference (&amp;minus;0.4/0.75) can also be stated as a ratio (&amp;minus;0.53) or as a percentage (&amp;minus;53%), e.g., Martian favorability to Earthlings decreased 53% after watching the show.
--&gt;

==Other change units==

Change in a quantity can also be expressed logarithmically using the [[Units of measurement|unit]] of logarithmic change: the [[decibel]] and the [[neper]] (Np).  Normalization with a factor of 100, as done for [[percent]], yields the derived unit '''{{visible anchor|centineper}}''' (cNp), which aligns with the definition for percentage change for very small changes:
:&lt;math&gt; D_{cNp} = 100 \cdot \ln\frac{V_2}{V_1} \approx 100 \cdot \frac{V_2 - V_1}{V_1} = \text{Percentage change} \text{ when }\left | \frac{V_2 - V_1}{V_1} \right | &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Using cNp has two advantages.  First, the magnitude of the change expressed in cNp is the same whether ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen as the reference, since &lt;math&gt;\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1} = -1 \cdot \ln\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;.  In contrast, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2 - V_1}{V_1} \approx -1 \cdot \frac{V_1 - V_2}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;, with the approximation error becoming more significant as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; diverge.  For example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; !! ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; !! Change (cNp) !! Change (%)
|-
| 10 || 9 || -10.5 || -10.0
|-
| 9 || 10 || +10.5 || +11.1
|}

The second advantage is that the total change after a series of cNp changes equals the sum of the changes.  With percent, summing the changes is only an approximation, with larger error for larger changes.  For example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Change 1 (cNp) !! Change 2 (cNp) !! Total Change (cNp) !! Change 1 (%) !! Change 2 (%) !! Total Change (%)
|-
| 10 || 5 || 15 || 10 || 5 || 15.5
|-
| 10 || -5 || 5 || 10 || -5 || 4.5
|-
| 10 || 10 || 20 || 10 || 10 || 21
|-
| 10 || -10 || 0 || 10 || -10 || -1
|-
| 50 || 50 || 100 || 50 || 50 || 125
|-
| 50 || -50 || 0 || 50 || -50 || -25
|}

'''Roger Wolcott Richardson''' (30 May 1930 &amp;ndash; 15 June 1993) was a mathematician noted for his work in [[representation theory]] and [[geometry]]. He was born in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and educated at [[Louisiana State University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] where he obtained a [[Ph.D]]. under the supervision of [[Hans Samelson]]. He emigrated in 1970, and subsequently worked in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].

Richardson’s best known result states that if ''P'' is a [[parabolic subgroup]] of a [[reductive group]], then ''P'' has a dense orbit on its [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]], i.e., one whose closure is the whole space.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Soc., volume 6 (1974) 21&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt; This orbit is now universally known as the [[Richardson orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;G.I.

'''Statistical conclusion validity''' is the degree to which conclusions about the relationship among [[Variable (research)|variables]] based on the data are correct or ‘reasonable’. This began as being solely about whether the statistical conclusion about the relationship of the variables was correct, but now there is a movement towards moving to ‘reasonable’ conclusions that use: quantitative, statistical, and qualitative data.&lt;ref name="Cozby"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cozby |first=Paul C. |year=2009 |title=Methods in behavioral research |edition=10th |publisher= Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fundamentally, two types of errors can occur: [[Type I and type II errors|type I]] (finding a difference or correlation when none exists) and [[Type I and type II errors|type II]]  (finding no difference when one exists). Statistical conclusion validity concerns the qualities of the study that make these types of errors more likely.
Statistical conclusion validity involves ensuring the use of adequate sampling procedures, appropriate statistical tests, and reliable measurement procedures.

==Common threats==
The most common threats to statistical conclusion validity are:

=== Low statistical power===
[[Statistical power|Power]] is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (inverse of the type II error rate). Experiments with low power have a higher probability of incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis—that is, committing a type II error and concluding that there is no effect when there actually is (I.e. there is real covariation between the cause and effect). Low power occurs when the sample size of the study is too small given other factors (small [[effect sizes]], large group variability, unreliable measures, etc.).

=== Violated assumptions of the test statistics ===
Most statistical tests (particularly [[inferential statistics]]) involve assumptions about the data that make the analysis suitable for testing a hypothesis. Violating the assumptions of statistical tests can lead to incorrect inferences about the cause-effect relationship. The [[Robust statistics|robustness]] of a test indicates how sensitive it is to violations. Violations of assumptions may make tests more or less likely to make [[Type I and type II errors|type I or II errors]].

=== Fishing and the error rate problem===
Each hypothesis testing involves a set risk of a type I error (the alpha rate). If a researcher searches or "fishes" through their data, testing many different hypotheses to find a significant effect, they are inflating their type I error rate. The more the researcher repeatedly tests the data, the higher the chance of observing a type I error and making an incorrect inference  about the existence of a relationship.

=== Unreliability of measures===
If the dependent and/or independent variable(s) are not measured [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliably]] (i.e., with large amounts of [[measurement error]]), incorrect conclusions can be drawn.

===Restriction of range===
Restriction of range, such as [[Ceiling effect (statistics)|floor and ceiling effects]] or [[selection effects]], reduce the power of the experiment, and increase the chance of a type II error.&lt;ref name="Sackett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sackett |first=P.R. |last2=Lievens |first2=F. |last3=Berry |first3=C.M. |last4=Landers |first4=R.N. |year=2007 |title= A Cautionary Note on the Effects of Range Restriction on Predictor Intercorrelations |journal= Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=538–544 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6436643_A_cautionary_note_on_the_effects_of_range_restriction_on_predictor_intercorrelations/file/d912f50dd667aa5857.pdf |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.2.538 |pmid=17371098}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because [[correlation]]s are attenuated (weakened) by reduced variability (see, for example, the equation for the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] which uses score variance in its estimation).

=== Heterogeneity of the units under study===
Greater heterogeneity of individuals participating in the study can also impact interpretations of results by increasing the variance of results or obscuring true relationships (see also [[sampling error]]. , the higher the standard deviation will be. This obscures possible interactions between the characteristics of the units and the cause-effect relationship.

===Threats to Internal Validity===
Any effect that can impact the [[internal validity]] of a research study may bias the results and impact the validity of statistical conclusions reached. These threats to internal validity include unreliability of treatment implementation (lack of [[standardization]]) or failing to control for [[extraneous variables]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">In the [[theory of computation]], the '''Sudan function''' is an example of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive]], but not [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. This is also true of the better-known [[Ackermann function]]. The Sudan function was the first function having this property to be published.

It was discovered (and published&lt;ref&gt;Bull. Math. Soc. Roumaine Sci. 30 (1927), 11 - 30; Jbuch 53, 171&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1927 by [[Gabriel Sudan]], a [[Romania]]n [[mathematician]] who was a student of [[David Hilbert]].

'''Traian Lalescu''' ({{IPA-ro|traˈjan laˈlesku|lang}}; 12 July 1882 – 15 June 1929) was a [[Romania]]n [[mathematician]]. His main focus was on [[integral equations]] and he contributed to work in the areas of [[functional equation]]s, [[trigonometry|trigonometric series]], [[mathematical physics]], [[geometry]], [[mechanics]], [[algebra]], and the [[history of mathematics]].

==Life==
He went to the [[Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]], continuing high school in [[Roman, Romania|Roman]], and graduating from the [[Costache Negruzzi National College|Boarding High School]] in [[Iași]]. After entering the [[University of Iași]], he completed his undergraduate studies in 1903 at the [[University of Bucharest]].

He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in Mathematics from the [[University of Paris]] in 1908. His dissertation, ''Sur les [[Volterra integral equation|équations de Volterra]]'',  was written under the direction of [[Charles Émile Picard|Émile Picard]]. In 1911, he published ''Introduction to the Theory of Integral Equations'', the first book ever on the subject of [[integral equation]]s.

He was a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]], the [[Polytechnic University of Timișoara]] (where he was the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]], in 1920), and the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5576">In [[differential topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''Whitney conditions''' are conditions on a pair of [[submanifold]]s of a [[manifold]] introduced by [[Hassler Whitney]] in 1965. 

A '''stratification''' of a [[topological space]] is a finite [[filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] by closed subsets ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; , such that the difference between successive members ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;(''i'' &amp;minus; 1)&lt;/sub&gt; of the filtration is either empty or a smooth submanifold of dimension ''i''. The connected components of the difference  ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;(''i'' &amp;minus; 1)&lt;/sub&gt; are the '''strata''' of dimension ''i''. A stratification is called a '''Whitney stratification''' if all pairs of strata satisfy the Whitney conditions A and B, as defined below.

==The Whitney conditions in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two disjoint locally closed submanifolds of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, of dimensions ''i'' and ''j''.

* ''X'' and ''Y'' satisfy '''Whitney's condition A''' if whenever a sequence of points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … in ''X'' converges to a point ''y'' in ''Y'', and the sequence of tangent ''i''-planes ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' at the points ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to an ''i''-plane ''T'' as ''m'' tends to infinity, then ''T'' contains the tangent ''j''-plane to ''Y'' at ''y''.
* ''X'' and ''Y'' satisfy '''Whitney's condition B''' if for each sequence ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … of points in ''X'' and each sequence ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … of points in ''Y'', both converging to the same point ''y'' in ''Y'', such that the sequence of secant lines ''L&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' between ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to a line ''L'' as ''m'' tends to infinity, and the sequence of tangent ''i''-planes ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' at the points ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to an ''i''-plane ''T'' as ''m'' tends to infinity, then ''L'' is contained in ''T''.

[[John Mather (mathematician)|John Mather]] first pointed out that ''Whitney's condition B'' implies ''Whitney's condition A'' in the notes of his lectures at Harvard in 1970, which have been widely distributed. He also defined the notion of Thom–Mather stratified space, and proved that every Whitney stratification is a Thom–Mather stratified space and hence is a [[topologically stratified space]]. Another approach to this fundamental result was given earlier by [[René Thom]] in 1969.

[[David Trotman]] showed in his 1978 Warwick thesis that a stratification of a closed subset in a smooth manifold ''M''  satisfies ''Whitney's condition A'' if and only if the subspace of the space of smooth mappings from a smooth manifold ''N'' into ''M'' consisting of all those maps which are transverse to all of the strata of the stratification, is open (using the Whitney, or strong, topology). The subspace of mappings transverse to any countable family of submanifolds of ''M'' is always dense by Thom's [[transversality theorem]]. The density of the set of transverse mappings is often interpreted by saying that transversality is a [[generic property|'generic' property]] for smooth mappings, while the openness is often interpreted by saying that the property is 'stable'.

The reason that Whitney conditions have become so widely used is because of Whitney's 1965 theorem that every algebraic variety, or indeed analytic variety, admits a Whitney stratification, i.e. admits a partition into smooth submanifolds satisfying the Whitney conditions. More general singular spaces can be given Whitney stratifications, such as [[semialgebraic set]]s (due to [[René Thom]]) and [[subanalytic set]]s (due to [[Heisuke Hironaka]]). This has led to their use in engineering, control theory and robotics. In a thesis under the direction of Wieslaw Pawlucki at the [[Jagellonian University]] in Kraków, Poland, the Vietnamese mathematician Ta Lê Loi proved further that every definable set in an [[o-minimal structure]] can be given a Whitney stratification.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8784">In [[representation theory]], a '''Yangian''' is an infinite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], a type of a [[quantum group]]{{clarify|date=May 2017}}. Yangians first appeared in [[physics]] in the work of [[Ludvig Faddeev]] and his school{{clarify|date=May 2017}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s concerning the [[quantum inverse scattering method]]. The name ''Yangian'' was introduced by [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] in 1985 in honor of [[C.N. Yang]].{{why|date=May 2017}}

Initially, they were considered a convenient tool to generate the solutions of the quantum [[Yang–Baxter equation]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}

The center of Yangian can be described  by [[quantum determinant]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}

== Description ==

For any finite-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]] ''a'', Drinfeld defined an infinite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]] ''Y''(''a''), called the '''Yangian''' of ''a''. This Hopf algebra is a deformation of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''U''(''a''[''z'']) of the Lie algebra of polynomial loops of ''a'' given by explicit generators and relations. The relations can be encoded by identities involving a rational [[R-matrix|''R''-matrix]]. Replacing it with a trigonometric ''R''-matrix, one arrives at [[affine quantum group]]s, defined in the same paper of Drinfeld.

In the case of the [[general linear group|general linear Lie algebra]] ''gl''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, the Yangian admits a simpler description in terms of a single ''ternary'' (or ''RTT'') ''relation'' on the matrix generators due to Faddeev and coauthors. 
The Yangian Y(''gl''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined to be the algebra generated by elements &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt; with 1 ≤ ''i'', ''j'' ≤ ''N'' and ''p'' ≥ 0, subject to the relations

:&lt;math&gt; [t_{ij}^{(p+1)}, t_{kl}^{(q)}] -  [t_{ij}^{(p)}, t_{kl}^{(q+1)}]= -(t_{kj}^{(p)}t_{il}^{(q)} - t_{kj}^{(q)} t_{il}^{(p)}).&lt;/math&gt;

Defining &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}^{(-1)}=\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, setting

:&lt;math&gt; T(z) = \sum_{p\ge -1} t_{ij}^{(p)} z^{-p+1}&lt;/math&gt;

and introducing the [[R-matrix]] ''R''(''z'') = I + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''P'' on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;,
where ''P'' is the operator permuting the tensor factors, the above relations can be written more simply as the ternary relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ R_{12}(z-w) T_{1}(z)T_{2}(w) = T_{2}(w) T_{1}(z) R_{12}(z-w).}&lt;/math&gt;

The Yangian becomes a [[Hopf algebra]] with comultiplication Δ, counit ε and antipode ''s'' given by

:&lt;math&gt; (\Delta \otimes \mathrm{id})T(z)=T_{12}(z)T_{13}(z), \,\, (\varepsilon\otimes \mathrm{id})T(z)= I, \,\, (s\otimes \mathrm{id})T(z)=T(z)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

At special values of the spectral parameter &lt;math&gt;(z-w) &lt;/math&gt;, the ''R''-matrix degenerates to a rank one projection. This can be used to define the '''quantum determinant''' of  &lt;math&gt;T(z) &lt;/math&gt;, which generates the center of the Yangian.

The '''twisted Yangian''' Y&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''gl''&lt;sub&gt;''2N''&lt;/sub&gt;), introduced by G. I. Olshansky, is the co-ideal generated by the coefficients of

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ S(z)=T(z)\sigma T(-z),}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is the involution of ''gl''&lt;sub&gt;''2N''&lt;/sub&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sigma(E_{ij}) = (-1)^{i+j}E_{2N-j+1,2N-i+1}.}&lt;/math&gt;
Quantum determinant is the center of Yangian.

== Applications ==

=== Classical representation theory ===

G.I. Olshansky and I.Cherednik discovered that the Yangian of ''gl''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is closely related with the branching properties of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of general linear algebras. In particular, the classical Gelfand–Tsetlin construction of a basis in the space of such a representation has a natural interpretation in the language of Yangians, studied by M.Nazarov and V.Tarasov. Olshansky, Nazarov and [[Alexander Molev|Molev]] later discovered a generalization of this theory to other [[classical group|classical Lie algebra]]s, based on the twisted Yangian.

=== Physics ===
The Yangian appears as a symmetry group in different models in physics.{{why|date=May 2017}}

Yangian appears as a symmetry group of one-dimensional exactly solvable models such as [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|spin chains]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9310158 Hubbard model] and in models of one-dimensional [[relativistic quantum field theory]].

The most famous occurrence is in planar [[N=4 super Yang-Mills|supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]] in four dimensions, where Yangian structures appear on the level of symmetries of operators,&lt;ref&gt;Beisert, N. (2007). The S-matrix of AdS/CFT and Yangian symmetry. arXiv preprint arXiv:0704.0400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spill, F. (2009). Weakly coupled N= 4 Super Yang-Mills and N= 6 Chern-Simons theories from u (2| 2) Yangian symmetry. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2009(03), 014, https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3897&lt;/ref&gt; and [[scattering amplitude]] as was discovered by Drummond, Henn and [[Plefka]].

== Representation theory ==

Irreducible finite-dimensional representations of Yangians were parametrized by Drinfeld in a way similar to the highest weight theory in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. The role of the [[highest weight]] is played by a finite set of ''Drinfeld polynomials''. Drinfeld also discovered a generalization of the classical [[Schur–Weyl duality]] between representations of general linear and [[symmetric group]]s that involves the Yangian of ''sl''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; and the degenerate [[affine Hecke algebra]] (graded Hecke algebra of type A, in [[George Lusztig]]'s terminology).

Representations of Yangians have been extensively studied, but the theory is still under active development.
