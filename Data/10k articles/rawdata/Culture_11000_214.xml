The '''Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (AJKBISE)''' was established in 1973 through an ordinance promulgated by the [[Government of Azad Kashmir]]. It is located in [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir]]. Before the establishment of the AJK BISE, educational institutes in [[Azad Kashmir]] were included in the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore]] (BISE Lahore).

The first examination was conducted by this Board in 1974, in which 6,161 candidates of [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) &amp; [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSSC) appeared. The scope of its activities gradually increased. The rules and regulations of [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore]] have been adopted on the principle of [[Parity (law)|parity]] with [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

'''''A Luneta Mágica''''' ({{lang-en|The Magical Glasses}}) is a [[1869 in literature|1869]] [[romance novel|novel]] written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writer [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]. It is considered to be one of the first Brazilian [[fantasy|fantastic novels]] ever, comparable to the works of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].

==Plot==
The book tells the story of Simplício, a naïve and [[Near-sightedness|near-sighted]] man who lives with his brother Américo, an ascending politician, his cousin Anica and extremely religious aunt Domingas, and wishes to be able of seeing again one day. A friend of his, old man Nunes, takes him to Reis, an [[Optometry|optometrist]] who is able to make very powerful lenses; however, none of them are able to make Simplício see again. Reis then suggests Simplício to go see a friend of his, an unnamed [[Armenians|Armenian]] magician who makes magical lenses.

Simplício is finally able to see again, but the Armenian tells him that if he looks to someone or something for more than three minutes, he would see the evil enclosed on them. However, Simplício does not pay attention to the Armenian's warning, and starts seeing the evil parts of all things, and considered to be crazy, becomes a recluse.

Simplício accidentally destroys the "evil" lenses one day, and returns to see the Armenian – this time he gives to Simplício new lenses that make him see the '''good''' parts of all things. Being seduced and manipulated by everyone he knows, after many mishaps Simplício finally obtains the "sanity" lenses, and is able to live happily again.

'''Arthur Mitchell''', often referred to as the "'''Trinity Killer'''", is a fictional character in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''. The character is portrayed by [[John Lithgow]], who won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his performance. He is the main [[antagonist]] in season four. In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #34 of their "40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time".&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character overview ==
Arthur Mitchell is portrayed as an unassuming suburbanite and family man &amp;mdash; who for 30 years has been living a double life as a [[serial killer]]. In the series, FBI agent Frank Lundy dubs him the "Trinity Killer" because of a recurring pattern of three killings. The series shows that Mitchell's first murder is of a young woman in a bathtub, killed by slicing her [[femoral artery]] with a [[straight razor]] while putting her in a [[choke hold]], and holding up a small mirror so that he can see her face as she dies. His second victim is a married mother of two, whom he kidnaps. He forces her, by threatening her husband and children if she does not comply, to fall to her death from a carefully selected abandoned building. His third victim is a father of two, whom he [[Bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeon]]s to death with a hammer. At each site he places a small sample of his sister's ashes, and arranges the victim's arm to point at the ash. He has repeated this cycle in different cities all over the [[United States]]. Frank Lundy's superiors are skeptical about the existence of the Trinity Killer, leading him to launch a private inquiry into the murders that eluded him during his FBI career.

It is later discovered that, before these three, the Trinity Killer also kidnaps a young boy whom he dresses in cowboy pajamas and convinces to play with a train set in a recreation of his childhood. Following this, he will bury the boy alive in cement at a Four Walls' building site. These killings were not connected to the pattern until shortly before Mitchell's death, because the boys were reported as missing rather than dead.&lt;ref name="Lost Boys"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Lost Boys | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 29, 2009| season = 4 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, [[Dexter Morgan]] is fascinated by Mitchell's efficient killing methods and apparent ability to balance his familial responsibilities with his secret life as a serial killer.

=== Family ===
When Mitchell was 10, he innocently spied on his older sister taking a shower; when she saw him, she was so startled that she slipped and fell through the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and bleeding to death. His mother committed suicide two years later by jumping out of a window. His father blamed him for the tragedies that befell their family, and beat him for years until he was bludgeoned to death with a hammer (Dexter believes that Mitchell killed him).&lt;ref name="Road Kill"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Road Kill | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 26, 2009| season = 4 | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell re-enacts his family's deaths in his murders: the young woman represents his sister, the married mother of two represents his mother, the father of two represents his father, and the boy represents Mitchell himself.&lt;ref name="The Getaway"&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Getaway | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 16, 2009| season = 4 | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell lives with his wife, Sally, and his teenaged children, Jonah and Rebecca. He has another, older daughter by a previous relationship: Christine Hill, who witnessed one of his murders as a child. He treats her like a shameful secret, forbidding her from contacting him and keeping her existence hidden from his other family. She tries unsuccessfully to win his love, going so far as to commit murder for him; she kills [[FBI]] agent Frank Lundy and wounds Dexter's adopted sister [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] to protect her father from the police.&lt;ref name="Dex Takes a Holiday"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Dex Takes a Holiday | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 18, 2009| season = 4 | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her actions have the opposite of the intended effect, however: When he learns what she has done, Mitchell is enraged and tells her he wishes she had never been born. She commits [[suicide]] shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="The Getaway"/&gt;

== Story progression ==

=== Episode 37 ===
In season four, Mitchell begins the cycle again, killing his victims at the original [[murder]] sites. After killing the woman in the bathtub, Mitchell takes a shower in scalding hot water and, after forcing a mother to fall to her death, he provokes a drunken man into beating him up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Living the Dream | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = September 27, 2009| season = 4 | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episode 40 ===
[[FBI]] agent Frank Lundy comes out of retirement to hunt Trinity down, but is shot and killed just as he begins to close in on him. Lundy had theorized that Trinity was a loner who had no life outside killing. When Dexter goes to kill Trinity, he discovers that Trinity is a husband and father, as well as a prominent figure in a charitable [[Christianity|Christian]] homebuilding organization. He uses this organization to travel around the country to cover for his murder spree, and (it is later learned) as a dump site for the first victim in his cycle.&lt;ref name="Dex Takes a Holiday"/&gt;

=== Episode 43 ===
Dexter is conflicted over whether to kill Mitchell or learn how he make his family life work. Dexter, under the alias of Kyle Butler, befriends Mitchell and soon learns that, unlike Dexter, Mitchell apparently has no problem being himself with his family or expressing affection. He also witnesses Mitchell's strange, unpredictable personality; the same man who murders people with uncommon brutality starts crying when he and Dexter hit a [[deer]], and is appalled at the idea of putting it out of its misery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Slack Tide | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 8, 2009| season = 4 | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episode 44 ===
As Mitchell plans a trip to [[Tampa]] to build a house, Dexter concocts a plan to go to a [[Meteorology|meteorological]] convention to establish an alibi so he has a reason to be in Tampa as well. Mitchell reluctantly allows Dexter to tag along when Dexter claims he's done something terrible that only Mitchell can help him recover from. Dexter, hoping to redeem his murder of an innocent man, plans to murder the decidedly guilty Mitchell along the way. During their road trip, however, Mitchell pushes Dexter to admit his terrible deed, and Dexter claims to have killed someone in a hunting accident. This admission greatly affects Mitchell, who sees it as a sign of kinship. He takes Dexter to his old home and tells him that when he was 10, he startled his sister while spying on her in the shower; she fell and broke the glass door, slicing her femoral artery and [[Exsanguination|bleeding to death]]. His mother later committed [[suicide]] by leaping off a building, leaving him in the care of his [[Child abuse|abusive]] father; Dexter conjectures that Mitchell bludgeoned his father to death, accounting for the third victim.&lt;ref name="Road Kill"/&gt;

For the remainder of the trip Mitchell exhibits sudden mood swings and irrational behavior. He keeps telling random people about his family members' deaths and stresses the need for confession, to the point that Dexter is actually worried that Mitchell might tell people about Dexter's previously mentioned murder. One morning, Dexter sneaks into Mitchell's room, intent on killing him, only to find him gone. Dexter tracks him to a construction site where Mitchell attempts [[suicide]]. Dexter reluctantly stops him, wanting to kill Mitchell himself. Dexter contemplates letting Mitchell fall to his death, but as he's about to let go, workers at the site come to help Dexter save him. Afterward, Mitchell has a newfound zest for life, believing God sent Dexter to save him.&lt;ref name="Road Kill"/&gt;

=== Episode 45 ===
As Dexter gets to know Mitchell, he learns that his would-be mentor is not the loving family man he appears to be; Mitchell dominates his wife, beats his son and keeps his daughter virtually imprisoned in her room. During [[Thanksgiving]], Mitchell's son, Jonah, lashes out at his father, destroying his homebuilder's plaques and smashing his sister's urn. In a fit of rage, Mitchell almost strangles Jonah, but Dexter interferes, dragging him into the kitchen. Just as Dexter has Mitchell at his mercy, however, Mitchell's wife and daughter rush in to stop him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Hungry Man | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 22, 2009| season = 4 | number = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodes 46 and 47 ===
Dexter witnesses Mitchell kidnap a child, but is unable to stop him. Eventually Dexter tracks him down as he's about to bury the boy alive in drying concrete. Dexter saves the boy, but Mitchell escapes. After Mitchell learns from a news report that the boy is alive, and that Dexter didn't turn him in, he begins to become suspicious. As he tries to find Dexter he kills a man named Kyle Butler, and ultimately follows Dexter to the Miami Metro Police Department. There, he discovers Dexter's real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Hello, Dexter Morgan | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = December 6, 2009| season = 4 | number = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episode 48 ===
In the last episode of the season, "[[The Getaway (Dexter episode)|The Getaway]]", Dexter subdues Mitchell and prepares to kill him in the room where Mitchell had held the kidnapped child. Mitchell believes Dexter was sent by God to kill him, and claims that he had tried several times to stop killing, but found that he could not change his "path". He predicts a similar fate for Dexter: he tells Dexter "It's already over", the same thing he says to his victims before he kills them. Dexter then kills him with a hammer. It is revealed in the final scene of the episode that Mitchell killed Dexter's wife, [[Rita Bennett|Rita]], in the bathtub of Dexter's house, and that he left Dexter's son Harrison in her blood, mirroring the childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] that put Dexter on the path to becoming a serial killer.&lt;ref name="The Getaway"/&gt;

=== Episode 52 ===
Miami Metro detective [[Joey Quinn]] suspects Dexter of killing Rita, and he connects the dots as for the identity of Kyle Butler. Anxious to further his investigation, Quinn requests permission from Captain [[Maria LaGuerta]], but she denies his request and orders him to leave Dexter alone. Undeterred, Quinn finds Jonah Mitchell amidst being relocated into [[witness protection]] with the rest of his family, and tries to show him a picture of Dexter so that Jonah can confirm whether or not it is "Kyle Butler". However, one of the FBI convoys manages to intercept Quinn's attempt before he succeeds, and so Quinn's query remains unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Beauty and the Beast | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = October 17, 2010| season = 5 | number = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episode 67 ===
In the sixth season, Dexter hears news about the Mitchell family, who are now living in [[Nebraska]]: Mitchell's wife, Sally, and daughter, Rebecca, have been murdered in the same way as were Mitchell's victims. Dexter deduces that Jonah is the killer, and hunts him down. At first, Jonah claims his father killed them both, but later gets into a fight with Dexter, seemingly wanting to die by Dexter's hand. Confused, Dexter gets Jonah to confess that Rebecca actually committed suicide because their mother kept blaming the children for Mitchell's capture; upon finding her, Jonah flew into a fit of rage and killed his mother, bludgeoning her in the same manner that his father killed his victims. Dexter tells Jonah to forgive himself, and leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Nebraska | episodelink = | series = Dexter| serieslink = Dexter (TV series) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | airdate = November 13, 2011| season = 6 | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barasana refers to themselves as the ''jebá.~baca'', or people of the jaguar (''Jebá'' "jaguar" is their mythical ancestor).&lt;ref name=Gomez-Imbert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gomez-Imbert|first=Elsa|author2=Michael Kenstowicz|title=Barasana Tone and Accent|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=October 2000|volume=66|issue=4|page=461|doi=10.1086/466437|jstor=1265845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography, ecology==
Barasana territory lies in the central sector of the Colombian Northwest [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]]. The Barasana inhabit the Pirá-piraná river basin of the [[Vaupés Department|Comiseria de Vaupés]] between the two main river systems of the [[Vaupés River]]  and the [[Japurá River]] . The area is a [[tropical rainforest]], interspersed with occasional stands of [[Mauritia flexuosa]] or mirití palm and [[savanna]]  with [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] vegetation. [[Rain]]fall averages around {{convert|3500|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per [[year]].&lt;ref name="Palm 2"&gt;pp.18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Elizabeth Jackson p.50"&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

Its climate is marked by four seasons, a long dry spell from December to March followed by the wet season from March to August, a short dry season between August and September, followed by a rainy season from September until December. The average temperature varies between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius (68 and 86&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Palm 2"/&gt; It is notorious for its treacherous  rivers that are choked with dangerous rapids and falls. The number of [[fauna]]l species is not rich, and individual animals not common,  though hunting game is prized as the  fundamentally male mode of procuring food. Fish also, despite the many rivers, do not abound.&lt;ref name=Reichel-Dolmatoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Reichel-Dolmatoff|first=Gerardo|title=Amazonian cosmos; the sexual and religious symbolism of the Tukano Indians.|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226707310|page=13|edition=4. Aufl.}} For a list of edible foods and animals in the Vaupés area see pp. 11-14, and Appendix 3, pp. 274-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic group context==
The Vaupés area is inhabited  by roughly 20 tribes or descent groups.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Goldman, writing in 1948, identified 18 sub-tribes of the Eastern Tukunoan group Irving Goldman, ‘The Tribes of the Uapes-Caqueta Region,’ p.764: The Taiwano taxonomy has 22 groups: ''Bará'', ''Barasana'', ''Cabinyari'', ''Carijona'', ''Cubeo'', ''Curripaco'', ''Desana'', ''Letuama'', ''Macú'', ''Macuna'', ''[[Pirá-Tapuya]]'', ''Siriano'', ''Taiwano'', ''Tanimuka'', ''Tatuyo'', ''[[Tariana people|Tariana]]'', ''Tucano'', ''Tuyuca'', ''Uanano'', ''Yauna'', and ''Yurutí''. See François Correa Rubio, ''Por el Camino de la Anaconda Remedio, '' Univ. Nacional de Colombia, 1996 p.375&lt;/ref&gt; The word tribe is generally disdained by anthropologists, who prefer to define groups by such terms as [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]], [[language group]], [[Exogamy|exogamous group]] or [[phratry]].,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.50,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Gomez Imbert, ‘Conceptual categories and linguistic classification’, in John Joseph Gumperz, Stephen C. Levinson (eds.) ''Rethinking linguistic relativity, '' Cambridge University Press, 1996 Cambridge University Press, 1996 pp.438-469 .p.442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, '' The Palm and the Pleiades,'' pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; living in an unbounded system, that is [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Multilingualism|multilingual]].&lt;ref&gt;’i.e. ‘a large geographical area in which people are basically similar and distance and differentiation are seen in terms of degrees rather than absolutes’ Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ''The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, '' p.7: Reichel-Dolmatoff, following Goldman, called this system ‘cosmopolitan’ . See Irving Goldman 1963 p.15; Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff ‘Review of The Cubeo: Indians of the Northwest Amazon by Irving Goldman ,’ p.1378. For multilingualism see Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.56: Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the  [[Nadahup languages|Maku]] and the [[Maipurean|Arawakan]],  Vaupés Indians  belong to Eastern [[Tucanoan languages|Tukanoan language family]], most prominent of them being, other than the Barasana, the Desana, the Bará, the [[Tucano people|Tukano]] proper, the [[Macuna]], the Tatuyo, and the [[Cubeo]].&lt;ref name="Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff p.1"&gt;Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, ''Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, '' p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the established system of intermarriage, their languages are mutually unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Jean Elizabeth Jackson p.53"&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.53&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Creole languages|Creole]]-type [[lingua franca]], called locally [[Língua Geral|lingua geral]], created by the [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit missionaries]] as a general language for communicating with Indians in the lower reaches of the Amazon,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shermer, ''In Darwin's shadow: the life and science of Alfred Russel Wallace : a biographical study on the psychology of history,'' Oxford University Press US, 2002 p.67&lt;/ref&gt; is also spoken among them.

==History==
The various Tukanoan myths of origin refer to a westward upstream migration from Brazil, and Reichel-Dolmatoff believes that there is a ‘kernel of historical truth’ behind these uniform traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ''The fish people, '' p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Curt Nimuendajú]] thought that the east Tukanoan tribes invaded from the west, and that the [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] population consisted of the [[Nadahup languages|Makú]], assuming that these smaller hunter-gatherers were older than the agriculturalist newcomers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra Aikhenvald|Aleksandra Yurievna Aĭkhenvald]], ''Language contact in Amazonia. '' Oxford University Press, 2002 reprint, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Desultory Spanish contact with the Vaupés region goes back to the 16th century. But historical records show that the Tukano peoples shifted to the remote headwaters of the [[Vaupés River|Río Negro]] as a refuge, in flight from the [[slave trade]] and diseases, and forced [[Deportation|relocations]] introduced by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the late 18th.century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan David Hill, ''Made-from-bone: trickster myths, music, and history from the Amazon, '' University of Illinois Press, 2008 p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alcionilio Brüzzi Alves da Silva, '' A civilização indígena do Uaupés: observações antropológicas etnográficas e sociológicas,'' São Paulo, 1962 p.22, cited Stephen Hugh-Jones, '' The Palm and the Pleiades'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], in travelling up the Vaupés river in 1850&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones,''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Goldman, ''The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, '' University of Illinois Press, 1963 p.12 puts the date as 1853. The difference may reflect the fact that  Wallace’s book, ''Palm Trees of the Amazon and their uses'', was published in 1853.&lt;/ref&gt; who first took note of Indians like the Barasana and their [[dialect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;He composed ten [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] and synonymies, published in the first edition of his account, but dropped from subsequent editions. See Michael Shermer, ''In Darwin's shadow: the life and science of Alfred Russel Wallace, '' p.67&lt;/ref&gt; and the rites of their Yurupary [[cult]]. According to his account, traders were already active in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Camilo Domínguez, Augusto Gómez, ''La economía extractiva en la Amazonia colombiana, 1850-1930, '' Corporación Colombiana Para la Amazonia Araracuara, 1990 p.124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] entered the area in the last decades of the 19th century. One major reaction to this [[evangelisation]] in the Vaupés, initiated by Venancio Aniseto Kamiko,&lt;ref&gt;Robin M.Wright &amp; Jonathan D.Hill, ‘Venancio Kamiko: Wakuenai Shaman and Messiah,’ in E. Jean Langdon and. Gerhard Baer, (eds.) ''Portals of Power: : Shamanism in South America, '' University of New Mexico Press, 1992 1992  pp. 257-286.&lt;/ref&gt; was to create a wave of [[Millennialism|messianic]] cults among the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ‘Shamans, Prophets, Priests and Pastors,’ pp.47ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries were convinced that the central cult of Yurupary, their [[culture hero]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; was the work of the [[Satan|Devil]], though this was a series of rituals rather than a divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman wrote that the "great spirit"called Yuruparí believed to be worshipped through the Vaupés was a fiction. ‘In simple fact there is no Yuruparí. The term is [[jargon]] from the trade language of the Amazon based heavily upon [[Tupian languages|Tupían]] and is used indiscriminately by the Indians to refer to anything that is [[sacred]] and [[Taboo (book)|taboo]].’ Irving Goldman, ''The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon,'' p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was widespread damage to the native culture. as ceremonial houses were burnt, ritual ornaments destroyed, and secret masks displayed to the tribe’s women and children, who were previously  [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|forbidden]] to look at them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades, '' pp.4.5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Millenarianism|Messianic]] [[shamanism]], strongly connected with jaguar shamanism, declined further with the establishment of [[Catholic missions]] in the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ‘Shamans, Prophets, Priests and Pastors,’ p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The German traveller [[Theodor Koch-Grunberg|Theodor Koch-Grünberg]] spent two years at the turn of the century (1903–05) travelling throughout the region and provided a classic account of the Indians’ material culture and languages, which long remained the authoritative source for information of these tribes.&lt;ref name="Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff p.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff , ‘Review of The Cubeo: Indians of the Northwest Amazon by Irving Goldman ,’ in ''American Anthropologist, '' New Series, Vol. 65, No. 6 (Dec., 1963), pp. 1377-1379, p.1377.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubber-gatherers from the beginning of the 20th century began to aggressively exploit the area, as they did again the [[Second World War|World War II]] when the urgency of improved rubber supplies led to a [[rubber boom]] in the area. Their violent presence caused considerable upheaval and suffering, finally driving the Indians, after fierce resistance, into the less accessible backwaters.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades, '' 1979 preface&lt;/ref&gt; Population decline, as a result, has been a marked feature of the past one hundred and fifty years,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, The fish people, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest professional  ethnological [[Field work|fieldwork]] was done by [[Irving Goldman]] in 1939-40 among the Cubeo Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, ''Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon,'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Postwar missionary work, colonizing movements, and the activities of the linguists attached to Christian proseyltisation still engage, according to Stephen Hugh-Jones, in the ‘criminal folly’ of [[ethnocide]]  by their programmatic hostility to traditional religion&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades:Initiation and Cosmology ion Northwest Amazonia,''  p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The Barasana are [[slash-and-burn]]  [[Shifting cultivation|swidden]] [[Horticulture|horticulturalists]]&lt;ref name="Jean Elizabeth Jackson p.50"/&gt; who supplement their food with hunting and fish-gathering, with different roles allocated to men (poisoners) and  women (gatherers of the poisoned catch). The economy is inelastic, subsistence-oriented and egalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, ''  p.85&lt;/ref&gt; As both [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and gardeners, the Barasana exploit the forest in various ways to obtain a wide variety of foodstuffs. Bread made of bitter [[cassava]] is their [[staple food]]; Barasana culture itself is said to be grounded on cultivation of cassava production.&lt;ref name=Hugh-Jones/&gt; but they also harvest [[maize]], [[banana]]s, [[cooking plantain]]s, [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[pineapple]]s, [[sugarcane]] and considerable quantities of fruits picked in the forests or from cultivated trees like the [[Pithecellobium dulce]], the "Madras thorn" or ''mene''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fishing]] supplies most of the [[protein]] in their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], supplemented by [[Game (food)|game]], [[rodent]]s  and birds mostly, but [[woolly monkey]]s and [[peccary|peccaries]]&lt;ref&gt;There are two varieties of peccary (''kii jece'') hunted, the [[white-lipped peccary]]  (Tayassu tajacu: ''kii jece'') and the [[collared peccary]]. R.A. Donkin, ‘The Peccary’, in ''Transactions, American Philosophical Society,'' (vol. 75), Part 5, 1985 pp.1-152, p.61)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Imbert, Elsa, &amp; Kenstowicz, Michael, ‘Barasana Tone and Accent, p.434&lt;/ref&gt; are also culled, traditionally with [[blowgun]]s, but most recently also with [[shotgun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' pp.29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most South American peoples, the Barasana are not particularly passionate about [[honey]], which they gather occasionally. [[Beeswax]], on the other hand, is highly prized for its use in ceremonial contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; From cassava leaves they extract a native [[chicha]].&lt;ref name=Hugh-Jones/&gt; [[Coca]] and [[tobacco]], the latter prepared either in [[cigar]]s or as [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], are also cultivated.&lt;ref name=Hugh-Jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Hugh-Jones|first=Christine|title=From the Milk River : spatial and temporal processes in northwest Amazonia|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521358897|pages=176–9, 206|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They prepare their local [[entheogen]]ic drink [[ayahuasca]], which they call ''yagé'',&lt;ref&gt;The English [[botanist]] [[Richard Spruce]] made the first report of this drink in his journey among the Tukuano Indians in 1852, roughly contemporaneously with Wallace’s visit. For details see Andrei A. Znamenski, ''The beauty of the primitive: shamanism and Western imagination,'' pp.148ff.&lt;/ref&gt; from the endemic [[Banisteriopsis caapi]],  a [[liana]] locally known as "vine of the soul" or "vine of the ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Znamenski|first=Andrei A.|title=The beauty of the primitive : shamanism and Western imagination|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195172317|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofmann|first=Richard Evans Schultes, Albert|title=Plants of the gods : origins of hallucinogenic use|date=1987|publisher=A. van der Marck Editions|location=New York|isbn=978-0912383378|pages=120–7}}; this text contains a photo of a Barasana tracing religious patterns while under the influence of the yagé decoction on p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==
The Tukunoan descent groups are subdivided into ranked and named sibs. The dominant feature of their social organization is language group exogamy, which requires that one must always marry a spouse speaking a language different from one’s own.&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, '' Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, '' p.1. However, the Cubeo do not practice language group exogamy, since they marry among same language phratries, that is they practice linguistic endogamy, ''The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, '' pp.42ff.: Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' pp.23-24. For failing to observe this principle,  their status as ‘real people’ becomes a matter of doubt among the Eastern Tukunoans, of which the Barasana are one. See Jonathan David Hill, ''History, power, and identity: ethnogenesis in the Americas, 1492-1992, '' University of Iowa Press, 1996 p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the Barasana themselves, exceptions however do exist to the principle of linguistic exogamy, since they intermarry with Taiwanos whose language is regarded as almost identical to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson ''The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, '' p.20, p.246 n.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that one’s father’s language determines one’s inclusion or exclusion in Barasana identity, which accounts for the custom of [[Patrilocal residence|virilocality]]. Women marrying out, though speaking Barasana as their native tongue, are therefore excluded from Barasana identity.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Imbert, Elsa, &amp; Kenstowicz, Michael, ‘Barasana Tone and Accent,’ , p.420&lt;/ref&gt; Concern for exogamy is obsessive and is considered by Reichel-Dolmstoff to be the most important social rule of all.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaupés social system may be divided in four units in ascending hierarchy, namely (a) the local descent group, (2) the sib, (3) the language-aggregate, and finally (4) the [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|phratry]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinship is based on a [[Dravidian kinship system|‘a Dravidian’]] type [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] system, with bilateral [[Parallel cousin|cross-cousin marriage]] between people from hierarchically order patrilineal sibs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.22&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most other groups of the Vaupés system, the Barasana are an [[Exogamy|exogamous]]  [[patrilineal]]   and [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]]  [[Kinship#Descent groups|descent group]], with a [[Segmentary lineage|segmentary]] social structure. The constitutive groups live in isolated settlements in units of four to eight families  dwelling in multifamily [[longhouses]].&lt;ref name="Jean Elizabeth Jackson p.53"/&gt;

The Barasana have seven exogamous phratries,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson ''The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, '' p.246 n.11. Hugh-Jones lists only 5 neighbouring groups with whom the Barasana intermarry: the ''Bará'', ''Tatuyo'', ''Taiwano'', ''Kabiyeri'' and ''Makuna''. Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; and five sibs, common descendants of the ''Yebi Meni'' [[Anaconda]] people, traditionally ranked hierarchically in decreasing order of seniority, with each assigned a distinct ritual role as (1) ''Koamona'', ritual chiefs (2) ''Rasegana'', dancers and chanters (3) ''Meni Masa'', warriors (4) ''Daria'', [[shaman]]s and (5) ''Wabea'', cigar lighters. These  ritual functions restricted to distinct sibs, reflect a dying tradition, and survive now mainly as a matter of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones, ''The Palm and the Pleiades,'' pp.25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Barasana society is rigidly divided along sexual lines. Men and women enter dwellings by different doors, pass most of their lives in separation, a reality reinforced by their ceremonial Yurupari rites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones , ''The Palm and the Pleiades'', preface&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in Vaupés societies women have higher status, and marriages are more stable than in other South Amerindian groups, perhaps since intertribal warfare ended several decades ago, which may explain why women are not ‘pawns in the displays of male brinksmanship.’ &lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Jackson ''The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, ''p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barasana-Eduria language|Barasana]] is classified as one of the [[Tucanoan languages|eastern Tucanoan languages]]. It is mutually intelligible with Taiwano, and both are considered dialect variations of each other, though it is reported that Taiwano speakers are assimilating to the Barasana with whom they have very close relations of exchange, leading them to adopt the Barasana tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Gomez-Imbert, 'Conceptual categories and linguistic classification,' in John J.

'''Batak''' is a collective term used to identify a number of closely related [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnic groups predominantly found in [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] who speak [[Batak languages]]. The term is used to include the [[Karo people|Karo]], [[Pakpak people|Pakpak]], [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]], [[Batak Toba people|Toba]], [[Angkola people|Angkola]], and [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nalom Siahaan|title=Sedjarah kebudajaan Batak: suatu studi tentang suku Batak (Toba, Angkola, Mandailing, Simelungun, Pakpak Dairi, Karo)|year=1964|publisher=Napitupulu|oclc=690038854}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are related groups with distinct languages and customs (''adat'').

== Prehistory ==
[[File:Batak Toba House.jpg|left|thumb|A traditional Toba Batak house (see [[Batak architecture]]).]]

Linguistic and archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] speakers first reached Sumatra from [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]] through [[Borneo]] or [[Java]] about 2,500 years ago, and the Batak probably descended from these settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood, Peter, ''Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago,'' Revised edition, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; While the archaeology of southern Sumatra testifies to the existence of neolithic settlers, it seems that the northern part of Sumatra was settled by agriculturalists at a considerably later stage.

Although the Batak are often considered to be isolated peoples thanks to their location inland, away from the influence of seafaring European colonials, there is evidence that they have been involved in trade with other neighbouring kingdoms for a millennium or more.

The Bataks practiced a syncretic religion of Tamil Shaivism, Buddhism and local culture for thousands of years. The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists till 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in [[Zhao Rugua]]'s 13th-century ''Description of the Barbarous People'', which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The ''[[Suma Oriental]]'', of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by [[Pasai]] and the [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru kingdom]].

Based on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with [[China]], perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.

It has been suggested that the important port of [[Barus]] in [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] was populated primarily by Batak people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Drakard|title=A Malay Frontier: Unity and Duality in a Sumatran Kingdom|year=1990|publisher=SEAP Publications|isbn=08-772-7706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at [[Kota Cina]], a trading town located in what is now northern [[Medan]] that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.

These trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for [[camphor]].

The [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo ''marga'' or tribe]] ''Sembiring'' "black one" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with [[Pagarruyung]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Bangun, Mengenal Suku Karo, Yayasan Pendidikan Bangun, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th century onward, [[Aceh]] increased the production of [[Black pepper|pepper]], an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either ''sawah'' (wet rice fields) or ''ladang'' (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.

==Language==
[[File:Image from page 129 of "Handbook to the ethnographical collections" (1910) (14783317945).jpg|thumb|right|Bark book with charms written in native [[Batak script]], 1910.]]
{{main|Batak languages}}
{{see also|Batak script}}
The Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the [[Batak Dairi language|Pakpak-Dairi]], [[Batak Alas-Kluet language|Alas-Kluet]] and [[Batak Karo language|Karo]] languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: [[Batak Toba language|Toba]], [[Batak Angkola language|Angkola]] and [[Batak Mandailing language|Mandailing]]. [[Batak Simalungun language|Simalungun]] is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in [[Medan]] city today.

The Batak possess their own script known as the [[Batak script|''Surat Batak'']].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0834803496 Kozok, Uli, "Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra," in ''Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia,'' Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237).]&lt;/ref&gt; The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.

==Profession==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]
The traditional occupation of the Batak was [[agriculture]], hunting and farming. The great lake of [[Lake Toba|Toba]] provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. 

The port of [[Barus]] on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of ''kapur barus'' ([[camphor]]). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, ''sawit'' [[palm oil]], and [[rubber]], converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.

Throughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.

Even though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law Bataks have been well represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/31491/batak-make-good-lawyers-is-it-true/|title=Batak Make Good Lawyers, Is It True?|date=31 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, lawyers like Hotma Sitompul, Ruhut Sitompul and Hotman Paris Hutapea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/asia/24hotman.html|title=A Top Indonesian Lawyer May Be Honest to a Fault|date=24 April 2010|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media. One of the most influential attorneys in Indonesian legal history was Prof. Dr. [[Adnan Buyung Nasution]] who struggled in the autocratic Suharto era with great personal risk and engagement for democratic values and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hukumonline.com/berita/baca/lt59de058823368/abna--cikal-bakal-lahirnya-kantor-advokat-modern-generasi-kedua|title=ABNA, Cikal Bakal Lahirnya Kantor Advokat Modern Generasi Kedua|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He founded successfully with other prominent Batak lawyers like Albert Hasibuan,&lt;ref name="kompas.com"&gt;http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/09/25/15000061/read-adverd.html?page=all&lt;/ref&gt; Victor D. Sibarani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Indonesian_Legal_Aid_Foundation|title=Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation - SourceWatch|website=www.sourcewatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Todung Mulya Lubis the first Indonesian human rights organization YLBH (Legal Aid Indonesia).&lt;ref name="kompas.com" /&gt; Besides that, Batak people have also shaped Indonesian society in the sense of cultural development: Musicians like [[:id:Victor Hutabarat]] and Donnie Sibarani, the writer [[Mochtar Lubis]] and painter [[:id:Augustin Sibarani]] are fine examples for a profound involvement in the area of Indonesian arts. National heroes such as [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], two Indonesian prime ministers ([[Amir Sjarifuddin|Amir Syarifuddin Harahap]] and [[Burhanuddin Harahap]]), speakers of the parliament ([[Zainul Arifin|Zainul Arifin Pohan]]), one vice president ([[Adam Malik|Adam Malik Batubara]]), governor of the central bank ([[Darmin Nasution]]), one attorney general ([[Marsillam Simanjuntak]]), and many cabinet ministers (such as [[Malam Sambat Kaban|M.S. Kaban]], [[Tifatul Sembiring]], [[Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan]]), as well as leading military generals and officers ([[Abdul Harris Nasution]], [[T. B. Simatupang]], [[Maraden Panggabean]]) are also showing their influence in Indonesian life, history and politics.

==Society==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De bekende Karo-Batak schaker Si Narser met zijn vrouw Karolanden Noord-Sumatra TMnr 10005391.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A Batak couple, circa 1914–1919.]]

Batak societies are [[patriarchy|patriarchally]] organized along clans known as [[Marga (Batak)|''Marga'']]. A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor "Si Raja Batak", with all ''Margas'' descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called ''[[tarombo]]''. In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Farber, Kinship and Family Organization, Wiley, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Toba Batak are known traditionally for their [[weaving]], [[wood carving]] and especially ornate stone tombs.

Before they became subjects of the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the [[HKBP]] (''Huria Kristen Batak Protestan'') Christian church. The dominant Christian [[theology]] was brought by [[Lutheran]] [[German people|German]] missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]]. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Calvinist]] missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (''Gereja Batak Karo Protestan''). The [[Mandailing]] and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus [[Padri War|Padri]].&lt;ref&gt;Luckman Sinar (Tengku), The History of Medan in the Olden Times, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the ''agama si dekah'', the old religion, which is also called ''perbegu'' or ''pemena''.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dalihan Na Tolu ===
''Dalihan Na Tolu'' (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people. It was consisted of three general rule in Batak society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beberapa Pemikiran Menuju Dalihan Natolu|last = S Aritonang|first = Jan|publisher = Dian Utama|year = 2006|location = Jakarta|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those are:
# Somba Marhulahula (showing respect to wife's family). Even though ''somba'' could mean worship, in Dalihan Na Tolu, it means respect to those with wife family and those with the same clan ([[Marga (Batak)]]). Those family includes wife of the grandfathers, wife of the fathers, and wife of the children. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Raja Napogos|last = J|first = P Sitanggang|publisher = Penerbit Jala Permata Aksara|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Jakarta|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Elek Marboru (showing kindness to all women). Kindness in this context means not accompanied by ulterior motives and self-interest. Also, women in this context means the family who marry the daughter, including the daughter itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Manat Mardongan Tubu (careful in living with close relatives). Living carefully means a cautious attitude towards fellow Marga to prevent misunderstandings in the implementation of custom tradition events. This act was reflected in the Batak proverb "''hau na jonok do na boi marsiogoson''" (only woods that are really close can cause friction). This illustrates that it is in close and frequent intercourse that possible conflicts of interest, status, etc. can occur&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The essence of this teachings is the moral code contains the teachings of mutual respect (''masipasangapon'') with the support of the moral rule: mutual respect and helpfulness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Ritual cannibalism===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Het dorpsgebouw in een Batak-kampong vrouwen bezig potten te vormen Bataklanden' TMnr 10014161.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pottery]] making by Batak women in [[Tarutung]], Batak-country; [[Dutch East Indies]] era.]]

Ritual [[cannibalism]] was well documented among pre-colonial Batak people, being performed in order to strengthen the eater's [[Batak#The tendi cult|''tendi'']].&lt;ref name=tradebatak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874|title=Kitlv-journals.nl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the blood, heart, palms and soles of the feet were seen as rich in ''tendi''.

In [[Marco Polo]]’s memoirs of his stay on the east coast of Sumatra (then called Java Minor) from April to September 1292, he mentions an encounter with hill folk whom he refers to as “man-eaters”.&lt;ref&gt;Polo M, [[Henry Yule|Yule H]], Cordier H. [http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/y#a5823 ''The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition,''] Dover Pubns, 1993, Vol. II, Chapter X, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; From secondary sources, Marco Polo recorded stories of ritual cannibalism among the "Battas". Marco Polo's stay was restricted to the coastal areas, and he never ventured inland to directly verify such claims. Despite never personally witnessing these events, he was nonetheless willing to pass on descriptions which were provided to him, in which a condemned man was eaten: "They suffocate him. And when he is dead they have him cooked, and gather together all the dead man's kin, and eat him. And I assure you they do suck the very bones till not a particle of marrow remains in them...And so they eat him up stump and rump. And when they have thus eaten him they collect his bones and put them in fine chests, and carry them away, and place them in caverns among the mountains where no beast nor other creature can get at them. And you must know also that if they take prisoner a man of another country, and he cannot pay a ransom in coin, they kill him and eat him straightway.&lt;ref&gt;Polo, Vol. II, Chapter X, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venetian [[Niccolò de' Conti]] (1395–1469) spent most of 1421 in Sumatra in the course of a long trading journey to [[Southeast Asia]] (1414–1439), and wrote a brief description of the inhabitants: "In a part of the island called Batech live cannibals who wage continual war on their neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Nicolò Conte'' [sic] ''in the East in the Early Part of the Fifteenth Century'' [[Hakluyt Society]] xxii (London, 1857)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/050097392X Sibeth A, Kozok U, Ginting JR.

Sir Thomas [[Stamford Raffles#Administration of Bencoolen.2C 1820.E2.80.931822|Stamford Raffles]] in the 1820s studied the Batak and their rituals and laws regarding the consumption of human flesh, writing in detail about the transgressions that warranted such an act as well as their methods.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Barley (ed.), ''The Golden Sword: Stamford Raffles and the East'', British Museum Press, 1999 (exhibition catalogue). {{ISBN|0-7141-2542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffles stated that "It is usual for the people to eat their parents when too old to work," and that for certain crimes a criminal would be eaten alive: “The flesh is eaten raw or grilled, with lime, salt and a little rice.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805019685 Barley N. ''The Duke of Puddle Dock: Travels in the Footsteps of Stamford Raffles.'' 1st American ed. New York: H. Holt, 1992, p. 112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The German physician and geographer [[Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn]] visited the Batak lands in 1840-41. Junghuhn says about cannibalism among the Batak (whom he called "Battaer"): 
“People do the honest Battaer an injustice when it is said that they sell human flesh in the markets, and that they slaughter their old people as soon as they are unfit for work...They eat human flesh only in wartime, when they are enraged, and in a few legal instances.”
Junghuhn tells how after a perilous and hungry flight he arrived in a friendly village, and the food that was offered by his hosts was the flesh of two prisoners who had been slaughtered the day before,&lt;ref&gt;Junghuhn, F., ''Die Batta-länder auf Sumatra,'' (1847) Vol. II, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; however he maintains that the Batak exaggerated their love of human flesh in order to frighten off would-be invaders and to gain occasional employment as [[mercenaries]] for the coastal tribes who were plagued by [[pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXMPAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Die+Battal%C3%A4nder+auf+Sumatra,%22&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Die Battaländer auf Sumatra: Im auftrage sr. excellenz des general-governeurs von Niederländisch-Indien hrn.

Oscar von Kessel visited Silindung in the 1840s and in 1844 was probably the first European to observe a Batak cannibalistic ritual in which a convicted adulterer was eaten alive. His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, [[adultery]], spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the [[verdict]] of the community and were not thinking of [[revenge]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Kessel, O., "Erinnerungen an Sumatra," ''Das Ausland,'' Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]] visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: 
:"[[Prisoners of war]] are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice. The body is then distributed; the ears, the nose, and the soles of the feet are the exclusive property of the [[Rajah]], who has besides a claim on other portions. The palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the flesh of the head, and the heart and liver, are reckoned peculiar delicacies, and the flesh in general is roasted and eaten with salt. The [[Regent]]s assured me, with a certain air of relish, that it was very good food, and that they had not the least objection to eat it. The women are not allowed to take part in these grand public dinners."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0217663761 Pfeiffer, Ida, ''A Lady's Second Journey Around the World: From London to the Cape of Good Hope, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Ceram, the Moluccas, etc., California, Panama, Peru, Ecuador, and the United States.'' New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1856, p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Munson and Henry Lyman, American Baptist missionaries to the Batak, were cannibalized in 1834. Dutch and German [[missionaries]] to the Batak in the late 19th century observed a few instances of cannibalism and wrote lurid descriptions to their home [[parish]]es in order to raise donations for further missions.&lt;ref&gt;An example may be found in Wegner, R., ''Einzelzüge aus der Arbeit der Rheinischen Mission,'' Gütersloh (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; The growing Dutch influence in northern Sumatra led to increased [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] influence in coastal trade and plantations, pushing the Karo farther inland. Growing ethnic tensions culminated in the [[1872 Karo Rebellion]] where the Karo were suppressed by Dutch and Malay forces. Despite this, Karo resistance to Dutch imperialism lingered into the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Niessen, Sandra. "Foreign Penetration of North Sumatra."

Singapore: Editions Didiers Millet, 2001. pp. 134-35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 the Dutch colonial government banned cannibalism in the regions under their control.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors of Batak cannibalism survived into the early 20th century but it seems probable that the custom was rare after 1816, due partially to the influence of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0472101765 Kipp RS.

===Tarombo===
{{main|Tarombo}}
Family tree or lineage is a very important thing for the Batak. For those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (''nalilu'') Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name ([[Marga (Batak)]]) and the related clans (''dongan tubu'') came from. This is necessary in order to determine the relation of a kinship (''partuturanna'') within a clan or simply the surname ([[Marga (Batak)]]) itself.

The Batak lands consist of [[North Sumatra]] province, excluding [[Nias]] island, the historically Malay kingdoms of the east coast and the western coast of [[Minangkabau people]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Perret, Kolonialisme dan Etnisitas: Batak dan Melayu di Sumatra Timur Laut, Gramedia, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, part of the Karo lands extend into modern-day [[East Aceh Regency]] in [[Aceh]] province, while parts of the Mandailing lands lie in [[Rokan Hulu]] Regency in [[Riau]]. Significant numbers of Batak have migrated in recent years to prosperous neighbouring Riau province.

To the south of North Sumatra are the Muslim Minangkabau of [[West Sumatra]], while to the north there are various Muslim Acehnese peoples.

==Traditional Batak religion==
[[File:Batak-village 09N9400-01.jpg|left|thumb|Batak village on Samosir island.]]
The various Batak cultures differ in their pre-colonial religious ideas as they do in many other aspects of culture. Information about the old religious ideas of the [[Mandailing]] and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and  very little is known about the religion of the [[Pakpak people|Pakpak]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]] Batak. For the [[Toba people|Toba]] and [[Karo people|Karo]] on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of [[Germans|German]] and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]], in particular the large [[Padang Lawas temple complex]] in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, [[Shaivism|Shaivist]], and [[Tantra|Tantrist]] practices&lt;ref name=tradebatak /&gt; within their own customs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Parkin, ''The Extent and Areas of Indian/Hindu Influence on the Ideas and Development of Toba-Batak Religion and Its Implications for the Christianization of the Toba-Batak People of North Sumatra.'' D.Th. Dissertation, Serampore, 1975, p. 440; [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CQRIW Also published under the title ''Batak Fruit of Hindu Thought,'' (Christian Literature Society 1978,1987)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Indonesian state is founded on the principles of [[Pancasila (politics)|pancasila]], which requires the belief in 'one and only God', the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual's [[Indonesian identity card|KTP]]. Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.

===Creation myths===
[[File:Batak Puppenspieler.jpg|thumb|right|Puppeteers of [[Toba Batak people]] with a [[Sigale Gale]] puppet, [[Sumatra]].]]

There are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. &amp; Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) "Die Religionen Indonesiens." ''Die Religionen der Menschheit,'' vol. 5:1, Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld [[dragon]] ''Naga Padoha''. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving [[myths]] record that at the beginning of creation stands the god ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon''. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the "beginning of becoming". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. ''Mula Jadi'' lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, ''Batara Guru'', ''Mangalabulan'' and ''Soripada'' were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by ''Mula Jadi''. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to ''Mula Jadi'' in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. ''Mula Jadi'' begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of ''Mula Jadi'' there is another god, ''Asiasi'', whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that ''Asiasi'' can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.

The ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon ''Naga Padoha''. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of ''Mula Jadi''. As ruler of the underworld ''Naga Padoha'' also has an important function in the creation of the earth.

What all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of [[sacrifice]] are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Leertouwer, L.
(1977) ''Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken.'' Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of ''Batara Guru'', ''Sideak Parujar'', who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,
the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion ''Mula Jadi'' sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. ''Sideak Parudjar'' was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of ''Naga Padoha'', the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of ''Mula Jadi'' and by her own cunning ''Sideak Parudjar'' was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of ''Naga Padoha'' up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever ''Naga Padoha'' twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.

After the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, ''Sideak Parujar'' marries him. ''Sideak Parujar'' becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their [[incestuous]] union.
The couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of [[Lake Toba]], and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, ''Si Raja Batak'' is one of their grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''tendi'' cult===
[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Carved bone calendar and almanac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 20th century carved bone of a [[Porhalaan]] Batak calendar.]]
In the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the ''tendi'' (Karo) or ''tondi'' (Toba) and the ''begu''. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are "life-soul" and "death-soul". A person receives his "life-soul" (''tendi'') from ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon'' before he is born. The [[destiny]] of the individual ''tendi'' is decided by the ''tendi'' itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the ''tendi'' choose their destiny from ''Mula Jadi''. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (''ephorus'') of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) ''Tcba-Batak: Deutsches Wörterbuch.'' The Hague.&lt;/ref&gt; What is significant is that the ''tendi'' themselves are responsible for their idiocy:

:"''Mula Jadi'' presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the ''tendi'' asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts."

:"With ''Mula Jadi'' in the upper world is a mighty tree called ''Djambubarus''. ''Mula Jadi'' has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every ''tendi'' that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask ''Mula Jadi'' for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world."

Among the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the ''tendi'' dwells and how many ''tendi'' there are. According to the Toba a person has seven ''tendi''. The second ''tendi'' is found in the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid]] of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called ''saudara'' (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (''kaka'' and ''agi'') who always remain close to the person.&lt;ref&gt;Westenberg CJ, (1982) ''Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks.'' BK141:208-53&lt;/ref&gt;

All Batak regard the loss of ''tendi'' as signifying a great danger for "body and soul". ''Tendi'' can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a ''datu'' with evil intentions. In other words, the ''tendi'' is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the ''tendi'' inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the ''tendi'' dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in ''tendi''. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of ''tendi'', and the bringing back of the ''tendi'' is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called ''upah tendi'' (''upah'' = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their ''tendi'' so that their ''tendi'' stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the ''tendi'' satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, RS,
1974 "Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure." ''Berita Kajian Sumatra''(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tendi'' love the sound of the ''surdam'' (a bamboo flute). If a ''tendi'' has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the ''surdam'' in the ''raleng tendi'' ritual can contribute to the ''tendi'' returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the ''datuk'' are in a position to interpret and influence people's ''tendi'' correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the ''tendi'' has chosen another destiny for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, P. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death cult===
[[File:Batak totem 09N9443.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Batak [[Totem pole]].]]

At death the ''tendi'' leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the "death-soul" (''begu'') is set free. It is thought that the ''tendi'' vanishes and after the death of any human being only the ''begu'' continues to exist. The Batak believe that the ''begu'' continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the
cemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the ''begu'' of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged ''begu'' by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a ''datu'' or a ''guru'' must be called in.&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, 1974, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''begu'' are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a ''begu'' dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Batak believe that three categories of ''begu'' exist.&lt;ref&gt;Westenberg, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''bicara guru'' are the ''begu'' of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn ''bicara guru'' into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a ''guru sibaso'', the ''bicara guru'' can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the ''bicara guru'' is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.

The ''begu'' of members of the family who have had a sudden death (''mate sada-uari'') can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the ''begu'' of dead virgins (''tungkup''). Their graves, called ''bata-bata'' or ''ingan tungkup'', are maintained for a long time by their relatives.

===Burial traditions===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een stenen sarcofaag in een Toba Batak dorp TMnr 60045329.jpg|thumb|left|A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village.]]

Batak [[burial]] traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the ''begu'' understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with [[camphor]] and its orifices stopped with [[camphor]], then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this ''perumah begu'' ceremony a ''guru sibaso'' declares to the ''begu'' of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.

Wealthier families have their coffins (Karo: ''[[pelangkah]]'') made of the wood of the ''[[:id:kemiri]]'' tree (''[[Ateurites rnoluccana]]''), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a [[hornbill]], or a horse, or a [[mythical beast]] known as a [[Singa (mythology)|singa]]. The lid is then sealed with [[resin]] and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.

The corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the [[cemetery]] with musical accompaniment from the ''[[gondang]]'' orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the ''begu''. It is hoped that the ''begu'' will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of ''datuk'' and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and [[betel]] placed between them.&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, 1974, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reburial===
[[File:Batak Tombs.JPG|right|thumb|Batak ''tugu'' on the island of [[Samosir]], Lake Toba, December 1984.]]

The burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as ''mangongkal holi'', among the Karo as ''nurun-nurun''. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a ''tugu'' or ''tambak'':
:"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various [[citrus]] fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the ''tugu'' until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (''[[ulos]]'') and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the ''tugu''. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, A. (1982) "Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak." ''ZjE'' 107:177-206.&lt;/ref&gt;"

In ancient times these [[sarcophagi]] were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate ''tugu'' can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of [[Samosir]].

One motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the ''begu'' of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a ''begu'' to the status of a ''sumangot'' by means of a great ceremony and a ''horja'' feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the ''gondang'' orchestra provided an accompaniment.

The next level up from the ''sumangot'' is the ''sombaon'', who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a ''sumangot'' to a ''sombaon'' requires another great festival, a ''santi rea'', often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new [[kinship]] groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.&lt;ref&gt;Stohr, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional Batak medicine===
[[File:Mme Sitorus Dukun.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Sitorus, a well-known Toba ''guru sibaso'' who practiced in [[:id:Laguboti|Laguboti]] in 1984. She is consulting a paperback edition of the [[New Testament]] in lieu of a ''[[pustaha]]''. On the shelf are components of herbal remedies. In front of her is a [[kaffir lime]] in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people.]]

In traditional Batak society ''datuk'' (animist priests) as well as ''[[gurus]]'' practiced [[traditional medicine]], although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by [[dukun]]s in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''datu'' and ''guru'' healers also practiced [[divination]] by consulting a ''[[pustaha]]'', a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in ''poda,'' an archaic [[Batak script|Batak shorthand]]. According to Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;J. Winkler, ''Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen,'' [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224.&lt;/ref&gt; there were three categories of ''[[Pustaha]]'' based on the purpose of their usage:
:1. '''Protective Magic''', which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as [[amulets]], ''parmanisan'' (love charms), etc.
:2. '''Destructive Magic''', which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the ''pangulubalang'', and the art of making ''dorma'' (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).
:3. '''Divination''', which involves [[oracles]] (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an [[almanac]] or calendrical system (''porhalaan''), and [[astrology]] to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.&lt;ref name="V7177"&gt;Voorma, pp. 71-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''datu'' or ''guru'' consulted the ''[[pustaha]]'' when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and [[augury]] the [[Bible]] may have been adopted by some ''gurus'' in place of the ''[[pustaha]]''.&lt;ref name="V7177"/&gt;

Among the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the ''jinujung,'' or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo [[cosmology]], each person receives a ''jinujung'' in childhood or at [[puberty]] and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the ''jinujung'' back, a female ''guru'' (''guru sibaso'' in Karo) goes into a [[trance]] and  the ''jinujung'' will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's ''tendi'' (this falls under the jurisdiction of the ''datuk''), however they do play a role in communicating with ''begu'' and influencing their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Sibeth, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malim===

{{Main|Parmalim}}
{{Other uses|Pemena}}
Malim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion. Practitioners of Malim are called Parmalim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/16/malim-the-batak%E2%80%99s-native-religion.html Thejakartapost.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018185652/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/16/malim-the-batak%E2%80%99s-native-religion.html |date=October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Malim Batak peoples (those following Christian or Muslim faith) often continue to believe certain aspects of traditional Batak spiritual belief.

The 'Perodak-odak' movement among the Karo people in the 1960s was a reassertion of the traditional Karo religion, but has largely faded; a subsequent Karo movement to identify as [[Hindu]] was noted starting from the late 1970s in order to adopt, if only in name, one of the [[Pancasila (politics)|recognised religions of Indonesia]], while in practice still following traditional beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;History of Christianity in Indonesia, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

At the time of Marco Polo's visit in 1292 the people were described as "wild [[Idolatry|idolaters]]" who had not been influenced by outside religions, however by [[Ibn Battuta]]'s visit in 1345 [[Arab]] traders had established river-ports along the northern coasts of Sumatra and Sultan Al-Malik Al-Dhahir had recently converted to Islam.

Sir Stamford Raffles perceived the Batak lands as a buffer between the Islamic Aceh and Minang kingdoms, and encouraged Christian missionary work to preserve this.&lt;ref name=mandailingislam&gt;[http://www.cseas.ncnu.edu.tw/journal/v02_no2/pp55-98.pdf Cseas.ncnu.edu.tw] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308042807/http://www.cseas.ncnu.edu.tw/journal/v02_no2/pp55-98.pdf |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was continued by the Dutch, who deemed the non-Muslim lands the 'Bataklanden'.

In 1824 two [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Baptist]] missionaries, Richard Burton and Nathaniel Ward, set off on foot from [[Sibolga]] and  traveled through the Batak lands.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, R. and Ward, N., "Report of a Journey into the Batak Country, in the interior of Sumatra, in the year 1824." ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' London 1:485-513.&lt;/ref&gt; After three days' journey they reached the high valley of Silindung and spent about two weeks in the Batak region. Considering the shortness of their stay their account reveals very intensive first-hand observation. This was followed in 1834 by [[Henry Lyman (missionary)]] and [[Samuel Munson]] from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] who met with a more hostile reception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/magazine/issues/2000_winter/amherst_authors#anchor52178 "Missionaries: The Martyrs of Sumatra," in ''The Most of It: Essays on Language and the Imagination.'' by Theodore Baird, Amherst, Mass.: Amherst College Press, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ida Pfeiffer]]:
:"Some time before the arrival of the missionaries  the unfortunate Americans presented themselves as religious teachers,the Battakers felt that these people were invaders, and resolving to be beforehand with their tormentors, they killed them and ate them up."&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, p. 150. Professor Uli Kozok disputes the belief that the missionaries were eaten. [http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/downloads/Rima36.pdf See his discussion.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk]] was employed by the Nederlands Bijbel Genootschap (Netherlands Bible Society) in the 1850s to produce a Batak–Dutch grammar-book and a dictionary, which enabled future Dutch and German missionaries to undertake the conversion of the Toba and Simalungan Batak.&lt;ref&gt;Tuuk, H. N. van der, ''Bataksch Leesbok, Stukken in het Mandailingsch; Stukken in het Dairisch.'' Amsterdam, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first German missionaries to the Lake Toba region arrived in 1861, and a mission was established in 1881 by Dr. [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]] of the German [[Rhenish Missionary Society]]. The [[New Testament]] was first translated into Toba Batak by Dr. Nommensen in 1869 and a translation of the [[Old Testament]] was completed by P. H. Johannsen in 1891. The complete text was printed in [[Latin]] script in [[Medan]] in 1893, although H. O. Voorma describes the translation as “not easy to read, it is rigid and not fluent, and sounds strange to the Batak…[with] a number of errors in the translation.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.uu.nl/digiarchief/dip/diss/1922364/full.pdf Voorma, H.O. ''The Encounter of the Batak People with Rheinische Missions-Gesellschaft in the Field of Education, 1861-1940, A Historical-Theological Inquiry.'' (2000), p. 173.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toba and Karo Batak accepted [[Christianity]] rapidly and by the early 20th century it had become part of their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ooi KG. ''Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor.'' Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period was characterized by the arrival of Dutch colonists and while most Batak did not oppose the Dutch, the Toba Batak fought a [[guerrilla]] war that lasted into the early 20th century and ended only with the death in 1907 of their charismatic priest-warrior-king Si [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], who had battled the Dutch during the First Toba War with both magic and weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0804716668 Sherman, George, ''Rice, Rupees and Ritual,'' Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY 1990.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Batak churches====
[[File:Balige church.JPG|thumb|right|[[Batak Christian Protestant Church|Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP)]] Church in [[Balige]], [[North Sumatra]], built circa 1917.]]
The Huria Kristen Batak Protestan ([[HKBP]]) Church was established in [[Balige]] in September, 1917. By the late 1920s a nursing school was training [[nurse]] [[midwives]] there. In 1941, the Gereja Batak Karo Protestan (GBKP) was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/kushnick/diss.htm Kushnick, G. "Parent-Offspring Conflict Among the Karo of Sumatra," Doctoral dissertation, University of Washington, Seattle, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064524/http://faculty.washington.edu/kushnick/diss.htm |date=March 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although missionaries ceded much power to Batak converts in the first decades of the 20th century, Bataks never pressured the missionaries to leave and only took control of church activities as a result of thousands of foreign missionaries being interned or forced to leave&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, 1990, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; after the 1942 invasion of Sumatra by the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/9622099106 Archer B. ''The internment of Western civilians under the Japanese 1941-1945: a patchwork of internment.'' London ; Portland, OR: F. Cass, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Simalungun Protestant Christian Church|Gereja Kristen Protestan Simalungun]], originally part of the HKBP and preaching in Batak Toba language, eventually became a distinctively Simalungun church, adopting Simalungun customs and language, before finally incorporating as GKPS in 1963.

===Islam===
The Mandailing and Angkola people, occupying the southern Batak lands, came under the influence of the neighbouring Islamic [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people as a result of the [[Padri War]] (1821–1837).&lt;ref name=mandailingislam /&gt; Some Mandailing had previously converted to Islam, but the Padri war was a watershed event, with the Padri [[Wahabbi]]s suppressing traditional [[adat]] and promoting 'pure' Islamic faith. Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern [[Shafi`i]] school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of [[hajj]], although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.

The advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatbile with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.

Christian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.

At the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html|title=Mandailing.org|publisher=|access-date=2010-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172658/http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html|archive-date=2011-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">'''Belarusization''' ({{lang-be|Беларусізацыя}}) was a policy of protection and advancement of the [[Belarusian language]] and recruitment and promotion of [[Belarusians|ethnic Belarusians]] (a type of [[affirmative action]] program) within the [[Government of Belarus|government]] of [[Belarusian SSR]] and the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia|Belarusian Communist Party]], conducted by the government of [[BSSR]] in the 1920s.  

Together with the 1920s policy of [[Ukrainization]] in the [[Ukrainian SSR]], as well as other similar policies in other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], it constituted the Soviet policy of [[korenization]], an attempt by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to win favor with non-Russian ethnic groups by temporarily reversing the effects of centuries of [[Russification|forced Russification]] within the [[Russian Empire]] and promoting national cultures and languages in [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet national republics]]. All policies of korenization were radically reversed with the onset of [[Stalinism]] and Soviet government's promotion of Russian language as the sole [[state language]] and the required [[:uk:Мова міжнаціонального спілкування|''language of interethnic communication'']].

==Plan for Belarusization==
{{History of Belarus}}
The official policy of Belarusization was instituted in 1924 by the Central Executive Committee of the [[BSSR]] by creation of a special commission headed by A. I. Khatskevich. The special commission recommended the following measures:
 
* Transition of the Belarusian Republic's institutions and Belarusian units of the Red Army to the [[Belarusian language]]
* Promotion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] to leadership positions within the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia|party]], [[Government of Belarus|government]] and [[trade union|labor unions]]
* Organization of educational institutions in the Belarusian language, development of [[Belarusian literature]] and more.

The transition of Belarusian republic's institutions to the Belarusian language was planned to take place over a period of one to three years.

==Results of Belarusization==
* By 1927, 80% of [[BSSR]]'s civil servants were fluent in Belarusian language.
* By 1928, 80% of schools in [[BSSR]] were transitioned to Belarusian as the language of instruction.

==End of Belarusization==
However, with the rise of [[Stalinism]] in the 1930s, and the concurrent return of the policies of forced [[Russification]], Belarusization was quickly reversed, along with [[Ukrainization]] and all the other programs of [[korenization]] within the Soviet Union.

==Post-Soviet era==
After the breakup of Soviet Union in 1991, Belarusization came into full effect, with Belarusian becoming the only state language, and children started receiving education in Belarusian. However, after the accession to power of [[Aleksandr Lukashenko]], in 1995 a referendum was held on Russian language, most people voting for Russian to become the second state language in Belarus. After a while, the use of Belarusian has dwindled, and in today's Belarus, Russian is dominant in everyday life.

Alongside having a satirical take on current events, politics, and show business, ''BoJack'' is lauded for its realistic take on dealing with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], [[addiction]], [[self-destructive behavior]], and the [[human experience]].

Despite mixed reviews upon its debut, critics were notably more positive towards the second half of the first season, before universally acclaiming the subsequent seasons.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 1 (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s01/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 2 (2015)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s02/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, online magazine [[Thrillist]] ranked it as the best Netflix original series of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Entertainment |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-netflix-tv-shows-original-series |title=Best Netflix Original Series &amp; TV Shows, Ranked |publisher=Thrillist |date=2018-08-29 |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 2017, the series was renewed for a fifth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Otterson|first1=Joe|title=‘BoJack Horseman’ Renewed for Season 5 at Netflix|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bojack-horseman-renewed-season-5-netflix-1202565362/|accessdate=September 21, 2017|work=Variety|date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered on September 14, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2018/06/27/get-back-in-the-saddle-september-14-with-bojack-horseman-season-5-008211/20180627netflix02/|title=Get Back in the Saddle September 14 with "BoJack Horseman" Season 5|author=Netflix|publisher=The Futon Critic|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was renewed for a sixth season on October 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bojack-horseman-renewed-season-6-at-netflix-1156146|title='BoJack' Renewed For Season 6 at Netflix|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 30, 2018|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
The series takes place mostly in [[Hollywood]] (later known as "Hollywoo" after the 'D' in the [[Hollywood Sign]] is destroyed in a romantic gesture), in an [[alternate history|alternate world]] where humans and tailless [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals live side by side. [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack Horseman]], the washed-up star of the 1990s sitcom ''Horsin' Around'', plans his big return to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography that he dictates to his [[ghostwriter]] Diane Nguyen. BoJack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and on-again-off-again girlfriend Princess Carolyn, the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate Todd Chavez, and his friend and rival Mr. Peanutbutter.

== Cast and characters ==
{{Main|List of BoJack Horseman characters}}

*[[Will Arnett]] as BoJack Horseman, a self-loathing alcoholic [[horse]] currently in his 50s, whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful '90s family sitcom called ''Horsin' Around''. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards Hollywoo&lt;!--NOT a typo--&gt; and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him. 
*[[Alison Brie]] as Diane Nguyen, a human [[ghostwriter]], a well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a [[Vietnamese-American]] [[third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] from Boston. She is an idealist who wants to make the world a better place and expects others to behave to a higher standard, even though she often falls short of her own ideals.  While writing BoJack's memoir, Diane and BoJack develop a strong friendship that initially becomes awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her, especially as she was dating Mr. Peanutbutter at the time. She eventually marries Mr. Peanutbutter, but during and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for [[Governor of California]] their marriage begins to deteriorate, and they divorce at the beginning of Season 5. She is a graduate of [[Boston University]].
*[[Amy Sedaris]] as Princess Carolyn, a pink [[Persian cat]] who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her dogged pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in Season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but frequently suffers miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina.
*[[Aaron Paul]] as Todd Chavez, an unemployed but well-meaning and friendly 24-year-old human [[slacker]] who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese, entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas, and writing and composing his own [[rock opera]], which was eventually sabotaged by BoJack. This, along with other examples of BoJack's poor behavior towards him leads Todd to break ties with him. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places ''[[The Prince and the Pauper|Prince and the Pauper]]''-style with a Cordovian dictator. He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In his teenage years, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale "That Went Well" that he is [[Asexuality|asexual]].
*[[Paul F. Tompkins]] as Mr. Peanutbutter, an energetic and cheerful yellow [[Labrador Retriever]] who is BoJack's former sitcom rival. Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of ''Mr. Peanutbutter's House'', which, according to BoJack, "borrowed the premise" from ''Horsin' Around''. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on ''Horsin' Around''. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures. Mr. Peanutbutter has been married three times (including to Diane). His marriages all end after his wives grow out of their 20s and tire of his immature behavior. "Mr." is his actual first name. He is a graduate of [[Northwestern University]].

The [[Courtney Barnett]] song "Avant Gardener" plays during the second-season finale, and [[Nina Simone]]'s cover of [[Janis Ian]]'s "Stars" closed out the last episode of the third season. The show also features [[Oberhofer]]'s song "Sea of Dreams" on the fourth episode of the third season, "Fish out of Water", [[Magic sword|Magic Sword]]'s "Infinite" on the fifth episode of the fourth season, [[K.Flay]]'s "Blood in the Cut" on the sixth episode of the fourth season, and [[Jenny Owen Youngs]]'s ''Wake Up'' on the twelfth episode of the fourth season.
Princess Carolyn's hold music is the song "Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats" from the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''. The [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] song "[[Los Ageless]]" plays throughout the first episode of the fifth season, including the credits.

===Season 1===

On the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the first season has an approval rating of 65%, based on 23 reviews.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the season received a score of 59 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BoJack Horseman – Season 1|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Adams' review of the first six episodes gave the series a C+ grade; in the review, Adams wrote that the show "spoofs the emptiness of celebrity, but does so without any novelty or true insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/review/netflixs-entry-adult-animation-race-bojack-horsema-208254 | title=Netflix's entry into the adult-animation race, BoJack Horseman, stumbles out of the gate | website=[[The A.V. Club]] | date=August 21, 2014 | accessdate=August 22, 2014 | author=Adams, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'', Willa Paskin was more enthused. "[It] is perhaps a little more clever than it is uproariously funny, but it is often very clever, and, moreover, well-tuned to the ludicrousness of the sort of low-level fame that surrounds BoJack". She likened it to ''[[30 Rock]]'' in its ability to "[present] big ideas without having to commit to them".&lt;ref name="Slate review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paskin|first=Willa|title=The Longest Face|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/08/bojack_horseman_on_netflix_will_arnett_comedy_cartoon_is_bleak_and_brilliant.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=August 22, 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Mitchell from Popzara was equally optimistic about the show's future, saying that "Fans of [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' or [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' will definitely want to check this one out, as its rapid-fire delivery is always consciously spot-on".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.popzara.com/bojack-horseman-netflix/|title = BoJack Horseman Popzara Review|last = Mitchell|first = Chris|date = August 29, 2014|work = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140831183910/http://www.popzara.com/bojack-horseman-netflix/|archivedate = August 31, 2014|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the show as "hilarious and ribald".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/arts/television/bojack-horseman-netflix-animated-series-with-will-arnett.html|title = A Talking Horse of a Different Color: Blue|last = Neil|first = Genzlinger|date = August 24, 2014|work = |accessdate = August 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Lyons of [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] gave a positive review, describing it as "radically sad. I love it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/bojack-horsemans-radically-funny-sadness.html|title=BoJack Horseman's Radically Funny Sadness – Vulture|website=Vulture|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the season, however, received much more positive reviews. Ben Travers of [[IndieWire]] believed one possible reason for mixed reviews of the show was critics reviewing only the first half of the season, with the second half changing drastically in tone and developing a darker and deeper meaning. This change was so drastic it resulted in IndieWire changing its policy to only review entire seasons of shows on Netflix, instead of just the first six episodes, which would have boosted ''BoJack Horseman'''s C+ grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/7-new-netflix-shows-to-binge-watch-in-july-2015-and-the-best-episodes-of-each-20150627|title=7 New Netflix Shows to Binge Watch in July 2015   – Indiewire|author=Ben Travers|date=June 27, 2015|website=Indiewire|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
The second season of the show received universal acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes the second season holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 17 critics,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; whilst on Metacritic, the season has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 7 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BoJack Horseman – Season 2|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-2|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vox (website)|Vox]] commented the show had "found its footing beautifully in season two, earning the title of not just the streaming service's best show, but of one of television's best shows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/20/9002247/bojack-horseman-review-netflix-season-2|title=The deeply funny, even more depressing BoJack Horseman is Netflix's best show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiewire]] gave the series an A-, praising the depth of the show's storyline, the voice cast and the superior comedy in comparison to the first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/review-bojack-horseman-season-2-brings-the-comedy-but-finds-true-depth-in-its-questions-60375/|title=Review: 'BoJack Horseman' Season 2 Brings the Comedy, But Finds True Depth in Its Questions – IndieWire|first=Liz Shannon|last=Miller|website=www.indiewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also gave the series an A-, commenting that "for the most part,  it’s an entirely unique, funny, and melancholic exploration into the heart and mind of someone struggling to put his life back on track after a series of dark turns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.avclub.com/absurdist-humor-biting-drama-groom-bojack-horseman-int-1798184367|title=Absurdist humor, biting drama groom BoJack Horseman into one of TV's best shows|first=Vikram|last=Murthi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' awarded the series 4-and-a-half stars out of 5, commenting that "BoJack Horseman’s second season is an even more confident blend of the various tones it experimentally donned last year, as it’s simultaneously melancholic, angry, goofy, playful, and often uproariously funny in a distinctively ineffable what-the-fuck fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/bojack-horseman-season-two|title=BoJack Horseman: Season Two – TV Review – Slant Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the series a B rating, stating it was "one of TV's best meta-skewers of Hollywood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-2|title=BoJack Horseman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Like the previous season of the show, the third season received universal acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gives the third season an approval rating of 100%, based on 31 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 3 (2016)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack-horseman/s03/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst on Metacritic, the season received a score of 89 out of 100, based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-3 |title=BoJack Horseman: Season 3 |website=Metacritic |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' lauded the season, commenting that the show "evolved from frothy talking-animal Hollywood satire to character-rich treatise on depression in its first season, deepened and darkened into one of TV's best shows in its second season and gallops into its third season with a profound confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bojack-horseman-season-3-tv-912911 |title='BoJack Horseman' Season 3: TV Review |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |date=July 20, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the series an A rating, stating the season is "more digressive than the show’s first two years, and much more open-ended, sending core characters in different directions" and that it "builds to one of the funniest, weirdest, and most profound moments ever seen in a television show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/07/13/bojack-horseman-season-3-review/ |title='BoJack Horseman' season 3: EW review |last=Franich |first=Darren |date=July 13, 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the series an A-, commenting that "Netflix has taken it upon itself to add BoJack to the line of TV’s famous antiheroes" and praising the show for improving with each series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.avclub.com/bojack-horseman-is-as-gut-wrenching-and-gut-busting-as-1798188367 |title=BoJack Horseman is as gut-wrenching and gut-busting as ever in season 3 |last=Chavez |first=Danette |date=July 21, 2016 |website=The AV Club |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collider (website)|Collider]] gave the show 4/5 stars, stating "BoJack Horseman ends up becoming a thrilling, rueful study of the psychological games and uniquely vain, notably capitalistic decision-making that powers the entertainment industry". They went on to praise the show's humor; "through its venomous jokes and unrelenting, uproarious gags, the series also recognizes how charming, joyful, and galvanizing entertainment for entertainment sake can be, no matter how stupid or silly it may seem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/bojack-horseman-season-3-review-netflix/ |title='BoJack Horseman' Season 3 Review: Netflix's Strange, Sublime Animated Melodrama Returns |last=Cabin |first=Chris |date=July 22, 2016 |website=Collider.com |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
The fourth season of the show received universal acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an approval rating of 97%, based on 31 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack_horseman/s04|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 4 – Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Metacritic awarded the show a score of 87 based on 5 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-4|title=BoJack Horseman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiewire]] gave the series an A grade, commenting that "by the end of the season, we know these characters, and this show, far better than ever before. BoJack’s signature tropes—the background visual jokes, the animal puns, the brutal moments of sadness—remain reliably consistent, but turns the focus largely inward, ensuring that some of the more outlandish plots support and highlight the more emotional storylines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/08/bojack-horseman-season-4-review-netflix-1201871227/|title=BoJack Horseman Season 4 Review: The Most Honest, Soulful Season Yet – IndieWire|first=Liz Shannon|last=Miller|website=www.indiewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' lauded the series, praising the installment as "moving and unexpected" and that "it offers hope but never ignores the sorrows that are inevitable in real life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bojack-horseman-returns-with-its-most-emotional-season-yet/2017/09/06/567a4b7e-8f4c-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html|title=Review – 'BoJack Horseman' returns with its most emotional season yet|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/bethoniebutler|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' also gave a positive review, commenting that the "material has the snap and the poignancy we’ve grown accustomed to" and that "while nothing matches the adventurousness of Season 3’s underwater film festival episode, Season 4’s ninth episode — narrated from the future by a distant descendant of Princess Carolyn’s — is a devastating example of what 'BoJack' can do at its best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/television/bojack-horseman-netflix-season-4-review.html|title=Review: There Are No Hollywood Endings in 'BoJack Horseman'|first=Mike|last=Hale|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 5===
Keeping up with the performance of previous seasons, the fifth season received universal acclaim. Based on 31 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a score of 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bojack_horseman/s05|title=BoJack Horseman: Season 5|work= Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiewire gave the season an "A" calling it another brilliant season and saying the series has become so great that it is "beyond reproach". Multiple critical reviews have praised the episode "Free Churro", calling it one of the series' best episodes and giving it Emmy buzz for both the writing and Will Arnett's monologue. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' observed that the episode "The Dog Days Are Over", where Diane Nguyen takes an impromptu trip to [[Hanoi]], can be seen as a commentary on the "identity crisis elements" of having the Vietnamese-American character Diane voiced by a white actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chappell |first1=Les |title=Diane travels to Vietnam as she—and 'BoJack Horseman'—grapple with questions about her identity |url=https://www.avclub.com/diane-travels-to-vietnam-as-she-and-bojack-horseman-gra-1829050303 |accessdate=September 17, 2018 |work=The A.V.

===Season 6===
On October 30, 2018, a sixth season was officially picked up. [[Jonny Sun]] was added to the writing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |last=sun |first=jonny |user=jonnysun |date= 2 November 2018 |link= https://twitter.com/jonnysun/status/1058532680696918016 |access-date= 29 November 2018 |number=1058532680696918016 |title=i'm starting my first tv writing job. and it’s for my dream show. LET’S GOOOO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
In the fall of 2010, ''BoJack Horseman'' creator [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]] met with [[The Tornante Company]] producer Steven A. Cohen and pitched five different animated projects, from which ''BoJack Horseman'' was chosen.&lt;ref name="Vulture"&gt;{{cite news |last=McDonnell |first=Chris |title=How ''BoJack Horseman'' Got Made: An oral history of TV's favorite alcoholic, narcissistic, self-destructive talking horse. |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-oral-history.html |accessdate=November 29, 2018 |work=Vulture |date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob-Waksberg later met with The Tornante Company CEO [[Michael Eisner]], who suggested that the show center around a former racehorse rather than a former sitcom actor. While they settled on the show-business angle, this contributed to a storyline in which BoJack played a racehorse in the fictional movie ''Secretariat''.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;

In the summer of 2011, [[Lisa Hanawalt]] was asked to work as a designer on the show. She initially turned down the offer, which she has said was because she was "kind of commitment-phobic". She eventually took the job six months later.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt; She then worked with animation production studio [[ShadowMachine]] to develop the show's visual style.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;

Bob-Waksberg pitched ''BoJack Horseman'' to Netflix in October 2013, and it was picked up for a first season that was released in August 2014.&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt; 

Writers for ''BoJack Horseman'' include Bob-Waksberg, [[Joe Lawson (writer)|Joe Lawson]], Kate Purdy, Elijah Aron, [[Jordan Young (producer)|Jordan Young]] Mehar Sethi, and Joanna Calo. Directors include [[Amy Winfrey]], J.C. Gonzalez, [[Mike Hollingsworth (animator)|Mike Hollingsworth]], [[Aaron Long (animator)|Aaron Long]], and Anne Walker Farrell.

==Influences==
{{Prose|date=September 2018}}
Creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg has cited the cynical humor in the [[The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)|Canadian show ''The Newsroom'']] as a large influence on ''BoJack Horseman''.  He also praised ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as an influence for being able to tell sad stories without sacrificing humor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-09-21/horsin-around-bojack-creator-raphael-bob-waksberg Horsin' around with 'BoJack' creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg], 15:00–20:00.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on storyline similarities and graphical nuances, the series has been said to have influences deriving from ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' and ''[[Daria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/4785-the-inspiration-behind-netflix-s-bojack-horseman|title=Who is BoJack Horseman About?|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, before the show's fifth season was released, Bob-Waksberg has stated what the show's ten biggest influences were:&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/bojack-horseman-netflix-raphael-bob-waksberg-718290|title= 'BoJack Horseman' Creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg on the Show's 10 Biggest Influences|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate = September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'': "This show is such a titan of the format. It's so influential in so many ways."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'': "Formally, it's easy to see the connection: ''Roger Rabbit'' posits, 'What if cartoons were real and interacted with humans?'"&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'': "The caustic style of ''Archer'' was really on my mind when I was first doing ''BoJack'' - perhaps too much!" &lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[Animaniacs]]'': "I've always been a big fan of aspirational references. It's boring if I watch [a show] and get everything."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[Daria]]'': "It did a good job of showing that smart people aren't always right and stupid people aren't always bad."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[The Tick]]'': "There was a villain, Chairface Chippendale, who wanted to carve his name in the moon, and the Tick stopped him, but not before he got the C and the H in. So for the rest of the series, whenever there's a night scene, there's a C and an H there."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]]: "I love how the studio plays with structure and isn't afraid to try different things, like the dialogue-free first act of ''[[Wall-E]]''." &lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[Futurama]]'': "It plays with continuity in a really cool way, and plays with sadness in a really cool way" &lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* ''[[South Park]]'': "I particularly love the more didactic episodes of the show, even though I don't always agree with them politically."&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;
* The works of [[Don Hertzfeldt]]: "His short ''[[Rejected]]'' was a big influence, particularly in the first drug-trip episode of ''BoJack''." &lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;

== Addressing social issues ==
Since its first season, ''Bojack'' has addressed many hot-button sociopolitical issues. Its creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, once said that he considered the concept of "political correctness" something that other comedians and media creators should view as more of a responsibility:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/8xx9mg/the-creator-of-bojack-horseman-on-why-political-correctness-isnt-censorship|title=The Creator of 'Bojack Horseman' on Why Political Correctness Isn't Censorship|date=2017-08-10|work=Vice|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview with VICE, he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"I think most people who argue for what you might call political correctness, are not actually arguing for censorship. They're arguing for self-control and self-restraint. They're arguing for people to be conscious of the power they have, right? And I believe that I have a lot of power, as someone making popular entertainment. I do think we have to be careful about the art we put out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;The seventh episode of the second season was perhaps one of the most notable examples of the show's voice on this issue. The season 2 episode "Hank After Dark," commonly referred to as "the [[Bill Cosby|Cosby]] episode,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.papermag.com/bojack-horsemans-bill-cosby-episode-is-equally-hilarious-and-devastati-1427606437.html|title=BoJack Horseman's Bill Cosby Episode is Equally Hilarious and Devastating|date=2015-07-21|work=PAPER|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows Diane and Bojack on a book tour as they field questions regarding allegations that have just surfaced about a comedy legend, Hank Hippopopalous. In the third season episode "Brrap Brrap Pew Pew" (episode 6), Diane accidentally announces she is getting an abortion via pop starlet Sextina Aquafina's Twitter account, and Hollywoo gets swept up in talks about the practice. The season 4 episode "Thoughts and Prayers," took a similar satirical approach towards the [[Mass shootings in the United States|frequency of mass shootings]] and the [[Gun politics in the United States|gun debate in America]], after Diane fires a gun for the first time and one of Princess Carolyn's projects get caught in the crossfire, launching a debate on whether or not women should own and use guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/10/02/bojack_horseman_s_thoughts_and_prayers_episode_skewers_rote_responses_to.html|title=BoJack Horseman’s Mass Shooting Episode Reminds Us That "Thoughts and Prayers" Won’t Stop Gun Violence|last=Martinelli|first=Marissa|date=2017-10-02|work=Slate|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 5 has been praised for its handling of sexual harassment and powerful men following the [[Me Too movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/bojack-horseman-raphael-bob-waksberg-season-5-me-too|title=BoJack Horseman: Raphael Bob-Waksberg Unpacks a Sensitive, Brilliant, Post-#MeToo Season|last=Saraiya|first=Sonia|date=2018-9-14|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bojack-horseman-season-5-marginalized-women.html|title=How BoJack Horseman Addresses the Silencing of Women|first=Jen|last=Chaney|date=2018-9-25|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it "just might be the best artistic rumination on #MeToo and an age of terrible men yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/15/17858086/bojack-horseman-season-5-review-netflix-metoo-spoilers|title=BoJack Horseman season 5 is a bold, bracing look at a culture that shirks responsibility|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=2018-9-17|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show also explores Todd Chavez's open [[asexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pride.com/tv/2017/9/12/todd-chavez-tvs-first-openly-asexual-character-and-people-are-emotional|title='Bojack Horseman's' Todd Chavez Is Doing Big Things for Asexual Visibility|date=2017-09-12|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is addressed throughout seasons 4 and 5. In the last episode of the third season, Todd says "I’m not gay... I mean, I don’t think I am, but I don’t think I’m straight, either. I don’t know what I am. I think I might be nothing."

== Syndication ==
On July 26, 2018, [[Comedy Central]] acquired exclusive [[Non-linear media#Television|linear television]] rights to the series. The series premiered on the network after the ''[[South Park]]'' season 22 premiere on September 26, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17618728/bojack-horseman-netflix-comedy-central|title=BoJack Horseman comes to Comedy Central this fall|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] deal makes it also the first [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix original]] to be syndicated on linear television in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/07/seasons-1-4-of-bojack-horseman-to-air-on-comedy-central.html|title=Every Season of BoJack Horseman Comes to Comedy Central This Fall|last=Wright|first=Megh|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Khmer text}}
'''Dance in Cambodia''' ({{lang-km|របាំ}} ''robam'') consists of three main categories: classical dance of the royal court used for invocation, entertainment and to pay homage, folk dance which portrays cultural traditions, and social dances performed in social gatherings.However, all traditional Cambodian dances were destroyed during Khmer Rouge period. Most of them restored after the Khmer rouge ended and by the help from Thailand. Therefore, the dances styles in Cambodia are highly influenced from Thai dance styles.

{{main|Royal Ballet of Cambodia}}

Cambodia's premier performing art form is the Khmer classical dance, or ''Robam Preah Reach Trop'', a highly stylized dance form originating from the royal courts. Performances of classical dance consist of elaborately costumed dancers and music played by a pinpeat ensemble. It is performed for invocation of deities and spirits as well as to pay homage to royalty and guests. In the mid-20th century, it was introduced to the general public and became widely celebrated as iconic of Cambodian culture, often being performed during public events, holidays, and for tourists visiting Cambodia. Two of the most performed classical dance are the ''Robam Chuon Por'' ("Wishing dance") and the ''[[Robam Tep Apsara]]'' ("Apsara dance").

==Folk dance==
Created in the 20th century are folk dances that emphasize that various cultural traditions and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Cambodian folk dances are usually more fast-paced than classical dances. The movements and gestures are not as stylized as classical dance. Folk dancers wear clothes of the people they are portraying such as [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]], hill tribes, farmers, and peasants. Some folk dances are about love or folktales. Most of the music of folk dances is played by a [[mahori]] orchestra.

A '''Discourse-Completion Task''' (DCT) is a tool used in [[linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] to elicit particular [[speech acts]].  A DCT consists of a one-sided role play containing a situational prompt which a participant will read to elicit the responses of another participant.

==Background==
The instrument was originally developed by [[Shoshana Blum-Kulka]] for studying speech act realization comparatively between native and non-native Hebrew speakers, based on the work of E. Levenston.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper. (1989). Investigating cross-cultural pragmatics: An introductory overview. In Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper (Eds.), Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies (pp. 1-34). Norwood, NJ: Ablex, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

DCTs are used in pragmatics research to study speech acts and find the medium between naturally occurring speech and scripted speech acts.  In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts,&lt;ref&gt;Gass, S., &amp; Houck, N. (1999).

'''Ethnic interest groups in the United States''' are [[ethnic interest group]]s within the [[United States]] which seek to influence the [[foreign policy]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[domestic policy]] of the United States for the benefit of the foreign "ethnic [[Kinship|kin]]" or [[homeland]] with whom the respective ethnic groups identify.&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002&gt;[[Thomas Ambrosio|Ambrosio, Thomas]].  2002.  "Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy."  Praeger Publishers.  {{ISBN|0-275-97533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic development==
{{rquote|right|'''''[The] ethnic composition [of the United States is] the single most important determinant of American foreign policy.''''' — [[Nathan Glazer]]&lt;ref name=GlazerMoynihan1975&gt;[[Nathan Glazer|Glazer, Nathan]] and [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]. 1975. ''Ethnicity: Theory and Experience''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-26856-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Being a country founded and populated by immigrants, the United States has always contained groups with significant affective and political ties to their national homeland and their ethnic kin throughout the world."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002 /&gt;

Many commentators when discussing the influence of ethnic interest groups tend to focus on new entrants to the competition for influence while accepting that the historic role that the Anglo-Saxon ethnic group had is no longer influencing, the foreign policy of the United States.&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002 /&gt; According to the Anglo authors as it usually is it was the United States' Anglo-Saxon's ethnic-ideological identity that, according to Paul McCartney,&lt;ref name=McCartney2002&gt;McCartney, Paul. "Anglo-Saxonism and U.S. Foreign Policy during the Spanish–American War" in [[Thomas Ambrosio|Ambrosio, Thomas]]. 2002. ''Ethnic Identity Groups and U.S. Foreign Policy''. Praeger Publishers. {{ISBN|0-275-97533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; drove it to enter into the [[Spanish–American War]]. Similarly, United States foreign policy in the mid-20th century was shaped in favor of [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|South African apartheid]], according to Catherine Scott,&lt;ref name=Scott2002&gt;Scott, Catherine V. "White Mischief: U.S. Support for Apartheid, 1948–1961" in [[Thomas Ambrosio|Ambrosio, Thomas]]. 2002. ''Ethnic Identity Groups and U.S. Foreign Policy''. Praeger Publishers. {{ISBN|0-275-97533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the influence of people who identified with the [[Afrikaners]] based on a feeling of shared "whiteness."

===World War I===
In the United States, according to [[Alexander DeConde]],&lt;ref name=DeConde1992&gt;[[Alexander DeConde|DeConde, Alexander]]. 1992. ''Ethnicity, Race and American Foreign Policy''. Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the "World War quickened the ethnic consciousness of minority groups. They promptly created organizations to help the causes of their old European homelands that had become belligerents. Through whatever means possible, the ethnic activists among them sought to give direction to Washington on matters of policy that affected their overseas kin, making the United States a lobbying battleground between rival interest groups emotionally entangled in the war."

===Cold War===
Ambrosio writes that "during the Cold War, the influence of ethnic identity groups was limited by the nature of both the international system and the U.S. foreign policy process."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002 /&gt; The ethnic identity groups had limited influence during this period because:
# the Cold War foreign policy of the United States was formulated largely by elites concentrated in an executive branch (itself insulated from ethnic politicking because of their diminished role in presidential elections as compared to congress), and
# the general public, because of the high stakes involved, granted significant latitude and deference to the policy making elites.

===Post–Cold War===
Historian [[Samuel P. Huntington]]&lt;ref name=Huntington1997&gt;[[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington, Samuel P.]] "[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19970901faessay3794/samuel-p-huntington/the-erosion-of-american-national-interests.html The Erosion of American National Interests]." ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (September/October 1997):28–49.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that in the post–[[Cold War]] international system, there is uncertainty and confusion in the United States as to what are its [[national interest]]s. Contributing to this confusing is the rise of multiculturalism and its eroding of a singular "American identity." The lack of a coherent national identity makes its challenging for the state to articulate its true interests, thus it becomes less resistant to the influence exerted by ethnic interest groups whose ethnocentric goals, at best, may only align with broad "American interests" by chance.

===Current trends===
Political scientist [[Thomas Ambrosio]] writes in 2002 that there "has been a growing acceptance that ethnic identity groups have the right to mobilize politically for the purpose of influencing U.S. policies at home and abroad. This has resulted in a rise in the number and ethnic lobbies as well as their influence."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002 /&gt; Additional trends include an "increasing rejection of cultural assimilation and, in its place, growing support for expressions of ethnic diversity" as well as a decreasing tendency for Americans "to make charges of disloyalty against those who retain ties to their ethnic kin abroad and who advocate positions in line with the interests of their homeland." The proliferation of ethnic conflicts has also heightened the stakes for many ethnic groups causing concerted efforts to expand their influence on U.S. foreign policy as the "independence, survival, or general welfare of a group's ethnic kin or homeland is threatened."

==Conflicting interpretations==
There are multiple perspectives as to the value of the influence of ethnic interest groups on the foreign policy of the United States, much like there are conflicting interpretations of the influence of ethnic interest groups in general, see [[Ethnic interest group#Conflicting interpretations|Ethnic interest groups – conflicting interpretations]]. Yossi Shain writes that in "many ways […] the participation of ethnic diasporas in shaping U.S. foreign policy is a truly positive phenomena."&lt;ref name=Ambrosio2002 /&gt; A less positive assessment comes from Tony Smith, who writes that at "present, the negative consequences of ethnic involvement may way outweigh the undoubted benefits this activism at times confers on America in world affairs."&lt;ref name=Smith2000&gt;Smith, Tony. 2000. ''Foreign Attachments: The Power of Ethnic Groups in the Making of American Foreign Policy''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-00294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europeade''' is the largest festival of European folk culture, held in a different European country each year. The last Europeade was held in [[Turku]], [[Finland]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turku.fi/en/europeade2017&lt;/ref&gt; The year before that it was held in [[Namur, Belgium|Namur]], [[Belgium]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeade2016.be&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Europeade was held in 1964 at the initiative of Mon de Clopper (1922–1998) from [[Flanders]] and Robert Müller-Kox, a German exiled from the [[Province of Silesia]]. Mon de Clopper was president of the Europeade until 1997, when he was succeeded by the current president Bruno Peeters (born 1939), also from Flanders.

The goal of the Europeade is to foster a united Europe, where everyone contributes and develops his or her own culture, respecting everyone else. This philosophy is practised each year during the five-day festival, when thousands of people from all parts of Europe, dressed in their traditional costumes, meet to sing, to make music, to dance and to celebrate - without formal lecturing.

In a typical Europeade there are about five thousand participants, all in costume, in almost two hundred groups, from about twenty-two countries. They all pay their own transport costs, and perform free of charge. Participants arrive during the Wednesday, and are accommodated in large premises wherever possible, typically in large schools, with basic beds supplied in the class-rooms, and using other school amenities. Large-scale catering is provided, usually  a simple breakfast, a packed lunch and a hot evening meal in one central location. Groups perform in a number of large concerts, in designated street locations, and take part in a massed parade through the town and in a major Saturday evening Europeade Ball. Outside the actual events many groups will sing, play and dance wherever they happen to find themselves, including the premises where they are lodged.  After the Sunday afternoon Closing Concert - typically ninety groups performing - groups are free to make their way home, but accommodation continues until after breakfast on the Monday morning.

A '''feather boa''' is a [[fashion accessory]] that is usually worn wrapped around the neck like a scarf.
[[File:Pink_feather_boa_-_colour_isolated.jpg|thumb|A modern, pink chandelle feather boa, in a black and white image]]

==Construction==
A boa can be made of [[fur]], but it is usually made instead from various types of [[feathers]]. Ostrich, marabou, chandelle, and turkey are the most common feathers used, although non-feather boas are also available. Feathers used go through bleaching or dyeing processes and are glued and stitched into lengths called "ply". Sometimes more natural boas are produced. A lightweight chandelle boa might only weigh {{convert|65|g|oz}}, whereas a 24 ply ostrich boa can weigh as much as {{convert|200|g|oz}}. The more ply, the fluffier and thicker the boa. Boas are generally measured by weight (grammes), length (centimetres), and ply. Boas are available through novelty, costume, or lingerie shops, as well as online.

[[File:Gabriela Poet Wearing Boa by Patty Mooney.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Young woman modeling a knitted boa, San Diego, California – Photograph by Patty Mooney]]With the development of "fun fur" or "eyelash" yarns in the late 20th century, an adept craftsperson can knit a boa of one solid color or a mix of various colors.  Yarn boas do not "shed" like feather boas and are favored for their soft texture against the neck. The rounded boa shape is achieved by knitting one row and purling the next row, then repeating this pattern until reaching the desired length.

==Types==
'''[[Ostrich]]''' —
Thousands of long thin feather strands woven into ply are used to construct these very fluffy boas. These form the larger, Las Vegas showgirl type boas, as when they are coloured and woven into many ply, they can look very dramatic even at a distance.

'''[[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]]''' —
Many larger flat turkey feathers form these heavier boas which might weigh between 120 and 400 grams and reach {{convert|30|cm|in}} in diameter.

'''[[Marabou (fashion)|Marabou]]''' —
The fine down from marabou is used to form these very thin, and very fluffy boas.

'''Chandelle''' —
Smaller feathers or "flats" from the turkey are used to create these lighter boas with smaller diameters.

==History==
[[Image:Lautrec woman with a black feather boa c1892.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman with a black feather boa, c. 1892, by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]]]
Feather boas have been documented for use as an adornment since at least 1820, but they might have been worn as early as the 17th century. Feather boas have fallen in and out of fashion many times over the years. Feather boas have had the reputation of being elegant as well as being considered [[campy]] or vulgar apparel. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Some historic eras where feather boas were in style or trendy include: the late [[Victorian era]] and [[Edwardian]] era (between 1890 and 1915), the 1920s, and the 1970s during the [[glam rock]] and [[disco]] music eras.

Entertainers have long used feather boas as part of their act. A few feather boa wearers include: dancer [[Isadora Duncan]]; singer [[Shirley Bassey]];  actor/comedian [[Mae West]]; [[Professional wrestling|wrestler]]s [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Superstar Billy Graham]], and [[Hulk Hogan]]; singers [[Scott Weiland]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Cher]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Gerard Way]], and [[Elton John]]; and numerous other opera and [[cabaret]] singers.

==Other uses==
Social clubs such as the [[Red Hat Society]], or those who are involved with historic re-enactment societies, wear boas at meetings while they are often worn as a [[costume]] accessory for parties around holiday seasons such as [[Halloween]] or [[Mardi Gras]] in New Orleans.

Feather boas are worn around campus by new members of the [[Mask and Wig|Mask &amp; Wig Club]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Feather boas are worn for [[erotic]] seduction purposes and are at times considered [[fetish clothing|fetish]] wear. Nude performers may use boas to cover themselves while teasing their audience.

Feather boas are sometimes used as trims for skirts or tutus.

The '''Frari Triptych''' or '''Pesaro Triptych''' is a 1488 oil on panel [[triptych]] painting by [[Giovanni Bellini]]. It is signed and dated 1488 on the centre of the Virgin Mary's throne, though it may have taken several years to produce, meaning he started it in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Fry&lt;/ref&gt; On the reverse is a label dating its completion more precisely, to 15 February 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Anchise Tempestini, ''Giovanni Bellini'', Catalogo Completo, Cantini, Firenze 1992. {{ISBN|88-7737-105-6}}, Kat. 60, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mariolina Olivari, ''Giovanni Bellini'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|88-8117-099-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its central scene is the Madonna and Child enthroned with two angel musicians, flanked to the left by [[saint Nicholas of Bari]] and [[saint Peter]] and to the right by [[saint Mark]] (patron of Venice) and [[saint Benedict]]. The work's division into compartments is rather old-fashioned and may have been explicitly demanded by the commissioner, but Bellini uses this to his advantage, integrating the painted architecture with the frame, which he designed himself. This develops the illusionism of his [[San Giobbe Altarpiece]], again placing the Virgin in a deep blue mantle on a high marble throne, using a golden light and a Byzanto-Venetian-style apse. To the sides thin strips of landscape suggest a vast space behind the work, whilst the [[trompe l'oeil]] apse behind the Virgin bears an inscription reading &lt;small&gt;IANUA CERTA POLI DUC MENTEM DIRIGE VITAM: QUAE PERAGAM COMMISSA TUAE SINT OMNIA CURAE&lt;/small&gt; ("Certain gate of heaven, guide [my] mind, direct [my] life: may everything I do be entrusted to your care").&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Rona Goffen, ''Devozione e committenza.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">'''Free writing'''  is a [[prewriting]] technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by [[prose]] writers and writing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/GRAMMAR/composition/brainstorm_freewrite.htm |title=Getting Started: Freewriting |publisher=Grammar.ccc.commnet.edu |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconsciouslife.com/liberate-your-mind-with-free-writing.htm|title=Liberate Your Mind with Free Writing|publisher=theconsciouslife.com|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[writers]] use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as [[automatic writing]].

Unlike [[brainstorming]] where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.

==History==
[[Dorothea Brande]] was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book ''Becoming a Writer'' (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can.

[[Peter Elbow]] advanced freewriting in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'' (1975), and it has been popularized by [[Julia Cameron]] through her book ''The Artist's Way'' (1992).

==Technique==
The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections.  If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will ''write'' that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.

Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.

The writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines [[blog]]ging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.

==Definition==
Free writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, [[Peter Elbow]], and [[Natalie Goldberg]].&lt;ref name="Cole2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Free-writing is all about loosening and limbering the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer.&lt;ref name="Robinson1967"&gt;{{cite journal

==Use in education==
Often free-writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching to [[elementary school]] children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique.&lt;ref name="Klingman1985"&gt;{{cite journal

*Give yourself a time limit. Write for one or ten or twenty minutes, and then stop.
*Keep your hand moving until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you've written. Write quickly but not in a hurry.
*Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.
*If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving.
*If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that.
*When the time is up, look over what you've written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free-writing session.

Goldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by [[Jack Kerouac]], whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 "rules" in his Belief &amp; Technique for Modern Prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-technique.html|title=Kerouac on technique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kerouac's "rules" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose,&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-spontaneous.html|title=Kerouac, Spontaneous Prose|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Kerouac himself cites the "trance writing" of [[William Butler Yeats]] as a precursor of his own practice.&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Goldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.

'''Gender sensitization''' precides over [[Gender Sensitivity|gender sensitivity]] which refers to the [[Behavior modification|modification of behavior]] by [[Consciousness raising|raising awareness]] of [[gender equality]] concerns.&lt;ref name="IJSR"/&gt; This can be achieved by conducting various [[sensitization]] campaigns, training centres, workshop, programs etc. Sensitization in the domain of [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]], is seen as an awareness informed propensity or disposition which aims at changing behavior so that it is sensitive to certain issues. Gender sensitization may be seen as "the awareness informed disposition or propensity to behave in a manner which is sensitive to gender justice and gender equality issues."&lt;ref name="IJSR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding the Concept of Sensitisation in Humanities and Social Sciences : An Exploration in Philosophy of Mind | author=Dr. Jatinder Kumar Sharma | journal=International Journal of Scientific Research | date=March 2016 | volume= 24| issue=90 | pages=380–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interlinked with [[gender empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/1931007/Gender_Sensitization_and_Police | title=Gender Sensitization and Police | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Bhowmick Soma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender sensitization theories claim that modification of the behavior of [[teaching|teachers]] and parents (etc.) towards children which can have a causal effect on gender equality.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Gender sensitizing "is about changing behavior and instilling [[empathy]] into the views that we hold about our own and the other genders."&lt;ref name=Aksornkool&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender sensitivity: a training manual for sensitizing education managers, curriculum and material developers and media professionals to gender concerns|first=Namtip|last=Aksornkool|editor1-first=Cindy|editor1-last=Joerger|editor2-first=Elaine|editor2-last=Taylor|page=VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps people in "examining their personal attitudes and beliefs and questioning the 'realities' they thought they know.

Gender Sensitization is one basic requirement for the normal development of an individual. Without being sensitive to the needs of a particular gender, an individual may refrain from understanding the opposite gender and in some acute cases even him or herself. The need for this sensitivity has been felt and realised through times immemorial and in almost all kinds of human existence, across the globe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''Graphism''' refers to the "expression of thought in material symbols".&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Leroi-Gourhan/Leroi-Gourhan_ch6.html Stanford University webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; Graphism began some 30,000 years BC, not as a photographic representation of reality but as an abstraction that was geared toward magical-religious matters. Early graphism then was a form of [[writing]] that constitutes a 'symbolic transposition, not copying of [[reality]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heelstone.com/meridian/cheek/damntheory.html Riding the Meridian: Domestic Ambient Noise/Moise]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The birth of graphism==
The earliest traces of graphism date back to 30,000 years BC at the end of the [[Mousterian]] period and became more prevalent in the [[Chatelperronian|Chatelperronian period]] toward 35,000 BC{{Citation needed|reason=A credible source can probably handle "BC".|date=September 2010}}. While it can be claimed that language merely represents a logical development of the vocal signals of the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed before the dawn of [[homo sapiens]]. While [[Muscle|motor function]] determines expression in the techniques and language of all [[Simian|anthropoids]], [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] determines graphism in the figurative language of the most recent anthropoids.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

It has been hypothesized that graphism first appeared in the form of tight curves or series of lines engraved in bone or stone. However, there has been no substantial proof to support this [[hypothesis]], with the only comparison being the [[Australia]]n [[tjurunga]], stone or wood tablets engraved with abstract designs (spirals, straight lines, and clusters of dots) that represented objects of religious significance. The first forms of graphism that allow one to hazardly identify an animal, did not appear until around 30,000 B.C. Prehistoric art records are very numerous, and [[Statistics|statistical processing]] has allowed us to unravel the general meaning of what they represented. The earliest known paintings do not represent a hunt or a family scene, but are graphic building blocks without any associated description.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; All these early forms therefore suggests that figurative art was directly linked with language and was, in the broadest sense, much closer to writing  than to what we understand by a [[work of art]]. It was symbolic transposition, not copying of reality, that is to say that graphism did not begin start by reproducing reality in a slavishly photographic manner, but with abstraction.

The discovery of [[prehistoric art]] in the late 19th century raised the issue of a "naive" state, an art by which humans supposedly represented what they saw as a result of an aesthetic triggering effect.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; It was soon realized near the beginning of the 20th century that this view was mistaken, and that magical-religious concerns were responsible for the figurative art of the [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic Era]], as indeed for almost all art except in a few rare "hunting tallies" etched on bone during the [[Paleolithic]] period.

[[File:Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|Greece personified as a woman, with revolutionaries who participated in the Greek War of Independence.]]

'''Hellas''' or '''Ellada''' is the personification of the nation of [[Greece]], emanating from the classical period. There was a desire for unification in Greece, and Hellas is the only geographical personification known from that period. She is mentioned frequently in literature but only appears once in the arts of late classical Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amy C. Smith|title=Polis and Personification in Classical Athenian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZj9YGF12N8C&amp;pg=PA102|date=22 June 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-19417-7|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
She is usually depicted as a [[woman]] who wears simple clothes which remind the ancient greek ones. On her head she wears a crown or an olive wreath. Almost always she is depressed or sad for recent events with a few exceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35685">The '''history of [[business architecture]]''' has its origins in the 1980s. In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of "cross-organizational design of the business as a whole"&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; closely related to [[enterprise architecture]]. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise,&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"/&gt; as business strategy,&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"/&gt; and also as the representation of business design.&lt;ref name="SC 2010"/&gt;

The concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as [[architectural domain]]s and as activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.

By 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Overview ==
Business architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the "responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"&gt;Paul Arthur Bodine and Jack Hilty. "Business Architecture: An Emerging Profession," at ''businessarchitectsassociation.org,'' Business Architects Association Institute. April 28, 2009. ([http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107140443/http://www.businessarchitectsassociation.org/resources/Documents/Business_Architecture-An_Emerging_Profession_Edition_4-28-09.pdf |date=2010-11-07 }})&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zachman]] (2012) commented in this context, that "a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911) by Frederick Taylor."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"&gt;[[John A. Zachman]] "Foreword" in: Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus &amp; Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand "Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models)."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"&gt;[[Bernus, Peter]], and Ovidiu Noran. "[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054819/document A metamodel for enterprise architecture]," ''Enterprise Architecture, Integration and Interoperability.'' Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. 56-65.&lt;/ref&gt; And on the other hand "proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’."&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;

More specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan &amp; Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is "maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio planning and change management – to name but a few.&lt;ref name="WM 2012"&gt;Jonathan Whelan, Graham Meaden (2012) ''Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980s ==

=== Concept ===
The concept of business architecture emerged in the 1980s in the field of information systems development. One of the first to mention business architecture was the British management consultant [[Edwin E. Tozer]] in the 1986 article "Developing strategies for management information systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"&gt;[[Tozer, Edwin E.]] "Developing strategies for management information systems." ''Long Range Planning'' 19.4 (1986): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of business architecture in the context of [[business information systems planning]], and distinguished:
* Business architecture, and 
* [[Information architecture]], 
And he explained, that "each entity class in the Information Architecture is represented in some database and each business function may be supported by one or more systems."&lt;ref name="EET 1986"/&gt; In this paper Tozer was "prescriptive about the order in which [strategy] issues should be identified.",&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Jane, and Pam Hinton. "Case study-an information systems strategy: development and evolution at the University of Hertfordshire." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and focussed on "IS adaptability to organizational strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Palanisamy, Ramaraj. "Measurement and Enablement of Information Systems for Organizational Flexibility: An Empirical Study." Journal of Services Research 3.2 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First models ===
The American organizational theorist [[William R. Synnott]] (1987) presented one of the first models of business architecture, (see image), in the context of [[data management]]. Synnott wanted to develop an overall Information Resource Management (IRM) architecture, and proposed business architecture as its foundation. He described: 
[[File:Business architecture by Synnott, 1987 (2).svg|thumb|360px|Business architecture by Synnott, 1987]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Business architecture is the foundation upon which the IRM architecture rests. The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm... In the figure data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"&gt;[[William R. Synnott]] (1987). ''The Information Weapon: Winning Customers and Markets With Technology.'' p. 199-220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This model of Information Resource Management (IRM) distinguished seven types of architecture: 
* ''Centralized'': Business architecture, [[Data architecture]], and Communication architecture 
* ''Decentralized'' : Human resources architecture, [[Computer architecture]], User-computing architecture, and [[Systems architecture]].

This type of architectural model classifies different types of architecture. In the later theories and models different sets of architectures have been proposed. For example, the late 1980s [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]] distinguished five types, and this was incorporated in the 1990s [[Federal Enterprise Architecture]], which contained four types of architecture.

=== Base for the total development process ===
Synnott (1987) furthermore described, how business architecture should work and introduced the idea of architectural planning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The business architecture of the company (organization structure, strategic business units and missions, product and services) is the foundation of IRM planning. Since every company has an existing architecture, architectural planning begins with an inventory of the firm's information resources. Assembling the various information resource components' inventories results in an "as is" picture of the corporation's technology structure. From this inventory, the CIO can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company's information resources, particularly as they relate to business information needs as identified in the strategic planning process. From this analysis one can evolve an architectural plan, which is a "to be" picture of where one wants to go and how to get there, not just a picture of the status quo.&lt;ref name="WRS 1987"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cees J. Schrama. (1988) of the European [[International Federation for Information Processing#IFIP TC8|IFIP Technical Committee on Information Systems]] IFIP TC8 presented the opinion, that "business architecture is required to provide a solid base for the total development process." He pictured another model consisted of elements such as information processing architecture and network architecture, and explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Business architecture] contains the fundamentals for the information processing architecture, where process data, support systems and network architecture are performed. In business architecture the following can 'be identified:
:- enterprise analysis: to indicate the business domains
:- business analysis
:- Information systems planning
There are some basic elements in business architecture: management, organization, processes to be performed and data to be made available/delivered. In the past, when mainly operational systems were developed, the processes received considerable attention. Information was seen as being needed to perform processes. This is changing. It is becoming important to have data available to serve information retrieval needs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cees J. Schrama. "Composition and Decomposition in the Development of IS," in: Péter Kovács &amp; [[Elek Straub]] (editors). ''Governmental and Municipal Information Systems: Proceedings of the IFIP TC8 Conference on Governmental and Municipal Information Systems, Budapest, Hungary, September 8–11, 1987.'' [[IFIP TC8]], 1988. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These ideas around the concept of architectural planning evolved in th early 1990s into frameworks, such as [[TAFIM]], the predecessor of [[TOGAF]].

=== View models of enterprise architecture ===
In the 1987 article "A Framework for Information Systems Architecture" [[John Zachman]] presented some of the principles of Enterprise architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Zachman, John A. "A framework for information systems architecture." ''IBM systems journal'' 26.3 (1987): 276-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Framework for information systems architecture ===
[[File:NIST AE model 1989.jpg|thumb|240px|[[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]], one of the first EA models, 1989.]]
In the 5th [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model#NIST workshop on Information Management Directions|NIST workshop on Information Management Directions]] (1989) a working groups under guidance of [[W. Bradford Rigdon]] developed one of the first [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]s, the [[NIST Enterprise Architecture Model]]. In this model business architecture was incorporated as one of the layers of Enterprise Architecture. Bradford Rigdon et al. (1989) brought it like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A discussion of architecture must take into account different levels of architecture. These levels can be illustrated by a pyramid, with the business unit at the top and the delivery system at the base. An enterprise is composed of one or more Business Units that are responsible for a specific business area. The five levels of architecture are
* Business Unit 
* Information 
* Information System
* Data 
* Delivery System
The levels are separate yet interrelated... The idea if an [[enterprise architecture]] reflects an awareness that the levels are logically connected and that a depiction at one level assumes or dictates that architectures at the higher level.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Bradford Rigdon]] (1989) "Architectures and Standards". In: ''Information Management Directions: The Integration Challenge'' E.N. Fong and A.H. Goldfine (eds). NIST Sept 1989. p. 137; Partly cited in: IT Governance Institute (2005) ''Governance of the Extended Enterprise''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the original 1989 illustration of the NIST AE Framework (see image) the top layer was named "Business Unit Architecture." In representation of this model in the 1990s the top layer was named "Business architecture."

== 1990s ==

=== The unfolding information age ===
In the 1990s the [[information age]] was unfolding&lt;ref&gt;[[Zachman, John A.]] "[http://www.cioindex.com/nm/articlefiles/63503-EAIssueForTheCenturyZachman.pdf Enterprise architecture: The issue of the century]." ''Database Programming and Design'' 10.3 (1997): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt; changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture...&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"&gt;[[Gharajedaghi, Jamshid]]. ''Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity: A platform for designing business architecture.'' Elsevier, 1999; 2nd ed. 2005, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bodine and Hilty (2009) "important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions."&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;

=== Descriptions ===
In the 1990s works the concept of business architecture is presented in distinguished ways: 
* ''As activity'' : Lindsay &amp; Price (1991) for example presented business architecture as a "self security activity," which included the "study of a function, including its component organizations, tools, methods, and relationships, both internal and external... The very activity of identifying and listing all these elements is an important learning process for managers. In addition to the element identification and listing processes, the architecture develops a set of principles. Principles are semi-permanent statements of philosophy. That is, they are the basic rules by which managers agree they want to operate."&lt;ref&gt;David T. Lindsay, W. L. Price, ''Information security: proceedings of the IFIP TC11 Seventh International Conference on Information Security--Creating Confidence in Information Processing, IFIP/Sec '91, Brighton, UK, 15–17 May 1991.'' 1991, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As blueprint or model of the enterprise'' : Bourke (1994) described it as "a set of integrated blueprints of the ... [enterprise]'s business processes,"&lt;ref name="MKB 1994"&gt;Michael K. Bourke (1994). Strategy and architecture of health care information systems. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; and Veasey (1994) spoke of business architecture as "a model of the enterprise which is a mechanism for the management of change."&lt;ref&gt;Veasey, Philip W. "Managing a programme of business re-engineering projects in a diversified business." ''Long Range Planning'' 27.5 (1994): 124-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''As strategy for any change program'' : Davis (1996) for example described that business architecture can be used to "describe the type of comprehensive plan required to set the stage for integrated change programmes. The term "architecture" connotes the level of creativity and holistic change required to achieve process excellence. A comprehensive business architecture defines the way in which human performance, processes and technology will be integrated to transform business performance and create value."&lt;ref name="PTD 1996"&gt;Peter T. Davis (1996) ''Securing Client/server Computer Networks.'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Business architectures is presented as tool for [[change management]], acknowledged Van Rensburg (1997). It "provide organisations with the means to understand organisational activities in such a manner that it is used as a mechanism to support the organisation through the business transformation process. Using an object-oriented modelling approach in the design of the business architecture allows for a robust modelling approach which captures real world instances in a business architecture repository. This enables the creation and caption of organisational understanding required for the transformation process."&lt;ref&gt;Van Rensburg, A. C. J. "An object-oriented architecture for business transformation." Computers &amp; industrial engineering 33.1 (1997): 167-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FEA and business subarchitecture ===
In 1996 the US government introduced the [[Clinger–Cohen Act]], to improve the acquisition and management of their information resources.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Enterprise reference architecture ===
Beside the enterprise architecture frameworks a second type of architectural models were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were called Enterprise Reference Architecture.&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; 
* GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987)
* [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] ([[Theodore J. Williams|Williams]] 1994)
* [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), 
* [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems]] ([[August-Wilhelm Scheer|Scheer]] 1999), and 
* [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999)

=== Foundation ===
In 1999 two works on business architecture and its foundation were published, which became two of the most cited works on business architecture. In his "Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity" [[Jamshid Gharajedaghi]] presented a set of principles to design business architecture, which were based on [[systems thinking]]. Gharajedaghi argued, that business Architecture should be considered a [[system]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Business Architecture is a general description of a [[system]]. It identifies its purpose, vital functions, active elements, and critical processes and defines the nature of the interaction among them. Business architecture consists of a set of distinct but interrelated platforms, creating a multidimensional modular system. Each platform represents a dimension of the system, signifying a unique mode of behavior with a predefined set of performance criteria and measures.&lt;ref name= "JG 1999"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IBM researcher Douglas W. McDavid presented the paper "A standard for business architecture description." According to Evernden &amp; Evernden (2003) this paper described a "high-level semantic framework of standard business concepts – abstracted from experience, enterprise business models, the organization of business terminology and the various generic industry reference models. There is an excellent discussion on what constitutes business architecture and the nature and use of information categories, although concepts such as product and agreement seem to be missing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Evernden]], Elaine Evernden (2003). Information First: Integrating Knowledge and Information. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; McDavid argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concepts in the Business Architecture description provide a semantic framework for speaking about common business concerns... For our purposes, this semantic structure provides a common set of concept patterns to be able to understand the types of content that needs to be supported in technology-based information systems... a set of generic concepts and their interrelationships organize business information content in terms of requirements on the business, the boundary of the business, and the business as a system for delivery of value.&lt;ref&gt;McDavid, Douglas W. "A standard for business architecture description." IBM Systems Journal 38.1 (1999): 12-31.; As cited in: Glissman &amp; Sanz (2009, p. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business architect ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The arrival of Internet technologies like email, instant messaging and online data repositories in the mid-1990s opened up tremendous flexibilities in the ways co-workers could collaborate, while the new ability of buyers and sellers to interact in virtual space and transact online changed the traditional structure of businesses...
By the late 1990s, MBAs with advanced skills in Internet technologies began developing live business models for e-commerce websites in real-time. They used the development tools to both represent and build the business at the same time. The model became the business, and thousands were launched, allowing companies to access vast volumes of data and respond rapidly to changing market conditions... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ at the time returned just 12 results... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ in 2009 returns over 1 million listings.
This is just the beginning of a valuable and rapidly expanding profession. Today‘s Business Architects take a holistic view of the complete business representing all interests and engaging all expertise. They see the business organization as a constantly changing, dynamic organism that balances central planning with individual initiative to achieve its mission through the articulate implementation of its corporate strategy.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tools and frameworks ===
According to Bodine and Hilty (2009)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]]‘s book ''Reengineering the Corporation'', which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The [[Balanced Scorecard]] developed by [[Robert S. Kaplan|Robert Kaplan]] and [[David P. Norton|David Norton]] at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Architecture Frameworks have been used in many industries, including the domains of industrial automation / manufacturing / production management, business information systems (of various kinds), telecommunications and defence. Part of the Enterprise Architecture practice is ‘enterprise engineering’ and the practice of ‘enterprise modelling’ (or just modelling) and complete AFs describe the scope of modelling (which later can be summaised as a Modelling Framework that is part of the AF).&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One specific type of Framework is called the "Enterprise Reference Architecture." According to Bernus &amp; Noran (2010):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several proposals emerged in those two decades – e.g. [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]] (Williams 1994), [[CIMOSA]] (CIMOSA Association 1996), ARIS (Scheer 1999), GRAI-GIM ([[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts]], 1987), and the IFIP-IFAC Task Force, based on a thorough review of these as well as their proposed generalisation (Bernus and Nemes, 1994) developed [[GERAM]] (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999) which then became the basis of ISO15704:2000 “Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies”...&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Business Architecture Working Group ===
{{main article|OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group}}
The Business Architecture Special Interest Group (BASIG) is a working group on business architecture of the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG).

=== Business strategy ===
In the 2006 article "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT," [[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] explained the relation between business architecture, business activities and business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schelp, Joachim, and [[Robert Winter (business theorist)|Robert Winter]]. "Language communities in enterprise architecture research." ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology.'' ACM, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We use the concept of '[[Business Architecture]]’ to structure the responsibility over business activities prior to any further effort to structure individual aspects (processes, data, functions, organization, etc.). The business architecture arranges the responsibilities around the most important business activities (for instance production, distribution, marketing, et cetera) and/or economic activities (for instance manufacturing, assembly, transport, wholesale, et cetera) into domains &lt;ref&gt;[[Gerrit Versteeg (enterprise architect)|Versteeg, Gerrit]] &amp; [[Harry Bouwman|Bouwman]] (2006, p. 92), as cited in: McClure, Mark. ''[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7665/2007-mcclure.pdf Framing a Collaborative Enterprise Architecture Governance Program within the Context of Service-Oriented Software Systems Development].'' University of Oregon Applied Information Management Program, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Versteeg &amp; Bouwman also stipulated, that "the perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common: information architecture, technical architecture, process architecture. The various parts (functions, concepts and processes) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures. It pre-structures other architectures. Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design. We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study."&lt;ref name="GHV 2006"&gt;Versteeg, G &amp; H. Bouwman. "Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT." ''Information Systems Frontiers'' 8 (2006) pp. 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010s ==
[[File:EtomLevel0.png|thumb|360px|[[Business Process Framework (eTOM)]], Level 0 overview of the eTOM processes, 2010.]]

=== Handbooks ===
In the 2010 the first handbooks on Business architecture were published. In the US William M. Ulrich and Neal McWhorter of the OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group published the "Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Business Transformation," in 2010.

In 2012 in Britain the business consultants Jonathan Whelan and Graham Meaden published their "Business Architecture: A Practical Guide."&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"&gt;Meaden &amp; Whelan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
In several sources in the exact definition of "business architecture" is under review. InN 2008 Jeff Scott had commented in this matter: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Interest in business architecture is growing dramatically. During the past two years both IT and business leaders have joined the discussion about the need for a well-defined business architecture. Though there is a great deal of discussion, there is little consensus about what business architecture is, how it should be pursued, and what value it delivers. Business architects in IT as well as in the business have started developing business-unit-wide and enterprise-wide business architectures, learning as they go. Their ultimate goals are to improve business decision-making and facilitate better alignment between IT and the business units it supports. Architecture teams that want to play a leading role in business architecture development must start soon or be left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Scott (2008), ''Business Architecture’s Time Has Come,'' Forrester Publication. (summary at ''forrester.com'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other sources came to the same conclusion, that over the years many different definitions of business architecture have been proposed&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whittle &amp; Myrick (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerrie Holley, Ali Arsanjani. ''100 SOA Questions: Asked and Answered,'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Malik, "[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickmalik/archive/2012/09/11/many-flawed-definitions-of-business-architecture.aspx Many (flawed) Definitions of Business Architecture]," ''blogs.msdn.com,'' 11 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable definitions have described business architecture as: 
:* "A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands" - [[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]], 2008&lt;ref name="OMG 2008"&gt;[[OMG Business Architecture Working Group]]. "Business Architecture Working Group," at ''bawg.omg.org,'' Oct 10, 2008.  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081006052814/http://bawg.omg.org/ archive.org, Oct. 10, 2008]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes information, as well as the interaction between these concepts." - TOGAF, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[[The Open Group]]. ''TOGAF™ Version 9 Foundation Study Guide,'' 2009, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* "The formal representation and active management of business design." - SOA Consortium, EA2010 Working group on Business Architecture, 2010&lt;ref name="SC 2010"&gt;SOA Consortium, EA2010 working group. ''[http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf Business Architecture; The Missing Link between Business Strategy and Enterprise Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130051908/http://www.soa-consortium.org/EA2010_Business_Architecture.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}.'' Copyright by OMG, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion kept going. [[John Zachman]] (2012) declared in this matter, that "a lot of people define business architecture differently (I know a lot of people who have a lot of different opinions and definitions for business architecture). Not too many people do business architecture, at least not in a comprehensive and definitive fashion (in my estimation)..."&lt;ref name="JAZ 2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;!--
=== Approaches ===
--&gt;

== Roots in various academic domains ==
Ideas and definitions about business architecture originate from different academic sub disciplines, where the concept of business architecture and methods and techniques are developing in numerous initiatives. A selection of related subfields:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
:* [[Organizational theory]] inspired by [[systems thinking]], [[cybernetics]], [[complexity science]], etc.
:* [[Systems analysis]] and [[Systems design|design]], [[system engineering]], [[business engineering]], [[business modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]]&lt;ref name="BH 2009"/&gt; etc.
:* [[Software engineering]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[information technology management]], etc.
:* [[Enterprise architecture]], [[enterprise engineering]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise modeling]],&lt;ref name="BN 2010"/&gt; [[enterprise ontology]], [[enterprise resource planning]], etc.

== Field of practice ==
Guitarte (2013) stipulated, that also different types of organizations have been active, and created a so-called "business architecture vortex.” He listed four types:

:* Influencers: Academe, Various authors, [[Cutter Consortium|Cutter]], [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], Media, [[Gartner]], IIR
:* Third-party vendors: Metastorm, [[IBM]], [[Sparx Systems|Sparx]], [[Troux Technologies|Troux]], [[MEGA International Srl.|Mega]], BrainstormCentral, Pega, BAI, [[Business Process Management Initiative|BPMI]], Progress
:* Communities of practice: [[Business Architecture Guild]], Business Architecture Society, BAA, BizArchCommunity, BAA, IIBA, [[Project Management Institute|PMI]], AOGEA
:* Standards-setting bodies: [[ISO]], BPMN, [[Object Management Group|OMG]], MDA, BASIG, [[The Open Group]], [[TOGAF]], BPM/SOA, BEI&lt;ref name="AG 2013"&gt;Andrew Guitarte, "[http://www.buildingbusinesscapability.com/presentations/2013/1252.pdf Business Architecture Trends &amp; Methods]." (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Guitarte commented, that "influencers led followed by communities of practice and standards-setting bodies; vendors followed. Conflicting ideas provide opportunity to define the future of business architecture profession."&lt;ref name="AG 2013"/&gt;

== Management interests ==
Surveys have reported a growing interest of management in business architecture, as well as on universities:
* In 2004 [[Jaap Schekkerman]] already suggested that "Enterprise Architecture was ranked near the top of the list of most important issues considered by CEO’s and CIO’s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaap Schekkerman]], ''How to Survive in the Jungle of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks: Creating Or Choosing an Enterprise Architecture Framework,'' 2004. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venereum in the House of Sallust.jpg|thumb|A [[venereum]] in the House of Sallust]] 
The '''House of Sallust''' is a [[domus]] or elite residence in the ancient Roman city of [[Pompeii]]. The oldest parts of the house have been dated to the 4th century BC, but the main expansions were built in the 2nd century BC. The long history of this structure provides important evidence about the development of elite residences in Pompeii. The house is located on the east side of the Via Consolare. It received its modern name from an election notice placed on the facade, recommending Gaius Sallustius for office. An alternative name is the House of A. Cossus Libanus, from a seal found in the ruins.

It was first excavated between 1805 and 1809, was damaged by a bomb in [[World War II]], and was restored in 1970.

==History==
[[File:Plan of House of Sallust.JPG|thumb|A rough plan of the House of Sallust.]]
The House of Sallust was originally a single [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] house from the Samnite Period, and was made of Tufa blocks. It had six shops on its west side and an entrance corridor in the middle. This went through into the atrium with [[compluvium]] and impluvium. The atrium contained two alae, four cubicula, a [[tablinum]], four other rooms and a garden.
[http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/ml_gothein_history_garden_art_design/pompeii_domestic_villa_gardens]&lt;ref&gt;Pompeii and the domestic garden&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, we can see the addition of new features, such as the [[peristyle]] (a colonnaded garden) which was imported from Greece in the 2nd century BC, and the second atrium, which also became popular around this time. It eventually expanded to use almost all the garden space, but its development was cut short due to the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">[[File:Ukposter.jpg|thumb|Poster in the Ukrainian language about the beginning of the indigenization policy ([[Korenizatsiya]] in Russian, meaning "indigenization", literally "putting down roots") in [[Soviet Ukraine]] (see: ''[[Ukrainization]]''). The text translates to: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army]] commanders, and the defense of Soviet Ukraine will be ensured." First published in the USSR in 1921.]]
'''Indigenization''' is the act of making something more native; transformation of some service, idea, etc. to suit a local culture, especially through the use of more indigenous people in [[Public administration|administration]], employment, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term is primarily used by [[anthropologist]]s to describe what happens when locals take something from the outside and make it their own (e.g. [[Africanization]], [[Americanization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenize|title=Definition of INDIGENIZE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In world politics, indigenization is the process in which non-Western cultures redefine their native land for better use in agriculture and [[mass marketing]]. Due to [[imperialism]] and the [[Motivation|impetus]] to [[Modernization theory|modernize]], many countries and cultures invoked Western values and ideals of [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] and [[independence]] in the past. But now, along with experiencing their own share of cultural confidence, they desire to revert to their traditional cultures and values.

However, the word indigenization is also used in almost the opposite sense, it means: to increase local participation in or ownership of, to indigenize foreign-owned companies, or to adapt (beliefs, customs, etc.) to local ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/indigenize|title=the definition of indigenize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the word ===
The word indigenization first appeared in a paper about studies conducted in India about [[Christian mission]]aries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/94473?redirectedFrom=indigenization+#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used to describe the process of making Churches indigenous in [[South India|southern India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=J. F|year=1951|title=The Indian Research Series|url=http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1951-00/1951-02-001-butler.pdf|journal=The Occasional Bulletin|volume=11|issue=2|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it spread to [[The Economist]] where it was used to describe managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named ''English Language in West Africa,'' where it was used to describe the adoption of English. Indigenization is often used to describe the adoption of [[colonialism|colonial]] culture in [[Africa]] because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== History of the use ===
Throughout history, the process of making something indigenous has taken different forms. Other words that describe similar processes of making something local are [[Africanization]], [[wikt:localization|Localization]], [[Glocalization]], and [[Americanization]]. However, these terms describe a specific case of the process of making something indigenous. These terms may be rejected in favor of the more general term of indigenization because the others may have too narrow of a scope. For example, [[Christianization]] was a form of indigenization by converting areas and groups to follow [[Christianity]].

== Types ==

=== Linguistics ===
In this context, indigenization is used to refer to how a language is adopted in a certain area such as [[African French|French in Africa]]. The term is used to describe the process of conveying a certain region’s culture and concepts in terms of the language that is being introduced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A common case where a language needed to be indigenized was in Africa where the ex-colonizer's language required some references to [[Religion in Africa|African religion]] and [[Culture of Africa|culture]], even though in the original language there was no vocabulary for this. As this process is being carried out, there is usually a [[metalanguage]] created that is some combination of the original language and the introduced language. This language shares cultural aspects from both cultures, making it distinct and usually done in order to understand the foreign language in the context of the local region. Sometimes the term indigenization is preferred over other terms such as [[Africanization]] because it carries no negative connotations and does not imply any underlying meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African Palimpsest : Indigenization of Language in the West African Europhone Novel|last=Zabus|first=Chantal|publisher=Rodopi|year=1991|isbn=9051831978|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
Indigenization is seen as the process of changing someone to a person of more corroboration towards their surroundings. A large part of that process is the economy of said surroundings. Indigenization has played an important part in the economic roles of society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Thanks to The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]], black people were offered a more distinguished position in the economy, with foreigners having to give up 51% of their business to black people.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-acts-against-foreign-business-owners|title=Zimbabwe acts against foreign business owners {{!}} The National|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Open Door Policy|China’s Open Door Policy]] is seen as a big step of indigenization for their economy, as it is opening its doors to the western world. This allowed different cultures to experience one another and opened up China’s businesses to the western world as well, which set [[China]] forth in a sort of [[Microeconomic reform|economic reform]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Kwok|year=2006|title=The Politics of Indigenization: A Case Study of Development of Social Work in China|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3161&amp;context=jssw|journal=The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|volume=33|issue=2|pages=63–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social work ===
Another big part of indigenization is [[social work]], although it is unknown what the actual process is when social forces come into place.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Indigenization is seen by some as less of a process of naturalization and more of a process of culturally relevant social work. While indigenization wasn’t the standard, it was a way to not only accustom others to a surrounding point of view, but also helping understand both where these people came from and also their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Kim-yee|year=2014|title=Importing Western Values Versus Indigenization: Social work practice with Ethnic Minorities in Hong Kong|url=|journal=International Social Work|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0020872813500804|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that while the indigenization of social work may work when it comes to foreigners being brought into Western cultures, it would not work as well non-Western cultures were those that were being taken in. They also argue that Western cultures seem to exaggerate the similarities and differences between Western and foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenization Measures and Multinational Corporations in Africa|last=Ijalaye|first=David|publisher=Oceana Publications|year=1978|isbn=9024727332|location=New York|pages=41|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act ===
The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]] was passed by [[Parliament of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe Parliament]] in 2008. It is a set of regulations meant to regulate businesses, compelling foreign-owned firms to sell 51-percent of their business to blacks over the following years. Five-year jail terms are assigned to foreigners who do not submit an indigenisation plan or use locals as fronts for their businesses.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The intent of the law is to ensure the country’s black members fulfill a more prominent role in the economy. Controversy rose over this intent, with opponents stating that the law will scare away foreign investors. Indigenous [[Demographics of Zimbabwe|Zimbabweans]] are defined as "any person who, before the 18th April, 1980 [when [[Zimbabwe]] gained independence from [[British Empire|Britain]]], was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race, and any descendant of such person, and includes any company, association, syndicate or partnership of which indigenous Zimbabweans form the majority of the members or hold the controlling interest".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This provision allows the minister of youth development, indigenization and economic empowerment, [[Saviour Kasukuwere]], to keep a database of indigenous businesses from which foreign interest can pick partners from. At the time of the law passing, the ruling party in Zimbabwe was [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|Zanu-PF]], lead by the president [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Saviour Kasukuwere is a member of this party, which brought up skepticism among economists who speculated that the database may be used by the party to give its allies the best deals. Mr. Kasukuwere stated that he will implement the law regardless of objections.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The '''Institute of Museum and Library Services''' ('''IMLS''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the United States federal government established in 1996.  It is the main source of federal support for [[libraries]] and [[museums]] within the United States, having the mission to "create strong libraries and museums that connect people with information and ideas."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.imls.gov/about-us |title=About Us |date=2015-02-19 |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916195520/http://www.imls.gov/about-us |archivedate=2015-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMLS "works at the national level and in coordination with state and local organizations to sustain heritage, culture, and knowledge; enhance learning and innovation; and support professional development." Their vision is "a democratic society where communities and individuals thrive with broad public access to knowledge, cultural heritage, and lifelong learning."&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; In fiscal year 2015, IMLS had a budget of $228 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imls.gov/imls-admin/budget-and-performance |title=Budget and Performance |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024093345/https://www.imls.gov/imls-admin/budget-and-performance |archivedate=2016-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its other responsibilities, the IMLS annually awards the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]], the nation's highest award given for community service by libraries and museums.

IMLS is located at 955 L’Enfant Plaza North, SW, Suite 4000, Washington, D.C.  20024-2135.

==History==
IMLS was established by the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) on September 30, 1996, which includes the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] and the Museum Services Act. This act was reauthorized in 2003 and again in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imls.gov/about-us/legislation-budget/timeline |title=Timeline |date=2015-02-19 |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024093451/https://www.imls.gov/about-us/legislation-budget/timeline |archivedate=2016-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law combined the [[Institute of Museum Services]], which had been in existence since 1976, and the Library Programs Office, which had been part of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] since 1956.  Lawmakers at that time saw “great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imls.gov/imlsat20 |title=IMLS At 20 |last= |first= |date= |website=IMLS History |publisher= |access-date=October 17, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012191236/https://www.imls.gov/imlsat20 |archivedate=October 12, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As amended, MLSA authorizes IMLS to promote improvements in library services; to facilitate access to resources in libraries; to encourage resource sharing among libraries; to support museums in fulfilling their public service and educational roles; to encourage leadership and innovation to enhance museum services; to assist museums in the conservation of America's heritage; to support museums in achieving the highest standards of management and service to the public; and to support resource sharing among museums, libraries and other organizations. MLSA also authorizes IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The act comes up for reauthorization every 5 years. Adjustment to the act have been made over time.&lt;ref&gt;Mjoseth, Jeaninne, Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, 3rd ed, "Institute of Museum and Library Services", Aug 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Representative [[Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) recommended that the federal government not fund MLSA and "shift the federal agency’s responsibilities to the private sector in his 2015 fiscal year budget resolution"&lt;ref name="House budget proposal dismisses role of IMLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/news/node/10177 |title=House budget proposal dismisses role of IMLS |publisher=American Library Association |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=Wright, Jazzy |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410020143/http://www.ala.org/news/node/10177 |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "funded at the state and local level and augmented significantly by charitable contributions from the private sector".&lt;ref name="The Path to Prosperity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf |title=The Path to Prosperity |publisher=House Budget Committee |date=April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=Paul Ryan |page=51 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424174807/http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consolidation==
Following a proposal by President [[George W. Bush]], the activities of the [[National Commission on Libraries and Information Science]] was consolidated under IMLS, along with some of the activities of the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], in order to create a unified body for federal support of library and information policy.&lt;ref&gt;”IMLS Gets Feedback on NCLIS Consolidation”, “American Libraries”, 8(8):  8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The consolidation took effect in early 2008.

== Leadership ==
When Congress passed the Library Services and Technology Act in 1996, it moved library responsibilities out of the Department of Education and created the IMLS as new agency. The act stipulated that the agency maintain a rotating directorship starting with the former director of the Institute of Museum Services for a four-year term. In the fifth year, the directorship would pass to a representative from the field of library and information science.

==Research==
The Office of Impact Assessment and Learning (OIAL) "supports the agency in its efforts to create strong libraries and museums that connect people to information and ideas."  OIAL performs three key functions: policy research, evaluations, and survey and data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation |title=Research &amp; Evaluation |date=2015-02-20 |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024092708/https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation |archivedate=2016-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey and data collection===
*''Data Catalog'' – Data relating to grants administration and data about libraries, museums, and related organizations.
*''Public Library Survey'' (PLS) – collects data from 9,000 public library systems and 17,000 public library outlets.
*''State Library Agency Survey'' (SLAA) – provides descriptive data about state libraries.

'''Intercultural communicative competence in computer-supported collaborative learning''' is the application of [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) to provide intercultural communicative competence (ICC).

==Essential ideas connecting CSCL and ICC==
One of the well-known applications of [[Computer-supported collaborative learning|CSCL]] is telecollaboration involving the use of the Internet or other [[computer-mediated communication]] tools by internationally dispersed students in order to foster the development of foreign language linguistic and [[intercultural competence]] in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. (2003). Linguistic perspectives on the development of intercultural competence in telecollaboration. ''Language Learning &amp;amp; Technology'', ''7''(2), 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the technological mediation used in telecollaborative study, participants on each side of the network have cost-effective access to "[[Languaculture]]."

Numerous models and theories of [[intercultural communication]] have been proposed, including [[communication accommodation]] (Giles, 1973), cultural convergence (Barnett &amp; [[D. Lawrence Kincaid|Kincaid]], 1983), identity or [[face negotiation theory]] (Ting-Toomey, 1993), and [[interactive acculturation]] (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, &amp; Senecal, 1997). A model of ICC (or IC) widely accepted in foreign language education has been proposed by Byram.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, M. (1997). Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence. Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; This model includes five components, all of which are needed for a student to become an "intercultural speaker":

# attitudes: ''curiosity and openness, readiness to suspend disbelief about other cultures and belief about one's own.''
# knowledge: ''of social group and their products and practices in one's own and in one's interlocutor's country, and one of the general processes of societal and individual interaction.''
# skills of interpreting and relating: ''ability to interpret a document or event from another culture, to explain it and relate it to documents from one's own.''
# skills of discovery and interaction: ''ability to acquire new knowledge of a culture and cultural practices and the ability to operate knowledge, attitudes and skills under the constraints of real-time communication and interaction.''
# critical awareness or an evaluative orientation: ''an ability to evaluate critically and on the basis of explicit criteria perspectives, practices and products in one's own and other cultures and countries.''

==CSCL affordances&lt;!-- what is this supposed to mean? --&gt; for ICC==
The benefits as well as the challenges of utilizing CSCL as a means of intercultural communication must be considered. Research in the field indicates several advantages, including:

* Helps build [[Negotiation#The pervasive impact of culture on international negotiations.5B26.5D|negotiation]] strategies&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. &amp;amp; Muller-Hartmann, A. (2003). Teachers as intercultural learners: Negotiating German-American telecollaboration along the institutional fault line. ''The Modern Language Journal,'' '''87''' (1), 71–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improves [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|EFL]] and ESL language skills&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promotes the idea that learning is fun because:
** it's a novel way to communicate&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
** students view virtual worlds as places where they can take risks and "try on" different faces&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Positively impacts the development of intercultural competence&lt;ref&gt;Belz, J. (2003). Linguistic perspectives on the development of intercultural competence in telecollaboration. ''Language Learning &amp;amp; Technology'', ''7''(2), 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

** This, in turn, fosters cognitive development as participants' new-found awareness of different perspectives increases their flexibility  
* Takes advantage of communication media's increased social sensitivity (compared with printed or electronic one-way broadcast media&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, T. (1997).

Retrieved from [http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges for ICC within CSCL environments==
However, despite the potential advantages of using CSCL to overcome the barriers of face-to-face prejudice, develop social skills, and increase cognitive flexibility, simply adding CSCL to a communicative situation does not automatically foster [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] nor resolve intercultural issues. In fact, research has indicated that some problems are made worse (or at least more obvious) by moving to a computer-supported medium:

* Face-to-face conversations always ebb and flow, but in the CSCL world, this ebb and flow can be misinterpreted, depending on the intercultural context, as boredom or even anger.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even in a synchronous CSCL environment, people are often not as fully engaged because of physical isolation; consistent and constant clarification of meaning, similar to the interactive process of [[semantic interoperability]] in computer systems, is necessary, a requirement which prolongs tasks and projects.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, T. (1997). Social interaction and the new media: The construction of communicative contexts. ''Nordicom Review'', ''2'', 63–75. Retrieved from [http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf http://www.nordicom.gu.se/common/publ_pdf/5_001_012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* CSCL affords many choices among tools: from asynchronous email and discussion boards to synchronous chat and VoIP to visually present web cams and virtual worlds. However, when intercultural differences are considered, the tools are less interchangeable, and thus tool selection is more constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misunderstandings, including those which arise from intercultural differences, are not recognized (and cleared up) as quickly in CSCL environments.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Success depends on people feeling part of the group; bonding and [[interpersonal ties]] are more difficult to achieve at a distance, particularly with abstract and lengthy messages, which may be appropriate in some cultures but inappropriate in others.&lt;ref&gt;Wegeriff, R. (1998). The social dimensions of asynchronous learning networks. ''Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks'', ''2''(1), 34–49. Retrieved from [http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v2n1/v2n1_wegerif.asp http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v2n1/v2n1_wegerif.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Success depends on trust-building which is difficult to achieve in a computer-mediated environment which may be conducive only to selected intercultural contexts (for example, lack of self-disclosure is viewed as a positive trait in some cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because cultural preferences for activity, structure, and style vary among cultures, the creation of learning events requires careful consideration and additional design time on the part of the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt;]
*  Hences comes the need for developing a critical crosscultural communicative competence in English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) preservice teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sehlaoui, A. S. (2001). Developing Cross-cultural Communicative Competence in Preservice ESL/EFL Teachers: A Critical Perspective Language, Culture, and Curriculum Journal, Vol. 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Without a facilitator to invigorate conversations and engage participants, communication is likely to decrease in CSCL environments due to the extra effort and extended timeframe required by the additional layer of intercultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, T. (2000). Making sense of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC): Conversations as genres, CMC Systems as genre ecologies. In Nunaker, J.F. &amp;amp; Sprague, R.

Retrieved from [http://www.mediensprache.net/archiv/pubs/2862.pdf http://www.mediensprache.net/archiv/pubs/2862.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical implications and suggestions for implementation==
Although there are many benefits to using CSCL, especially in language learning contexts, teachers must approach its adoption with clear goals and objectives. Teachers should select the CSCL [[Medium (communication)|medium]] with careful consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidman, N., Te'eni, D. &amp;amp; Schwartz, D. (2008). Discourse-based technology support for intercultural communication in multinationals. ''Journal of Communication Management'', ''12''(3), 263–272. {{doi|10.1108/13632540810899434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning#Available Tools|tool]] selection is critical since different media work well for some people and not for others.&lt;ref&gt;Walther, J. (1997). Group and interpersonal effects in international computer-mediated collaboration. ''Human Communication Research'', ''23''(3), 342–369. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, instructors need to be familiar with concepts of intercultural communication in addition to CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Joia, L. (2002). Analysing a web-based e-commerce learning community: A case study in Brazil. ''Internet Research'', ''12''(4), 305–317.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of its application CSCL is not appropriate for short-term projects,&lt;ref&gt;Veermans, M. &amp;amp; Cesareni, D. (2005). The nature of the discourse in web-based Collaborative Learning Environments: Case studies from four different countries. ''Computers &amp;amp; Education'', ''45''(3), 316–336.&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers should expect to spend a considerable amount of extra management time in roles such as mediators, monitors, and facilitators.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who have little extra time should not implement CSCL.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorio, M. &amp;amp; van Veen, K. (2006). Strategies to build a cross-national virtual world. ''AACE Journal'', ''14''(2), 103–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

R. (2005). Negotiating sociocultural and institutional contexts: The case of Spanish-American telecollaboration. ''Language and Intercultural Communication'', ''5''(1), 40–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, CSCL may prove to be a superior tool through which teachers can foster greater understanding between their students and members of other cultures.

A '''''kaunakes'''''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes spelled '''''kaunakès''''', as in [[French language|French]].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:καυνάκης|καυνάκης]]}} or {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γαυνάκης|γαυνάκης]]}}; {{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|𒌆𒄖𒅘𒆪}} &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TÚG&lt;/sup&gt;GU-NAK-KU&lt;/small&gt;}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.enacademic.com/γαυνάκης/el/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/cad_g.pdf|title=Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, Volume 5|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''persis''''' was a [[wool]]en [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]] associated with [[Ancient Near East|ancient]] [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]. It was woven in a tufted pattern suggesting overlapping petals or feathers, either by sewing tufts onto the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric.

==Background==
The origin of this dress is traced to the [[Sumer|Sumerian civilization]] which existed even before 4,000 BC. The [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] between 2,700 and 2,350 BC was marked by high culture. The dress was a [[unisex]] garment which both men and women wore. The skirt was made from [[sheepskin]] and was worn with the skin turned inside and with tufts ornamented like a toothed-comb over the wool. It was used in the form of a [[wrapper (clothing)|wraparound skirt]] tied and worn from the waist extending to the knees.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dress-clothing#ref168685|title=Dress|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Servants and soldiers wore the shortest garments, while persons of high status wore longer ones{{sfn|Tortora|Eubank|2010|p=24}} with the skirt often extending down to the ankles. The upper part of the body was either covered with another sheepskin [[cloak]] spread across the shoulders, or left bare. It was only around 2,500 BC that the sheepskin garment was replaced by a textile made of woven wool; however the tuft part of the dress was continued in the form of "sewing tufts onto the garment or by weaving loops into the fabric". The [[Greek language|Greek]] called this dress kaunakes. This type of dress is featured in sculptures and mosaics of this period.

==History==
[[File:Relief Ur-Nanshe Louvre AO2344.jpg|thumb|Votive relief of [[Ur-Nanshe]], king of [[Lagash]], Early Dynastic III (2550–2500 BC), with all figures wearing ''kaunakes'']]
In a Sumerian image dated between 2,900 and 2,600 BC, the dress was worn as a [[pagne]], which was a simple fleece pelt used as body wrap but retaining the tail part. In some images the wraparound covered the body crossed over the left shoulder. Following the discovery of weaving, kaunakes were designed with tufts of wool stitched into the cloth to "simulate the curling fleece fur".&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfa.ilstu.edu/lmlowel/THE331/Mesopotamia/review.html|title=Mesopotamia Review|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher= College of Fine Arts – Illinois State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a rustic fabric made of [[sheepskin]], camel or goat's hide fashioned in the form of a [[shawl]] or skirts called the "thick blanket" that evolved to suit the severe weather conditions of the [[Sumero-Akkadian|Sumerian and Akkadian Mesopotamian region]].&lt;ref name=Sumer&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fido.palermo.edu/servicios_dyc/publicacionesdc/vista/detalle_articulo.php?id_articulo=8302&amp;id_libro=380|title=El traje en el Próximo Oriente antiguo. Mesopotamia. Kaunakes|language=Spanish|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher= Sitio Estudiantes DC – Universidad de Palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that kaunakes, as a fashioned fleece, while not mentioned prior to 300 BC could be traced to the 400–300 BC. During the Greek period of [[Aristophanes]] the garment was made from goat’s hair or wool in the style of a weighty [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] or [[cape]]. Coptic [[Egypt]], not [[Mesopotamia]], is credited with the original design of woven tapestry with projecting long locks or strands of wool. Its manufacture evolved into kaunakes when the woven fringe design began to mirror the original fleece and fur and was shaped as a [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]]. These were worn during the winter season as a shawl over the shoulders, and during summer adapted as a skirt. Over the centuries many designs evolved with sleeves, then variants were made with cloth instead of fleece, and eventually, it evolved back to a [[cape]] sans sleeves.{{Sfn|Forbes|1971|p=9}}

[[File:Kaunakes Bactria Louvre AO31917.jpg|thumb|Kaunakes of [[Bactria]] on display in the [[Louvre]]]]
In [[Athens]], initially the dress was thought to be of [[Persia]]n origin but later it came to be identified as a [[Babylonia]]n garment, as it matched with the textile practices of the northeast from [[Mesopotamia]]. Part of the confusion arose from the naming of the garment, because the root word is linguistically closer to [[Iranian language]], rather than [[Akkadian language|Babylonian language]].{{Sfn|Miller|2004|p=154}} The dress was also used by a stage actor in a drama scene of [[Aristophanes]]' ''Wasps'' in [[Athens]], as the design of the exotic dress suited the dramatic effect in view of it being "visually distinctive", heavy and with small decorative tufts. It was the Athenians' belief that the kaunakes was of Persian origin and not from Babylon from an understanding that the dress was an exported item and could have originated from [[Anatolia]] ([[Kilikia]] or [[Phrygia]]), the [[Levant]] ([[Phoenicia]] or [[Syria]]), or Mesopotamia (Babylon), which were all part of the [[Persian Empire]] in the fifth century BC.{{Sfn|Miller|2004|p=171}}

==Purpose==
An image dated to about 3rd millennium BC from the [[Temple of Ishtar]] at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Tell Hariri]], in [[Syria]] shows kaunakes wrapped as a cloak around the shoulders of an [[alabaster]] image of a woman in a seated posture; the kaunakes is inferred as made from goat hair or wool.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.in/detail/photo/woman-sitting-wearing-kaunakes-fleece-cloak-high-res-stock-photography/479645111|title=images|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher=Getty Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2,450 BC it was a royal dress, as seen from the figures in prayer mode in Mesopotamia. In this, the dress was formed with woolly tufts laid successively in horizontal lines and suspended vertically. It was fashioned generally as a woman's dress, adorning the left arm and shoulder with the right side exposing the skin and the breast.&lt;ref name=Worn&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/statuette-praying-figure|title=A traditional garment worn in an unusual way|accessdate=30 November 2015|publisher= Louvre Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leda and the Swan''' is a story and subject in art from [[Greek mythology]] in which the god [[Zeus]], in the form of a [[swan]], seduces the mortal woman [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]. According to later Greek mythology, Leda bore [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Castor and Polydeuces|Polydeuces]], children of Zeus, while at the same time bearing [[Castor and Polydeuces|Castor]] and [[Clytemnestra]], children of her husband [[Tyndareus]], the King of [[Sparta]]. In the [[W. B. Yeats]] version, it is subtly suggested that Clytemnestra, although being the daughter of Tyndareus, has somehow been traumatized by what the swan has done to her mother (see below).  According to many versions of the story, Zeus took the form of a swan and seduced Leda on the same night she slept with her husband King [[Tyndareus]]. In some versions, she laid two eggs from which the children hatched.&lt;ref&gt;The idea that the semen of more than one male might influence pregnancy, a feature in the origin myth of [[Theseus]], is called [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]]; it retained scientific followers until the late nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions, Helen is a daughter of [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], the goddess who personified the disaster that awaited those suffering from the pride of [[Hubris]].

The subject was rarely seen in the large-scale sculpture of antiquity, although a representation of Leda in sculpture has been attributed in modern times to [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheus]] (''compare illustration, below left''); small-scale sculptures survive showing both reclining and standing poses,&lt;ref&gt;Bull p. 167. See for example a marble relief with the Swan, grasping the back of Leda's neck with his beak, excavated in Argos, [[Pelopennese]], Greece, from 50–100 AD [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00102/AN00102484_001_l.jpg in the British Museum]; See External links for other examples&lt;/ref&gt; in [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]s and [[engraved gem]]s, rings, and terracotta oil lamps. Recently, an ancient fresco depicting Leda and the Swan was found at the Pompeii archeological site in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fresco-erotic-pompeii-leda-and-swan-intl/index.html|title=Ancient erotic fresco uncovered in Pompeii ruins|date=2018-11-20|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the literary renditions of [[Ovid]] and [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fulgentius|first1=Fabuis Planciades|authorlink1=The|title=The Fable of the Swan and Leda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73mJIuYfmzEC&amp;pg=PA78|website=Google Books|publisher=Ohio State University Press|accessdate=24 January 2016|page=78|isbn=9780814201626|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a well-known myth through the Middle Ages, but emerged more prominently as a classicizing theme, with [[erotic art|erotic overtones]], in the Italian Renaissance.

==Eroticism==
[[Image:Leda and Zeus (Swan).jpg|thumb|left|230px|''Leda and the Swan'', Roman marble possibly reflecting a lost work by [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheos]]; restored ([[Prado]])]]

The subject undoubtedly owed its sixteenth-century popularity to the paradox that it was considered more acceptable to depict a woman in the act of copulation with a swan than with a man.  The earliest depictions show the pair love-making with some explicitness—more so than in any depictions of a human pair made by artists of high quality in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Bull p 167&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leda mosaic crop.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A [[mosaic]] from [[Cyprus]] (c. 3rdC AD)]]The fate of the erotic album ''[[I Modi]]'' some years later shows why this was so. The theme remained a dangerous one in the Renaissance, as the fates of the three best known paintings on the subject demonstrate.  The earliest depictions were all in the more private medium of the [[old master print]], and mostly from Venice.  They were often based on the extremely brief account in the ''Metamorphoses'' of [[Ovid]] (who does not imply a rape), though [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] had both a Roman sarcophagus and an [[engraved gems|antique carved gem]] of the subject, both with reclining Ledas.&lt;ref&gt;Bull p167&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known explicit Renaissance depiction is one of the many [[woodcut]] illustrations to ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', a book published in [[Venice]] in 1499.  This shows Leda and the Swan making love with gusto, despite being on top of a triumphal car, being pulled along and surrounded by a considerable crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-books/HP/hyp166.htm Page 166 – Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An engraving dating to 1503 at the latest, by [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], also shows the couple in [[coitus]], but in deserted countryside.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Palumba leda swan.jpg|Photo of the print]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another engraving, certainly from Venice and attributed by many to [[Giulio Campagnola]], shows a love-making scene, but there Leda's attitude is highly ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodkinprints.co.uk/product.php?id=38 |title=Leda and the Swan |publisher=Bodkin Prints |first=Giulio |last=Campagnola |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413192242/http://www.bodkinprints.co.uk/product.php?id=38 |archivedate=2013-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not a woodcut, as Bull (p169) wrongly says (see Hind BM catalogue, The Illustrated [[Bartsch]] etc); nor is his view of Leda's expression the only one.&lt;/ref&gt; Palumba made another engraving, perhaps in about 1512, presumably influenced by Leonardo's sketches for his earlier composition, showing Leda seated on the ground and playing with her children.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Palumba ledafamily.jpg|British Museum copy]]; [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Poets_Lovers_Heroes/lovers_05_51.623.3.R.asp The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Special Exhibitions: Poets, Lovers, and Heroes in Italian Mythological Prints&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also significant depictions in the smaller decorative arts, also private media. [[Benvenuto Cellini]] made a medallion, now in Vienna, early in his career, and [[Antonio Abondio]] one on the [[obverse]] of a medal celebrating a Roman [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/international/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=66251&amp;Orient=Verso Abondio, NGA Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In painting==
[[Image:Leda and the Swan 1505-1510.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Leda and the Swan'', copy by [[Cesare da Sesto]] after a lost original by [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], 1515–1520, Oil on canvas, [[Wilton House]], England.]]
[[File:Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Leda and the Swan'' by [[Correggio]]]]
[[Leonardo da Vinci]] began making studies in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of Leda seated on the ground with her children. In 1508 he painted a [[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|different composition of the subject]], with a nude standing Leda cuddling the Swan, with the two sets of infant twins (also nude), and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal [[Château de Fontainebleau]] in 1625 by [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]].  However it is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the ''Spiridon Leda'', perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Leda Melzi Uffizi.jpg|image]]; Fossi, Gloria, pp. 402–3, ''Uffizi: art, history, collections'', Giunti Editore Firenze Italy, 2004, {{ISBN|88-09-03676-X}}, 9788809036765 [https://books.google.com/books?id=oNE3ofu8psMC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Spiridon+Leda&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kcWYTOuCJoWUjAex24D9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Spiridon%20Leda&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and the one at [[Wilton House]] in England (illustrated).

Also lost, and probably deliberately destroyed, is [[Michelangelo]]'s tempera [[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|painting of the pair]] making love, commissioned in 1529 by [[Alfonso d'Este]] for his palazzo in [[Ferrara]], and taken to France for the royal collection in 1532; it was at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] in 1536. Michelangelo's [[cartoon]] for the work—given to his assistant Antonio Mini, who used it for several copies for French patrons before his death in 1533—survived for over a century.  This composition is known from many copies, including an [[:commons:File:Cornelis Bos - Leda and the Swan - WGA2486.jpg|ambitious engraving]] by [[Cornelis Bos]], c. 1563; the marble sculpture by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] in the Bargello, Florence; two copies by the young [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] on his Italian voyage, and the painting after Michelangelo, ca. 1530, in the [[National Gallery, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Elfriede R. Knauer, "Leda." ''Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 11'' (1969:5–35) illustrates several copies as well as an engraving of a Roman bas-relief and examples of antique engraved gems that seem to have provided Micelangelo's inspiration and gives a full bibliography of Michelangelo's ''Leda''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Michelangelo composition, of about 1530, shows [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] tendencies of elongation and twisted pose (the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'') that were popular at the time. In addition, a sculptural group, similar to the Prado Roman group illustrated, was believed until at least the 19th century to be by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;It belonged to [[John Everett Millais]] and was included in his 2007 [[Tate Britain]] exhibition. Now London, attributed to a 16th-century "follower of Michelangelo".&lt;/ref&gt;

The last very famous Renaissance painting of the subject is [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]'s elaborate composition of c. 1530 (Berlin); this too was damaged whilst in the [[Orléans collection|collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], the Regent of France in the minority of [[Louis XV]].  His son [[Louis of Bourbon, Duke of Orléans|Louis]], though a great lover of painting, had periodic crises of conscience about his way of life, in one of which he attacked the figure of Leda with a knife. The damage has been repaired, though full restoration to the original condition was not possible.  Both the Leonardo and Michelangelo paintings also disappeared when in the collection of the French Royal Family, and are believed to have been destroyed by more moralistic widows or successors of their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Bull 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many other depictions in the Renaissance, including cycles of book illustrations to Ovid, but most were derivative of the compositions mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/ho_1982.60.11.htm Bacchiacca (Francesco d'Ubertino): Leda and the Swan | Work of Art | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The subject remained largely confined to Italy, and sometimes France – Northern versions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Bull 170.&lt;/ref&gt; After something of a hiatus in the 18th and early 19th centuries (apart from a very sensuous [[François Boucher|Boucher]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/anc_bou_leda.html Leda and the Swan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), Leda and the Swan became again a popular motif in the later 19th and 20th centuries, with many [[Symbolist]] and [[Expressionist]] treatments.

Also from that era were sculptures of the theme by [[Antonin Mercié]] and [[Max Klinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Bram, Idols of Perversity, Oxford University Press, New York, 1986 p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern art==
[[Cy Twombly]] executed an abstract version of ''Leda and the Swan'' in 1962. It was purchased by [[Larry Gagosian]] for $52.9&amp;nbsp;million at Christie's May 2017 Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/news/top-news/gagosian-pays-52-9m-twombly-fritz-cat-smashes-comic-art-record-fresh-news/ |title=Leda and the Swan |author=Cy Twombly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde filmmaker Kurt Kren along with other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionist]] movement, including [[Otto Muehl]] and [[Hermann Nitsch]], made a film-performance called ''7/64 Leda mit der Schwan'' in 1964. The film retains the classical motif, portraying, for most of its duration, a young woman embracing a swan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Photographer [[Charlie White (artist)|Charlie White]] included a portrait of Leda in his "And Jeopardize the Integrity of the Hull" series. Zeus, as the swan, only appears metaphorically.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

There is a life-sized marble statue of ''Leda and the Swan'' at the [[Jai Vilas Palace|Jai Vilas Palace Museum]] in [[Gwalior]], Northern [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jiwaji Rao Scindia Museum – Collection|url=http://jaivilasmuseum.org/Collection.html|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American artist and photographer [[Carole Harmel]] created the “Bird” series (1983), a Jean Cocteau-influenced collection of photographs that explored the “Leda and the Swan” myth in tightly cropped, voyeuristic images of a nude female and an undefinable birdlike creature hinting at intimacy.&lt;ref name="Pieszak2"&gt;Pieszak, Devonna. “Carole Harmel,” Catalogue essay, Chicago: Galerija, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bone"&gt;Bone, James. “Art Facts: a mix of media on Wells Street,” ''Chicago Reader'', March 11, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bristol Museum and Art Gallery currently exhibits Karl Weschke's ''Leda and the Swan'', painted in 1986.

The [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] in Canada has, in its permanent collection, a ceramic "Leda and the Swan" by Japanese-born American artist [[Akio Takamori]].

There is a sculpture in neon lights depicting Leda and the Swan in Berlin, near Sonnenallee metro station and the Estrel hotel, opposite Griessmühle.

==In poetry==
[[Ronsard]] wrote a poem on ''La Défloration de Lède'', perhaps inspired by the Michelangelo, which he may well have known. Like many artists, he imagines the beak penetrating Leda's vagina.&lt;ref&gt;Bull p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

"Leda and the Swan" is a sonnet by [[William Butler Yeats]] first published in the ''Dial'' in [[1923 in poetry|1923]].  Combining [[psychological realism]] with a mystic vision, it describes the swan's rape of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]. It also alludes to the [[Trojan war]], which will be provoked by the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who will be begotten by Zeus on Leda (along with [[Castor and Pollux]], in some versions of the myth). [[Clytaemnestra]], who killed her husband, [[Agamemnon]], leader of the Greeks at Troy, was also supposed to have hatched from one of Leda's eggs. The poem is regularly praised as one of Yeats's masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Yeats
|publisher=Oxford UP|year=1972|pages=363–66|isbn=978-0-19-501603-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqpspMiPWLgC&amp;pg=PA363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camille Paglia]], said the poem "could justifiably be considered the best of the twentieth century," and that "all human beings, like Leda, are caught up moment by moment in the 'white rush' of experience. For Yeats, the only salvation is the shapeliness and stillness of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paglia|first=Camille|title=Break, Blow, Burn|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=114–18|isbn=978-0-375-72539-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNZ_LYCGSPsC&amp;pg=PA114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See external links for a bas relief arranged in the position as described by Yeats.

Nicaraguan poet [[Rubén Darío]]'s 1892 poem "Leda" contains an oblique description of the rape, watched over by the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Darío|first=Rubén|author2=Andrew Hurley |author3=Greg Simon |author4=Steven F. White |title=Selected Writings: Ruben Dario|editor=Ilan Stavans|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|pages=20–21|isbn=978-0-14-303936-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJYd5G6EjpcC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.D.]] (Hilda Doolittle) also wrote a poem called "Leda" in 1919, suggested to be from the perspective of Leda. The description of the sexual action going on makes it seem almost beautiful, as if Leda had given her consent.

In the song "Power and Glory" from [[Lou Reed]]'s 1992 album ''[[Magic and Loss]]'', Reed recalls the experience of seeing his friend dying of cancer and makes reference to the myth, "I saw [[isotope]]s introduced into his lungs / trying to stop the cancerous spread / And it made me think of Leda and The Swan / and gold being made from lead"

[[Sylvia Plath]] alludes to the myth in her [[radio play]] ''Three Women'' written for the [[BBC]] in 1962. The play features the voices of three women. The first is a married woman who keeps her baby. The second is a secretary who suffers a miscarriage. The third voice, a girl who is pregnant and leaves her baby, mentions "the great swan, with its terrible look,/ Coming at me," insinuating that the girl was raped. The play is about the disconnection of women in society and challenges societal expectations of childbirth.

==In literature==
Several references to the myth are presented in novels by [[Angela Carter]], including ''Nights at the Circus'' and ''The Magic Toyshop''. In the latter novel, the myth is brought to life in the form of a performance in which a frightened young girl is forced to act as Leda in accompaniment with a large mechanical swan.

There is a reference to Leda and the Swan in [[Dorothea Benton Frank]]'s book "All Summer Long" published in 2016.

==In modern media==
A version of the Leda and the Swan story is the foundation myth in the Canadian futuristic thriller television series ''[[Orphan Black]]'' which aired over 5 seasons from 2013 to 2017. A corporation uses genetic engineering to create a series of female clones (Leda) and a series of male clones (Castor) who are also brothers and sisters clones as they derive from one mother who is a chimera with male and female genomes. The award-winning show addresses issues of the modern science of genetics, corporate greed, the ethics of human cloning, human longevity and the nature of individuality. Actress [[Tatiana Maslany]] won an Emmy award for her portrayal of all Leda clones, often together in the same scene. The television show spawned a comic book series which appeared in 2015.

==Modern censorship==
In April 2012 an art gallery in London, England, was instructed by the police to remove a modern exhibit of Leda and the Swan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/9232512/Mythical-swan-photo-taken-down-after-bestiality-fears.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Hannah | last=Furness | title='Mythical' swan photo taken down after 'bestiality' fears | date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law concerned was [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]], brought in by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of 2005–2010.

| Its significance for the biblical version of Israel's past, particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a "king of Israel" and a "[[Davidic line|house of David]]". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. Although the meaning of this phrase has  been disputed by the  minority of scholars,{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}} today it is generally accepted as a reference to [[Davidic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L.

==Other significant artifacts==

===2000 BCE===
* [[Creation myth]]s and [[flood myth]]s – recorded on the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], the [[Atra-Hasis]] tablets, the [[Enûma Eliš]], the [[Sumerian creation myth|Eridu Genesis]] and the [[Barton Cylinder]]
* [[List of ancient legal codes|Law tablets]] – ancient Near East legal tablets: [[Code of Hammurabi]], [[Laws of Eshnunna]], the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], king of [[Ur]] (ca. 2050 BCE), the [[Laws of Eshnunna]] (ca. 1930 BCE) and the codex of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] (ca. 1870 BCE).&lt;ref name="yale2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm |title=The Code of Hammurabi: Introduction |accessdate=14 September 2007 |publisher=Yale University |year=1915 |author=Charles F.

(see [[Cuneiform law]]).
* [[Hittite texts]] and [[Nuzi Texts|Nuzi texts]] (17th century BCE and later)
* [[Minoan Eruption]] – pumice found at various Tels dated to Late Bronze Age
* [[Execration texts]] – earliest references to many Biblical locations
* [[Shiphrah]] slave list – Shiphrah was one of two midwives who helped prevent the [[genocide]] of Hebrew children by the Egyptians, according to the [[Book of Exodus]] 1:15–21. The name is found in a list of [[slavery|slaves]] in Egypt during the reign of [[Sobekhotep III]]. This list is on Brooklyn 35.1446, a papyrus scroll kept in the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

===1500 BCE===
* Tombs of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]] and [[Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet]], record the earliest records of Egyptian control of Canaan. The Bible's depiction of Israel does not allow for Egyptian control over the area. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Amarna letters]] (c. 13th century BCE) – correspondence on clay tablets between the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] administration and various Middle East kings petty sub-rulers in [[Canaan]] during the New Kingdom. The Bible's depiction of Canaan at this time (the period of the Judges) contradicts these records. {{citation needed|reason=Contradiction not apparent or obvious|date=December 2015}}
* [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] is seen to possess strong similarities to [[Psalm 104]], which may be based on it.
* [[Admonitions of Ipuwer|Ipuwer Papyrus]] (probably 18th century BCE) – poem describing Egypt as afflicted by natural disasters and in a state of chaos. The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most histories of ancient Israel no longer consider it relevant to the story of Israel's emergence.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5-6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Nevertheless, Ipuwer is often put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "the river is blood" and its frequent references to servants running away. This ignores the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and the likelihood that the "river is blood" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}}
* North Wall of the [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu temple]] and the [[Papyrus Harris]] (c. 1150 BCE) – depicts the [[Ramesses III]]'s conquests in Canaan including the [[Battle of Djahy]]. This is not reflected in the Biblical history.

===10th century BCE===

*[[Pim weight]] – evidence of the use of an ancient source for the [[Book of Samuel]] due to the use of an archaic term.
*[[Khirbet Qeiyafa#Khirbet Qeiyafa inscription|Khirbet Qeiyafa pottery sherd]] – (10th century BCE) inscription – both the language it was written in and the translation are disputed.

*[[Shebna Inscription|Shebna's lintel inscription]] – (8th–7th century BCE ?) found over the [[lintel]] or doorway of a tomb, has been ascribed to [[Hezekiah]]'s comptroller [[Shebna]].
*[[King Ahaz's Seal]] (732 to 716 BCE) – Ahaz was a king of Judah but "did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his ancestor David had done" ({{bibleref2|2 Kings|16:2|NKJV}}; {{bibleref2|2 Chronicles|28:1|NKJV}}). He worshiped idols and followed pagan practices. "He even made his son pass through fire, according to the abominable practices of the nations" ({{bibleref2|2 Kings|16:3|NKJV}}). Ahaz was the son and successor of [[Jotham]].
*[[Bulla (seal)|Bullae]] (c.715–687 BCE or 716–687 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;See [[William F. Albright]] for the former and for the latter [[Edwin R. Thiele]]'s, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) 217. But [[Gershon Galil]] dates his reign to 697–642 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; (clay roundels impressed with a personal seal identifying the owner of an object, the author of a document, etc.) are, like ostraka, relatively common, both in digs and on the antiquities market. The identification of individuals named in bullae with equivalent names from the Bible is difficult, but identifications have been made with king [[Hezekiah]]&lt;ref&gt;Grena (2004), p. 26, Figs. 9 and 10&lt;/ref&gt; and his servants (????? ''avadim'' in Hebrew).

However, Israelite and Judaean History, Old Testament Library. Edited by John H. Hayes and J. Maxwell Miller. London: SCM Press, 1977 says, "Recently, Na'aman [Nadav Na'aman. "Sennacherib's 'Letter to God' on His Campaign to Judah," BASOR CCXIV (1974) 25–39] has shown conclusively that the fragment presumably mentioning Azriau king of Yaudi actually belongs to the time of Sennacherib and refers not to Azariah but to Hezekiah. In Tiglath-Pileser's annals there are two references to an Azariah (in line 123 as Az-ri-a-[u] and in line 131 as Az-r-ja-a-í) but neither of these make any reference to his country. Thus the Azriau of Tiglath-pileser's annals and Azariah of the Bible should be regarded as two different individuals. Azriau's country cannot, at the present, be determined." Na'aman separates the country (Yaudi) from the name Azriau (p. 36). Also p. 28 on line 5 where the original transcription was "[I]zri-ja-u mat Ja-u-di" he reads "ina birit misrija u mat Jaudi". However, Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament (OROT), p. 18, is less dogmatic. He says "Hence we cannot certainly assert that this Azriau (without a named territory!) is Azariah of Judah; the matter remains open and undecided for the present and probably unlikely." See Also CAH, 3:35–36."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5D5GNju1-ggC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''In Search of "Ancient Israel": A Study in Biblical Origins''] Philip R.

===1st century BCE===
*[[Western Wall]] – (c. 19 BCE) is an important Jewish religious site located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]. Just over half the wall, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, being constructed around 19 BCE by [[Herod the Great]]. The remaining layers were added from the 7th century onwards.

==Controversial==

David wanted to construct a [[Temple in Jerusalem]], but as his hands were "bloodied," he was forbidden to do so himself. The task was left to his son [[Solomon]], who completed the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] in c. 950 BCE.
*[[Uzziah of Judah#Uzziah Tablet|Uzziah Tablet]] – (8th century BCE or 30–70 CE?) controversial tablet discovered in 1931 by Professor [[Eleazar Sukenik|E.L. Sukenik]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in a Russian convent.

*[[Warren's Shaft]] – possible route corresponding to the biblical account of [[Joab]], king [[David]]'s commander, launching a secretive attack against the [[Jebusites]], who controlled [[Jerusalem]].
*[[Ivory pomegranate]]

*[[Tower of Siloam]] – ruins possibly mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Luke|13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*[[Caiaphas ossuary]]
*[[Sudarium of Oviedo]]
*[[Titulus Crucis]]
*[[Acheiropoieta]] (see [[Shroud of Turin]], [[Image of Edessa]], and the [[Veil of Veronica]]).

==Forgery==
*[[Stone Seal of Manasseh]] – Stone seal of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], King of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] c.687–642 BCE.

This list contains [[musical instrument]]s of symbolic or cultural importance within a [[nation]], [[Sovereign state|state]], [[ethnicity]], [[tribe]] or other group of people.

In some cases, national instruments remain in wide use within the nation (such as the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] ''[[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]''), but in others, their importance is primarily symbolic (such as the Welsh triple harp). Danish ethnologist Lisbet Torp has concluded that some national instrument traditions, such as the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] ''[[kantele]]'', are invented, pointing to the "influence of intellectuals and nationalists in the nationwide promotion of selected musical instruments as a vehicle for [[nationalism|nationalistic]] ideas".&lt;ref name="NI"&gt;{{cite journal|quote=One of the most interesting articles is that by Lisbet Torp about invented traditions in creating a national instrument, such as the Highland bagpipe in Scotland, the kantele in Finland, the bouzouki in Greece etc. She takes the reader through a tour of Europe, in a journey through time and space, beginning in the British Isles at the end of the 18th century with the Irish harp and the Scottish highland bagpipe. She then points to the influence of intellectuals and nationalists in the nationwide promotion of selected musical instruments as a vehicle for nationalistic ideas. The conclusion is that Denmark never developed any national instrument, though, 'at the beginning of the 20th century, the prehistoric bronze lurs were treated as a national symbol.'|title=Review of ''Musikkens Tjenere - Instrument - Forsker - Musiker'' by Mette Müller and Lisbet Torp|first=Göran|last=Grahn|journal=The Galpin Society Journal|volume=52|date=April 1999|pages=367&amp;ndash;368|jstor=842547|doi=10.2307/842547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments do not generally officially recognize national instruments; the only exceptions are the [[Paraguayan harp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study Guide for Quad City Arts' Visiting Artists Series|format=pdf|url=http://www.photohara.com/rodas.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072246/http://www.photohara.com/rodas.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-23|accessdate=December 23, 2007|date=October 2001|publisher=Quad City Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ''[[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotoworld.com/koto.html|accessdate=December 23, 2007|title=About the Japanese Koto|publisher=KotoWorld|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211010344/http://www.kotoworld.com/koto.html|archivedate=December 11, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Trinidad]]ian [[steelpan]].&lt;ref name="steelpan"/&gt;

This list compiles instruments that have been alleged to be a ''national instrument'' by any of a variety of sources, and an instrument's presence on the list does not indicate that its status as a national instrument is indisputable, only that its status has been credibly argued. Each instrument on this list has a [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] number immediately below it. This number indicates the instrument's classification within the Hornbostel-Sachs system (H-S), which organizes instruments numerically based on the manner in which they produce sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Classification of Musical Instruments: Translated from the original German by Anthony Baines and Klaus P.

Images and recordings are supplied where available; note that there are often variations within a national musical tradition, and thus the images and recordings may not be accurate in depicting the entire spectrum of the given nation's music, and that some images and recordings may be taken from a region outside the core of the national instrument's home when such distinctions have little relevance to the information present in the image and recordings. A number of countries have more than one instrument listed, each having been described as a ''national instrument'', not usually by the same source; neither the presence of multiple entries for one nation, nor for multiple nations for one instrument, on this list is reflective of active dispute in any instance. Alternative names and spellings are given. These mostly come from alternative spellings within English or alternative methods of [[transliteration|transliterating]] from a foreign language to English, such as the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] ''[[yangqin]]'', also transliterated ''yang ch'in'' and ''yang qin''. Others reflect regions or subcultures within a given nation, such as the Australian [[didgeridoo]] which is or has been called ''didjeridu'', ''yidaki'', ''yiraki'', ''magu'', ''kanbi'' and ''ihambilbilg'' in various [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]. All non-English words are italicized.

Particular issues of [[science policy]] raised by the marchers include support for [[evidence-based policymaking]],&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; as well as support for government [[Funding of science|funding for scientific research]], [[Open government|government transparency]], and government acceptance of the [[scientific consensus on climate change]] and [[Level of support for evolution|evolution]].&lt;ref name="Ahuja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossman"/&gt; The march is part of growing political activity by American scientists in the wake of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|November 2016 elections]] and the [[2017 Women's March]].&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rathernotmarch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=In Age of Trump, Scientists Show Signs of a Political Pulse |authors=Amy Harmon and Henry Fountain | date=February 6, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/science/donald-trump-scientists-politics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], a historian of science at Stanford University, stated that the March for Science was "pretty unprecedented in terms of the scale and breadth of the scientific community that's involved" and was rooted in "a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/22/historians-say-the-march-for-science-is-pretty-unprecedented/ Historians say the March for Science is 'pretty unprecedented'], ''Washington Post'' (April 22, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
=== Donald Trump ===
In 2012, [[Donald Trump]] referred to [[climate change]] as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alcorn |first=Chauncey |url=https://mic.com/articles/174536/march-for-science-dc-what-to-know-about-the-april-2017-march-on-washington |title=March for Science DC: What to know about the April 2017 march on Washington |work=Mic |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a presidential candidate,&lt;ref name="Lucky Tran"&gt;{{YouTube|ngD8l-n6Jck|Lucky Tran and the March for Science}} published on Apr 21, 2017 [[The National (TV program)|The National]] - [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; he promised to resume construction of the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and roll back [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations adopted by the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ashley |last1=Parker |first2=Coral |last2=Davenport |date=May 26, 2016 |title=Donald Trump's Energy Plan: More Fossil Fuels and Fewer Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/politics/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump's election, his [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] sought out specific [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) employees who had worked on climate change during the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/09/trump-transition-team-for-energy-department-seeks-names-of-employees-involved-in-climate-meetings/ |title=Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings |work=Washington Post |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Trump's inauguration, many climate scientists began downloading climate data from government websites that they feared might be deleted by the Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/ |title=Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump |work=Washington Post |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other actions taken or promised by the [[Trump administration]] inspired the march, including pulling out of the [[Paris Agreement]],&lt;ref name=NetburnFrontier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-scientists-politics-trump-20170209-story.html |title=Science entering a new frontier: Politics |first=Deborah |last=Netburn |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stances of his [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|Cabinet nominees]], the freezing of research grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-are-planning-the-next-big-washington-march/ |title=Scientists Are Planning the Next Big Washington March: In just two days, more than 300,000 people join a Facebook planning group |first=Brian |last=Kahn |work=Scientific American |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[gag order]] placed on scientists in the EPA regarding dissemination of their research findings.&lt;ref name="TWPGoingToProtest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/24/are-scientists-going-to-march-on-washington/ |title=Are scientists going to march on Washington? |first=Sarah |last=Kaplan |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/316023-scientists-are-planning-their-own-march-on-washington |title=Scientists are planning their own march on Washington |first=Paulina |last=Firozi |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14382514/scientists-march-on-washington-donald-trump-science-gag-order-epa |title=Scientists plan to march on Washington and run for office to fight Trump |first=Loren |last=Grush |work=[[The Verge]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[William Happer]], a possible Trump science advisor with [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|skeptical views on human caused global warming]], described an area of climate science as "really more like a cult" and its practitioners "glassy-eyed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult |title=Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult' |author=Hannah Devlin |date=February 15, 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=February 20, 2017 |via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ScienceInsider]]'' reported Trump's first budget request as "A grim budget day for U.S. science" because it contained major funding cuts to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s research and satellite programs, the EPA's Office of Research and Development, the DOE's [[Office of Science]] and energy programs, the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], and other science agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/trumps-first-budget-analysis-and-reaction |title=A grim budget day for U.S. science: analysis and reaction to Trump's plan |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |date=March 16, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International solidarity===
International sister marches were planned for countries around the world. These both supported American scientists and climate scientists more generally, and protested against other impingements on academic freedom internationally, such as government action against the [[Central European University]] in Hungary and the [[List of educational institutions closed in the 2016 Turkish purges|closure of educational institutes]] and dismissal of academics in the [[2016–17 Turkish purges]], as well as local issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/marchers-around-world-tell-us-why-theyre-taking-streets-science |title=Marchers around the world tell us why they're taking to the streets for science |date=13 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017 |newspaper=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:March for Science, Washington, DC (33825703150).jpg|thumb|Protestors march towards the Capitol Building]]
The primary march in [[Washington, D.C.]] began at 10 AM with a rally and teach-in on the grounds of the [[Washington Monument]], featuring speeches by concerned citizens alternating with scientists and engineers; including [[Denis Hayes]], co-founder of the first Earth Day in 1970 and [[Bill Nye]].&lt;ref name="planb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why people are marching for science: ‘There is no Planet B’| author1=Joel Achenbach| author2=Ben Guarino| author3=Sarah Kaplan| date=April 22, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/big-turnout-expected-for-march-for-science-in-dc/2017/04/21/67cf7f90-237f-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html|accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; No politicians spoke at the rally.&lt;ref name="planb"/&gt; At 2 PM the crowd of thousands, in spite of the steady rain throughout the day, proceeded down [[Constitution Avenue]] to 3rd Street, NW between the [[National Mall]] and the west front of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/science/march-for-science.html?_r=0|author=Nicholas St. Fleur| title=Scientists, Feeling Under Siege, March Against Trump Policies| accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="planb"/&gt;

Protesters gathered in over a hundred cities across the globe, with an estimated 70,000 participants in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and over 150,000 in several cities in [[California]].

==Reception==
[[File:Lydia Villa-Komaroff.jpg |thumb |[[Lydia Villa-Komaroff]]]]Professor [[Robert N. Proctor|Robert Proctor]] of [[Stanford University]] said that the March for Science was similar to other efforts by scientists such as [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]; however, the scale was larger because "there's a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/article146169319.html |title=Historians say the March for Science is 'pretty unprecedented' |work=idahostatesman |access-date=April 22, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:March_for_Science_2017_El_Paso.jpg |thumb|Organizers and some participants of the El Paso March for Science, April 22, 2017 |alt=Organizers and some participants of the El Paso March for Science, April 22, 2017]]

===Support===
On January 26, 2017, U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont expressed his support for the march, congratulating "those scientists and researchers who are fighting back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Firozi |first1=Paulina |title=Sanders applauds scientists 'fighting back' with planned DC march |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/316453-sanders-backs-scientists-fighting-back-with-planned-march-in-dc-science-is |work=The Hill |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Representative Bill Foster of Illinois, a physicist and the only current member of Congress with a Ph.D. in a [[natural sciences]] field, will join the march, "not as a Democratic member of Congress, but as a scientist."&lt;ref name="Gacher"&gt;Lev Gacher, [https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/05/bill-foster-scientist-congress-march/ Congress's one PhD-trained scientist will join march on Washington], ''[[Stat (website)|Stat]] (April 5, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Foster said that he viewed the march as political, but not partisan, saying, "if you see a specific policy that is inconsistent with the known principles of science, every citizen who is also a scientist should speak out."&lt;ref name="Gacher"/&gt;

In February the AAAS and other science groups announced their support for the march.&lt;ref name="KaplanNye"/&gt; [[Rush Holt Jr.]], the chief executive officer of the AAAS, expressed support for scientist involvement in politics.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Holt also emphasizes the importance of "appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population".&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

{{quote|"What’s so interesting is it’s the first time, I think, anybody can point to in decades where there has been a spontaneous effort to defend the idea of science.

===Criticism===
The march received a torrent of criticism from [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] publications for the perceived [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] bias and orientation of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/21/march-science-comes-under-microscope-over-left-til/]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scientists voiced concerns over the march. [[Sylvester James Gates]] warned that "such a politically charged event might send a message to the public that scientists are driven by ideology more than by evidence".&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flam |first1=Faye |authorlink1=Faye Flam |title=Why Some Scientists Won't March for Science |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-07/why-some-scientists-won-t-march-for-science |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |work=[[Bloomberg View]] |date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change denier [[William Happer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Devlin, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'], ''The Guardian'', February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "there's no reason to assume the president is against science" while regarding the march.&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome/&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Robert S. Young]] argued that the march will "reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends" and that it would be better for scientists to "march into local civic groups, churches, county fairs and, privately, into the offices of elected officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Robert S. |authorlink1=Robert S. Young |title=A Scientists' March on Washington Is a Bad Idea |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/a-scientists-march-on-washington-is-a-bad-idea.html |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Nisbet writing for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine right after the first march in 2017, states that it isn't the least educated but the "best educated and most scientifically literate who are prone to biased reasoning and false beliefs about contentious science issues". In his opinion this will mean that the March will only deepen "partisan differences, while jeopardizing trust and impartiality and credibility of scientists". Regardless of assurances by the March's organizers that this would be non-political, it clearly was. Nisbet feels that confidence in scientists is strong, and they should "use this capital wisely and effectively".&lt;ref name="Nisbet 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=The March for Science: Partisan Protests Put Public Trust in Scientists at Risk |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to criticism surrounding the political nature of the march, meteorologist and columnist [[Eric Holthaus]] wrote that the scientific field "has always been political" and referred to the example of Galileo Galilei's [[Galileo affair|confrontation with the political order]]. Holthaus wrote that the scientists must also protest when "truth itself is being called into question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holthaus |first1=Eric |title=The March for Science Isn't 'Political'—It's a Defense of Basic Truth |url=https://psmag.com/the-march-for-science-isnt-political-it-s-a-defense-of-basic-truth-4aaf89ebbd4b#.lkbs4lmc6 |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |work=Pacific Standard |date=February 1, 2017 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing science’s role in policy and government, Rush Holt points out a [[fallacy]] in viewing science and politics as philosophically incompatible: "The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you’re interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there’s a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

San Francisco Lead Organizer Kristen Ratan debated [[Jerry Coyne]] on [[KQED |KQED's]] Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ww2.kqed.org/forum/2017/04/20/scientists-across-the-nation-trade-in-lab-coats-for-protest-signs |title=Scientists Across the Nation Trade in Lab Coats for Protest Signs |author= |date= |work=kqed.org |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.kqed.org/.stream/mp3splice/radio//2017/04/Forum20170422a.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; regarding his criticism of the March and remarked that the millennial generation is just finding its feet with regard to activism and should be encouraged. Ratan also distinguished between being political and being partisan and suggested that while the March for Science is a political act, it is by no means partisan, which implies blind allegiance to one party over another. Ratan reiterated that the March For Science supports evidence-based policy-making regardless of party or affiliation.

A '''middle school''' (also known as '''intermediate school''' or '''junior high school''') is an [[educational stage]] which exists in some countries, providing education between [[primary school]] and [[secondary school]]. The concept, regulation and classification of middle schools, as well as the ages covered, vary between, and sometimes within, countries.

==Afghanistan==
In [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], middle school consists of grades 6, 7 and 8.

== Albania ==
In [[Albania]], middle school is included in the primary education which lasts 9 years and attendance is mandatory.

==Algeria==
In [[Algeria]], a middle school includes 4 grades; 6, 7, 8 and 9 consisting of students from ages 11 to 14 or 12 to 15.

==Argentina==
{{Main article|Education in Argentina}}
The ''ciclo básico'' of secondary education (ages 12–16) is roughly equivalent to middle school.

==Australia==
Most regions of [[Australia]] do not have middle schools, as students go directly from [[primary school]] (for years K–6) to [[secondary school]] (years 7-12, usually referred to as [[high school]]).

As an alternative to the middle school model, some secondary schools divided their grades into "junior high school" (years 7, 8, 9 and 10) and "senior high school" (years 11 and 12). Some have three levels, "junior" (years 7 and 8), "intermediate" (years 9 and 10), and "senior" (years 11 and 12).

In 1996 and 1997, a national conference met to develop what became known as the National Middle Schooling Project, which aimed to develop a common Australian view of
*early adolescent needs
*guiding principles for educators
*appropriate strategies to foster positive adolescent learning.
The first middle school established in Australia was [[The Armidale School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.edu.au//community/archives/Short_History_of_TAS.pdf |title=A SHORT HISTORY of THE ARMIDALE SCHOOL |publisher=The Armidale School |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408013530/http://www.as.edu.au//community/archives/Short_History_of_TAS.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Armidale (approximately {{Convert|370|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Sydney]], {{Convert|360|km|abbr=on}} SSW of [[Brisbane]] and approximately {{Convert|140|km|abbr=on}} due west of Coffs Harbour on the coast). Other schools have since followed this trend.

The [[Northern Territory]] has introduced a [[three-tier education|three tier system]] featuring Middle Schools for years 7–9 (approximate age 13–15) and high school year 10–12 (approximate age 16–18).&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleyears.nt.gov.au/about/|title=About Middle Years|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=Northern Territory Government|year=200|work=Middle Years – Northern Territory of Australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223120910/http://www.middleyears.nt.gov.au/about/|archivedate=2008-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schools across Queensland have introduced a Middle School tier within their schools. The middle schools cover years 6 to 8.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Bangladesh ==
In Bangladesh, middle school is not separated like other countries. Generally schools are from class 1 to class 10. It means lower primary (1-5), upper primary (6-10). From class 6-8 is thought as middle school. Grades 1,2,3,4 and 5 are said to be primary school while all the classes from 6 to 9 are considered high school (as middle school and high school are not considered separate) while 10-12 is called college.

== Bolivia ==
There aren't middle schools in Bolivia since 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oei.es/historico/quipu/bolivia/Ley_Reforma_Educativa_1565.pdf|title=Ley de Reforma Educativa. Ley Nº 1565/1994 - OEI|last=|first=|date=|website=OEI|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Students aged 11–15 attend the last years of elementary education or the first years of secondary education.

== Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] "middle school" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–4 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 or 9 years). ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]'' are the most prestigious type of "middle" school.

== Brazil ==
In [[Brazil]], middle school is a mandatory stage that precedes [[High School]] (''Ensino Médio'') called "Ensino Fundamental II" consisting of grades 6 to 9, ages 11 to 14.

==Canada==
In Canada, the terms "Middle School" and "Junior High School" are both used, depending on which grades the school caters to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861692773/junior_high.html "Definition of junior high school"]. Retrieved June 12, 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023669116635 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Junior high schools tend to include only grades 7, 8, and sometimes 9 (some older schools with the name 'carved in concrete' still use "Junior High" as part of their name, although grade nine is now missing), whereas middle schools are usually grades 6–8 or only grades 7-8 or 6-7 (i.e. around ages 11–14), varying from area to area and also according to population vs. building capacity. Another common model is grades 5–8. Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island junior high schools (the term "Middle School" is not commonly used) include only grades 7–9, with the first year of high school traditionally being grade 10. In some places students go from elementary school to secondary school. In Ontario, the term "Middle School and Secondary School are used).

Quebec uses a grade system that is different from those of the other provinces. The Secondary level has five grades, starting after Elementary Grade 6. These are called Secondary I to Secondary V.

==Chile==
{{Main article|Education in Chile}}
There aren't middle schools in Chile. Students aged 11 to 16 attend the last years of ''educación básica'' (basic education, until age 14) or the first years of ''educación media'' (middle education, equivalent to middle and high school).

==China==

In the People's Republic of China, middle school has two stages, junior stage (grades 7–9, some places are grades 6–9) and senior stage (grades 10–12). The junior stage education is the last 3 years of 9-year-compulsory education for all young citizens; while the senior stage education is optional but considered as a critical preparation for college education. Some middle schools have both stages while some have either of them.

The admissions for most students to enroll in senior middle schools from junior stage are on the basis of the scores that they get in "Senior Middle School Entrance Exam",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Commonly referred as "Zhong Kao" ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 中考).&lt;/ref&gt; which are held by local governments. Other students may bypass the exam, based on their distinctive talents, like athletics, or excellent daily performance in junior stage.

==Colombia==
{{Main article|Education in Colombia}}
Secondary education is divided into basic secondary (grades 6 to 9) and mid-secondary (grades 10 and 11). The students in basic secondary, roughly equivalent to middle school, are 11 or 12 to 15 or 16 years old.

== Croatia ==
In [[Croatia]] "middle school" refers to educational institutions for ages between 14 and 18, and lasts 3–5 years, following elementary school (which lasts 8 years). ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]'' are the most prestigious type of "middle" school.

== Cuba ==
{{Main article|Education in Cuba}}
''Secundaria básica'' (basic secondary, seventh through ninth grades) is the approximate equivalent of middle school in [[Cuba]].

== Czech Republic ==
In the [[Czech Republic]] after completing the nine-year elementary school ([[compulsory school attendance]]) a student may apply for high school or [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="czech-education-act"&gt;[http://www.msmt.cz/dokumenty/act-no-561-of-24th-september-2004 Czech Act No. 561/2004 Collection of Law, on Pre-school, Basic, Secondary, Tertiary Professional and Other Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627005357/http://www.msmt.cz/dokumenty/act-no-561-of-24th-september-2004 |date=2014-06-27 }} (the Education Act)&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have the opportunity to enroll in high school from Grade 5 or (less commonly{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}) Grade 7 of elementary school, spending eight or six years respectively at high school that otherwise takes four years. Thus they can spend five years in elementary school, followed by eight in high school.

The 4th and last level of ''educación general básica'' (ages 12–14) is roughly equivalent to middle school.

==Egypt==
In [[Egypt]], middle school precedes high school. It is called the preparatory stage and consists of three phases: first preparatory in which students study more subjects than primary with different branches. For instance, algebra and geometry are taught instead of "mathematics." In the second preparatory phase, students study science, geography, the history of Egypt starting with [[History of ancient Egypt|pharaonic history]], including [[Coptic history]], [[Islamic history]], and concluding with [[History of modern Egypt|modern history]]. The students are taught two languages, Arabic and English. Middle school (preparatory stage) lasts for three years.

==France==
In France, the equivalent period to middle school is [[Secondary education in France|collège]], which lasts four years from the [[:fr:Classe de sixième française|Sixième]] (''sixth'', the equivalent of the Canadian and American [[Grade 6]]) to the [[:fr:Classe de troisième française|Troisième]] (''third'', the equivalent of the Canadian and American [[Grade 9]]), accommodating pupils aged between 11 and 15. Upon completion of the latter, students are awarded a [[Brevet des collèges]] if they obtain a certain amount of points on a series of tests in various subjects (French, history / geography, mathematics, science / physics / chemistry), but also on a series of skills completed during the last year and on oral examinations (e.g., about cross-subjects themes they work on the latest years, the fourth year of collège). They can then enter high school (called ''[[lycée]]''), which lasts three years from the [[:fr:Seconde (lycée)|Seconde]] to the [[:fr:Terminale (lycée)|Terminale]] until the ''[[baccalauréat]]'', and during which they can choose a general or a professional field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language= French|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid24/les-niveaux-d-enseignement.html |title=Les niveaux et les établissements d'enseignement – Ministère de l'éducation nationale |publisher=Education.gouv.fr |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle schools were reinstated in Poland in 1999 now lasting three years after six years of [[primary school]]. Pupils entering ''gimnazjum'' are usually 13 years old. Middle school is compulsory for all students, and it is also the final stage of mandatory education. In the final year students take a [[standardized test]] to evaluate their academic skills. Higher scorers in the test are allowed first pick of school if they want to continue their education, which is encouraged.

Middle school in Romania, or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (''gimnaziu''), includes grades 5 to 8 and the students usually share the building with the students of primary school but in different wings/floors. Primary school lessons are taught by a handful of teachers: most are covered by one of them, and more specific areas such as foreign languages, religion or gym may have dedicated teachers. The transition to middle school changes that to a one teacher per course model where the students usually remain in the same classroom while the teachers rotate between courses. At the end of the eighth grade (usually corresponding to age 14 or 15), students take a written exam that counts for 80% (before, it used to be 50%) of the average needed to enroll in high school.

{{main|List of middle schools in England}}
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], [[local education authority|local education authorities]] introduced middle schools in the 1960s and 1970s. The notion of Middle Schools was mooted by the [[Plowden Report]] of 1967 which proposed a change to a [[Three-tier education|three-tier model]] including [[First school]]s for children aged between 4 and 7, Middle Schools for 7–11 year-olds, and then upper or high schools for 11–16 year-olds.&lt;ref name="plowden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/plowden/plowden1-10.html|title=Volume 1 Chapter 10 The Ages and Stages of Primary Education|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|year=1967|author=Central Advisory Council for Education (England)|work=Children and their Primary Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404002119/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/plowden/plowden1-10.html|archivedate=2010-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authorities introduced Middle Schools for ideological reasons, in line with the report, while others did so for more pragmatic reasons relating to the [[Raising Of School Leaving Age|raising of the school leaving age]] in compulsory education to 16, or to introduce a [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive system]].&lt;ref name="tes81"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Middle schools decline due to haphazard development|date=1981-11-13|work=Times Educational Supplement|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="circ1065"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmonovians.com/comprehensive/circular1065.htm |title=Main forms of comprehensive organisation |last=Andrew |first=Herbert |author2=Department of Education and Science |date=1965-07-12 |work=Circular 10/65: The Organisation of Secondary Education |publisher=HMSO |accessdate=2009-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092823/http://www.oldmonovians.com/comprehensive/circular1065.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different authorities introduced different age-range schools, although in the main, three models were used:
*4–6 First schools, followed by 7–11 '''middle schools''', as suggested by Plowden
*5–9 First schools, followed by 9–13 '''middle schools'''
*5–10 First schools followed by 10–13 '''middle schools''', or intermediate schools

In many areas ''primary school'' rather than first school was used to denote the first tier.

In addition, some schools were provided as [[combined school]]s catering for pupils in the 5–12 age range as a combined first and middle school.&lt;ref name="tes81"/&gt;

Around 2000 middle and combined schools were in place in the early 1980s. However, that number began to fall in the later 1980s with the introduction of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The new curriculum's splits in [[Key Stage]]s at age 11 encouraged the majority of [[local education authority|local education authorities]] to return to a two-tier system of [[Primary school|Primary]] (sometimes split into [[Infant school]]s and [[Junior school]]s) and [[Secondary school]]s.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/121169.stm|title=Education: End of the Middle Way?|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=BBC News| date=1998-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now fewer than 150 middle schools still operational in the United Kingdom, meaning that approximately 90% of middle schools have closed or reverted to primary school status since 1980. The system of 8-12 middle schools has fallen into complete disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/middleschools |title=UK Middle Schools |publisher=Sites.google.com |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under current legislation, all middle schools must be deemed either primary or secondary. Thus, schools which have more primary year groups than KS3 or KS4 are termed '''deemed primaries''' or '''middles-deemed-primaries''', while those with more secondary-aged pupils, or with pupils in Y11 are termed '''deemed secondaries''' or '''middles-deemed-secondaries'''. For statistical purposes, such schools are often included under primary and secondary categories "as deemed".&lt;ref name="SI1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1983/contents/made|title=The Education (Middle School) (England) Regulations 2002|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|year=2002|work=Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, most schools also follow teaching patterns in line with their deemed status, with most deemed-primary schools offering a primary-style curriculum taught by one class teacher, and most deemed-secondary schools adopting a more specialist-centred approach. Legally [[all-through school]]s are also considered middle schools (deemed secondary), although they are rarely referred to as such.

Some middle schools still exist in various areas of England. They are supported by the [[National Middle Schools' Forum]]. See [[List of middle schools in England]].

In [[Scotland]], a similar system to the English one was trialled in [[Grangemouth middle schools]], [[Falkirk (council area)|Falkirk]] between 1975 and 1987.&lt;ref name="meldrum"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Three-tier Education in Grangemouth| last=Meldrum| first=James| year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label of '''junior high school''' is used for some through schools in Orkney and Shetland which cater for pupils from 5 up to the age of 14, at which point they transfer to a nearby secondary school.

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], in the [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council]] area in [[County Armagh]], the Dickson Plan operates, whereby pupils attend a primary school from ages 4–10, a junior high school from 11–14, and a senior high school or grammar school from 14–19. This is not dissimilar to the middle school system.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}{{clarify|reason=why is this important? Why are deviations from national plan allowed anywhere?

==United States==
{{main article|Education in the United States}}

Middle schools in the United States usually cover grades 5-6, 5–8, 6–8, or 7–8. Historically, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary school]] includes kindergarten through to [[sixth grade]], or kindergarten through to fifth grade, i.e., up to age 12, but some elementary schools have four or eight grades, i.e., up to ages 10 or 14&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf], p. 7, fig. 1&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the intermediate grades). Basic subjects are taught and pupils often remain in one or two classrooms throughout the school day, except for [[physical education]], [[library]], [[music]], and [[art]] classes. In 2001, there were about 3.6 million children in each grade in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2001 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Middle schools” and “junior high schools” are schools that span grades 5 or 6 to 8 and 7 to 8, respectively,&lt;ref name=nces/&gt; but junior high schools spanning grades 7 to 9 were common until the 1980s.

The range defined by either is often based on demographic factors, such as an increase or decrease in the relative numbers of younger or older students, with the aim of maintaining stable school populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861692773/junior_high.html |publisher=encarta.msn.com |title=junior high school |quote=The major difference between a middle school and a junior high lies in the philosophy.

Also, pupils are able to choose some of their class subjects (electives). Usually, starting in ninth or tenth  grade, grades become part of a pupil’s official transcript. In the U.S., children within this grade-range are sometimes referred to as “junior highers”.&lt;ref&gt;Gillham, Isabel. "Self-concept and Reading". ''The Reading Teacher'' 21.3 (1967): 270–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The “junior high school” concept was introduced in 1909, in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2690 |title= First Junior High School in the United States |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |work=OhioHistoryCentral.org |accessdate =2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior high schools were created for "bridging the gap between the elementary and the high school", an emphasis credited to [[Charles W. Eliot]].&lt;ref name="dmn-jh"&gt;"Junior high plan outlined", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', September 22, 1929, section 1, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8, and this organization still exists, where some concepts of middle school organization have been adapted to the intermediate grades. As time passed, the junior high school concept increased quickly as new school districts proliferated, or systems modernized buildings and curricula.  This expansion continued through the 1960s. Jon Wiles, author of ''Developing Successful K–8 Schools: A Principal's Guide'', said that "[a] major problem" for the original model was "the inclusion of the ninth grade", because of the lack of instructional flexibility, due to the requirement of having to earn high school credits in the ninth grade—and that "the fully adolescent ninth grader in junior high school did not seem to belong with the students experiencing the onset of puberty".&lt;ref name=Wiles3&gt;{{cite book| editor-last= Wiles| editor-first=John |title= Developing Successful K–8 Schools: A Principal's Guide | publisher= Corwin Press | date= June 10, 2009 | ISBN=1412966175 | page= 3| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ovDM0whNv3cC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22The+structure+of+the+American+elementary+school+in+the+late+19th+century%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20structure%20of%20the%20American%20elementary%20school%20in%20the%20late%2019th%20century%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new ''middle school'' model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, "At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced [...]."&lt;ref name=Wiles3/&gt;

The [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] is organised into [[academic department]]s that operate more or less independently of one another.{{source?|date=August 2018}}

The middle school format has now replaced the junior high format by a ratio of about ten to one in the United States, but at least two school districts had incorporated both systems in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usd333.com USD, Concordia, Kansas] retrieved 2010-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agawampublicschools.org/ retrieved 2011-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uruguay==
{{Main article|Education in Uruguay}}
In [[Uruguay]], the public middle school consists of two stages, one mandatory called "Basic Cycle" or "First Cycle". This consists of three years, ages 12–13, 13–14 and 14–15, and one optional called "Second Cycle", ages 15–16, 16–17 and 17–18. The Second Cycle is divided into 4 options in the 5th grade: "Human Sciences", "Biology", "Scientific" and "Arts", and 7 options in the 6th and last grade: "Law" or "Economy" (if Human Sciences course taken in 5th), "Medicine" or "Agronomy" (if Biological course taken in 5th), "Architecture" or "Engineering" (if Scientific course taken in 5th) and "Arts" (if Arts course taken in 5th).

Both these stages are commonly known as "Liceo" (Spanish for "high school").  Middle school starts at grade 7 and ends at grade 9.

==Venezuela==
{{Main article|Education in Venezuela}}
&lt;!---not sure this should be here. Seems more like a junior/senior high school---&gt;
In [[Venezuela]], public middle schools have a different Spanish name than private schools.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Liceo"; private schools are called "Colegio"&lt;/ref&gt; The school system includes a preparatory year before first grade, so nominal grade levels are offset when compared to other countries (except those countries who have mandatory pre-school). Middle schools (''educación media general'', ages 12–15) are from 7th grade (equivalent to 8th grade US) to 11th grade, which is equivalent to 12th grade.

In some institutions called "Technical Schools" there is an extra grade, for those who want to graduate as "Middle technician" in a certain area. This education would allow them to be hired at a higher level, or get introduced more easily into a college career.

There is a "college test" from main universities of the country. Their score on this test might allow them to more quickly obtain a spot within an institution. Students with high qualifications during the high school, have more chances to have the spot.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Vietnam==

Secondary school, or Junior High school, includes grade 6 to 9. After finishing grade 9, students have to take the graduating test nationally, which includes Mathematics, Literature and English. The maximum score for each test is 10, with the first two subjects (called the Core Subjects) multiplied by two for a total possible score of 50. Reward points from the vocational course; spanning from 1.0 to 2.0 according to the students' record could also be added to the final score. 

Some public schools use the graduating exam's score and student's transcripts to make their decision. Many other public and private schools require students who apply for those schools to take their entrance exams. The administration team would review the student's transcripts and his or her exam to decide whether that student is qualified for their requirement or not.

Culture consists of the social behaviour and norms in human societies transmitted through social learning.&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011/&gt; '''Molluscs''' play a variety of roles '''in culture''', including but not limited to art and literature, with both practical interactions—whether useful or harmful—and symbolic uses.

Practical interactions with molluscs range from their use as food, where species as diverse as snails and squid are eaten in many countries, to the employment of molluscs as [[shell money]] and to make dyestuffs and [[Conch (musical instrument)|musical instruments]], for personal adornment with [[seashell]]s, [[pearls]], or [[mother-of-pearl]], as [[conchology|items to be collected]], as fictionalised [[sea monster]]s, and as raw materials for craft items such as [[Sailor's Valentines]]. Some [[bivalves]] are used as [[bioindicator]]s to monitor the health of marine and freshwater environments.

Harmful interactions with molluscs include the stings of [[cone snail]]s and the venomous bites of certain [[octopus]]es; [[blue-ringed octopus]]es bite only when provoked, but their venom kills a quarter of the people bitten. Some snails are [[vector (disease)|vectors of diseases]] such as [[schistosomiasis]], a major tropical disease that infects some 200 million people; others are serious crop pests, and species such as the giant East African snail ''[[Lissachatina fulica]]'' have damaged [[ecosystem]]s in areas where they have been introduced.

Mollusc shells have been widely used in art, whether carved directly, sometimes as [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]], or depicted in paintings.
In popular culture, the snail [[animal epithet|is known for]] its stereotypical slowness, while the octopus and giant squid have featured in literature since [[classical era|classical times]] as [[sea monster|monsters of the deep]]. Many-headed and tentacled monsters appear as the [[Gorgon]] and the [[Medusa]] of [[Greek mythology]], and the [[kraken]] of Nordic legend. The [[taxonomist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] named the Venus shell as ''[[Pitar dione|Venus dione]]'', for the goddess of love and her mother, and named its parts using overtly sexual descriptors.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by molluscs in human culture, so defined.

Most [[molluscs]] with shells can produce pearls, but only the pearls of [[bivalve]]s and some [[gastropod]]s, whose shells are lined with [[nacre]], are valuable.&lt;ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaGastropoda"&gt;[[#Ruppert|Ruppert]], pp. 300–343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaBivalvia"&gt;[[#Ruppert|Ruppert]], pp. 367–403&lt;/ref&gt; The best natural pearls are produced by marine [[pearl oyster]]s, ''[[Pinctada]] margaritifera'' and ''Pinctada mertensi'', which live in the [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] and shell.

[[Pearls]] for use as jewellery are cultured by inserting either "seeds" or beads into oysters. The "seed" method uses grains of ground shell from freshwater [[mussel]]s, and overharvesting for this purpose has [[endangered]] several freshwater mussel species in the southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="RuppertFoxBarnes2004MolluscaBivalvia" /&gt; The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jones, J.B. |author2= Creeper, J.| title=Diseases of Pearl Oysters and Other Molluscs: a Western Australian Perspective| journal=Journal of Shellfish Research | volume=25 | issue=1 |date=April 2006| pages=233–238| doi=10.2983/0730-8000(2006)25[233:DOPOAO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peoples of the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, North America, Africa and the Caribbean have used [[shell money|shells as money]], including ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'', the money cowrie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Damme|first1=Ingrid|title=Cowry Shells, a trade currency|url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/en/2007/01/cowry-shells.htm|publisher=Museum of the National Bank of Belgium|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preindustrial societies. However, these were not necessarily used for commercial transactions, but mainly as [[social status]] displays at important occasions, such as weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maurer, B. |title=The Anthropology of Money |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=35 |pages=15–36 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123127 |url=http://www.anthro.uci.edu/faculty_bios/maurer/Maurer-AR.pdf |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070943/http://www.anthro.uci.edu/faculty_bios/maurer/Maurer-AR.pdf |archivedate=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for commercial transactions, they functioned as [[commodity]] money, as a tradable commodity whose value differed from place to place, often as a result of difficulties in transport, and which was vulnerable to incurable [[inflation]] if more efficient transport or "goldrush" behaviour appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Shell Money of the Slave Trade |author1=Hogendorn, J. |author2=Johnson, M. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0521541107}} Particularly chapters "Boom and slump for the cowrie trade" (pages 64–79) and "The cowrie as money: transport costs, values and inflation" (pages 125–147)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Eastern Woodlands tribes]] of [[indigenous people of North America|North America]], shell beads known as [[wampum]] were kept on strings and used as money.&lt;ref name=lsd&gt;Dubin, Lois Sherr.

===Bioindicators===
Bivalve molluscs are used as [[bioindicators]] to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status and structure, physiology, behaviour and their levels of contamination with chemicals together provide a detailed indication of the status of the ecosystem. Because they are sessile, they serve as readily-monitored representatives of their environment.&lt;ref name=Molluscan&gt;{{cite web |author=Université Bordeaux et al |url=http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en |title=MolluSCAN ''eye'' project |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few species of molluscs, including octopuses and cone snails, can sting or bite. Some present a serious risk to people handling them. However, deaths from [[jellyfish]] stings are ten times as common as those from mollusc bites.&lt;ref name="WilliamsonFennerEtAl1996VenomousMarine Animals"&gt;{{cite book | author=Williamson, J.A., Fenner, P.J., Burnett, J.W., and Rifkin, J. | title=Venomous and Poisonous Marine Animals: A Medical and Biological Handbook| publisher=UNSW Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-86840-279-6 | pages=65–68| url=https://books.google.com/?id=YsZ3GryFIzEC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vectors of disease===

Molluscs are [[vector (disease)|vector]]s of [[parasitism|parasitic]] diseases such as [[schistosomiasis]], a major tropical disease second only to [[malaria]]. It is caused by [[Trematoda|flukes]], ''[[Schistosoma]]'' spp., and infects some 200 million people in 74 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Carter Center Schistosomiasis Control Program |publisher=The [[Carter Center]] | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/schistosomiasis/index.html | accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flukes have a complex life cycle with freshwater snails as [[Host (biology)|intermediate hosts]]; people swimming or washing in the water are at risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Brown, D.S. | title=Freshwater Snails of Africa and Their Medical Importance| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-7484-0026-5 | page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such pest, the giant African snail ''[[Lissachatina fulica]]'', has been introduced to many parts of Asia and islands in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, reaching the [[West Indies]] in the 1990s. The predatory snail ''[[Euglandina rosea]]'' was disastrously introduced in an [[biological pest control|attempt to control it]], as the predator ignored ''A. fulica'' but extirpated several native snail species instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Civeyrel, L. |author2= Simberloff, D. | title=A tale of two snails: is the cure worse than the disease? | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation | volume=5 | issue=10 |date=October 1996| pages=1231–1252 | doi=10.1007/BF00051574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monsters of the deep ===

[[Cephalopoda|Cephalopod]] molluscs including the [[octopus]] and [[giant squid]] have featured as [[sea monster|monsters of the deep]] since classical times. Giant squid are [[Aristotle's biology|described by Aristotle]] (4th century BC) in his ''[[History of Animals]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]. N.d.

In his 1758 ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', and then in his 1771 ''Fundamenta Testaceologiae'', the pioneering taxonomist [[Carl Linnaeus]] used a series of "disquieting[ly]"&lt;ref name=Grout&gt;{{cite web| url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/dacosta.html | title=Da Costa and the Venus dione: The Obscenity of Shell Description | accessdate=19 May 2015}} From the ''Encyclopædia Romana'' by James Grout.&lt;/ref&gt; sexual terms to describe the Venus shell: ''[[vulva]]'', ''[[anus]]'', ''nates'' ([[buttocks]]), ''[[pubis (bone)|pubis]]'', ''[[mons veneris]]'', ''[[labia]]'', ''[[hymen]]''.&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |first1=Carl |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=[[Systema Naturae]] |date=1758 |pages=684–685 |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |first1=Carl |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=[[Systema Naturae]] |date=1767 |pages=1128–1129 |edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he named the species ''[[Venus dione]]'', for [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love, and [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], her mother. The evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] called Linnaeus's description "one of the most remarkable paragraphs in the history of systematics".&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=The Anatomy Lesson: The Teachings of Naturalist Mendes da Costa, a Sephardic Jew in King George's Court |journal=Natural History |date=1995 |volume=104 |issue=12 |pages=10–15, 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later naturalists found the terms used by Linnaeus uncomfortable; an 1803 review commented that "a few of these terms however strongly they may be warranted by the similitudes and analogies which they express, ... are not altogether reconcilable with the delicacy proper to be observed in ordinary discourse",&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt; while the 1824 ''Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica'' criticised Linnaeus for "indulg[ing] in obscene allusions."&lt;ref name=Grout/&gt;

'''''Omphisa fuscidentalis''''', the '''bamboo worm''' (and one of the insects called bamboo borer), is a [[moth]] of the [[Crambidae]] family. Its habitat are the [[bamboo]] [[Grove (nature)|groves]] and forests in the cooler regions of northern [[Thailand]], northern [[Laos]], northern [[Myanmar]], and adjacent parts of [[Yunnan Province]], China. The mature [[caterpillar]]s are viewed as a delicacy by the inhabitants of these regions.

The wingspan of the male is 4&amp;nbsp;cm with a 2-cm-long body. The female is slightly larger with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm wingspan and a 2.2-cm-long body. The wings of this moth are orange-brown in colour, with black, curved stripes. The caterpillar is white in colour with a body length of 3.5 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm. &lt;!-- notable if not 1:1 The  ratio of males to females is about 1:1. --&gt;

==Lifecycle==
The adult moth only lives for two months: July and August. Mating takes place at night in early August after which the female lays a cluster of about 80-130 eggs near the base of a [[bamboo shoot]]. The larvae hatch after 12 days, and are pale brown in colour and covered with long hair. Working together, the larvae bore an entrance hole at an internode of the bamboo in one day. After entering the shoot, they then, also in one day, bore an exit hole for the mature moths from which to eventually emerge. The larvae turn white within three days.

Boring their way upwards from one bamboo [[Plant stem|internode]] to another, the larvae feed on the fresh inner pulp of the bamboo while avoiding common predators such as birds. After 45 to 60 days, the larvae mature and migrate down to the internode containing the exit hole where they enter a period of [[diapause]] for eight months, hanging upside down from the roof of the internode. This long period of diapause is exceptional for a tropical insect, and probably caused by the [[monsoon]]al character of the region which has a cool, dry period from November to February, a hot season from March to June, followed by a wet period from June through October, affecting the availability of food for the larvae. The [[pupa]]l phase takes 46 to 60 days and falls in June and July.

Eleven different species of bamboo are infested. The infestation does not harm the plants, but instead makes the bamboo stronger than uninfested bamboo. However, the bamboo worm's activity may cause irregular growth patterns in the bamboo shoots which they occupy. In northern Thailand, ''O. fuscidentalis'' infestations have been found in ''[[Dendrocalamus]] membranaceus'', ''D. hamiltonii'', ''D. strictus'', ''[[Bambusa]] nutans'', ''B. blumeana'', ''[[Gigantochloa]] albociliata'', and ''G. nigrociliata''.

==As food==
[[File:Bamboo worms food.jpg|thumb|Deep-fried "bamboo worms" at a market in [[Bangkok]]]]
Collection of the larvae for consumption by people falls mainly in the period of diapause when the larvae congregate in one single internodal cavity. This involves carefully piercing through sections of the bamboo shoots with a cleaver where water is trapped. Cutting down the entire shoot will endanger the worms natural habitat. Together with other types of insects, the consumption of bamboo worms is gaining popularity in Asian regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/JIFF2014.0017 Insects as food and feed in the Asia Pacific region: current perspectives and future directions]&lt;/ref&gt; About 26% of their body weight is protein, and 51% fat. The name in [[Thai cuisine]] for this delicacy is "bamboo worm" (''non mai phai'', {{lang-th|หนอนไม้ไผ่}}), but due to its appearance, it is commonly called ''rot duan'' ([[Thai language|Thai]]: รถด่วน), meaning "express train". They are also considered to be an environmentally friendly diet as they do not require a large amount of resources when they are raised. Now, because of the greater demand for bamboo worms as food, they are being commercially bred and cultivated by [[insect farmer]]s to ensure that their population in the wild is not affected. They are usually eaten deep-fried, sometimes flavoured with herbs, spices or condiments.&lt;ref name=Bangkok&gt;{{cite book |title=Six-legged Livestock: Edible insect farming, collection and marketing in Thailand |year=2013 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |location=Bangkok |isbn=978-92-5-107578-4|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i3246e/i3246e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chopin nocturne op27 2b.png|thumb|600x600px|An extreme example of ornamentation as a [[fioritura]] from [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin's]] [[Nocturnes, Op. 27 (Chopin)#Nocturne in D-flat major, Op. 27, No. 2|Nocturne in D{{music|flat}} major]]|alt=]]

In [[music]], '''ornaments''' or '''embellishments''' are musical flourishes—typically, added notes—that are not essential to carry the overall line of the [[melody]] (or [[harmony]]), but serve instead to decorate or "[[ornament (art)|ornament]]" that line (or harmony), provide added interest and variety, and give the performer the opportunity to add expressiveness to a song or piece. Many ornaments are performed as "fast notes" around a central, main [[Musical note|note]]. There are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short [[grace note]] before a main note to the performance of a virtuostic and flamboyant trill. The amount of '''ornamentation''' in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none. The word ''agrément'' is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation.

In the Baroque period, it was common for performers to [[musical improvisation|improvise]] ornamentation on a given melodic line. A singer performing a [[da capo aria]], for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time, but decorate it with additional flourishes and trills the second time. Similarly, a harpsichord player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, mordents (upper or lower) and appoggiaturas.

Ornamentation may also be indicated by the composer. A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in [[music notation]], while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as fully sized notes. Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code. A [[grace note]] is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its [[note value]] does not count as part of the total time value of the [[Bar (music)|bar]]. Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see {{section link|#Appoggiatura}} below), or in association with some other ornament's indication (see {{section link|#Trill}} below), regardless of the timing used in the execution.

In [[Spain]], melodies ornamented upon repetition ("[[Division (music)|divisions]]") were called "[[Variation (music)#History of variations|diferencias]]", and can be traced back to 1538, when [[Luis de Narváez]] published the first collection of such music for the [[vihuela]].&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Sisman, "Variations, §4: Origins", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western classical music==

===Trill===
{{Main|Trill (music)}}

A [[trill (music)|trill]], also known as a "shake", is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above. In simple music, the trills may be diatonic, using just the notes of the scale. 

Sometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few grace notes following the note that bears the trill indication. The trill is indicated by either a {{serif|'''''tr'''''}} or a {{serif|'''''tr~~'''''}}, with the '''~''' representing the length of the trill, above the [[Staff (music)|staff]]. In Baroque music, the trill is sometimes indicated with a '''+''' (plus) sign above or below the note.

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {
        \time 2/4
        g2\trill
    }
}

&lt;/score&gt;
At a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {
        \time 2/4
        g32[ a g \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]
        g32[ a g \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

There is also a single tone trill variously called ''trillo'' or ''[[tremolo]]'' in late Renaissance and early Baroque. Trilling on a single note is particularly idiomatic for the bowed strings.

===Mordent===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ornament (music)]] --&gt;
{{main|Mordent}}
The ''[[mordent]]'' is thought of as a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note above (called the ''upper mordent'', ''inverted mordent'', or ''pralltriller'') or below (called the ''lower mordent'' or ''mordent''), and the indicated note again.

The upper mordent is indicated by a short thick [[tilde]] (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it:

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        d\prall c\mordent
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt; 

As with the trill, the exact speed with which the mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        d32 e d16~ d8  c32 b c16~ c8 
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Lmordent no-lmordent.ogg|title=Mordents|description=First bar of Goldberg Variation 7, first played with lower mordents, then without (134 KB)}}

Confusion over the meaning of the unadorned word ''mordent'' has led to the modern terms ''upper'' and ''lower'' mordent being used, rather than ''mordent'' and ''inverted mordent''. Practice, notation, and nomenclature vary widely for all of these ornaments; that is to say, whether, by including the [[symbol]] for a mordent in a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a composer intended the direction of the additional note (or notes) to be played above or below the principal note written on the sheet music varies according to when the piece was written, and in which country. This article as a whole addresses an approximate nineteenth-century standard.

In the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], a Mordant (the [[German language|German]] or [[Scots language|Scottish]] equivalent of ''[[mordent]]'') was what later came to be called an ''[[inverted mordent]]'' and what is now often called a ''[[lower mordent]]''. In the 19th century, however, the name ''mordent'' was generally applied to what is now called the ''upper'' mordent. Although mordents are now thought of as just a single alternation between notes, in the Baroque period a ''Mordant'' may sometimes have been executed with more than one alternation between the indicated note and the note below, making it a sort of inverted trill. Mordents of all sorts might typically, in some periods, begin with an extra ''inessential note'' (the lesser, added note), rather than with the ''principal note'' as shown in the examples here. The same applies to trills, which in Baroque and Classical times would standardly begin with the added, upper note. A ''lower'' inessential note may or may not be chromatically raised (that is, with a natural, a sharp, or even a double sharp) to make it just one semitone lower than the principal note.

=== Turn ===&lt;!--this section is linked to directly from [[Turn (music)]] &amp; [[Gruppetto]]--&gt;
{{Redirect|Gruppetto|the group of cyclists behind the peloton|Grupetto}}
A '''turn''' is a short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.

The details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. The following turns:

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
&lt;&lt; \clef treble
    \relative c'' {

        \stemNeutral c4. d8 e2  c4 d\turn e2
    } \\ {
        s4 s^\turn
    }
&gt;&gt;

}
&lt;/score&gt;

might be executed like this::

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {
        c8 \tuplet 3/2 { d16 c b } c8 d e2
        c4 e16 d c d e2
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

The exact speed at which the notes of a turn are executed can vary, as can its rhythm. The question of how a turn is best executed is largely one of context, convention, and taste. The lower and upper added notes may or may not be chromatically raised (see [[mordent]]).

An '''inverted''' turn (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.

=== Appoggiatura ===
{{main|Appoggiatura}}

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Apog no-apog.ogg|title=Appoggiatura|description=A passage with two phrases ending in appoggiaturas, followed by these phrases without them (160 KB)}}

The ''Appoggiatura'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|p|ɒ|dʒ|ə|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ə}}; {{IPA-it|appoddʒaˈtuːra|lang}}) is an added note that is important melodically (unlike the acciaccatura) and suspends the principal note by a portion of its time-value, often about half, but this may be considerably more or less depending on the context. The added note (the unessential note) is one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and, if lower, it may or may not be chromatically raised. Appoggiaturas are also usually on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution, are themselves emphasised, and are approached by a leap and left by a step in the opposite direction of the leap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q&amp;A/Q93.html] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kent Kennan]], ''Counterpoint'', Fourth Edition, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The appoggiatura is often written as a [[grace note]] prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Appoggiatura |volume=2 |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the oblique stroke:

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        \grace { d4( } c2)
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

This may be executed as follows:

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        d4( c)
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

=== Acciaccatura ===
'''''Acciaccatura''''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ə|ˌ|tʃ|æ|k|ə|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|tʃ|ɑː|k|ə|-}}; {{IPA-it|attʃakkaˈtuːra|lang}}) comes from the Italian verb ''[[Wikt:acciaccare|acciaccare]]'', "to crush". In the eighteenth century, it was an ornament applied to any of the main notes of arpeggiated chords, either a tone or semitone below the chord tone, struck simultaneously with it and then immediately released. Hence the German translation ''Zusammenschlag'' (together-stroke).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Seletsky, "Acciaccatura (It.; Fr. ''pincé étouffé''; Ger. ''Zusammenschlag'')", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the acciaccatura (sometimes called ''short appoggiatura'') came to be a shorter variant of the ''long appoggiatura'', where the delay of the principal note is quick. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or [[eighth note]]), with an oblique stroke through the stem. The ''acciaccatura'' in the Classical period is usually performed before the beat and the emphasis is on the main note not the grace note. The ''appoggiatura'' long or short has the emphasis on the grace note.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        \slashedGrace { d8( } c4)
        \slashedGrace { e8( } d4)
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

The exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {

        \time 2/4
        d32 c32~ c16~ c8  e32 d32~ d16~ d8
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

Whether the note should be played before or on the beat is largely a question of taste and performance practice. Exceptionally, the acciaccatura may be notated in the bar preceding the note to which it is attached, showing that it is to be played before the beat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} (This guide to practice is unfortunately not available, of course, if the principal note does not fall at the beginning of the bar.)

The implication also varies with the composer and the period. For example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s long appoggiaturas are – to the eye – indistinguishable from [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s before-the-beat acciaccaturas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Glissando===
{{Main|Glissando}}

A glissando is a slide from one note to another, signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes. All of the intervening diatonic or chromatic (depending on instrument and context) are heard, albeit very briefly. In this way, the glissando differs from [[portamento]].

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c' {
        \override Glissando.style = #'trill
        e2\glissando e'
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

In contemporary classical music (especially in avant garde pieces) a glissando tends to assume the whole value of the initial note.

===Schleifer===
[[File:Schleifer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Schleifer notation]]
{{Main|Slide (musical ornament)}}
A slide ('''Schleifer''' in German) instructs the performer to begin one or two diatonic steps below the marked note and slide upward. The schleifer usually includes a prall trill or mordent trill at the end.

Willard A. Palmer wrote, "The '''schleifer''' is a 'sliding' ornament, usually used to fill in the gap between a note and the previous one."&lt;ref&gt;''First Lesson in Bach for the Piano'', Edited by Walter Carroll &amp; Willard A. Palmer, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Baroque music==

Ornaments in [[Baroque music]] take on a different meaning. Most ornaments occur on the beat, and use diatonic intervals more exclusively than ornaments in later periods do. While any table of ornaments must give a strict presentation, consideration has to be given to the tempo and note length, since at rapid tempos it would be difficult or impossible to play all of the notes that are usually required. One realisation of some common Baroque ornaments is set in the following table from the [[Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]] written by J.S. Bach:

[[File:Tableofornaments750.jpg|750px]]&lt;!--this image shown wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;

==Renaissance and early Baroque==

From [[Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego|Silvestro Ganassi]]'s treatise in 1535 we have instructions and examples of how musicians of the Renaissance and early [[Baroque]] periods decorated their music with improvised ornaments.  [[Michael Praetorius]] spoke warmly of musicians' "sundry good and merry pranks with little runs/leaps".{{Citequote|date=May 2012}}

Until the last decade of the 16th century the emphasis is on ''divisions'', also known as ''diminutions'', ''passaggi'' (in Italian), ''gorgia'' ("throat", first used as a term for vocal ornamentation by [[Nicola Vicentino]] in 1555), or ''glosas'' (by Ortiz, in both Spanish and Italian) – a way to decorate a simple cadence or interval with extra shorter notes. These start as simple passing notes, progress to step-wise additions and in the most complicated cases are rapid passages of equal valued notes – virtuosic flourishes. There are rules for designing them, to make sure that the original structure of the music is left intact. Towards the end of this period the divisions detailed in the treatises contain more dotted and other uneven rhythms and leaps of more than one step at a time.

Starting with Archilei (1589),{{Full citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--nothing by Archilei is found in the following list.--&gt; the treatises bring in a new set of expressive devices called ''graces'' alongside the divisions. These have a lot more rhythmic interest and are filled with affect as composers took much more interest in text portrayal. It starts with the ''trillo'' and ''cascate'', and by the time we reach [[Francesco Rognoni]] (1620) we are also told about fashionable ornaments: ''portar la voce'', ''accento'', ''[[tremolo]]'', ''gruppo'', ''esclamatione'' and ''intonatio''.&lt;ref name="rrognoni"&gt;{{cite book | title = Passaggi per potersi essercitare nel diminuire (1592); edition with preface by Bruce Dickey | last = Rognoni | first = Riccardo | year = 2002 | publisher = Arnaldo Forni Editore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian classical music ==
In [[Carnatic music]], the [[Sanskrit]] term ''gamaka'' (which means "to move") is used to denote ornamentation. One of the most unusual forms of ornamentation in world music is the Carnatic ''kampitam'' which is about oscillating a note in diverse ways by varying amplitude, speed or number of times the note is oscillated. This is a highly subtle, yet scientific ornamentation as the same note can be oscillated in different ways based on the raga or context within a raga. For instance, the fourth note (Ma) in Shankarabharanam or Begada allows at least three to five types of oscillation based on the phrasings within the raga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acharyanet.com/lesson/22-sarasvati-begada-geetam/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important gamaka in Carnatic is the "Sphuritam" which is about rendering a note twice but forcefully from a grace note immediately below it the second time. For instance, the third note (Ga) would be rendered plain first time and with a force from the second (Ri) the next time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acharyanet.com/lesson/jantai-varishais/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other important Carnatic ornamentation include aahatam, pratyaahatam, tripuchham, andolam, daalu, daatu and jaru.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The last is similar to Western Classical [[glissando]].

==In non-classical music==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
===Rock and pop===
Ornamentation is also used in popular music such as rock and pop. Rock piano playing has incorporated many ornaments from early 1900s blues piano styles such as [[boogie-woogie]]. Improvised ornaments in rock solos or instrumental melody lines are often idiosyncratic to specific instruments. Electric guitar players can draw from an immense array of ornaments that are specific to their instrument. [[Hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s are two of the most basic techniques, and may be used in executing classical ornaments, as well as for the execution of ornaments more particular to guitar (such as [[tapping]], which can be used as ornamentation or as a playing style in and of itself).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

While rock and pop are typically learned by ear, with the arrangements fleshed out with improvisation, the style also includes notated music, particularly in arranged music for larger ensembles. This notated music uses some of the most-used "Classical" ornaments, such as trills and mordents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Jazz===
[[Jazz]] music incorporates a number of ornaments, which can be divided into [[Jazz improvisation|improvised]] ornaments. They are added by performers during their solo [[extemporization]]s, and as written ornaments. Improvised ornaments are often idiosyncratic to specific instruments. The Hammond organ playing in the jazz subgenre of organ trio [[soul jazz]] often features trills which outline the harmony of a chord, glisses up or down the keyboard, and turn-like decorations. [[Saxophone]] players may decorate a simple melody line with turns, grace notes, and short [[glissandi]] created with the mouth and the reed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

While jazz is substantially based upon improvisation, the style also includes notated music, particularly in music for larger ensembles such as [[big band]]s. Small ensembles may also use notated music for part of their performances, in arrangements of a tune's main theme. Notated jazz music incorporates most of the standard "classical" ornaments, such as trills, grace notes, and mordents. Written jazz notation may also include other ornaments, such as "dead" or [[ghost note]]s (a percussive sound, notated by an "X"), glissandi (step-wise glides between a start and destination note, written with a long line), "doit" notes and "fall" notes (annotated by curved lines above the note, indicating by direction of curve that the note should either rapidly rise or fall on the scale),&lt;ref name="Read1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Read|first=Gardner|title=Music notation: a manual of modern practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGQJAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=1969|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an instruction to "[[fill (music)|fill]]" part of a bar with an embellishment (notated with diagonal slashes in the bar).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Celtic music===
Ornamentation is a major distinguishing characteristic of [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], and [[Cape Breton fiddling|Cape Breton]] music. A singer, fiddler, flautist, harpist, [[tin whistle]]r, [[bagpipes|piper]] or a player of another instrument may add grace notes (known as 'cuts' / 'strikes' in Irish fiddling), slides, rolls, cranns, doubling, mordents, drones, trebles (or Birls in Scottish fiddling), or a variety of other ornaments to a given melody. &lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Britannica" /&gt;

The '''PDC Pro Tour''' is a series of non-televised [[darts]] tournaments organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). They comprise [[Professional Dart Players Association]] (PDPA) Players Championships, [[UK Open (darts)|UK Open]] qualifiers and European Tour events.

==Pro Tour Card==
From 2011, the PDC Pro Tour operates a Tour Card system. 128 players are granted Tour Cards, which enables them to participate in all Players Championships and UK Open Qualifiers.

The 2011 Tour Cards were awarded to:
*101 players from the [[PDC Order of Merit]] after the [[2011 PDC World Darts Championship|2011 World Championship]]
*2 finalists from the [[2010 PDC Women's World Darts Championship|2010 PDC Women's World Championship]]
*25 qualifiers from a four-day Qualifying School in [[Wigan]] (4 semi-finalists from each day, plus the top 9 players from the Q School Order of Merit)

Tour Cards were also offered to the four semi-finalists from the [[2011 BDO World Darts Championship|2011 BDO World Championship]], although none of the players took up the offer.

From 2012 onwards, the PDC awards Tour Cards were awarded to:
*Top 64 players from the [[PDC Order of Merit]] after the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]] (having competed in at least ten events)
*Tour Card holders from previous year's Qualifying School
*Tour card holders from previous year's invitations (BDO World Championship &amp; World Youth Championship)
*4 semi-finalists from the [[2012 BDO World Darts Championship|2012 BDO World Championship]]
*2 finalists from the [[2012 PDC World Youth Championship|2012 World Youth Championship]]
*At least 16 qualifiers from a four-day Qualifying School (more places will be awarded via this method if not all the above spaces are filled)

From 2015 onwards, the PDC withdrew the Tour Cards awarded to BDO semi-finalist and the new distribution of Tour Cards is as follows:
*Top 64 players from the [[PDC Order of Merit]] after the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]] (having competed in at least ten events)
*Tour Card holders from previous year's Qualifying School
*Four tour card holders from previous year's invitations (PDC Challenge Tour &amp; PDC Development Tour)
*Two highest qualifiers from the PDC Challenge Tour, a series of tournaments for non-Tour Card holders
*Two highest qualifiers from the PDC Development Tour, a series of tournaments for youth players
*At least 16 qualifiers from a four-day Qualifying School (more places will be awarded via this method if not all the above spaces are filled)

==Players Championships==
'''Players Championships''', originally known as PDPA Players Championships, are organised by the [[Professional Dart Players Association]] (PDPA) and have increased in number in recent years. They are known as "floor tournaments", because they usually feature 16 darts boards in close proximity on an arena floor where the tournament is played in the space of a day. Televised events differ by having just one main board on a stage with the audience and cameras situated around it.

Eligibility for these events are usually restricted to PDPA members only, however tournaments held outside of the United Kingdom often allow entry to non-PDPA members who are residents of the country staging the tournament. Some overseas players from the [[British Darts Organisation|BDO]] take the opportunity of playing in PDC Players Championships in their home countries.

===Order of Merit===
The prize money won in Players Championships count towards the [[PDC Order of Merit]], which contributes to each player's [[darts world rankings|world ranking]].

During 2007, the PDC and PDPA added further importance to Players Championships by changing qualification criteria for major televised events. A separate Players Championship Order of Merit was introduced which calculates players earnings for these tournaments only each calendar year. The players who won the most money (without qualifying automatically via the PDC Order of Merit) were awarded qualifying places at major tournaments, such as the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] and [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]].

Previously, a sudden-death knockout qualifying tournament decided the players which meant players could miss out on tournaments because of unlucky matches or unlucky draws. The World Championship, however, still maintains an additional qualifying tournament - from which [[Kirk Shepherd]] emerged and went on to reach the world final itself in 2008. This was dropped for the 2010 running of the event, however it was reinstated for 2011.

===Entries===
PDPA members must enter events through the PDC's online entry system, while non-PDPA members must enter through the local organiser for the relevant event. The entry fee for all Players Championships is £100 for Tour Card holders.

In addition, seedings for Players Championship events are determined by a one-year rolling Players Championship Order of Merit, consisting of prize money won in Players Championships over the 12 months before that event. The top 32 players in the Order of Merit that have entered the tournament are seeded.

All UK Players Championship events have a 128-player draw.

All non-UK Players Championship events consist of no more than 256 players, with all Tour Card holders that have entered the event starting at the last 128 stage.

If fewer than 128 players enter a Players Championship event, byes are awarded to players in order of their seeding. For example, if there is one bye, the number 1 seed will receive a bye into the last 64.

===Prize money===
The prize money for PDC Pro Tour events has increased steadily over the years. Prize money is awarded to all players who reach at least the last 64 of a Pro Tour event. In the past, Players Championships held outside of Europe awarded less prize money than those held in the United Kingdom or Europe.

In 2011, all Players Championship events and UK Open qualifiers awarded £34,600 each, but from 2013 on Players Championship events awarded £50,000.

Up to 2013 on the Pro Tour, there was also a rolling jackpot for [[nine-dart finish|nine-dart finishes]]. £500 (Players Championship events) / £400 (UK Open qualifiers) per event is reserved for any player who hits a nine-dart finish, with the money rolling over to the next event if the feat is not achieved. If more than one player hits a nine-darter in an event, the jackpot is shared.

==UK Open Regional Finals/Qualifiers==
The [[UK Open (darts)|UK Open]] is a major tournament which took place at Bolton's [[Reebok Stadium]] each year in June from 2003-2013. From 2014 onwards it has taken place in March at Minehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about UK Open|url=http://www.bigweekends.com/your-break/133713|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|title=PDC event list|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/EventList.aspx|publisher=Darts Database|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the televised event, there are eight UK Open Qualifiers (originally named Regional Finals), where the prize money won is collated into a UK Open Order of Merit table which determines 96 qualifiers for the UK Open finals in Bolton. From 2003-2015 there were ties and a preliminary round would be used to reduce the field to 96. In 2016 ties were scrapped and count back was used to separate players who were level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coral UK Open Field Confirmed|url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/yjzmh3nh2krf1pi5o74kn09vb/title/coral-uk-open-field-confirmed|publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation]]|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=7 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223033958/http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/yjzmh3nh2krf1pi5o74kn09vb/title/coral-uk-open-field-confirmed|archivedate=23 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournaments are organised in a similar fashion to the Players Championships in that 32 boards are in operation for a non-televised "floor tournament", completed inside one day. During the 2007-08 UK Open, sponsors [[The Rank Group#Blue Square|Blue Square]] streamed live coverage of these Regional Finals on the internet.

From 2011 until 2013, the UK Open Qualifiers were held on four double-header weekends instead of being held on eight Sundays. From 2014 onwards there were only 6 UK Open Qualifiers.&lt;ref name=da/&gt;

===Player eligibility===
Until the 2010 UK Open, a player must have competed in at least three Qualifiers before being able to qualify for the televised stages. From 2011 onwards, this was reduced to two Qualifiers.

Until 2007-08, the tournaments were open to all darts players, which meant that players from both darts organisations, the PDC and the [[British Darts Organisation|BDO]] were able to compete. They are now restricted to PDPA members only.

==PDC European Tour==
{{main|PDC European Tour}}
In 2012, the PDC introduced a series of five tournaments held across Europe known as the European Tour. The number of events has steadily risen with eight held in 2013 and 2014, nine in 2015, and there will be ten held in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/european-tour/article/1js2wgl8c4lpm1rmfay2g9npyb/title/2015-european-tour-update | title=2015 European Tour Update | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events see the top players on the [[PDC Order of Merit]] compete against players from a UK qualifier, European qualifier and home nations qualifier (the country where the event is held). Currently the prize fund for each tournament is £135,000, with £25,000 going to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/news/article/1gx38ghla22uw1c49krgw4bv65/title/record-prize-money-on-offer-in-2017 | title=Record Prize Money On Offer In 2017 | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events differ to others held on the Pro Tour as they are played on one board in front of an audience. They are not televised, but selected events have been available on the PDC's YouTube channel in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdc.tv/european-tour/article/145606y570pmx1e0hgaeizn80j/title/et1-live--free-on-youtube | title=ET1 Live &amp; Free On YouTube | publisher=[[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] | accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red mercury''' is a substance of uncertain composition purportedly used in the creation of nuclear bombs, as well as a variety of unrelated weapons systems. It is considered a hoax and the existence of such a substance has not been documented. Samples of "red mercury" obtained from arrested would-be terrorists invariably consisted of nothing more than various red dyes or powders. It has been suggested these may have been sold as part of a campaign intended to flush out potential nuclear smugglers.

It is purported to be [[Mercury(II) iodide|mercuric iodide]], a poisonous, odorless, tasteless, water-insoluble scarlet-red powder that becomes yellow when heated above 126&amp;nbsp;°C, due to a [[thermochromism|thermochromatic]] change in crystalline structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnnbJG7f7dwC&amp;pg=PT290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Introduction to Materials Chemistry |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |first=Harry R. |last=Allcock |date=29 September 2011 |isbn=9781118210987 |chapter=3.

The "red mercury" hoax was first reported in 1979, and was commonly discussed in the media in the 1990s. Prices as high as $1,800,000 per kilogram were reported.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02385950 |issn=0236-5731 |volume=235 |issue=1-2 |pages=129–132 |last=Grant |first=P.

== History ==

References to red solid mercury first appeared in major Soviet and western media sources in the late 1980s. The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of [[boosted fission weapon]]s. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point the exact nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported in 1992, a [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] report outlined that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because it came from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury's stock in trade.

The report, compiled by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the [[Stealth technology|stealth]] bomber? What you need is red mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William |last=Bown |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13418241.900-only-fools-still-hunt-for-elusive-red-mercury-.html |title=Only fools still hunt for elusive red mercury |work=[[New Scientist]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=6 June 1992 |accessdate=15 May 2014 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A key event in the history of the red mercury story was an article in the daily Russian newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' in 1993. Claiming to be based on leaked top secret memos, they noted that red mercury was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'Stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads. Primary end-users are major aerospace and nuclear-industry companies in the United States and France along with nations aspiring to join the nuclear club, such as South Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Libya.&lt;ref name=Yelysingate&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/yeltsingate/ |title=Yeltsingate |work=nti.org |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |date=17 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two TV documentaries about red mercury were made by [[Channel 4|British Channel 4 television]], airing in 1993 and 1994, ''Trail of Red Mercury'' and ''Pocket Neutron'', which claimed to have "startling evidence that Russian scientists have designed a miniature neutron bomb using a mysterious compound called red mercury".&lt;ref name=doomsday&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Doomsday Scam |author=C. J. Chivers |authorlink=C. J. Chivers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/the-doomsday-scam.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |page=MM35 |date=November 22, 2015 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel T. Cohen]], an American physicist who worked on building the atomic bomb, said in his autobiography that red mercury is manufactured by "mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam."  When detonated, this mixture allegedly becomes "extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb."&lt;ref name=doomsday /&gt;

Red mercury was offered for sale throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who found many buyers who would pay almost anything for the substance even though they had no idea what it was.  A study for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' in 1997 has perhaps the best summary of the topic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per kilogram. Sometimes the material would be irradiated or shipped in containers with radioactive symbols, perhaps to convince potential buyers of its strategic value. But samples seized by police contained only [[mercury(II) oxide]], [[mercury(II) iodide]], or mercury mixed with red dye—hardly materials of interest to weapons-makers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the arrest of several men in Britain in September 2004, on suspicion that they were trying to buy a kilogram of red mercury for £300,000, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. "Red mercury doesn't exist," said the spokesman. "The whole thing is a bunch of [[wikt:malarkey|malarkey]]."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; When the case came to trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in April 2006, it became apparent that ''[[News of the World]]''{{'}}s "fake sheikh" [[Mazher Mahmood]] had worked with the police to catch the three men, Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare. They were tried for "trying to set up funding or property for terrorism" and "having an article (a highly dangerous mercury based substance) for terrorism". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, but whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4943122.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Terror accused in 'mercury sting' | date=25 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three men were acquitted in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5176382.stm | work=BBC News | first=Chris | last=Summers | title=What is red mercury? | date=25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5176522.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Trio cleared of red mercury plot | date=25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

A variety of different items have been chemically analyzed as putative samples of "red mercury" since the substance first came to the attention of the media, but no single substance was found in these items. A sample of radioactive material was seized by German police in May 1994. This consisted of a complex mixture of elements, including about 10% by weight [[plutonium]], with the remainder consisting of 61% [[mercury (element)|mercury]], 11% [[antimony]], 6% [[oxygen]], 2% [[iodine]] and 1.6% [[gallium]]. A formula reported for the powder component of the mixture was Hg&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ([[mercury(II) cyclopyrorthoantimonate]]), with some of the mercury present in its pure metallic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.10.161 |issn = 0925-8388 |volume = 444-445 |pages = 57–62 |last = Wallenius |first = Maria |first2 = Klaus |last2 = Lützenkirchen |first3=Klaus |last3=Mayer |first4=Ian |last4=Ray |first5=Laura |last5=Aldave de las Heras |first6=Maria |last6=Betti |first7=Omer |last7=Cromboom |first8=Marc |last8=Hild |first9=Brian |last9=Lynch |first10=Adrian |last10=Nicholl |first11=Herbert |last11=Ottmar |first12=Gert |last12=Rasmussen |first13=Arndt |last13=Schubert |first14=Gabriele |last14=Tamborini |first15=Hartmut |last15=Thiele |first16=Werner |last16=Wagner |first17=Clive |last17=Walker |first18=Evelyn |last18=Zuleger |title = Nuclear forensic investigations with a focus on plutonium |journal = Journal of Alloys and Compounds |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838806016653 |subscription=yes |date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why somebody had assembled this complex mixture of chemicals is unknown; equally puzzling was the presence of fragments of glass and brush bristles, suggesting that someone had dropped a bottle of this substance and then swept it up into a new container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719914.300-fissile-fingerprints.html?page=1 |title=Fissile Fingerprints |work=[[New Scientist]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=19 August 1995 |first=Rob |last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, an analysis reported in 1998 of a different "red mercury" sample concluded that this sample was a non-radioactive mixture of elemental mercury, water and [[mercury(II) iodide]], which is a red colored chemical.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; Similarly, another analysis of a sample recovered in Zagreb in November 2003 reported that this item contained only mercury.&lt;ref name=Sudac&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.nimb.2007.04.015 |volume = 261 |issue = 1-2 |pages = 922–924 |last = Obhoðas |first = Jasmina |first2 = Davorin |last2=Sudac |first3=Sasa |last3=Blagus |first4=Vladivoj |last4=Valkovic |title = Analysis of an object assumed to contain "Red Mercury" |journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B |year = 2007 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X07007471 |bibcode = 2007NIMPB.261..922O  |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One formula that had been claimed previously for red mercury was Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; ([[mercury(II) pyroantimonate]]), but no antimony was detected in this 2003 sample.&lt;ref name=Sudac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Explanations ==
Red mercury was described by many commentators,{{who|date=June 2011}} and the exact nature of its supposed working mechanism varied widely among them. In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable.

===Background===
Traditional [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged thermonuclear weapons]] consist of two parts, a [[Nuclear fission|fission]] "primary" and a fusion/fission "secondary". The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed.

The primary is generally built as small as possible, due to the fact that the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary that can be built, known as the [[critical mass]]. For weapons grade [[plutonium]], this is around 10&amp;nbsp;kg. This can be reduced through the use of [[neutron reflector]]s or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device.

Due to the need for a fission primary, and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of [[arms control]] efforts to limit [[nuclear proliferation]] rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.

===Shortcut to fissionable material===
A theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with [[Zippe-type centrifuge]]s, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated{{who|date=June 2011}} to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon.

===Shortcut to fusible material===
A key part of the secondary in a [[fusion bomb]] is [[Isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]]-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy [[neutron]]s, Li-6 creates [[tritium]], which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hibbs | first = Mark | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = 'Red mercury' is lithium-6, Russian weaponsmiths say | journal = Nucleonics Week | volume = | issue = 10 | pages = | date = 22 July 1993 | url = | doi = | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Ragheb [https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Isotopic%20Separation%20and%20Enrichment.pdf Isotopic Separation and Enrichment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218200812/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Isotopic%20Separation%20and%20Enrichment.pdf |date=2012-12-18 }} Nuclear Power Engineering, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red mercury as a ballotechnic===
[[Samuel T. Cohen]], the "father of the [[neutron bomb]]", claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a [[ballotechnics|ballotechnic]]. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapon]]. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of [[softball]]-sized [[Pure fusion weapon|pure fusion bombs]] weighing as little as {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}}, which he claimed were made in large numbers.&lt;ref name=fse&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cohen | first = Sam | author-link =  | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Joe | author2-link =  | title = The nuclear threat that doesn't exist - or does it? | publisher = Financial Sense Editorials | date = 11 March 2003 | url = http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | accessdate =  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081016050603/http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | archivedate = 16 October 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately keeping it "under wraps" due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President [[Boris Yeltsin]] took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers.&lt;ref name=fse/&gt;

Cohen's claims appear to be difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears{{who|date=June 2011}} that the "red mercury" approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required. Furthermore, ballotechnic materials are those that do ''not'' explode, so it is difficult to understand how their energy could be used to produce compression at all.{{original research inline|date=June 2011}}

Additionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen's claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists{{who|date=June 2011}} in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including [[Edward Teller]].

According to Cohen,&lt;ref name=fse/&gt; veteran nuclear weapon designer Dr. [[Frank Barnaby]] conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and [[Irradiation|irradiating]] the resultant [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Barnaby | first = Frank | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Red mercury: Is there a pure-fusion bomb for sale? | journal = International Defense Review | volume = | issue = 6 | pages = 79–81 | year = 1994 | url = | doi = | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Adam | first = David | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = What is red mercury? | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | date = 30 September 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/sep/30/thisweekssciencequestions1 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stealth paint===
As mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term "red mercury" was in the Russian newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', which claimed that red mercury was "a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads."&lt;ref name=Yelysingate /&gt; Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story.

===Metallic hydrogen===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Given that [[metallic hydrogen]] (MH) is theorized to exist, and was allegedly produced in a laboratory in 2016, as reported in the journal ''Science'', it is possible, though unlikely, that it may have been discovered earlier through unrelated experimentation, and so-called "red mercury" may in fact be MH.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It has been said{{By whom|date=July 2017}} that one possible way to make it in bulk is to use a hydrogen-rich polymer under high pressure and/or pulsed laser irradiation, but the sample found so far is reportedly a shiny red metal.
If MH is indeed metastable, then it would theoretically make a very effective explosive in the right configuration, 38 times more powerful than RDX, and ideal for replacing the shaped charges used in a conventional warhead.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Project Orion may well have used a variant of this, had it not been canceled due to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Intriguingly, MH is also theorized to be a superconductor well above room temperature, so it may have found applications in sensors and powerful computers even without the ability to make it in bulk.  Some reports suggest that the sample obtained shows weak signs of a [[Meissner effect]] even at 250K.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Nuclear "sting" operations===
Red mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA313|page=313|author=Eric Croddy, James J. Wirtz|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History|volume=Volume 2|year=2005|isbn=1-85109-490-3|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One televised report indicated that the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged the [[KGB]] and [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] to arrange [[sting operation]]s for the detection of those seeking to deal in nuclear materials.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Soviet intelligence services allegedly created a myth of the necessity of "red mercury" for the sorts of nuclear devices that [[terrorism|terrorists]] and rogue governments might seek. Political entities that already had nuclear weapons did nothing to debunk the myth.

In 1999 ''Jane's Intelligence Review'' suggested that victims of red mercury scams may have included Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/the-doomsday-scam.html|title=The Doomsday Scam|publisher=The New York Times|author=C. J. Chivers|date=Nov 19, 2015|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red mercury in southern Africa ===
Organizations involved in [[mine clearance|landmine clearance]] and unexploded munitions disposal noted a belief amongst some communities in southern Africa that red mercury may be found in certain types of ordnance. Attempting to extract red mercury, purported to be highly valuable, was reported as a motivation for people dismantling items of unexploded ordnance, and suffering death or injury as a result. In some cases it was reported that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately promoting this misconception in an effort to build a market for recovered ordnance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landmineaction.org/resources/resource.asp?resID=1051 |title=Explosive remnants of War: unexploded ordnance and post-conflict communities |work=landmineaction.org |publisher=Landmine Action |date=31 March 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211075530/http://www.landmineaction.org/resources/resource.asp?resID=1051 |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosion in [[Chitungwiza]], Zimbabwe that killed five people is attributed to a quest to reclaim red mercury from a live landmine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soldier, ex-cop ‘among dead’ in Zengeza blast|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-10095-Soldier,+ex-cop+%E2%80%98among+Zengeza+dead/news.aspx|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
In April 2009 it was reported from Saudi Arabia that rumors that Singer sewing machines contained "red mercury" had caused the prices of such machines to massively increase in the Kingdom, with some paying up to [[Saudi riyal|SR]]200,000 for a single machine which could previously have been bought for SR200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/15/2543046.htm |title=Red mercury hoax sparks sewing machine frenzy |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers in the rumor claimed that the presence of red mercury in the sewing machines' needles could be detected using a mobile telephone; if the line cut off when the telephone was placed near to the needle, this supposedly proved that the substance was present.

In [[Medina]] there was a busy trade in the sewing machines, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while it was reported that others had resorted to theft, with two tailors' shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen. At other locales, there were rumors that a Kuwait-based multinational had been buying up the Singer machines, while in Al-Jouf, the residents were led to believe that a local museum was buying up any such machines that it could find, and numerous women appeared at the museum offering to sell their Singer machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Al-Maqati | first = Abdullah | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = ‘Red mercury’ rumors gain ground | newspaper = [[Saudi Gazette]] | pages =  | date = 14 April 2009 | url = http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009041435015&amp;archiveissuedate=14/04/2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716185425/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009041435015&amp;archiveissuedate=14%2F04%2F2009 | archivedate = 16 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little agreement among believers in the story as to the exact nature or even color of the red mercury, while the supposed uses for it ranged from it being an essential component of nuclear power, to having the ability to summon [[jinn]], extract gold, or locate buried treasure and perform other forms of magic. The official spokesman for the [[Riyadh]] police said that the rumors had been started by gangs attempting to swindle people out of their money, and denied the existence of red mercury in sewing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Al-Maqati | first = Abdullah | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = ‘Red mercury’ rumors gain ground | newspaper = [[Saudi Gazette]] | pages =  | date = 14 April 2009 | url = http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009041435015&amp;archiveissuedate=14/04/2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716185425/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009041435015&amp;archiveissuedate=14%2F04%2F2009 | archivedate = 16 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danius is the daughter of the author Anna Wahlgren (b. 1942) and Lars Danius (1907-1996).&lt;ref name="vemardet" /&gt; She is the oldest of eight siblings and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/17/the-ugly-scandal-that-cancelled-the-nobel-prize-in-literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Danius graduated from [[University of Stockholm]] in 1986. She received her [[Master of Arts]] in Critical Theory at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 1989. In 1997 she became a Ph.D. at [[Duke University]], and in 1999 she received a Ph.D. degree at Uppsala University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webappl.web.sh.se/p3/ext/content.nsf/aget?openagent&amp;key=sh_personal_profil_sv_657229 Sara Danius], profile at [[Södertörn University]] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has published on the relationship between literature and society, and written about [[Marcel Proust]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[James Joyce]].

'''Sexecology''' (also ecosexuality) is a radical form of [[environmental activism]] based around nature fetishism, the idea of the earth as a lover. It invites people to treat the earth with love rather than see it as an infinite resource to exploit.&lt;ref name="Lechner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lechner|first=Marie|title=Annie Sprinkle, un cas d'écolo-sexe|url=http://next.liberation.fr/arts/2013/09/25/annie-sprinkle-un-cas-d-ecolo-sexe_934661|publisher=Next Libération|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Elizabeth Stephens]] and [[Annie Sprinkle]], who describe themselves as "two ecosexual artists-in-love", whose manifesto is to make environment activism "more sexy, fun, and diverse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=sexecology.org|title=Sex Ecology|url=http://sexecology.org/|accessdate=22 October 2013| date=n.d.|publisher=Elizabeth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexecology employs [[absurdist humor]], [[performance art]] and [[sex-positivity]], which Stephens claims "may produce new forms of knowledge that hold potential to alter the future by privileging our desire for the Earth to function with as many diverse, intact and flourishing ecological systems as possible."&lt;ref name=ES&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Elizabeth Stephens|website=elizabethstephens.org|title=PAR: ''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story''|url=http://elizabethstephens.org/par-goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story/|accessdate=22 October 2013|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corinne|first=Van Houten|title=Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story: Beth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle Marry A Mountain| journal=Artcore| date=July 21, 2013|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://artcorejournal.net/2013/07/21/goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story-beth-stephens-and-annie-sprinkle-marry-a-mountain-by-corinne-van-houten/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reed |first=Jennifer J. |year=2015 |editor-last=Anderlini-D’Onofrio   |editor-first=SerenaGaia  |editor2-last=Hagamen |editor2-first=Lindsay  |title=From Ecofeminism to Ecosexuality: Queering the Environmental Movement |url=https://www.academia.edu/6147985/From_Ecofeminism_to_Ecosexuality_Queering_the_Environmental_Movement |journal=Ecosexuality: When Nature Inspires the Arts of Love |pages=92–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple promote education, events such as the ecosex symposium, and activism, such as protecting the Appalachian Mountains from [[Mountaintop removal mining|mountain top removal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Difference from ecofeminism ==
Sexecology conceives of the earth not as a mother, but as a lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Stephens|url=http://art.ucsc.edu/faculty/elizabeth-stephens|work=Faculty List|publisher=Art Faculty UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=22 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101000948/http://art.ucsc.edu/faculty/elizabeth-stephens |archivedate=1 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptual shift invites people to engage their bodies and senses in acts of environmental preservation.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt;

Unlike [[ecofeminism]], sexecology does not see an intrinsic link between women and nature; some of the limitations of ecofeminism which sex ecology indirectly addresses are "the reliance on women's biological functions to establish a connection between women and nature, the uncritical over-privileging of women's experiences, the inappropriateness of designating ideal female characteristics, and the regressive political implications of associating women with nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archambault|first=Anne|title=A Critique of Ecofeminism|journal=Canadian Woman Studies|volume=13|issue=3|page=21|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/cws/article/download/10403/9492|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The formulation of an Eco-Sexual identity is a practice of an erotic eco-logic, deconstructing heteronormative constructions of gender, sex, sexuality, and nature in order to continually queer and destabilize identities, actively form and retain spaces of lack that necessitate interdependency, and engage a permeable sensuous self in perpetual sensorial reciprocity with the sensing and sensible more-than-human environment. It is an identity identified by desire rather than a stable essence or being, and it is a desire for the more-than-human environment in which the human subject is sensorially implicit."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecosexuals==

Proponents of this movement are called "ecosexuals"; they are unafraid to engage in and embrace their erotic experience with the earth, such as bathing naked, having sex with vegetables or having an orgasm in a waterfall.&lt;ref name="Lechner"/&gt; Stephens describes ecosexuals as people who "... are related to [[cyborgs]] and are not afraid of engaging in intercourse with nature and/or with technology for that matter. We make love with the Earth through our senses."&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt;

Ecosexuals range from those who use sustainable sex products and like being nude in nature to those who "roll around in the dirt having an orgasm covered in potting soil" and those who "masturbate under a waterfall"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/ecosexuals-believe-having-sex-with-the-earth-could-save-it|title=Ecosexuals Believe Having Sex with the Earth Could Save It {{!}} VICE {{!}} United States|date=2016-11-02|newspaper=VICE|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-02|author=Neil McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Sprinkle and Stephens] have officiated wedding ceremonies where they and fellow ecosexuals marry the earth, the moon, and other natural entities" &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They have also stated that they believe there are over 100,000 people who identify as ecosexual worldwide&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Stefanie Iris Weiss wrote a book about using sustainable sex products called ''Eco-sex: Go Green Between the Sheets and Make Your Love Life Sustainable''. She brings up the environmental impact and the carbon footprint we leave behind when using condoms, lube, and other sex products. The overall purpose of the book is to bring awareness of the environmental impact of current sex products while introducing more eco-friendly alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecosex.net/ecosex-the-book-2/|title=Eco-Sex: The Book {{!}} Eco-Sex|website=ecosex.net|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human/nonhuman relationships ==

Sexecology seeks to direct attention towards “the ways in which sex and sexuality affect the larger nonhuman world.” Ecosexuality is an orientation directed toward the non-human material world. With this direction, ecosexuality makes a bold statement that “these human bodies are part of the nonhuman material world.” The blur between human and non-human entities is essential to Sprinkles and Stephens’ demonstration of sexecology.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Michael. "Material Entanglements With the Nonhuman World: Theorizing Ecosexualities in Performance." Electronic Thesis or Dissertation. Ohio State University, 2015.OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center. 02 Dec 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexecology was influenced by contemporary theories around [[posthumanism]] and the relationships between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna|title=When Species Meet|year=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|pages=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Donna Haraway|Haraway]]’s work has guided my understanding of the material consequences and the theoretical underpinnings embedded in human/nonhuman relationships that matrix our world. This has helped me understand how [[human exceptionalism]] has been constructed and privileged throughout the history of religion and science as well as in other secular practices in western culture. Human exceptionalism, in collaboration with [[global capitalism]], has created the isolated space necessary for the ongoing practices that have produced the dangerously degraded environmental conditions in which we now live. The belief systems and ideologies that allow some people to think that they have the [[Darwinian fitness|Darwinian survival skill]] and the rights that accompany those skills to use or destroy other human and non humans is now causing the kind of [[environmental degradation]] that affects the whole system sooner or later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elizabethstephens.org/par-goodbye-gauley-mountain-an-ecosexual-love-story/|title=PAR: Goodbye Gauley Mountain:An Ecosexual Love Story|last=Stephens|first=Elizabeth|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances and workshops==

“The Love Art Lab projects aim to instill hope, create an antidote to fear, and act as a call for action.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anniesprinkle.org/projects/current-projects/assuming-the-ecosexual-position-adventures-of-the-love-art-lab/|title=Assuming the Ecosexual Position: Adventures of the Love Art Lab |website=anniesprinkle.org|date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a private demonstration into the work of the two founders of the movement, Sprinkles and Stephens, as the research how to become "lovers with the earth. The performances can be privately booked by contacting the two and are meant to be demonstrational, informative, and "radical."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sprinkles and Stephens have performed a number of "weddings to the earth" across the world intended to break the barrier between human sexuality and nature. The performances include "Wedding to the Dirt, Wedding to Lake Kallavesi, Wedding to the Coal, Wedding to the Rocks, Wedding to the Snow, Wedding to the Moon, Wedding to the Appalachian Mountains, Wedding to the Earth, and Wedding to the Sea", to date. The intention, according to Sprinkles, is to "…shift the metaphor from ‘Earth as Mother’ to ‘Earth as Lover´" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexecology.org/ecosex-weddings/|title=Ecosex Weddings, weddings with nonhuman natural elements| website=sexecology.org| date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprinkles and Stephens have performed a two women show 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth (Theatre Piece) at the Kosmos Theatre in Vienna in 2010 to demonstrate how to "make love with the earth", including talking, singing, dancing, and stroking natural objects. The performances are educational as well as self-promoting of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexecology.org/projects/dirty-sexecology-25-ways-to-make-love-to-the-earth/|title=Dirty Sexecology: 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth (Theater Piece)|website=sexecology.org|date=n.d.|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic strategies of sexecology are influenced by [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of [[social sculpture]], which sees art as having the potential to transform society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beuys|first=Joseph|title=What is Art?|year=2004|publisher=Clairview|location=Forest Row|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beuys|first=Joseph|title=Joseph Beuys in America : Energy Plan for the Western Man : Writings by and Interviews with the Artist|year=1990|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... the production of visible art may effect the production of invisible ideological and class relations. For Joseph Beuys, sculpture and artistic creativity hold the potential to reshape the educational and governmental institutions that produce ideological subjects, as well as social, political, and economic systems. Art, Beuys argues, is the necessary condition for the production of a revolutionary society because it can both unravel the old order and engage everyone in the production of a new social order."&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

Ecosexuals have held a number of educational workshops.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} They have engaged in on-site environmental activism, such as "Occupy Bernal"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and protests against mountaintop removal, as shown in the film "Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story."

===''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story'' (film) ===

''Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story'' (2013) is a [[autoethnographic]] documentary film by Elizabeth Stephens with Annie Sprinkle about the environmental issue of [[Mountaintop removal]] in [[West Virginia, United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-archer/mountaintop-removal-two-e_b_4312730.html|title=Mountaintop Removal: Two Ecosexuals Fight Back Hard.|last=Archer|first=Greg|date=20 November 2013|website=|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Virginia native Stephens returns to her childhood home to create a film that incorporates autobiography, a brief history of the coal industry, an inventory of activist strategies, an eco-sexual mini-manifesto, and finally, an example of the performance art Stephens and Sprinkle often employ to express their ecosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Tammy|year=2014|title=Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story|url=https://www.academia.edu/9744023/Film_Review_of_Goodbye_Gauley_Mountain_An_Ecosexual_Love_Story_|journal=Journal of Appalachian Studies|volume= 20| issue = 1|pages=91–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens presents a community struggling to rectify their love of their natural mountainous environment with the fact that its destruction via MTR provides the local economy. The piece explores the negative consequences of mountaintop removal, both cosmetic and environmental, and culminates in an exploration of ecosexuality, followed by wedding ceremony in which Stephens and Sprinkle "marry" the mountain. “Ecosexuality inserts an ‘erotic’ humor that plays against the horrific subject matter. So far the feedback that I’ve received at film previews makes me realize that these are effective strategies for creating space to briefly cut the feeling of despair that MTR evokes.”

A '''singing telegram''' is a message that is delivered by an [[artist]] in a musical form.  Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal [[telegram]]s, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.  Singing telegrams are often given as a gift.

[[Western Union]], the American [[telegraph]] company began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star [[Rudy Vallee]] a birthday greeting by telegram. [[George P. Oslin]] (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular.  He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | title = Special delivery: The singing telegram endures | newspaper = Columbia News Service | date = July 7, 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108220256/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-07-07/168.asp | archivedate = November 8, 2006 | df =  | author=Liz Sadler }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought "that messages should be fun," he recalled that he "was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = George Oslin, 97, creator of the singing telegram | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 31, 1996 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Western Union Tuning Out Singing Telegram | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1972 | page = 27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
A '''DIY singing telegram''' is a specially written song all about the person in karaoke DVD form, so that any singer anywhere in the world can deliver the fully personalised singing telegram.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Kissogram===
A '''kissogram''', also called '''kissagram''' (short for kissing [[telegram]]), is a [[message]] delivered along with a [[kiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/kissogram |title=Definition of kissogram |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually arranged as a fun surprise for a person for a special occasion. Message deliverers can be hired either by themselves, or as part of an [[Employment agency|agency]]. A kissogram is usually presented by a performer dressed in a costume or uniform such as a [[police officer]], [[nurse]], [[french maid]] or [[nun]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term was used in the TV program Doctor Who to describe the profession of Doctor Who's companion Amy Pond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a197176/new-who-companion-has-kissogram-job/|title=New 'Who' companion 'has kissogram job'|date=2010-01-18|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stripogram===
A '''stripogram''' or '''strippergram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strippergram|title=strippergram - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of message delivery in which a [[stripper]] will perform a [[striptease]] while singing or dancing.  The word is a combination of [[telegram]] and striptease.  This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to the UK and Europe during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thecelebratedmisterk|title=Newsroom Stripper|date=2012-03-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lusr48t3cBM|accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a [[birthday]], [[anniversary]] or [[bachelor party]].  A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some form of charade connected with this, before commencing their act - for example a police officer 'arresting' somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended 'victim' has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety. Unlike an escort who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant and is not chaperoned. Now-a-days, some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

==Star System==
In the early 1980s, a collaboration of independent singing telegrams companies in the U.S. was formed by Larry Balsamo, Hey!Wires Sing Telegrams in Chicago. Similar to [[Florists' Transworld Delivery]], the Star System was a referral system for people to send a singing telegram to friends and family throughout the United States.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 season 5, episode 1 of The Bob Newhart Show, Bob receives a singing telegram announcing a visit from his college roommate and his new wife.  

In the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Sam Lowry ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) received an invitation to his mother's party via singing telegram. When told the message had been sent Reply Paid, he attempted to sing his reply.

In ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', 1985, a singing telegram ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) arrives and is shot on the doorstep. She is later revealed to be a secret blackmail informant. 

In a classic episode of [[Sesame Street]], Grover poses as a singing telegram artist. He goes up to [[Mr. Johnson (Sesame Street)|Mr. Johnson]] singing a series of singing telegrams not directed for him until he eventually gives him the right telegram. The telegram is about Mr. Johnson's hat being found by someone in Buffalo, New York, but to Mr. Johnson's dismay, Grover forgets who sent the telegram.

In the 1987 [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]] episode "Soft Touch", [[Penny Parker]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) tries her hand at being a singing telegram deliveryperson. But due to her forgetfully visiting the wrong address, she happens to witness two thugs torturing a man.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'', 1991, Parry ([[Robin Williams]]) sends a singing telegram ([[Michael Jeter]]) to Lydia, the love interest in her office.

In the 2010 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Amy Pond]] worked delivering kissograms, prior to traveling with the Doctor.

The '''Surmic Languages''' are a branch of the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] language family.

==Languages==
*'''North''': [[Majang language|Majang]] (also known as Majangir)
*'''South'''
**'''Southeast''': 
***[[Kwegu language|Kwegu]] (dialects: Yidinich, Mugiji)
***'''Surma''': [[Me'en language|Me'en]], [[Mursi language|Mursi]]–[[Suri language|Suri]] (dialects: Tirma, Chai)
**'''Southwest''': [[Didinga language|Didinga]]–[[Narim language|Narim]], [[Murle language|Murle]], [[Tennet language|Tennet]]; [[Kacipo-Balesi language|Kacipo-Balesi]]

The Surmic languages are found in southwest [[Ethiopia]] and adjoining parts of southeast [[South Sudan]]. In the past, Surmic had been known as “Didinga-Murle” and “Surma”.  The former name was too narrow by referring only to two closely related languages and the latter was a label also used to refer to a specific language (Unseth 1997b), so the label “Surmic” is now used.  The relationships in the chart above are based on Fleming's work (1983).

Today, the various peoples who speak Surmic languages make their living in a variety of ways, including nomadic herders, settled farmers, slash and burn farmers.  They live in a variety of terrain, from the lowlands of South Sudan and the banks of the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] to mountains over 2,300 meters.

Much foundational fieldwork and analysis of Surmic languages was done by [[Harold C. Fleming]] and [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|M. L. Bender]]. The most complete descriptions of Ethiopian Surmic languages are of Murle (Arensen 1982) and Tirma (Bryant 1999).  All Surmic languages are presumed to be tonal, have implosive consonants, and have distinctive vowel length.  Some have as many as nine vowel qualities, and more detailed study may confirm this in other Surmic languages, also.  [[Me'en language|Me'en]] and [[Kwegu language|Kwegu]] (also spelled Koegu) have sets of [[ejective consonants]].

The languages share a system of marking the number of both the possessed and the possessor in possessive pronouns (Unseth 1991).  Number of nominals is typically marked on a number of morphemes, with t/k marking singular and plural (Bryan 1959).  Adjectives are formed by stative relative clauses.

[[Majangir]] (also called Majang) and Southwest Surmic languages (Fleming 1983) share a number of traits, so they are therefore presumably reconstructable in Proto-Surmic: relative clauses (which include adjectives), demonstratives, adverbs, numerals, genitives, and possessive pronouns follow their heads, noun derivations and subject marking on verbs are marked by suffixes, VSO ([[verb–subject–object]]) order predominates in indicative main clauses. Some typologically exceptional points are discussed by Arensen, et al. (1997). However, Dimmendaal’s introduction proposes a different analysis (1998).

All Surmic languages have been documented as having case suffixes (Unseth 1989). None of them have a marked accusative, but at least Majang and Murle sometimes mark nominatives, part of a broader areal pattern (König 2006).

The original geographic home of the Surmic peoples is thought to be in Southwestern Ethiopia, somewhere near [[Maji, Ethiopia|Maji]], with the various groups dispersing from there: for example, the Majangir having moved north, the Murle having migrated clockwise around [[Lake Turkana]] (Arensen 1983:56-61, Tornay 1981), and the Mursi having moved into and out of the Omo River valley. Ethnolinguistic identities within the Surmic group have not been rigid, with ample evidence of people’s identities shifting from one ethnolinguistic group to another (Tornay 1981, Turton 1979, Unseth and Abbink 1998).

Abbink has published a pioneering work comparing the vocabulary and systems of kinship among Surmic languages, particularly from the South West node of Surmic (Abbink 2006).

The starting point for linguistic and anthropological research into Surmic studies is the book edited by Dimmendaal (1998), especially the bibliography article (Abbink and Unseth 1998).

'''Third World Media''' is an adult entertainment production studio founded in 1999 by [[Steve Scott (producer)|Steve Scott]] and director [[Ed Hunter (director)|Ed Hunter]]. It was one of the first producers of entertainment featuring ethnic performers exclusively from outside the United States.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, pg. 144"&gt;X, Nelson: "Third World Media: First Rate Entertainment," August 2007, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
The company, initially named Asian Eyes Pictures, placed an emphasis on Japanese [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] content in its early years. As the company grew, it expanded its production to Southeast Asia and South America. In late 2006, Third World Media added Katana, a high-end Japanese lineup featuring popular Japanese [[AV Idol|AV stars]] and scripted, subtitled story lines.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, pg. 144"/&gt;

Scott, a fluent Japanese speaker, credits the growth of his company to his extensive travels in Asia. When Third World Media entered the adult market, the Japanese product entering the US market was produced for the Japanese domestic market, where penetration is blurred, or "[[pixelization|mosaiced]]" to conform with their laws. Third World Media produces movies for distribution outside Japan, and its hardcore products are shot without mosaics.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, pg. 144"/&gt;

Like the company's Asian titles, its Latin titles, which include [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] titles, are also produced to be sold primarily in the American market. Third World Media's veteran in-house director Ed Hunter makes frequent travels to South America to find performers who've never been seen by American audiences.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, pg. 144"/&gt; The company also added John Florian as its sales manager in January 2008.&lt;ref name=XBIZ2009-G&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=88469 "Third World, Combat Zone Bring On John Florian"], ''[[XBiz]]'', January 5, 2008. Retrieved 2009-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also the exclusive distributor of [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] performer [[Gia Darling]]'s production company, Gia Darling Entertainment.&lt;ref name=XBIZ2009&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=107207 "Third World Media Adds Gia Darling Titles"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820053052/http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=107207 |date=August 20, 2012 }}, ''[[XBiz]]'', April 15, 2009. Retrieved 2009-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other adult film stars featured in Third World Media movies include: Mai Haruna, [[Monica Mattos]], [[Chocoball Mukai]], [[Ed Powers]], [[Allanah Starr]], [[Gia Darling]], among others. Japanese [[AV idols]] Junko, featured in ''The Kimono Kronicles'',and Mirai Haneda, star of Hello ''Titty 3'', signed at Third World Media's 2008 [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]] booth.&lt;ref name=XBIZ2009-H&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=88287 "Japanese Adult Stars to Sign for Third World at AEE"], ''[[XBiz]]'', December 28, 2007.

The company was named the "Best Asian Release Company" in 2007 and 2008 by consumer adult video review magazine [[Adam Film World]].&lt;ref name=XBIZ2009-K&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=93231 "Adam Film World Names Annual Awards Winners"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826033927/http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=93231 |date=August 26, 2012 }}, ''[[XBiz]]'', April 30, 2008.

'''Vera Borea''' is a French fashion house founded in 1931 in Paris, France by Countess Borea de Buzzaccarini Regoli.

Vera Borea was one of the very first houses to offer luxury [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] for women.&lt;ref&gt;COUTURE – An illustrated History of the Great Paris designers and Their creations. Edited by Ruth Lynam with Introduction by Nancy White, former editor of Harper’s Bazaar, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc, New York City 1972, page 81 "Vera Borea was the most outstanding of small couture houses dedicated to sportswear"&lt;/ref&gt; The house produced high-end garments for ski, tennis, golf, beach, boating, motoring, biking and hunting, along day and evening dresses, accessories, shoes and jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, Feb. 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US.

== History ==

=== Sports Models for City Wear : A couture house dedicated to sportswear ===
{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}[[File:VERA BOREA-SAINT HONORE PARIS SHOP WINDOW-1948.jpg|thumb|267x267px|VERA BOREA Boutique Rue Saint-Honore in 1949]]

Countess de Regoli, a passionate sportswoman&lt;ref&gt;Femina Oct 1933&lt;/ref&gt; born and raised in Italian Dolomites, was frustrated by a lack of clothing that was chic yet comfortable and began to design sportswear, négligées and swimming suits featuring special knitting stitch invented by her grand mother&lt;ref&gt;Vogue US, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogue US, Oct 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  --&gt;

With assistance of her friend, the British-born Princess de Rohan, the Countess located her haute-couture salon at 29 rue d’Artois, at the very end of Faubourg Saint-Honoré. With growing success, the House established in 1935 a two-story shop at 376 [[Rue Saint-Honoré|rue Saint Honoré]], which remained open until 2007.

With a no-nonsense, hands-on approach, Countess de Regoli, an avid skier, swimmer and golfer, tried out her creations on herself before she offered them for sale, and often modelled them for clients.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The designs appeared smart enough to be worn in town, reuniting sports and town wardrobes.&lt;ref&gt;The Montreal Gazette, Sept 10th 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== International success ===
Vera Borea became soon the favorite destination on both sides of the Atlantic for women going for the new relaxed lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, Oct 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post Gazette, 9 June 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

American department stores snapped her designs &lt;ref&gt;''Kaufmann's Ad'', [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], 9 June 1932, pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt; and the House became the reference for garments that were simple in line but unusual in materials and cut, modern and practical. Vera Borea's creations often featured details that, beyond looking good, served a practical purpose and could be wore on multiple occasions such as after tennis, for motoring or on a shipboard.

Prestigious fashion magazines featured Vera Borea's creations alongside [[Hermès]], [[Lanvin (company)|Lanvin]], [[Chanel]] and [[Patou]].&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L’Officiel de la Mode, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, May 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jardins des Modes, Aug 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Her designs were copied with those of Vionnet, Schiaparelli,&lt;ref&gt;The Pittsburgh Press, 22 March 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Lanvin and Patou.&lt;ref&gt;The Pittsburgh Post, 9 July 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Scores of Americans soon joined the regular French clients at Borea's Paris salon,&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, Oct 1932&lt;/ref&gt; including famous sports women [[Helen Wills]] and Mademoiselle [[Suzanne Lenglen]]&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US Oct. 1932&lt;/ref&gt; and Hollywood movie stars such as [[Joan Bennett]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodi News Sentinel, 22 January 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the retirement of Countess de Regoli in 1962, Vera Borea was considered as one of the grand Parisian couturiers of its days and was a member of [[Haute couture|Parisian Haute-Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, "Profils des Grands Couturiers de Paris", Feb 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== A novel approach to elegance: relaxed simplicity, chic in details, gender fluidity ===
Vera Borea brought a sporty aesthetic and integrated the codes of athletic wear. The House started off designing daywear, and soon became known for garments that were elegant yet dynamic, stylish yet practical. Her creations often had unusual details that served a practical purpose. Even her evening wear, which she introduced a few seasons later, avoided superfluous details and instead focused on a superb cut, a comfortable fit, and excellent workmanship.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, April 1938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, May 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, Dec. 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the designer favored simple but noble materials like wool, linen, hemp, and cotton, often with a textured or nubby surface.&lt;ref&gt;THE NEW YORK TIMES, Published: 21 February 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Even when she used silk, it was usually in heavy woven patterns, which Vera Borea had made in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;La Soierie de Lyon : Syndicat des fabricants de soieries de Lyon. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

She borrowed liberally from menswear, and regularly used wool flannel, tweeds and pinstripes for her women's suits and separates.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, Mar 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE FR, Dec. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Even ski ensembles were made of wool flannel and were often shown with an ascot or a tie. Another example of mixing men's and women's codes could be seen in an extraordinary black velvet ski suit that Borea designed in 1933, which looked like a tuxedo and closed with metallic clips that echoed those of a ski boot. The designer re-visited the theme often, like an evening wear she designed in 1945 that sported a [[tuxedo]] top and a full skirt like a ballerina's tutu… decades before "le Smoking" burst onto the fashion scene.&lt;ref&gt;FEMINA 1945, Tuxedo Evening Wear by Vera Borea, illustrated by GRUAU&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Technical innovation ===
A constant desire to explore and innovate permeated Vera Borea's work. She figured out how to [[Corduroy|weather-proof corduroy]] and used it for a raincoat. Another raincoat was made of [[rubber]]. She spun [[hemp]] with silk for [[travel suits]]&lt;ref&gt;THE NEW YORK TIME, Published: 5 June 1932&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced in France the two-way-stretch elastic fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;THE NEW YORK TIME, Published : 21 May 1933&lt;/ref&gt; An evening coat was made of transparent fabric. An aviator jacket was made of supple leather and a knitted back panel, making it wearable both indoors and outdoors. Shoes sported heels made of rubber. Buttons were made of Brazil nuts. Other elements like fur, raffia, rope, bone, nut, feathers, pine cones and leather also showed up in her designs.&lt;ref&gt;THE NEW YORK TIMES, Published : 5 February 1933, pg. X9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 16 October 1959, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vera Borea Designs and Aesthetics  ==

'''Modern cuts for a modern lifestyle'''
[[File:VERA BOREA - White Beach Dress - 1934 July.png|thumb|White Beach Dress, July 1934]]
Vera Borea's garments were ingenious on both an aesthetic and a practical level.

For example, the designer introduced high-waisted pants that skimmed the body from just below the bust down to the waist, with no belt necessary. She lowered the waistline down to the hips for a slimming line. She showed the pants with a bolero, bomber jackets, cropped sweaters or full blouses, which enhanced the elongated effect.

Wrap blouses and dresses did away with a need for zippers, buttons and belts. Halter tops did away with collars. Flared and gored skirts provided fullness and ease of movement while avoiding the stiffness and puffiness of a gathered waistline. Judicious draping on dresses and jackets, inverted pleats on pants, set-in panels; all continued this body-conscious philosophy. Waistbands and cuffs became ribbed and elasticized, offering more comfort and a sleeker line, as well as protection against the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Harper’s Bazaar Magazine, October 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Scarves were built into blouses or jackets, or looped through a belt. Short sleeved jackets provided both polish and practicality. Pockets freed up a woman's hands, as did chains and clips, which held a clip-on cigarette case, a visor, or a pair of gloves. Collars disappeared from coats and jackets, or were shrunk down to a simple stand-up style. Kimono cut coats closed with sashes or one or two oversized buttons. A slim ribbed turtleneck pullover became one with the body and removed the need for a scarf to keep the wearer's throat warm. Thin ribbed pullovers were layered, making them ideal for cool temperatures or outdoor sports, but also easy to peel off once inside for maximum comfort.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, Oct 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

Vera Borea also made a mark with her swimsuits, which were often made from plain wool or cotton knits, and little ornament. The flair was in the details: low backs, criss-crossing straps, flared hips, discreet patterns. In 1934, the designer showed swimsuits worn under a matching skirt or flared shorts, giving women a new alternative to the fuller covering of an apron dress. With either option, a woman could simply slip on the skirt, shorts or dress over her swimsuit and go straight to lunch or jump into her car. An apron style sundress with a low back allowed women to soak up the sun's rays on the terrace of a restaurant. Pants got a cargo pocket and jackets incorporated pockets or deeply cuffed sleeves that could hold a swim cap or a wet bathing suit. The beach wear range grew to include sleeveless dresses with matching cotton coats and capri pants, oversized terry cloth lined jackets, high-waisted shorts and bra tops; with matching sandals, socks and beach bags.&lt;ref&gt;VOGUE US, March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

===1932===

Passionate about skiing, swimming and golf, Borea particularly enjoyed designing sportswear because she found it so difficult to buy clothing that was chic yet comfortable and well-priced. Her 1932 sports clothes designs included a skirt and waist-length jacket made of thick woolly tricot. These were worn in combination with
an ''open work'' inside sweater of the same color. A tweed top coat with a black belt and a loose wrap around front gave a harmonious silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Modes'', New York Times, 3 January 1932, pg. X11.&lt;/ref&gt; Paris fashion releases in the late spring were replete with frocks made of heavy black wool. Borea's black wool crepon frock had an incrusted collar and top sleeves of white shaved lamb.&lt;ref&gt;''Nonchalance Is Now Chic'', New York Times, 22 May 1932, pg. X9.&lt;/ref&gt; Her summer 1932 fashions emphasized a high-waist
effect, even when no belt was worn. The wearer's [[Human physical appearance|figure]] was closely fit from just below her bust to the waist. Borea's day skirts had hemlines from eight to ten inches from the ground. The designer favored materials which were quite rough and open-surfaced, primarily cotton or
woolen ones. These were tailored into small modern suits which were worn with blouses made of [[dimity]] or crocheted [[Irish people|Irish]]
linen thread. These featured turn down collars and [[muslin]] ties. For town wear Borea stressed rough linen fabrics and she often employed negligee materials in formal fashions. She rarely used silks, but sometimes created heavy basket or [[chevron (insignia)]] patterns, which she obtained 
hand woven from [[Italy]]. The youthful designs were without pretense and definitely were not [[flapper]]ish.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Features Cotton'', New York Times, 21 February 1932, pg. X13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VERA BOREA-BEACH ACCESSORIES RAFIA AND LEATHER-1935.jpg|thumb|Beach Accessories in interwoven Rafia and Leather, 1935]]

===1933===
Summer designs revealed in February 1933 marked a milestone in Borea's designing career. From this point she no longer showed pants, with the exception of [[plus fours]], which she styled for boating. Her very feminine sports frocks and evening gowns were quite similar, except for their
lengths. The frocks were shorter, sixteen inches off the floor, while the evening gowns were ankle-length. Both possessed accentuated sunburn [[decollete]]s, suspended from very small ribbon-threaded metal chains. Borea lowered the waistlines of her creations to the hipbone. Her fashions began to exaggerate fullness in overblouses and the wide, flared, gored skirts she designed. Borea's bathing suits were short and flaring, made from
plain wool or checked cotton. She created [[taffeta]] blouses with linen suits.&lt;ref&gt;''Vera Borea Makes Plus-Fours for Boating-Metal Trimmings Are a Novelty'', New York Times, 5 February 1933,
pg. X9.&lt;/ref&gt; For spring and summer Borea used knitted shoulder yokes. A white suede golf jacket she designed had a knitted white cotton yoke. 
Her mixed wool motor and travel coats featured knitted wool yokes in very dark tones. Borea's cotton or linen dresses and jackets had yokes with bright contrasts and belts of knitted wool.&lt;ref&gt;''Two-In-One'', New York Times, 19 February 1933, pg. X9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934===

A novelty introduced in January 1934 was the skirted bathing suit. A skirt was worn over [[maillot]] or flaring one-piece shorts. The separate
skirt began to outmode the fuller covering previously given by a beach apron. Borea's ''runner'' consisted of two flared panels which opened up on both sides. She used a large printed cotton handkerchief, which was popular in [[St. Tropez]]. Her creativity showed in the stylishness which she exhibited, working the scarves into new forms to cover backless frocks. Often the skirt was one color, the maillot another, and the wraplet a third. Some favored combinations were dark blue, venetian pink, and pale yellow, or Chinese blue, old rose, and beige.&lt;ref&gt;''Bathing Suits Undergoing Changes'', New York Times, 14 January 1934, pg. X9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VERA BOREA - SKI SUITS in Schenectady Gazette - Jan 1 1934.png|thumb|Ski suit in ''Schenectady Gazette'', 1 January 1934]]

===1935===
In May 1935 a copy of a Borea [[sundress]] sold for $5.95 in a Los Angeles store.
Made of cotton Indianhead, the dress left the entire back open to soak in the sun's warmth. It featured a block print with a natural background and a design of green or purple lines. The block print was also adorned with turquoise, gold, and [[coral (color)]]. The sundress was fashionable to wear over a bathing suit for a luncheon indoors at a beach club.&lt;ref&gt;''King Cotton Dresses His Attractive Subjects in Newest Smartly-Tailored Summer Styles'', [[Los Angeles Times]], 6 May 1935, pg. A6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borea's collection for fall 1935 included suits, jackets, and long redingotes, which were semi-fitted with leg-o'-mutton sleeves. Her fashions had a widening shoulder line. Her sports suits were uniquely cut in soft colored tweeds and were worn with dark [[crape]] shirts. The short sleeves on these shirts were also widened. Borea's day clothes featured a number of shades of gray-green. These were accentuated with buttons and scarves of yellow or guardsman's red. Bishop violet was a prominent color of Borea's evening wear designs. A nubby woolen, woven with bear's hair, was featured in the designer's sports wear. Her wool daytime frocks had velvet belts and trimmings. Highlights included pine-cone rosettes, which replaced sports buttons. Pheasant feathers were exhibited as trimming.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sports Suits Show Novel Trend'', New York Times, 7 August 1935, pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936===
In July Borea released a white flannel suit especially for the ''sea-cum-casino''. Worn with a chali blouse, it had subtle differences with suits introduced by [[Lucien Lelong]] and other designers.&lt;ref&gt;''Dressing The Part'', [[Manchester Guardian]], 20 July 1936, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938===
Borea' silhouette was characterized by moulded bodices, normal shoulders, small waists, and short skirts, with some of them pleated and others slightly flared. She often made use of linens for beach, town, and evening wear. She frequently employed an apronline, which was either draped or tied in the back. Other prominent features of note were striped and embroidered materials (often oriental types), and colored [[piping (sewing)]]. Her colorful printed frocks were worn beneath slim, dark coats.&lt;ref&gt;''By Wireless From Paris'', New York Times, 30 January 1938, pg. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939===
For fall 1939 Borea styled striped necktie wool dresses. Her daytime frocks were worn with necktie wool blouses and heavy leather belts. Wool
jackets were shown with plain skirts. Full skirted dresses with shirtwaist bodices were a part of her evening wear. One design was made in red and green vertical stripes. It tucked in at the waist. Her evening gowns were inspired from portraits by [[Velasquez]]. The features included long sleeves and gold buttons, with modern shirtwaist effects.&lt;ref&gt;''Double Bell Evening Silhouette Is Novel Idea of Paris Designer'', New York Times,
4 August 1939, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VERA BOREA-TENNIS DRESS-1948.png|thumb|Tennis suit, 1948]]

===1940===
Flared basques were created by Borea for wear in the evenings. Her styles displayed screw-head
buttons with a contrasting color on a square cut jacket. The look was very individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Summer Clothes In Paris'', Manchester Guardian, 27 May 1940, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1946===
Borea's 1946 fall collection was presented on 12 September at her Paris salon, which had been redecorated with white and red and massed with red flowers. The lines of her clothing designs were simple, with natural shoulders. Fullness was eschewed except for drapery featured on a
slim silhouette for evening. Among her fashions at the showing included a gray flannel ski suit with white leather suspenders and gold buckles. Borea introduced amber, mouse gray, and [[moss green]] corduroy box jackets over tweed suits or simple [[turtleneck]] wool dresses. Her town dresses and suits employed black wool bands or were inset with black velvet. Perhaps her most attractive ensemble in the collection was a mouse gray jacket with a plum [[frock]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sees Garb For Sportswomen'', New York Times, 13 September 1946, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959===

Borea designed a raincoat made from golden brown proofed corduroy. Its buttons were of embossed silver.&lt;ref&gt;''Rainwear a la Francaise'', [[The Guardian]], 16 October 1959, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viserys Targaryen''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and the [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|first season]] of the television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Viserys (along with his younger sister, Daenerys) is one of the last confirmed members of [[House Targaryen]] who, until fifteen years before the events of the first novel, ruled on the Iron Throne for nearly three hundred years.

Viserys is portrayed by [[Harry Lloyd]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/harry-lloyd/bio/harry-lloyd.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Viserys Targaryen played by Harry Lloyd |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones|work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Viserys Targaryen is the middle child and younger son of [[Aerys II Targaryen]], also known as The Mad King, and his sister-wife Rhaella Targaryen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/03/25/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-2/|title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones, Part 2|publisher=Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
===Novel===
[[File:Three dragons.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a red three-headed dragon on a black field over a scroll reading "Fire and Blood."|Coat of arms of House Targaryen]]
Viserys Targaryen is the second born son of [[Aerys II Targaryen]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix}} Thirteen years before the events of the series, he and his sister [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] fled [[Westeros]] to escape death at the hands of rebel [[Robert Baratheon]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} Viserys is an arrogant, cruel and ambitious man given to violent mood swings. In ''A Game of Thrones'', he sells his sister as a wife to the [[Dothraki]] [[Khal Drogo]], as a means to secure the allegiance of Drogo's army toward his goal of reclaiming the throne.{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 3: Daenerys I}} Frustrated with Drogo, Viserys demands a crown and threatens Daenerys and her unborn child; Drogo kills him by pouring a pot of molten gold over his head.

Daenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, after Viserys. She explains that in spite of everything, he was still her brother, and that his draconic namesake will help do what he could not. She also tries to remember him as the good person he was before the stresses of their exile made him violent and bitter, and acknowledges that he at least kept her alive and safe through her childhood.

=== Television ===
====Season 1====
Viserys Targaryen is the exiled prince and heir of the Targaryen dynasty. Known as "The Beggar King" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others, especially his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in the first episode, "[[Winter Is Coming]]", and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have any leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, whom he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Realizing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and that her and Drogo's unborn son are prophesied to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In the sixth episode, "[[A Golden Crown]]", he gets in a fit of drunken rage, threatens Drogo to give him his army and crown or he will kill his sister and her unborn son. Having had enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a "Golden Crown"; molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as "fire cannot kill a dragon".

Daenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, as a tribute to Viserys, although the reasoning is not explained on-screen.

== Development, overview and reception==
[[File:Harry Lloyd 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Harry Lloyd]] plays the role of Viserys Targaryen in the [[Game of Thrones|television series]].]]
Viserys Targaryen is played by British actor [[Harry Lloyd]] in the television adaption of the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/20779/jason-momoa-interview-game-of-thrones-playing-conan-and-more|title='Game of Thrones: Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen|work=DenofGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Viserys Targaryen is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his sister [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry Lloyd]] on Viserys Targaryen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as I looked into more of the history of the Targaryen family and actually read the other books, I found out more and pieced together his backstory, and he became sympathetic. I understood more what motivated him, and the fear he had, and the responsibility he had, and his childishness. I mean, he never really had a parent. That changed a lot my view from reading it to playing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/harry-lloyd/245447/interview-harry-lloyd-talks-game-of-thrones-supreme-tweeter|title=Interview: Harry Lloyd Talks Game of Thrones &amp; Supreme Tweeter|publisher=Denofgeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lloyd on his character’s death scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've never had to die on camera before, let alone in such a grisly way. So you just have to kind of give it everything. You talk to the two actors holding you and say, ‘Let's not pansy around here. I'm gonna absolutely try and get out of this, so don't let me.' Then, you let it rip. It can't be some sort of half-assed whimpering – you've got to really believe the pain and the fear. It's actually quite liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/viserys-targaryen/interview.html|title=Interview with Harry Lloyd|publisher=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lloyd has received positive reviews for his role as Viserys in the TV-series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/game-of-thrones-harry-lloyd-gets-into-the-mind-of-viserys-targaryen/|title=Game Of Thrones’ Harry Lloyd gets into the mind of Viserys Targaryen|publisher=Scifinow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blason Gondor.svg|thumb|The tree as a heraldic charge.]]
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[high fantasy]] universe of [[Middle-earth]], the '''White Tree of Gondor''' stood as a symbol of [[Gondor]] in the [[Court of the Fountain]] in [[Minas Tirith]].
The White Tree also appears as a [[Motif (art)|motif]] upon Gondor's flag and throughout its [[heraldry]] combined with the seven stars of the [[House of Elendil]] and the crown of the King.

==History==
=== First White Tree ===

The first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that [[Isildur]], at great personal risk, managed to steal from [[Nimloth]] the Fair, the White Tree of [[Númenor]], before it was destroyed at [[Sauron]]'s insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf of the planted fruit opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.

This sapling was brought to Middle-earth on [[Middle-earth objects#Nine Ships|Isildur's ship]], and it was eventually planted in [[Minas Ithil]] before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured [[Minas Ithil]], and he destroyed the White Tree.

===Second White Tree===
Isildur escaped the capture of Minas Ithil, taking with him a sapling of the White Tree to [[Minas Anor]] where it was planted in the citadel courtyard in memory of his slain brother [[Anárion]]. This tree died in 1636 during the Great Plague.

===Third White Tree===
A third sapling was planted in the year 1640 of the [[Third Age]] by King [[Tarondor of Gondor|Tarondor]]. This one lasted until the year 2872 and the death of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward]] [[Belecthor II]].

At this time no seedling of the tree could be found as the tree had rarely flowered after the line of the Kings had failed and therefore no fruit was produced. It was left standing after its death "until the King returns".

===Fourth White Tree===
When [[Aragorn]] became king he discovered (with [[Gandalf]]'s help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the slopes of [[Mindolluin]], high above the city, which he reverently planted in the Court of the Fountain. The dead tree was removed from the court but was placed in the [[Rath Dínen|Tombs of the Kings]] with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of the year 3019 of the [[Third Age]] the sapling was already laden with blossom.

==Film==
The finding of the sapling is not seen in Peter Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003). However, in the film we momentarily see a single blossom of "hope" on the previously dead tree during the Siege of [[Gondor]] and the imminent arrival of [[Aragorn]] on the Black Ships. At the time of the crowning of Aragorn the previously dead tree has returned to life and is in full blossom.
