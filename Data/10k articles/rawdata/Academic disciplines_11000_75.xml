In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Nitrogen, acting as an oxidant, is therefore reduced in a succession of four reactions performed by the enzymes [[Nitrate reductase|nitrate]], [[Nitrite reductase|nitrite]], [[Nitric-oxide reductase|nitric-oxide]], and [[Nitrous-oxide reductase|nitrous oxide]] reductases.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  The pathway ultimately yields reduced molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as, when the reaction does not reach completion, the intermediate species [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  A simple [[denitrification]] reaction proceeds as:

:{{chem|NO|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO →  {{chem|N|2|O}} → {{chem|N|2}} (g)

The [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reaction which utilizes oxygen as the oxidant is:

:{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} (aq) + 6{{chem|O|2}} (g) → 6{{chem|CO|2}} (g) + 6{{chem|H|2|O|}}

Classically, it was thought that denitrification would not occur in the presence of oxygen since there seems to be no energetic advantage to using nitrate as an oxidant when oxygen is available.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  Experiments have since proven that denitrifiers are often [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=William H.|year=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-625155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aerobic denitrification does indeed occur in a broad range of [[Denitrifying bacteria|microbial organisms]] with varying levels of productivity, usually lower productivity than results from purely aerobic respiration.  The advantages of being able to perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen are uncertain, though it is possible that the ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels plays a role.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt; Aerobic denitrification may be found in environments where fluctuating oxygen concentrations and reduced carbon are available&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relative harsh environment inspires the potential of denitrifiers to degrade toxic nitrate or nitrate under an aerobic atmosphere. Aerobic denitrifiers tend to work efficiently at 25 ~ 37°C and pH 7 ~ 8, when dissolved oxygen concentration is 3 ~ 5 mg/L and C/N load ratio is 5 ~ 10&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

==Environmental impact==

=== Wastewater treatment ===
Water treatment often relies on the activity of [[Denitrification|anaerobically denitrifying bacteria]] in order to remove [[nitrate]] from water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lv|first=Pengyi|last2=Luo|first2=Jinxue|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xuliang|last4=Zhang|first4=Dongqing|last5=Huang|first5=Zhanbin|last6=Bai|first6=Zhihui|date=2017-08-30|title=Diversity of culturable aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the sediment, water and biofilms in Liangshui River of Beijing, China|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09556-9|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09556-9|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of oxygen, nitrate cannot be fully reduced to [[dinitrogen]], thus nitrate remains in the water or it is converted to nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lingering nitrate in drinking water poses a plethora of health risks, and both nitrate and nitrous oxide have major environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Alyce M.|last2=Diaz|first2=James H.|last3=Kaye|first3=Alan David|date=2014|title=Reexamining the Risks of Drinking-Water Nitrates on Public Health|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=392–398|issn=1524-5012|pmc=4171798|pmid=25249806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Emma L.|last2=Allison|first2=Steven D.|date=2012-07-31|title=Meta-Analysis of Environmental Impacts on Nitrous Oxide Release in Response to N Amendment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00272|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3408851|pmid=22866053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hazards include, [[carcinogen]]ic nitrate ions in drinking water, or [[eutrophication]] caused by oxidized nitrogen seeding [[Algal bloom]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=David|date=1993-10-01|title=Aerobic denitrification in soils and sediments: From fallacies to factx|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016953479390218E|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=8|issue=10|pages=352–356|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90218-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely aerobic denitrification can further reduce oxidized nitrogen in a less specialized environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, many aerobically denitrifying bacteria from the [[pseudomonas]] genus (''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri|Pm. stutzeri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas mendocina|Pm. mendocina]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas putida|Pm.

[[File:Ciliate.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Ciliate]] with various cell structures (including anal pore) labelled]]
The '''anal pore''' or '''cytoproct''' is a structure in various [[protist|single-celled eukaryotes]] where waste is ejected after the [[nutrient]]s from the food have been absorbed into the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essential Microbiology |author=Stuart Hogg |edition=1 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0471497547 |date=2005 |chapter=The Ciliates |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8yRRtGJxP7YC&amp;pg=PT252&amp;dq=anal+pore+microbiology#v=onepage&amp;q=anal%20pore%20microbiology&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ciliates, the anal pore ('''cytopyge''') and [[cytostome]] are the only regions of the [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] that are not covered by ridges, [[cilium|cilia]] or rigid covering.  They serve as analogues of, respectively, [[anus]] and [[mouth]] of multicellular organisms.  The thin membrane of the cytopyge allows vacuoles to be merged into the cell wall and emptied.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[[Image:Layingpress1.jpg|thumb|200px|Wooden laying press holding a book being worked on.]]
'''Bindery''' refers to a [[studio]], [[workshop]] or [[factory]] where sheets of (usually) paper are fastened together to make books, but also where gold and other decorative elements are added to the exterior of books, where boxes or [[slipcase]]s for books are made and where the restoration of books is carried out.

==Overview==
A large traditional hand bookbinding studio or workshop may be divided into areas for different tasks such as sewing, rounding and backing the spine, attaching the boards to the book and covering the book with cloth or leather. These processes are collectively called forwarding and would be carried out in the forwarding department. This area of the bindery would typically have equipment such as sewing frames, guillotines, board choppers for cutting boards used as covers, laying presses for holding books when being worked on and nipping presses for flattening paper, board, etc. 
Recently, some compact material have been developed, allowing the processing of almost all the operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kirlinov.fr | title = Bookbinding device Kirl'inov | accessdate = 2011-06-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Brasstools1.jpg|thumb|200px|Racks of brass tools and a finishing stove beneath.]]
The process of decorating or titling a book with gold or other metals, and/or different colored pieces of leather, is called [[finishing (bookbinding)|finishing]] and is carried out in the finishing room or department. In a hand bookbindery this area would house the dozens or hundreds of brass hand tools that are used to impress gold patterns and figures onto leather one at a time, as well as the finishing stoves needed to heat these tools. In a more modern or commercial bindery, many decorative elements or letters are stamped onto a book's cover or case at the same time by use of a hot press. 

Modern, commercial, bookbinding outfits range in size from the local "copy shop" book binder, using techniques such as [[coil binding]], [[comb binding]] and [[velo binding]] to factories producing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of volumes a day using such processes as [[perfect binding]], saddle wire binding, and case binding. The term, bindery, especially in copy and print shops, has expanded to include other forms of paper finishing, such as [[paper drilling]], [[lamination]], and [[foamcore]] mounting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">The '''Bremen clause''' ({{lang-de|Bremer Klausel}}) is Article 141 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which states:
{{cquote|''Artikel 7 Abs. 3 Satz 1 findet keine Anwendung in einem Lande, in dem am 1. Januar 1949 eine andere landesrechtliche Regelung bestand.'' 
The first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 7 shall not apply in any state in which, on January 1, 1949, state law provides otherwise.}}
The sentence there cited says:
{{cquote|''Der Religionsunterricht ist in den öffentlichen Schulen mit Ausnahme der bekenntnisfreien Schulen ordentliches Lehrfach.''
Religious instruction shall form part of the regular curriculum in state schools, with the exception of non-denominational schools.}}

It limits the range of application of the constitutional (Basic Law) rule over [[religious education]], making it possible to have other types of instruction in some areas of [[Germany]]. A well-known example is the "instruction in [[Bible|Biblical]] history" in [[Bremen]]. It is not religious education in the sense of the Basic Law, because its content is not accountable to a [[religious community]]; therefore it is not a "[[common affair]]" ([[res mixta]]).

'''Bridge scour''' is the removal of [[sediment]] such as [[sand]] and [[gravel]] from around [[bridge]] [[abutment]]s or [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. Scour, caused by swiftly moving water, can scoop out ''scour holes'', compromising the integrity of a structure.&lt;ref&gt;Linda P. Warren, [http://ma.water.usgs.gov/publications/ofr/scour.htm Scour at Bridges: Stream Stability and Scour Assessment at Bridges in Massachusetts], U.S. Geological Survey, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, bridge scour is one of the three main causes of [[bridge failure]] (the others being collision and overloading). It has been estimated that 60% of all bridge failures result from scour and other hydraulic-related causes.&lt;ref name="presentation"&gt;Mark N. Landers, [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1140&amp;context=usgsstaffpub&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DShirhole%2Band%2BHolt%2B1991%26as_sdt%3D0%252C22%26as_ylo%3D%26as_vis%3D0#search=%22Shirhole%20Holt%201991%22 Bridge Scour Data Management].

==Areas affected by scour==
[[Image:HomochittoRiver1974.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Mississippi Highway 33]] bridge over the [[Homochitto River#River modification|Homochitto River]] failed due to [[flood]] induced [[erosion]].]]

Water normally flows faster around piers and abutments making them susceptible to local scour. At bridge openings, contraction scour can occur when water accelerates as it flows through an opening that is narrower than the channel upstream from the bridge. Degradation scour occurs both upstream and downstream from a bridge over large areas. Over long periods of time, this can result in lowering of the stream bed.&lt;ref name="presentation" /&gt;

==Causes==

Stream channel instability resulting in river [[erosion]] and changing angles-of-attack can contribute to bridge scour. Debris can also have a substantial impact on bridge scour in several ways. A build-up of material can reduce the size of the waterway under a bridge causing ''contraction scour'' in the channel. A build-up of debris on the abutment can increase the obstruction area and increase ''local scour''. Debris can deflect the water flow, changing the angle of attack, increasing ''local scour''. Debris might also shift the entire channel around the bridge causing increased water flow and scour in another location.&lt;ref name="structures" /&gt;

The most frequently encountered bridge scour problems usually involve loose alluvial material that can be easily eroded. However, one should not assume that total scour in cohesive or cemented soils will not be as large as in non-cohesive soils, the scour takes longer to develop.

Many of the equations for scour were derived from laboratory studies, for which the range of applicability is difficult to ascertain. Most studies focussed on piers and pile formations, though most bridge scour problems are related to the more complex configuration of the bridge abutment. Some studies were verified using limited field data, though this is also difficult to accurately scale for physical modelling purposes. During field measurements of post scour, a scour hole that had developed on the rising stage of a flood, or at the peak, may be filled in again on the falling stage. For this reason, the maximum depth of scour cannot be simply modelled after the event.

Scour can also cause problems with the hydraulic analysis of a bridge. Scour may considerably deepen the channel through a bridge and effectively reduce or even eliminate the [[Backwater (river)|backwater]]. This reduction in backwater should not be relied on, however, because of the unpredictable nature of the processes involved.

When considering scour it is normal to distinguish between non-cohesive or cohesionless (alluvial) sediments and cohesive material. The former are usually of most interest to laboratory studies. Cohesive materials require special techniques and are poorly researched.

The first major issue when considering scour is the distinction between '''clear-water''' scour and '''live-bed''' scour. The critical issue here is whether or not the mean bed shear stress of the flow upstream of the bridge is less than or larger than the threshold value needed to move the bed material.

If the upstream shear stress is less than the threshold value, the bed material upstream of the bridge is at rest. This is referred to as the clear-water condition because the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow. The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed material from the scoured area.

Live-bed scour occurs where the upstream shear stress is greater than the threshold value and the bed material upstream of the crossing is moving. This means that the approach flow continuously transports sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a uniform channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some additional increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by a contraction (natural or artificial, such as a bridge) or a local obstruction (e.g. a bridge pier). The equilibrium scour depth is achieved when material is transported into the scour hole at the same rate at which it is transported out.

Typically the maximum equilibrium clear-water scour is about 10% larger than the equilibrium live-bed scour. Conditions that favour clear water scour are:
* Bed material that is too coarse to be transported 
* Vegetated or artificial reinforced channels where velocities are only high enough due to local scour, or
* Flat bed slopes during low flows.
It is possible that both clear water and live-bed scour can occur. During a flood event,  bed shear stress may change as the flood flows change. It is possible to have clear-water conditions at the commencement of a flood event, transitioning to a live bed before reverting to clear water conditions. Note that the maximum scour depth may occur under initial clear-water conditions, not necessarily when the flood levels peak and live-bed scour is underway. Similarly, relatively high velocities can be experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge.

Urbanisation has the effect of increasing flood magnitudes and causing hydrographs to peak earlier, resulting in higher stream velocities and degradation. Channel improvements or the extraction of gravel (above or below the site in question) can alter water levels, flow velocities, bed slopes and sediment transport characteristics and consequently affect scour. For instance, if an alluvial channel is straightened, widened or altered in any other way that results in an increased flow-energy condition, the channel will tend back towards a lower energy state by degrading upstream, widening and aggrading downstream.

The significance of degradation scour to bridge design is that the engineer has to decide whether the existing channel elevation is likely to be constant over the life of the bridge, or whether it will change. If change is probable then it must be allowed for when designing the waterway and foundations.

The lateral stability of a river channel may also affect scour depths, because movement of the channel may result in the bridge being incorrectly positioned or aligned with respect to the approach flow. This problem can be significant under any circumstances but is potentially very serious in arid or semi-arid regions and with ephemeral (intermittent) streams. Lateral migration rates are largely unpredictable. Sometimes a channel that has been stable for many years may suddenly start to move, but significant influences are floods, bank material, vegetation of the banks and floodplains, and land use.

Scour at bridge sites is typically classified as contraction (or constriction) scour and local scour. Contraction scour occurs over a whole cross-section as a result of the increased velocities and bed shear stresses arising from a narrowing of the channel by a construction such as a bridge. In general, the smaller the opening ratio the larger the waterway velocity and the greater the potential for scour. If the flow contracts from a wide floodplain, considerable scour and bank failure can occur. Relatively severe constrictions may require regular maintenance for decades to combat erosion. It is evident that one way to reduce contraction scour is to make the opening wider.

Local scour arises from the increased velocities and associated vortices as water accelerates around the corners of abutments, piers and spur dykes. The flow pattern around a cylindrical pier. The approaching flow decelerates as it nears the cylinder, coming to rest at the centre of the pier. The resulting stagnation pressure is highest near the water surface where the approach velocity is greatest, and smaller lower down. The downward pressure gradient at the pier face directs the flow downwards. Local pier scour begins when the downflow velocity near the stagnation point is strong enough to overcome the resistance to motion of the bed particles.

During flooding, although the foundations of a bridge might not suffer damage, the fill behind abutments may scour. This type of damage typically occurs with single-span bridges with vertical wall abutments.

==Bridge examination and scour evaluation==

The examination process is normally conducted by [[hydrologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] technicians, and involves a review of historical [[engineering]] information about the bridge, followed by a visual inspection. Information is recorded about the type of rock or sediment carried by the river, and the angle at which the river flows toward and away from the bridge. The area under the bridge is also inspected for holes and other evidence of scour.

Bridge examination begins by office investigation. The history of the bridge and any previous scour related problems should be noted. Once a bridge is recognized as a potential scour bridge, it will proceed to further evaluation including field review, scour vulnerability analysis and prioritizing. Bridges will also be rated in different categories and prioritized for scour risk. Once a bridge is evaluated as scour critical, the bridge owner should prepare a scour plan of action to mitigate the known and potential deficiencies. The plan may include installation of countermeasures, monitoring, inspections after flood events, and procedures for closing bridges if necessary.

Alternatively, sensing technologies are also being put in place for scour assessment. The scour-sensing level can be classified into three levels: general bridge inspection, collecting limited data and collecting detailed data.&lt;ref&gt;Ettouney, Mohammed M.; Alampalli, Sreenivas (2011). Infrastructure Health in Civil 
Engineering : Applications and Management. CRC Press. Retrieved April 04, 2012, from Ebook Library.
&lt;/ref&gt; There are three different types of scour-monitoring systems: fixed, portable and geophysical positioning. Each system can help to detect scour damage in an effort to avoid bridge failure, thus increasing public safety.

==Countermeasures and prevention==
Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 23 Manual (HEC-23) contains general design guidelines as scour countermeasures that are applicable to piers and abutments. The design guideline numbering in the following table indicates the HEC-23 design guideline chapter.

Bend way weirs, spurs and guide banks can help to align the upstream flow while riprap, gabions, articulated concrete blocks and grout filled mattresses can mechanically stabilize the pier and abutment slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Lagasse, P. F., Zevenbergen, L. W., Schall, J. D., &amp; Clopper, P. E. U.S Department of Transportation, 
Federal Highway Administration. (2001). Bridge scour and stream instability countermeasures (NHI 01-003). Retrieved from website: http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FHWA/010592.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Riprap]] remains the most common countermeasure used to prevent scour at bridge abutments. A number of physical additions to the abutments of bridges can help prevent scour, such as the installation of [[gabion]]s and stone pitching upstream from the foundation. The addition of sheet piles or interlocking [[prefabricated]] concrete blocks can also offer protection. These countermeasures do not change the scouring flow and are temporary since the components are known to move or be washed away in a flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/hydraulics/library_listing.cfm |title=Publications - Hydraulics Engineering - FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; FHWA recommends design criteria in HEC-18 and 23, such as avoiding unfavourable flow patterns, streamlining the abutments, and designing pier foundations resistant to scour without depending upon the use of riprap or other countermeasures.

Trapezoidal-shaped channels through a bridge can significantly decrease ''local scour'' depths compared to vertical wall abutments, as they provide a smoother transition through a bridge opening. This eliminates abrupt corners that cause turbulent areas. [[Levee#Spur dykes|Spur dike]]s, barbs, [[groynes]], and vanes are river training structures that change stream hydraulics to mitigate undesirable erosion or deposits. They are usually used on unstable stream channels to help redirect stream flow to more desirable locations through the bridge. The insertion of piles or deeper footings is also used to help strengthen bridges.

==Estimating scour depth==
Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 Manual (HEC-18) was published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  This manual includes several techniques of estimating scour depth. The empirical scour equations for live bed scour, clear water scour, and local scour at piers and abutment are shown in Chapter 5-General Scour section. The total scour depth is determined by adding three scour components which includes the long-term aggradation and degradation of the river bed, general scour at the bridge and local scour at the piers or abutment.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, E. V., &amp; Davis, S. R. U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway 
Administration. (2001). Hydraulics engineering publications title: Evaluating scour at bridges, fourth edition description (NHI-01-001). Retrieved from website: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/hydraulics/library_arc.cfm?pub_number=17&amp;id=37
)&lt;/ref&gt; However, research had shown that the standard equations in HEC-18 over-predict scour depth for a number of hydraulic and geologic conditions.  Most of the HEC-18 relationships are based on laboratory flume studies conducted with sand-sized sediments increased with factors of safety that are not easily recognizable or adjustable.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, K. J., Holnbeck, S. R., Montana., &amp; Geological Survey (U.S.). (2004). Evaluation of 
pier-scour equations for coarse-bed streams. Reston, Va: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey.
&lt;/ref&gt; Sand and fine gravel are the most easily eroded bed materials, but streams frequently contain much more scour resistant materials such as compact till, stiff clay, and shale. The consequences of using design methods based on a single soil type are especially significant for many major physiographic provinces with distinctly different geologic conditions and foundation materials. This can lead to overly conservative design values for scour in low risk or non-critical hydrologic conditions. Thus, equation improvements are continued to be made in an effort to minimize the underestimation and overestimation of scour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5560">A '''building control body''' is an organisation authorised to control [[building|building work]] that is subject to the [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] in England and Wales (similar systems are provided in Northern Ireland, and in Scotland where the term 'building standards' is used). Building control roles are exercised by officers in local authorities and by private sector Approved Inspectors.

The title "Building control officer" (BCO) (also known as a "building inspector" or a "building control surveyor") is used predominantly by local authorities, which confer the title of "officer" to many staff who have regulatory, supervision or enforcement roles. Private sector "Approved Inspectors" generally do not refer to themselves as "officers".

==Qualifications and appointment==
Building control professionals practice in the public sector with local authorities or in the private sector as companies or individuals who are recognised as Approved Inspectors. Many individuals are members of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) and [[Chartered Building Surveyor|chartered building surveyors]] or chartered building control surveyors, and are members of that RICS Faculty; alternatively, they may be chartered members of the [[Chartered Institute of Building]] or the [[Chartered Association of Building Engineers]].&lt;ref name="CICAIR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Approved Inspectors: Approval Process – New Applicants |url=http://cic.org.uk/services/approval-process-new-applicants.php |website=Construction Industry Council |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Approved Inspectors are bodies or individuals who must be appointed by an organisation designated by the [[Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government]] or the equivalent [[Welsh Government]] Minister as having the authority to control [[building|building work]]. CICAIR Limited, a specially created wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Construction Industry Council]], is the sole body authorised to approve Approved Inspectors to undertake building control work in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="CICAIRlaunch"&gt;{{cite news |title=CIC launches CICAIR Limited |url=http://cic.org.uk/news/article.php?s=2014-03-27-cic-launches-cicair-limited |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=Construction Industry Council |publisher=CIC |date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The main function of building control is to ensure that the requirements of the building regulations are met in all types of non-exempt development. Generally they examine [[Plans (drawings)|plans]], specifications and other documents submitted for approval, and survey work as it proceeds. Most building control surveyors are now actively involved at design stage for many schemes and are acknowledged to provide valuable input at all stages of development.

Many building control surveyors who work for local authorities are involved with other legislation such as safety at sports grounds, dealing with dangerous structures and demolitions, and various development and building matters.

Local authorities have powers under the [[Building Act 1984]] to enforce the building regulations and have work altered or removed that does not comply. These powers have not been conferred on approved inspectors.

==Organisations==
Local Authority Building Control (LABC) is a membership association for around 3,000 members of local authority building control teams in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="About LABC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |url=https://www.labc.co.uk/about-us |website=LABC |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; LABSS (Local Authority Building Standards Scotland) is a not-for-profit membership organisation representing all local authority building standards verifiers in Scotland.&lt;ref name="LABSS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Authority Building Standards Scotland |url=https://www.labss.org/ |website=LABSS.org |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 1996, the Association of Consultant Approved Inspectors (ACAI) promotes private sector building control as a commercial, professional and cost-effective alternative to local authority inspectors.&lt;ref name="Richworks"&gt;{{cite web |title=ACAI |url=http://www.therichworks.co.uk/directory_business.asp?ID=171 |website=TheRichWorks.co.uk |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACAI and LABC joined with the CABE, CIOB and RICS to form the Building Control Alliance, incorporated in 2008.&lt;ref name="CoHo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Building Control Alliance Limited |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06506076/filing-history?page=2 |website=Companies House |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardiac psychology''' is a specialization of [[health psychology]] that focuses on the primary and secondary prevention of [[heart disease]] by incorporating strategies to address the [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] barriers to [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes (e.g. [[smoking cessation]]), and that seeks to enhance recovery in cardiac patients by means of providing patients tools (e.g. stress management and psychotherapy) to cope with life and physical changes associated with their disease. Cardiac psychologists can help cardiac patients across the lifespan: prevention, pre-surgery, post-surgery, and [[rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation]] of cardiac disease with a particular emphasis on achieving optimal [[quality of life]] outcomes.

Cardiac psychology also includes both [[research]] and [[clinical psychology|clinical practice]] aspects. Research labs have been founded at [[Tilburg University]], [[Tilburg]] Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/corps Tilburg University]&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Susanne Pedersen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/webwijs/show/?uid=s.s.pedersen Susanne Pedersen]&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[East Carolina University]], [[Greenville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;East Carolina University, [http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/cardiacpsychology ''Cardiac Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Samuel Sears]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/searss Samuel F.

A '''cochlear implant''' ('''CI''') is a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device that provides a sense of sound to a person with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Cochlear implants bypass the normal acoustic hearing process, instead replacing it with electric hearing. Namely, the sound sensation comes from the sound that is converted to electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. The brain adapts to the new mode of hearing, and eventually can interpret the electric signals as sound and speech.

The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include DSP chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin.  The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the [[cochlea]], which stimulate the [[cochlear nerve]].

The surgical procedure is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus and dizziness.

From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Graeme M. |title=The Multi-Channel Cochlear Implant: Multi-Disciplinary Development of Electrical Stimulation of the Cochlea and the Resulting Clinical Benefit |journal=Hearing Research |date=April 2015 |volume=322 |pages=4–13 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2014.08.002|pmid=25159273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shannon |first1=Robert V. |title=Advances in Auditory Prostheses |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |date=February 2012 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=61–66 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32834ef878|pmid=22157109 |pmc=4123811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blamey |first1=Peter |last2=Artieres |first2=Françoise |last3=Başkent |first3=Deniz |last4=Bergeron |first4=François |last5=Beynon |first5=Andy |last6=Burke |first6=Elaine |last7=Dillier |first7=Norbert |last8=Dowell |first8=Richard |last9=Fraysse |first9=Bernard |last10=Gallégo |first10=Stéphane |last11=Govaerts |first11=Paul J. |last12=Green |first12=Kevin |last13=Huber |first13=Alexander M. |last14=Kleine-Punte |first14=Andrea |last15=Maat |first15=Bert |last16=Marx |first16=Mathieu |last17=Mawman |first17=Deborah |last18=Mosnier |first18=Isabelle |last19=O'Connor |first19=Alec Fitzgerald |last20=O'Leary |first20=Stephen |last21=Rousset |first21=Alexandra |last22=Schauwers |first22=Karen |last23=Skarzynski |first23=Henryk |last24=Skarzynski |first24=Piotr H. |last25=Sterkers |first25=Olivier |last26=Terranti |first26=Assia |last27=Truy |first27=Eric |last28=Van de Heyning |first28=Paul |last29=Venail |first29=Fréderic |last30=Vincent |first30=Christophe |last31=Lazard |first31=Diane S. |title=Factors Affecting Auditory Performance of Postlinguistically Deaf Adults Using Cochlear Implants: An Update with 2251 Patients |journal=Audiology and Neurotology |date=2013 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |doi=10.1159/000343189|pmid=23095305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Başkent |first1=D. |last2=Gaudrain |first2=E. |last3=Tamati |first3=T.N. |last4=Wagner |first4=A. |title=Perception and psychoacoustics of speech in cochlear implant users, in Scientific Foundations of Audiology: Perspectives from Physics, Biology, Modeling, and Medicine, Eds.

Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]]. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/06/02/sunday/main10794.shtml |title=The Cochlear Implant Controversy, Issues And Debates |publisher=CBS News |date=September 4, 2001 |location=NEW YORK |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Infant with cochlear implant.jpg|thumb|An infant with a cochlear implant.]]
André Djourno and Charles Eyriès invented the original cochlear implant in 1957. This original design distributed stimulation using a single channel. Two years later they went their separate ways due to personal and professional differences.&lt;ref name="Svirsky2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svirsky|first1=Mario|title=Cochlear implants and electronic hearing|journal=Physics Today|volume=70|issue=8|year=2017|pages=52–58|issn=0031-9228|doi=10.1063/PT.3.3661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cochlear implant was invented by [[William F. House|William House]], in 1961.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Dr. William F. House, Inventor of Pioneering Ear-Implant Device, Dies at 89 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/health/dr-william-f-house-inventor-of-cochlear-implant-dies.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=December 15, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1964, Blair Simmons and [[Robert J. White]] implanted a six-channel electrode in a patient's cochlea at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="MudryHist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mudry|first1=A|last2=Mills|first2=M|title=The early history of the cochlear implant: a retrospective|journal=JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery|date=May 2013|volume=139|issue=5|pages=446–53|pmid=23681026|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/1688121|doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2013.293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern multichannel cochlear implant was independently developed and commercialized by [[Graeme Clark (doctor)|Graeme Clark]] from Australia and [[Ingeborg Hochmair]] and her future husband, [[Erwin Hochmair]], with the Hochmairs' first implanted in a person in December 1977 and Clark's in August 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award: Modern cochlear implant|url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/modern-cochlear-implant/|publisher=The Lasker Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts==
Cochlear implants bypass most of the [[Auditory system#Peripheral auditory system|peripheral auditory system]] which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of [[hair cells]] in the [[cochlea]]; the inside-portion of these hair cells release [[Potassium#Biochemical function|potassium ions]] in response to the movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, [[glutamate]], which makes the [[cochlear nerve]] send signals to the brain, which creates the [[experience]] of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the [[cochlea]]. The electrodes electrically stimulate the [[cochlear nerve]], causing it to send signals to the brain.&lt;ref name=2016Horizon&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26443490 | doi=10.1016/j.otc.2015.07.009 | volume=48 | issue=6 | title=On the Horizon: Cochlear Implant Technology | year=2015 | journal=Otolaryngol. Clin. North Am. | pages=1097–116 |vauthors=Roche JP, Hansen MR | pmc=4641792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIDCD2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=2015f1000&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26097718 | doi=10.12703/P7-45 | volume=7 | title=Cochlear implantation: a biomechanical prosthesis for hearing loss | pmc=4447036 | year=2015 | journal=F1000Prime Rep | pages=45 |vauthors=Yawn R, Hunter JB, Sweeney AD, Bennett ML }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several systems available, but generally they have the following components:&lt;ref name=2016Horizon/&gt;&lt;ref name=2015f1000/&gt;

==Surgical procedure==
The surgical procedure most often used to implant the device is called [[mastoidectomy]] with facial recess approach (MFRA).&lt;ref name=2015f1000/&gt; If a person's individual anatomy prevents MFRA, other approaches, such as through the [[suprameatal triangle]] are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing the two approaches were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; it is not known which approach is safer or more effective.&lt;ref name=2016procRev&gt;Bruijnzeel H, et al. Systematic Review on Surgical Outcomes and Hearing Preservation for Cochlear Implantation in Children and Adults. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2016 Feb 16. Review. {{DOI|10.1177/0194599815627146}} {{PMID|26884363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks of the procedures include [[mastoiditis]], [[otitis media]] (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the [[facial nerve]], damage to the [[chorda tympani]], and wound infections.&lt;ref name=2016procRev/&gt;

The rate of complications is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, facial paralysis, and device failure. To avoid the risk of [[bacterial meningitis]], which while low is about thirty times as high compared to people who don't undergo CI procedures, the FDA recommends vaccination prior to the procedure. The rate of transient facial nerve palsy is estimated to be approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur in 2.5-6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than 1 week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist.&lt;ref name=2015f1000/&gt;

Cochlear implants are only approved for people who are deaf in both ears; {{as of|2014|lc=y}} a cochlear implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies {{as of|2014|lc=y}} had been too small to draw generalizations from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokita|first1=J|last2=Dunn|first2=C|last3=Hansen|first3=MR|title=Cochlear implantation and single-sided deafness|journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology &amp; Head and Neck Surgery|date=October 2014|volume=22|issue=5|pages=353–8|pmid=25050566|pmc=4185341|doi=10.1097/moo.0000000000000080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
A 2011 AHRQ review of the evidence of the effectiveness of CI in people with bilateral hearing loss - the device's primary use - found low to moderate quality data that showed [[speech perception]] in noisy conditions was much better for people who had implants in both ears done at the same time compared to people who had only one. The data also showed that no conclusions could be drawn about changes in speech perception in quiet conditions and health-related quality-of-life. There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the second implantation made no change, or made things worse.&lt;ref name=AHRQ2011&gt;Raman G, et al. Effectiveness of Cochlear Implants in Adults with Sensorineural Hearing Loss [Internet]. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2011 Jun 17. {{PMID|25927131}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0073442/pdf/PubMedHealth_PMH0073442.pdf Free full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review found that the ability to communicate in spoken language was better the earlier the implantation was done. This review also found that, overall, the efficacy of cochlear implants is highly variable, and that it was not possible to accurately predict which children will and will not acquire spoken language successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganek|first=Hillary|last2=Robbins|first2=Amy McConkey|last3=Niparko|first3=John K.|author3link=John Niparko|title=Language Outcomes After Cochlear Implantation|url=|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|volume=45|issue=1|pages=173–185|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2011.08.024|pmid=22115689 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 review examined whether CI implantation to treat people with bilateral hearing loss had any effect on [[tinnitus]]. This review found the quality of evidence to be poor and the results variable: overall total tinnitus suppression rates varied from 8% to 45% of people who received CI; decrease of tinnitus was seen in 25% to 72%, of people; for 0% to 36% of the people there was no change; increase of tinnitus occurred in between 0% to 25% of patients; and, in between 0 and 10% of cases, people who did not have tinnitus before the procedure, got it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26153087 | doi=10.1002/lary.25370 | volume=125 | issue=11 | title=The effect of cochlear implantation on tinnitus in patients with bilateral hearing loss: A systematic review | year=2015 | journal=Laryngoscope | pages=2584–92 |vauthors=Ramakers GG, van Zon A, Stegeman I, Grolman W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 literature review on the use of CI for people with [[auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder]] found that, as of that date, description and diagnosis of the condition was too heterogeneous to make clear claims about whether CI is a safe and effective way to manage it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26545793 | doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.10.006 | volume=79 | issue=12 | title=Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and cochlear implantation | year=2015 | journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. | pages=1980–7 |vauthors=Harrison RV, Gordon KA, Papsin BC, Negandhi J, James AL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 systematic review of CI for people with [[unilateral hearing loss]] (UHL) found that of the studies conducted and published, none were randomized, only one evaluated a control group, and no study was blinded. After eliminating multiple uses of the same subjects, the authors found that 137 people with UHL had received a CI.&lt;ref name=2016cabral&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26722349 | doi=10.1055/s-0035-1559586 | volume=20 | issue=1 | title=Cochlear Implantation and Single-sided Deafness: A Systematic Review of the Literature | pmc=4687988 | year=2016 | journal=Int Arch Otorhinolaryngol | pages=69–75 |vauthors=Cabral Junior F, Pinna MH, Alves RD, Malerbi AF, Bento RF }}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging the weakness of the data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves [[sound localization]] compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after they learned to speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak.&lt;ref name=2016cabral/&gt; It appeared to improve [[speech perception]] and to reduce [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name=2016cabral/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Usage===
{{as of|2010|October}}, approximately 188,000 individuals had been fitted with cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=83|title=NIH Fact Sheets - Cochlear Implants|website=report.nih.gov|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|December}}, the same publication cited approximately 324,000 cochlear implant devices having been surgically implanted. In the U.S., roughly 58,000 devices were implanted in adults and 38,000 in children.&lt;ref name=NIDCD2016&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/coch.aspx|title= Cochlear Implants|author= NIH Publication No. 11-4798|date= 2013-11-01|publisher= [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016}}, the Ear Foundation in the United Kingdom, estimates the number of cochlear implant recipients to be around 600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earfoundation.org.uk/hearing-technologies/cochlear-implants/cochlear-implant-information-sheet|title=The Ear Foundation {{!}} Cochlear Implant Information Sheet|website=www.earfoundation.org.uk|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
In the [[United States]], the overall cost of getting cochlear implants was about $100,000 {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cochlear Implants|url=http://www.entnet.org/content/cochlearimplants|publisher=American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|accessdate=12 May 2017|language=en|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some or all of this may be covered by health insurance. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[National Health Service|NHS]] covers cochlear implants in full, as does Medicare in [[Australia]], and the Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beaumont.ie/index.jsp?p=350&amp;n=407&amp;a=0|title=Beaumont Hospital - Cochlear Implant - How to Refer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ireland]], Seguridad Social in [[Spain]] and [[Israel]], and the Ministry of Health or [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] (depending on the cause of deafness) in [[New Zealand]]. According to the US [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]], the estimated total cost is $60,000 per person implanted.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A study by [[Johns Hopkins University]] determined that for a three-year-old child who receives them, cochlear implants can save $30,000 to $50,000 in special-education costs for elementary and secondary schools as the child is more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2000/nf00505c.htm|title= Do Health-Care Providers Have to Pay for Assistive Tech?|accessdate= 2009-10-25|author= John M. Williams|date= 2000-05-05|publisher= [[Business Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturers===
{{as of|2013}}, the three cochlear implant devices approved for use in the US were manufactured by [[Cochlear Limited]] (Australia), Advanced Bionics (a division of [[Sonova]]) and [[MED-EL]] (Austria). In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by [[Neurelec]] (France, a division of [[William Demant]]) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available in some parts of the world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Criticism and controversy===
Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, some of whom are [[pre-lingual Deafness|pre-lingually Deaf]] people whose first language is a [[sign language]]. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.&lt;ref name="CBS News"/&gt; This is an old problem for the Deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of [[manualism and oralism|manualism vs. oralism]]. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the "normal" body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, M. and Nguyen, V-K., ''An Anthropology of Biomedicine'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture.&lt;ref name="Power, D. 2005, pp. 451-459"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power D |title=Models of deafness: cochlear implants in the Australian daily press |journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=451–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16000690 |doi=10.1093/deafed/eni042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the "hearing world" without losing their Deaf identity.&lt;ref name="Power, D. 2005, pp. 451-459"/&gt;

Cochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are considered to be most effective when implanted at a young age, during the [[critical period]] in which the brain is still learning to interpret sound.&lt;ref name=UCIResearch&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newuniversity.org/2009/11/news/uci-research-with-cochlear-implants-no-longer-falling-on-deaf-ears/|title= UCI Research with Cochlear Implants No Longer Falling on Deaf Ears|author= Paul Oginni|date= 2009-11-16|publisher= New University|accessdate= 2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves, on the assumption that deafness is a disability. Deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child's identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language, and claim that measuring the child's success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor self-image as "disabled" (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly deaf person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nad.org/site/pp.asp?c=foINKQMBF&amp;b=138140 |title= Cochlear Implants|author= NAD Cochlear Implant Committee|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220131900/http://www.nad.org/site/pp.asp?c=foINKQMBF&amp;b=138140|archivedate= 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated [[oralism|orally]], in the standard fashion, and without access to [[sign language]] and are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ringo|first1=Allegra|title=Understanding Deafness: Not Everyone Wants to Be 'Fixed'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/understanding-deafness-not-everyone-wants-to-be-fixed/278527/|work=The Atlantic|date=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of [[sign language]]s in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=T|title=W(h)ither the deaf community? Population, genetics, and the future of Australian sign language|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|date=2004|volume=148|issue=5|pages=358–75|pmid=15132016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more extreme responses from deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as "[[cultural genocide]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christiansen|first1=John B.|last2=Leigh|first2=Irene W.|last3=Spencer|first3=Patricia Elizabeth|last4=Lucker|first4=Jay R.|title=Cochlear implants in children : ethics and choices|date=2001|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781563681165|pages=304–305|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBAmGL_te7UC&amp;pg=PA305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the trend for cochlear implants in children grows, Deaf-community advocates have tried to counter the "either or" formulation of [[Manualism and oralism|oralism vs manualism]] with a "both and" approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denworth|first1=Lydia|title=Science Gave My Son the Gift of Sound|url=http://time.com/76154/deaf-culture-cochlear-implants/|work=Time|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">'''DREAD''' is part of a system for risk-assessing [[computer security]] [[Threat (computer)|threats]] previously used at Microsoft and  although currently used by OpenStack and other corporations{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} it was abandoned by its creators &lt;ref&gt;[https://adam.shostack.org/modsec08/Shostack-ModSec08-Experiences-Threat-Modeling-At-Microsoft.pdf Experiences Threat Modeling at Microsoft, Adam Shostack]&lt;/ref&gt;.  It provides a [[mnemonic]] for risk rating security threats using five categories.

The categories are:

* '''D'''amage – how bad would an attack be?
* '''R'''eproducibility – how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
* '''E'''xploitability – how much work is it to launch the attack?
* '''A'''ffected users – how many people will be impacted?
* '''D'''iscoverability – how easy is it to discover the threat?

The DREAD name comes from the initials of the five categories listed. It was initially proposed for [[threat model]]ing, but it was discovered that the ratings are not very consistent and are subject to debate.  It was out of use at Microsoft by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c601e0ca-5f38-4a07-8a46-40e4adcbc293/do-you-use-dread-as-it-is?forum=sdlprocess ''Do you use DREAD as it is?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When a given threat is assessed using DREAD, each category is given a rating from 1 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/OSSA-Metrics#DREAD OpenStack Security OSSA/Metrics DREAD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#DREAD OWASP Threat Risk Modeling: DREAD&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all ratings for a given issue can be used to prioritize among different issues.

==Discoverability debate==

Some security experts feel that including the "Discoverability" element as the last D rewards [[security through obscurity]], so some organizations have either moved to a DREAD-D "DREAD minus D" scale (which omits Discoverability) or always assume that Discoverability is at its maximum rating.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/OSSA-Metrics#Calibration OpenStack Security OSSA/Metrics DREAD Calibration: "Discoverability always assumed to be 10"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#DREAD OWASP Threat Risk Modeling: DREAD: "Discoverability will often be set to 10 by convention"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">'''EN 1063''', or CEN 1063, is a security glazing standard created by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] for measuring the protective strength of bullet-resistant glass. It is commonly used in conjunction with EN 1522 (Euronorm standard for Bullet Resistance in Windows, Doors, Shutters and Blinds) to form a [[Terminal ballistics|ballistic]] classification system by which armored vehicles and structures are tested and rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullet Resistance|url=http://www.sitec.de/en/information-and-advice/bullet-resistance|publisher=SITEC|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar classification system primarily used in the [[United States]] is [[NIJ 0108|NIJ Standard 0108]], the U.S. [[National Institute of Justice]]'s Standard for Ballistic Resistant Protective Materials which includes glass and armor plate.

== Threat Levels ==

The protective strength of a glazed shielding is rated based on the type of munitions, or threat level, it is capable of withstanding. There are 7 main standard threat levels: BR1-BR7 (also written as B1-B7), each corresponding to a different type of [[small arms]] fire. Additionally, there are two other threat levels (SG1 &amp; SG2) corresponding to shotgun munitions.

To be given a particular rating, the glazing must stop the bullet for the specified number of strikes, with multiple strikes placed within 120mm of each other. The glazing should also be shatterproof and produce no [[spalling|spalls]] after each strike. Lastly, the classification levels are numbered in order of increasing protective strength. Thus any sample complying with the requirements of one class also complies with the requirements of previous classes. However, the SG (shotgun) classes do not necessarily comply with BR classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Watney|url=http://www.ballisticedge.com.au/BSEN1063.htm|title=BS EN1063 2000|publisher=Ballistic Edge Research Laboratory Mechanical Impact Testing|year=2000|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">In [[epidemiology]] and [[biostatistics]], the '''experimental event rate (EER)''' is a measure of how often a particular statistical event (such as response to a drug, [[adverse event]] or death) occurs within the experimental group (non-control group) of an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/glossary/EER.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This value is very useful in determining the therapeutic benefit or risk to patients in experimental groups, in comparison to patients in [[placebo]] or traditionally treated control groups.

Three statistical terms rely on EER for their calculation: [[absolute risk reduction]], [[relative risk reduction]] and [[number needed to treat]].

==Control event rate==
The  ''control event rate (CER)'' is identical to the experimental event rate except that is measured within the [[Scientific control|scientific control group]] of an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/glossary/CER.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worked example ==
In a trial of hypothetical drug "X" where we are measuring event "Z", we have two groups. Our control group (25 people) is given a [[placebo]], and the experimental group (25 people) is given drug "X".

Event "Z" in control group : 4 in 25 people
[[Control event rate]] : 4/25

Event "Z" in experimental group : 12 in 25 people
Experimental event rate : 12/25

Another worked example is as follows:

==Biography==
Barton was born in [[East Farnham]], [[Quebec]], Canada. After attending [[Oakwood Friends School|Oakwood Seminary]] in [[Union Springs, New York]]. Barton became a minister in the [[Religious Society of Friends]] and continued his education at [[Haverford College]], completing a M.A. in 1885. He taught in [[Rhode Island]] from 1884–1889, then earned a Ph.D. at [[Harvard]] and became a professor of [[Semitic languages]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1891.

In 1922 Barton moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was professor of Semitic languages and the history of religion. He retired in 1931 and held the title of professor [[emeritus]] until his death. He specialized in many subjects, particularly in Semitic languages. His many publications cover a wide range of topics in areas such as [[biblical studies]], religion, and [[linguistics]] along with translations of [[Sumerian history|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] tablets.&lt;ref name="Kramer1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=From the Poetry of Sumer: Creation, Glorification, Adoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZSdbj5Hny0C&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=5 September 2012|year=1979|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03703-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fascinated by bible [[archeology]] and wrote a [[text book]] on the subject, published in 1916, along with other publications on similar subjects.

Barton specialized in translations of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] &amp; [[Akkadian language|Akkadiann]] tablets, seals and cylinders.&lt;ref name="Meade1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

'''Hyperpersonal theory''' (HPT) is related and understood through [[computer-mediated communication]](CMC). Hyperpersonal theory is part of [[interpersonal communication]] theory meaning that the HPT suggests CMC due to the uses technological messages rather than [[face-to-face interaction]]s. According to Erin Schumaker (2013) the hyperpersonal theory represents how people communicate online rather than FtF.  The theory displays predictions on how people present themselves in a virtual environment. HPT demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumaker|first1=Erin|date=2013|title=Exploring the Hyperpersonal Model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication|journal=Dissertation at Ohio State University|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walther ==
Joseph Walther is noted to be the founder of this theory, however, he uses his finding to teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In his research he found "the hyperpersonal model of CMC proposes a set of concurrent theoretically based processes to explain how CMC may facilitate impressions and relationships online"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes and Functions|last1=Walther|first1=Joseph|location=Chapter 14|pages=443–471|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to FtF relationships. The model Walther created has four main components that illustrate how CMC relates to message structure and reception:&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

# Effects due to receiver processes
# Effects among message senders
# Attributes of the channel
# Feedback effects

Effects due to receiver processes explains how communication could be misunderstood or exaggerated perceptions by the sender. By this, Walther explains that without FtF interactions and gesture cues, receivers fill in the missing information from the sender. The second component involves the sender. Walther illustrates that senders are able to avoid distractions of conversation with FtF interaction, allowing the sender to compose messages making themselves more desirable over text and online rather than the receiver being able to see their characteristics and gesture cues. Senders are able to disclose information while being able to provide only the information they want the receiver to know. The third component describes how CMC is the channel of the conversation. In this section, senders are able to take their time and craft messages or responses without conversation flow.  Senders are able to perfect messages through the channel without  communication interruptions. The fourth component involves feedback from CMC. It exemplifies behavioral conformation and overall impressions made by the receiver of the channel. The feedback effects component has been under study recently due to acknowledging if this component was enhancing the identity of the sender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These four components represent how CMC may effect how relationships online exceed offline relationships.

== Background ==
Orignination of the hyperpersonal theory model came from [[Joseph Walther]]. He is the Director of Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Walther, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara says, "his teaching and research focus on [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and social media in personal relationships, groups, educational settings, and inter-ethic conflict, topics on which he has contributed several original theories and numerous experiments and surveys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther|title=UC Santa Barbara Department of Communication|website=comm.ucsb.edu|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-mediated communication ==
Computer-mediated communication, also known as CMC, relates to hyperpersonal theory model because it suggests that computer-mediated communication can turn hyperpersonal since they both lack the use of face-to-face communication. CMC "may be [[wikt:impersonal|impersonal]]".&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walther |first1=Joseph B. |title=Computer-Mediated Communication |journal=Communication Research |date=29 June 2016 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1177/009365096023001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now online friendships and virtual communities. CMC was "emerged as an unintended byproduct of linking large computers to one another for security and information redundancy".&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; In doing so, operators found that the computers were able to send messages to other people, enabling computer-mediated communication. From this, researchers began to question whether CMC could replace traveling to events, such as business meetings, and indicate whether or not CMC might provide meetings more effective than FtF meetings.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; This is where researchers developed online behaviors vs personal interaction behaviors. They tested this by interactions through e-mail. Researchers then found that computer-mediated communication was more task-oriented rather than FtF conversations/meetings.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel's [[Media richness theory|Media Richness theory]] depict FtF interactions contain more richness than CMC. Daft and Lengel state, "messages should be communicated on channels with sufficient and appropriate media richness capacities."&lt;ref name=":423"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John|last2=Zmud|first2=Robert|date=April 1999|title=Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential Nature of Media Richness Perceptions|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=42|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continue to propose that "messages communicated on channels that are inappropriate to the equivocality of a situation and the richness of the information may be misinterpreted by recipients or may be otherwise ineffective"&lt;ref name=":423" /&gt; Whereas, Walther explains HPT represents how communication interpersonally online has enhanced society with new technologies, allowing people to create virtual communities. Walther enacted the finding and research of CMC when Daft and Lengel stated that management problems became too difficult and complex; stating that the richness of communication was lost when tying to convey adequate insight and understanding &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; Walther explains that growing numbers of reports indicate that CMC interactions are sometimes just as interactive as FtF interactions.

== Uses of Hyperpersonal theory ==
Hyperpersonal theory Model describes how people use virtual communication, or [[computer-mediated communication]], rather than [[face-to-face communication]] (FtF). There are two directions Walther makes on the work of CMC and its interpersonal effects:&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

# To integrate theories and findings based on impersonal and interpersonal interactions in CMC, allowing favorable outcomes for certain contexts in HPT &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;
# To view a new perspective on intimacy, solidarity, and liking via CMC, allowing HPT to surpass FtF interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock ===
Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use Joseph Walther's hyperpersonal theory model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established "some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Crystal|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalie|last3=Hancock|first3=Jeffrey|date=2010|title=The Disclosure–Intimacy Link in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Attributional Extension of the Hyperpersonal Model|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=37|pages=58–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depicted that people tend to "put their best foot forward"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that "related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a "more positive hyperpersonal relationship”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Daft &amp; Lengel's Media Richness Theory ===
Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt;

=== Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory ===
[[Ned Kock]], is a researcher of the [[Media naturalness theory|Media Naturalness]] and [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion theory]] (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to "richer" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory (Carlson and Zmud 1999) essentially undercut Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kock|first=Ned|last2=Garza|first2=Vanessa|date=April–June 2011|title=Media Naturalness and Compensatory Channel Expansion: A Study of Online and Face-to-Face Sections of the Same Course|url=|journal=International Journal of Distance Education Technologies|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve "positive effects" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning.

== Critique ==
Walther describes some challenges to CMC research. His area of concern lies within three areas:&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

# Neglect of off-line comparisons in CMC
# New technologies
# Studying interpersonal communication

Walthers seeks to tell researchers not compare FtF communication with CMC due the fact they rely on different users and features.

According to Charles Soukup (2000), the problem with CMC communication lies within the multi-media aspects. Many researcher have lacked studying new technologies and multi-media outlets in today's society. Researchers are failing to see the new dimensions CMC has to offer, the researchers are relying too much on textual aspects of CMC rather than communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soukup |first1=Charles |title=Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=30 June 2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=407–425 |doi=10.1177/1461444800002004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How accounting revenue and costs are to be [[Revenue recognition|recognized]] depends first on whether the stage of completion of a project can be reliably measured. If this is the case, cost and revenue (including profit if any) can be recognized up to the percentage of completion during the current accounting period. If the stage of completion of a project cannot be reliably measured, the revenue can only be recognized up to the costs that have been incurred and any profit is only recognized at the end of the last accounting period. In the case a company is expecting to make a loss on the contract, this loss will be immediately recognized in the current accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/docs/consolidated/ias11_en.pdf|title=International Accounting Standard 11 Construction Contracts|last=|first=|date=|website=Europa.eu|publisher=European Union|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ice-type model is a lattice model defined on a lattice of [[coordination number]] 4 - that is, each vertex of the lattice is connected by an edge to four "nearest neighbours". A state of the model consists of an arrow on each edge of the lattice, such that the number of arrows pointing inwards at each vertex is 2. This restriction on the arrow configurations is known as the '''ice rule'''. In [[graph theory|graph theoretic]] terms, the states are [[Eulerian path|Eulerian]] [[orientation (graph theory)|orientations]] of the underlying undirected graph.&lt;ref&gt;

For two-dimensional models, the lattice is taken to be the square lattice. For more realistic models, one can use a three-dimensional lattice appropriate to the material being considered; for example, the [[Ice Ih|hexagonal ice lattice]] is used to analyse ice.

At any vertex, there are six configurations of the arrows which satisfy the ice rule (justifying the name "six-vertex model"). The valid configurations for the (two-dimensional) square lattice are the following:

:[[File:Sixvertex2.png|500px]]

The energy of a state is understood to be a function of the configurations at each vertex. For square lattices, one assumes that the total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; E = n_1\epsilon_1 + n_2\epsilon_2 + \ldots + n_6\epsilon_6,&lt;/math&gt;

for some constants &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_6&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; here denotes the number of vertices with the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th configuration from the above figure. The value &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is the energy associated with vertex configuration number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

One aims to calculate the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of an ice-type model, which is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; Z = \sum \exp(-E/k_BT),&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over all states of the model, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the state, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the system's temperature.

Typically, one is interested in the [[thermodynamic limit]] in which the number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of vertices approaches infinity. In that case, one instead evaluates the '''free energy per vertex''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the limit as &lt;math&gt;N\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; f = -k_BT N^{-1}\log Z.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, one evaluates the '''partition function per vertex''' &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; in the thermodynamic limit, where
:&lt;math&gt;W=Z^{1/N}.&lt;/math&gt;

The values &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; are related by
:&lt;math&gt;f= -k_BT \log W.&lt;/math&gt;

==Physical justification==
Several real crystals with hydrogen bonds satisfy the ice model, including ice&lt;ref name="pauling" /&gt; and potassium dihydrogen phosphate {{chem|KH|2}}{{chem|PO|4}}&lt;ref name="slater" /&gt; (KDP). Indeed, such crystals motivated the study of ice-type models.

In ice, each oxygen atom is connected by a bond to four other oxygens, and each bond contains one hydrogen atom between the terminal oxygens. The hydrogen occupies one of two symmetrically located positions, neither of which is in the middle of the bond. Pauling argued&lt;ref name="pauling" /&gt; that the allowed configuration of hydrogen atoms is such that there are always exactly two hydrogens close to each oxygen, thus making the local environment imitate that of a water molecule, {{chem|H|2}}{{chem|O}}. Thus, if we take the oxygen atoms as the lattice vertices and the hydrogen bonds as the lattice edges, and if we draw an arrow on a bond which points to the side of the bond on which the hydrogen atom sits, then ice satisfies the ice model.

Similar reasoning applies to show that KDP also satisfies the ice model.

==Specific choices of vertex energies==
On the square lattice, the energies &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_6&lt;/math&gt; associated with vertex configurations 1-6 determine the relative probabilities of states, and thus can influence the macroscopic behaviour of the system. The following are common choices for these vertex energies.

===The ice model===
When modelling ice, one takes &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=\ldots=\epsilon_6=0&lt;/math&gt;, as all permissible vertex configurations are understood to be equally likely. In this case, the partition function &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; equals the total number of valid states. This model is known as the '''ice model''' (as opposed to an ''ice-type'' model).

===The KDP model of a ferroelectric===
Slater&lt;ref name="slater" /&gt; argued that KDP could be represented by an ice-type model with energies
:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=0, \epsilon_3=\epsilon_4=\epsilon_5=\epsilon_6&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

For this model (called the '''KDP model'''), the most likely state (the least-energy state) has all horizontal arrows pointing in the same direction, and likewise for all vertical arrows. Such a state is a [[ferroelectric]] state, in which all hydrogen atoms have a preference for one fixed side of their bonds.

===Rys ''F'' model of an antiferroelectric===
The '''Rys &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; model'''&lt;ref name="rys" /&gt; is obtained by setting
:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=\epsilon_3=\epsilon_4&gt;0, \epsilon_5=\epsilon_6=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The least-energy state for this model is dominated by vertex configurations 5 and 6. For such a state, adjacent horizontal bonds necessarily have arrows in opposite directions and similarly for vertical bonds, so this state is an [[antiferroelectric]] state.

===The zero field assumption===
If there is no ambient electric field, then the total energy of a state should remain unchanged under a charge reversal, i.e. under flipping all arrows. Thus one may assume without loss of generality that
:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_1=\epsilon_2, \quad \epsilon_3=\epsilon_4, \quad \epsilon_5=\epsilon_6&lt;/math&gt;

This assumption is known as the '''zero field assumption''', and holds for the ice model, the KDP model, and the Rys ''F'' model.

==History==
The ice rule was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the [[residual entropy]] of ice that had been measured by [[William F. Giauque]] and J. W. Stout.&lt;ref&gt;

 |bibcode=1936JAChS..58.1144G
 |doi=10.1021/ja01298a023
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The residual entropy, &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;, of ice is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; S= k_B\log Z = k_B\, N \, \log W, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; k_B &lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of oxygen atoms in the piece of ice, which is always taken to be large (the [[thermodynamic limit]]) and &lt;math&gt; Z=W^N &lt;/math&gt; is the number of configurations of the hydrogen atoms according to Pauling's ice rule. Without the ice rule we would have &lt;math&gt; W =4 &lt;/math&gt; since the number of hydrogen atoms is &lt;math&gt; 2N &lt;/math&gt; and each hydrogen has two possible locations. Pauling estimated that the ice rule reduces this to &lt;math&gt; W =1.5 &lt;/math&gt;, a number that would agree extremely well with the Giauque-Stout measurement of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;. It can be said that Pauling's calculation of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; for ice is one of the simplest, yet most accurate applications of [[statistical mechanics]] to real substances ever made. The question that remained was whether, given the model, Pauling's calculation of &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;, which was very approximate, would be sustained by a rigorous calculation. This became a significant problem in [[combinatorics]].

Both the three-dimensional and two-dimensional models were computed numerically by John F. Nagle in 1966&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found that &lt;math&gt; W = 1.50685 \pm 0.00015&lt;/math&gt; in three-dimensions and &lt;math&gt; W= 1.540 \pm0.001 &lt;/math&gt; in two-dimensions. Both are amazingly close to Pauling's rough calculation, 1.5.

In 1967, Lieb found the exact solution of three two-dimensional ice-type models: the ice model,&lt;ref name="lieba" /&gt; the Rys &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; model,&lt;ref name="liebb"&gt;

 |bibcode=1967PhRvL..19..108L
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.108
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution for the ice model gave the exact value of &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; in two-dimensions as

:&lt;math&gt; W_{2D} = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{3/2} = 1.5396007.... &lt;/math&gt;

which is known as [[Lieb's square ice constant]].

Later in 1967, Bill Sutherland generalised Lieb's solution of the three specific ice-type models to a general exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models satisfying the zero field assumption.&lt;ref&gt;

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.103
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still later in 1967, C. P. Yang&lt;ref name="yang1967"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Yang |first=C. P.
 |year=1967
 |title=Exact Solution of a Two-Dimensional Model for Hydrogen-Bonded Crystals
 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]
 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=586–588
 |bibcode=1967PhRvL..19..586Y
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.586
}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalised Sutherland's solution to an exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models in a horizontal electric field.

In 1969, John Nagle derived the exact solution for a three-dimensional version of the KDP model, for a specific range of temperatures.&lt;ref name="nagle1969" /&gt; For such temperatures, the model is "frozen" in the sense that (in the thermodynamic limit) the energy per vertex and entropy per vertex are both zero. This is the only known exact solution for a three-dimensional ice-type model.

==Relation to eight-vertex model==
The [[eight-vertex model]], which has also been exactly solved, is a generalisation of the (square-lattice) six-vertex model: to recover the six-vertex model from the eight-vertex model, set the energies for vertex configurations 7 and 8 to infinity.  Six-vertex models have been solved in some cases for which the eight-vertex model has not; for example, Nagle's solution for the three-dimensional KDP model&lt;ref name="nagle1969" /&gt; and Yang's solution of the six-vertex model in a horizontal field.&lt;ref name="yang1967" /&gt;

==Boundary conditions==
This ice model provide an important 'counterexample'  in statistical mechanics:
the bulk free energy in the [[thermodynamic limit]]  depends on boundary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

 |last1=Korepin |first1=V.

 |bibcode=2000JPhA...33.7053K
 |doi=10.1088/0305-4470/33/40/304
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was analytically solved for periodic boundary conditions, anti-periodic, ferromagnetic and domain wall boundary conditions. The six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions on a square lattice has specific significance in combinatorics, it helps to enumerate [[Alternating sign matrix|alternating sign matrices]]. In this case the partition function can be represented as a determinant of a matrix (whose dimension is equal to the size of the lattice), but in other cases the enumeration of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; does not come out in such a simple closed form.

Clearly, the largest &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is given by ''free'' boundary conditions (no constraint at all on the configurations on the boundary), but the same &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; occurs, in the thermodynamic limit, for periodic boundary conditions,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as used originally to derive &lt;math&gt;W_{2D}&lt;/math&gt;.

==3-colorings of a lattice==
The number of states of an ice type model on the internal edges of a finite simply connected union of squares of a lattice is equal to one third of the number of ways to 3-color the squares, with no two adjacent squares having the same color. This correspondence between states is due to Andrew Lenard and is given as follows. If a square has color ''i'' = 0, 1, or 2, then the arrow
on the edge to an adjacent square goes left or right (according to an observer in the square) depending on whether the color in the adjacent square is ''i''+1 or ''i''&amp;minus;1 mod 3. There are 3 possible ways to color a fixed initial square, and once this initial color is chosen this gives a 1:1 correspondence between colorings and arrangements of arrows satisfying the ice-type condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">A '''Kelvin bridge''', also called a '''Kelvin double bridge''' and in some countries a '''Thomson bridge''', is a measuring instrument used to measure unknown [[Resistor|electrical resistors]] below 1&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]. It is specifically designed to measure resistors that are constructed as four terminal resistors.

==Background==
Resistors above about 1 ohm in value can be measured using a variety of techniques, such as an [[ohmmeter]] or by using a [[Wheatstone bridge]]. In such resistors, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals is negligible compared to the resistance value. For resistors of less than an ohm, the resistance of the connecting wires or terminals becomes significant, and conventional measurement techniques will include them in the result.

[[File:Four terminal resistor symbol.tif|right|thumb|200px|Symbol for four terminal resistor]] To overcome the problems of these undesirable resistances (known as '[[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic resistance]]'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current [[ammeter]] shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals and a pair of potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. The volt drop measured will be entirely due to the resistor itself as the parasitic resistance of the leads carrying the current to and from the resistor are not included in the potential circuit. To measure such resistances requires a [[bridge circuit]] designed to work with four terminal resistances. That bridge is the Kelvin bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Northrup |first=Edwin F. |title=Methods of Measuring Electrical Resistance |year=1912 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3lKAAAAMAAJ |pages=100–131 |ref=none |chapter=VI: The Measurement of Low Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Kelvin bridge diagram.tif|right|thumb|300px|Circuit diagram of Kelvin bridge]]
[[File:Kelvin bridge by RFT.png|right|thumb|300px|A commercial Kelvin Bridge]]
{{See also|Four-terminal sensing}}
The operation of the Kelvin bridge is very similar to the Wheatstone bridge, but uses two additional resistors. Resistors ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are connected to the outside potential terminals of the four terminal known or standard resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and the unknown resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (identified as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the diagram). The resistors ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are essentially a Wheatstone bridge. In this arrangement, the parasitic resistance of the upper part of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and the lower part of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is outside of the potential measuring part of the bridge and therefore are not included in the measurement.  However, the link between ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) ''is'' included in the potential measurement part of the circuit and therefore can affect the accuracy of the result. To overcome this, a second pair of resistors ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form a second pair of arms of the bridge (hence 'double bridge') and are connected to the inner potential terminals of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (identified as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the diagram). The detector D is connected between the junction of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the junction of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_8/10.html All About Circuits]&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance equation of this bridge is given by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\frac{R_2}{R_1}+\frac{R_\text{par}}{R_s} \cdot \frac{R'_1}{R'_1+R'_2+R_\text{par}} \cdot \left( \frac{R_2}{R_1}-\frac{R'_2}{R'_1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

In a practical bridge circuit, the ratio of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is arranged to be the same as the ratio of R1 to R2 (and in most designs, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As a result, the last term of the above equation becomes zero and the balance equation becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_x}{R_s}=\frac{R_2}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to make ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; the subject

: &lt;math&gt; R_x=R_2 \cdot \frac{R_s}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

The parasitic resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt; has been eliminated from the balance equation and its presence does not affect the measurement result. This equation is the same as for the functionally equivalent Wheatstone bridge.

In practical use the magnitude of the supply B, can be arranged to provide current through Rs and Rx at or close to the rated operating currents of the smaller rated resistor. This contributes to smaller errors in measurement. This current does not flow through the measuring bridge itself. This bridge can also be used to measure resistors of the more conventional two terminal design.  The bridge potential connections are merely connected as close to the resistor terminals as possible. Any measurement will then exclude all circuit resistance not within the two potential connections.

==Accuracy==
The accuracy of measurements made using this bridge are dependent on a number of factors. The accuracy of the standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) is of prime importance. Also of importance is how close the ratio of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is to the ratio of ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As shown above, if the ratio is exactly the same, the error caused by the parasitic resistance (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) is completely eliminated. In a practical bridge, the aim is to make this ratio as close as possible, but it is not possible to make it ''exactly'' the same. If the difference in ratio is small enough, then the last term of the balance equation above becomes small enough that it is negligible. Measurement accuracy is also increased by setting the current flowing through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; to be as large as the rating of those resistors allows. This gives the greatest potential difference between the innermost potential connections (''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to those resistors and consequently sufficient voltage for the change in ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to have its greatest effect.

There are some commercial bridges reaching accuracies of better than 2% for resistance ranges from 1 microohm to 25 ohms. One such type is illustrated above.

Laboratory bridges are usually constructed with high accuracy variable resistors in the two potential arms of the bridge and achieve accuracies suitable for calibrating standard resistors. In such an application, the 'standard' resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) will in reality be a sub-standard type (that is a resistor having an accuracy some 10 times better than the required accuracy of the standard resistor being calibrated). For such use, the error introduced by the mis-match of the ratio in the two potential arms would mean that the presence of the parasitic resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt; could have a significant impact on the very high accuracy required. To minimise this problem, the current connections to the standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;); the sub-standard resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) and the connection between them (''R''&lt;sub&gt;par&lt;/sub&gt;) are designed to have as low a resistance as possible, and the connections both in the resistors and the bridge more resemble [[bus bar]]s rather than wire.

Some ohmmeters include Kelvin bridges in order to obtain large measurement ranges. Instruments for measuring sub-ohm values are often referred to as low-resistance ohmmeters, milli-ohmmeters, micro-ohmmeters, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latin American Social Sciences Institute''' or '''Latin American School of Social Sciences''' ('''{{lang-es|Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales}}''' or '''FLACSO''') is an inter-governmental autonomous organization for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] dedicated to research, teaching and spreading of [[social science]]s.

It was created on April 17, 1957,&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; following a [[UNESCO]] initiative at the Latin American Conference on Social Sciences in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Its goal was to promote academic research and development in the region.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite news|first=Manuel|last=Avendaño |title=Josette Altmann, ex primera dama, electa Secretaria General de Flacso |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Josette-Altmann-secretaria-Flacso_0_1564643619.html |work=[[La Nación (San José)]] |date=2016-07-14 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its membership is open to Latin American and Caribbean countries that subscribe to the FLACSO agreement. Current members include: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Suriname]] and Uruguay.

[[Josette Altmann Borbón]], a historian and former [[First Lady of Costa Rica]], was elected Secretary General of FLACSO in June 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; She succeeded Manuel González on July 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt;

'''''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong''''' is a 1995 book by [[James W. Loewen]], a  sociologist. It critically examines twelve popular American [[high school]] history textbooks and concludes that the textbook authors propagate false, [[Eurocentric]] and [[mythology|mythologized]] views of [[History of the United States|American history]]. In addition to his critique of the dominant historical themes presented in high school textbooks, Loewen presents themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A revised hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008.

==Themes==
In ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'',  Loewen criticizes modern American high school history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people  and events such as [[Christopher Columbus]], the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their "bland" and simplistic style. He proposes that when [[History of the United States|American history]] textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of [[hero]]es, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James. [http://www.ushistory.org/us/historians/loewen.asp Interview by ushistory.org]. 12 May 2000. Web. 21 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="993">In [[petroleum engineering]], a '''minipermeameter''' is a [[gas]]-based device for measuring [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] in [[Porosity|porous]] rocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5373727.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Minipermeametry has been used in the oil industry since the late 1960s (Eijpe and Weber, 1971) without becoming in any way a standard experimental method in core analysis or reservoir characterisation. The laboratory minipermeametry can make important contributions both as an improved methodology within experimental petrophysics and as a source of data invaluable in routine reservoir characterisation (C. HALVORSEN AND A. HURST, 1990)

The values obtained from the minipermeameter should possibly be calibrated by a [[Klinkenberg correction]]

'''The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut''' is situated at the heart of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Naumburg Cathedral]] and the landscpae has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the [[World Heritage List|List of World Heritage]]. On July 1, 2018, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-naumburg-cathedral-wins-world-heritage-designation/a-44481701|title=Germany's Naumburg Cathedral wins World Heritage designation|work=[[DW-TV|DW]]|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape arount the World Heritage nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" is representative for processes at the [[High Middle Ages]] that shaped the whole continent: [[Christianization]], settlement and [[Cultivation (agriculture)|cultivation]] processes, the so-called [[Landesausbau]], that took place between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers as well as to the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.

== Nomination as World Heritage ==
[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]
In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed into the Tentative List for World Heritage nominations and extended seven years later by its surrounding cultural [[landscape]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tentative Lists are prepared by States Parties to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural and Natural World Heritage. They contain a number of nominiation proposals to be submitted in the future. For further information on the selection of potential World Heritage sites, please see [http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ selection criteria].&lt;/ref&gt; ″The ′Naumburg Cathedral and the surrounding cultural landscape along the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]′ are outstanding and representative examples of the High Middle Ages (1000-1300). Nowhere else in the world has such a high density of monuments and cultural landscape elements from the High Middle Ages been preserved in such a small space in such a level of authenticity in its original spatial setting.″.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The nomination was discussed on the 39th meeting of [[World Heritage Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/INF.19.{{cite book|title=Summary Records of the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heritage Committee decided to defer the nomination in order to allow for a revision and renewed submission taking into account the recommendations of the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]-evaluation and seeking the guidance and advice by ICOMOS in the process.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/19.{{cite book|title=Decisions adopted at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On 1 February 2016, Germany submitted a renewed submission to the [[World Heritage Centre]] in [[Paris]], [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomination was discussed at the 41st meeting of the World Heritage Committee in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], from 2 until 12 July 2017 where the Committee decided upon the Outstanding Universal Value of the Naumburg Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41st session of the World Heritage Committee in Krakow|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany submitted the revised nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" on  1 February 2018. However, only [[Naumburg Cathedral]] was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] on July 1, 2018. The German officials were indifferent about the decision of excluding the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

=== Cultural landscape ===
The cultural landscape around the Naumburg Cathedral  is a [[cultural landscape]] that illustrates the "evolution of human society and settlement over time".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2016): WHC.16/01. {{cite book|title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.|page=11|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This landscape was created intentionally by man.&lt;ref name="Rössler2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=World Heritage Centre|title=Cultural landscapes: The challenges of conservation|chapter-url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/publications|last=Rössler|first=Mechtild|chapter=Linking Nature and Culture: World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2002|publisher=UNESCO press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut displays the rise of the [[Central Middle Ages]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haverkamp|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-last=Schieder|editor2-first=Wolfgang|title=Aufbruch und Gestaltung, Deutschland 1056-1273, Volume 1.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz3bPMw_7h4C&amp;pg=PA407|last=Le Goff|first=Jacques|chapter=The High Middle Ages.|year=1992|publisher=C.H. Beck|isbn=3406302653|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of rise, a ″take off″ due to an [[Population growth|increase in population]], [[Christianization]] and major transformation in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="″Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Classen|editor-first=Albrecht|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms –Methods-Trends.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Narratology and Literary Theory in Medieval Studies.|year=1992|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=3110267306|page=982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ″Landesausbau″, [[Urban planning|urban development]], internal [[colonization]] and territorialisation, took place all across [[Europe]]. ″Never again has Europe seen such cultural and institutional uniformity as at that time″.&lt;ref name="″Simms"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smyth|editor-first=William J.|editor2-last=Wehlan|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Common Ground: Essays on the Historical Geography of Ireland presented to T.

The nominated area serves as an extraordinary model region due to the density and quality of elements displaying mediaeval land development and land exploitation. It was a melting pot of populations of different origins, [[Franks|Frankish]], [[Thuringian]], [[Saxon]], [[Flemish]], and [[Slavs|Slavonic]]. Furthermore, as a sensitive border region, it was shaped by [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] and secular powers seeking the rights of possession, representation and defense. &lt;br /&gt;
In the nominated landscape, 720 elements from the period of the [[Central Middle Ages]] are still in use, establish the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the region and give testimony of the shaping of border lands during a period of no more than 200 years in the [[High Middle Ages]], which has in this instance been tangibly preserved to present day.&lt;ref name="″Denyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor-first=Ken|editor2-last=Clair|editor2-first=Archer S.|editor3-last=Mitchell|editor3-first=Nora J.|title=Conserving Cultural Landscapes: Challenges and New Directions.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Sustaining the Outstanding Universal Value of World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415744058|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the cultural landscape ==

In total, four castles and four [[Monastery|monastic complexes]], two cities as well as villages, vineyards, fertile fields and pastures constitute this nomination.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form a serial nomination with a total of 11 components parts : [[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

=== Component: Naumburg ===
==== Naumburg Cathedral ====
Naumburg Cathedral is known for its [[architecture]], [[sculpture]]s and images: ″The harmonic connection between architecture, sculpture and stained glass windows in the west choir of the cathedral counts among the most impressive creations of human creativity in the Middle Ages at large.″&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] core structure is flanked by two [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Rood screen|choirs]] in the east and in the west, built in the transitional style between [[Romanesque architecture|Late Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]].&lt;ref name="″Wixom"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin v. 46, no. 3|title=Medieval Sculpture at the Cloisters.|last=Wixom|first=William D.|chapter=Medieval Sculpture.|year=1988|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Naumburg Masters =====
[[File:Naumburg Masters.jpg|thumb|Naumburg Masters]]
The worldwide known workshop of [[Sculpture|sculptors]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]], which was likely established in the early [[13th century]], known as the [[Naumburg Master]]s, was headed by a sculptor-architect, who has been described by scholars as ″an artist of real genius″.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Janson|editor-first=Horst W.|editor2-last=Janson|editor2-first=Anthony F.|title=History of Art: The Western Tradition.|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415929356|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work of the Naumburg Masters, marked by an extraordinary realism and individualism of sculptures and a detailed representation of the environment such as plants or ornaments, has justified Naumburg’s reputation beyond its region. The Naumburg Masters were conveyors and pioneers of the innovations in architecture and sculpture of the Late [[Hohenstaufen]] period in the [[13th century]].&lt;ref name="Willamson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Paul|title=Gothic Sculpture, 1140—1300.|date=October 1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300074522|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their building workshop has left traces of its work all the way from Northern [[France]] over the Middle [[Rhine]] area up to the eastern boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Empire]] and further on the southwestern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skulptur, Architektur und Bautechnik des Naumburger Westchors|trans-title=Sculpture, Architecture and Building Techniques of the West Choir of Naumburg.|page=383|author=Dominik Jelschewski|publisher=Pustet, Friedrich GmbH|date=2015|language=German|isbn=3791726005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects the cultural artistic exchange during the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgete.

===== Choir screens – Passion of Christ =====
[[File:West choir.jpg|thumb|West choir]]
One feature of the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost completely preserved [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] screen structures from the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Matthew M.|title=Reading Gothic Architecture|date=2008|publisher=l'Université du Michigan|isbn=9782503525365|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the east choir, the only late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] hall choir screen has survived. In the west choir, there is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] partition-type screen: ″Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.″&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen. Space, sculpture, and community in the cathedrals of France and Germany ca. 1200-1400|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=EW31mRyo8acC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jacqueline+E.+Jung:+The+gothic+screen.&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJyJ7P_OLTAhUG0xoKHVLwBzcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacqueline%20E.%20Jung%3A%20The%20gothic%20screen|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107022959|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The western mural choir screen shows artistic quality in terms of architecture, ornamentation and figural sculptures: ″The mid-thirteenth-century west choir of Naumburg Cathedral has long been admired both for its unified architectural design″.″&lt;ref name="Jung2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen.

The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] is one of the most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing. The [[Naumburg Master]] achieved a degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy that conveys the suffering of [[Christ]] and the deep grief of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and St. John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L´Arte Medievale nel contesto 300-1300.

===== Founder statues – Uta =====
[[File:Uta from Naumburg.jpg|thumb|[[Uta von Ballenstedt]] statue, located in the west choir of the Naumburg Cathedral]]
[[File:Founder figures Hermann und Reglindis.jpg|thumb|left|Founder figures Hermann und Reglindis]]
The Early Gothic west choir was built with an elevated gallery portraying the founders. The life-sized representation of a group of 12 people of the high nobility that were neither emperor neither king is unique in [[History of art|art history]] : ″The twelve founder statues […] are extraordinary in many aspects. A series of monumental representations of secular male and female founders of the cathedral of Naumburg, the statues are characterized by startling vividness and by theatrical interaction″.&lt;ref name="Karge2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hispanic Research Journal|title=Iberian and Latin American Studies |last=Karge|first=Henrik|chapter=From Naumburg to Burgos. European sculpture and dynastic politics in the thirteenth century|year=2012|publisher=Hispanic Research Journal|pages=432–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues are considered ″sculptural ensemble of the major arts″&lt;ref name="Karge"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Colum|editor-first=Huriane|title=From Minor To Major. The Minor Arts in Medieval Art History|last=Wolter|first=Harald|chapter=Secular Arts: Their Order and Importance|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University|pages=66–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to their expressiveness and to the individualized portraits.

[[File:Founder figures Ekkehard und Uta.jpg|thumb|Founder figures Ekkehard und Uta]]
One founder couple, [[Ekkehard II]], [[List of margraves of Meissen|Margrave of Meissen]], with his wife [[Uta von Ballenstedt]], stands in the north. Margravess Uta is presented like a queen with a fleur-de-lis crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallafinedelmondo.blogspot.de/2015/06/maestro-di-naumburg-uta-von-ballenstedt.html|title=Master of Naumburg|publisher=Daniel di Schüler|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture of Uta has experienced an unparalleled cult, due considerably to photographs taken by the Naumburger photographer Walter Hege in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uta von Naumburg.

===== Glass painting =====
[[File:West choir Naumburg.jpg|thumb|West choir Naumburg]]
The window paintings of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the [[Naumburg Master]], together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of the images of the saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishops of Naumburg]] at the bottom of the window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass paintings of their style from the [[13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgeschichte.

===== Old Town of Naumburg =====
[[File:Old city of Naumburg.jpg|thumb|Old city of Naumburg]]
Naumburg was a [[Episcopal see|bishop’s seat]] and an important [[Market (place)|market place]] founded at the beginning of the [[11th century]] on the place of the former [[Slavs|Slav]] fortress of [[Wethau]]. The development of the town is closely connected with one of the most powerful and noble Ekkehardine dynasty of that time, [[Emperor Conrad II]] and [[Bishop of Zeitz|Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz]]. 
With the consent of the [[pope John XIX]] and the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Konrad II]], as well as citing the danger of Slav incursions, [[margrave]] Ekkerhard I relocated the [[Episcopal see|Episcopal See]] of Zeitz to Naumburg. Along with the bishop’s seat he transferred his own family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle ″Nuwemburch″ in Naumburg around 1028. Furthermore, he assigned the protection of the See to the ″new castle″, an event hitherto unparalleled in the history of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vereinigte-domstifter.de/en/foundation/the-combined-cathedral-chapters/domstift-naumburg|title=

In 1033, another highly unusual event for this time took place: On the initiative of the bishop Kadeloh of Memleben, Emperor Conrad II granted the merchants of Kleinjena, who moved to Naumburg free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuter|first=Timothy|title=Germany in the Early Middle Ages c.800 – 1056 (Longman History of Germany)|date= 2013|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=9780582081567|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest dated written document from 13 July 1033, that marked the Nuvemburg to the powerful market and merchant settlement in Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Naumburg: Teil 1 (967-1207)|trans-title=The book of documents of the Bishopric Naumburg: Part1 |page=26|author=Rosenfeld, Felix|publisher=Magdeburg|date=1925|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Margraves Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries, the [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine Monastery]] of St. George and the St Moritz Monastery. When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious center for the entirety of this border region. The trade routes in the region were relocated to Naumburg, which was strategically situated at the crossing of the [[Via Regia]] and the Regensburg Road.&lt;ref name="Jeep3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Garland|isbn=9781135575069|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays, the roads as well as parcel structures reflect the structure of the medieval civil town. The earliest stone buildings in Naumburg are situated in the cathedral precincts with the oldest residential tower of Naumburg with two Romanesque floors constructed probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts.

The old town of Freyburg is situated 9 kilometers north of Naumburg on the left bank of the Unstrut River. This component contains Neuenburg Castle above the river valley.

==== Neuenburg Castle ====
[[File:Neuenburg Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Neuenburg Chapel]]
Around 1090, it was most probably [[Louis the Springer]]  who built the vast and impressive complex of Neuenburg Castle. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self-confidence and sophistication of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowingians]]. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the largest and most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the [[13th century]]. It was designed as a border castle for the powerful Ludowinger dynasty and was part of a network of the landgraves’ castles, which also included [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die romanische Neuenburg bei Freyburg (Unstrut) und ihre Stellung im hochmittelalterlichen Burgenbau.

[[File:Neuenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg at night]]
Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was extended and modernized on a large scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the [[castle]] was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The [[landmark]] big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the [[Rhineland]] region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schloß Neuenburg bei Freyburg/Unstrut.

[[File:Residence building at Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Residence building at Neuenburg]]
The court culture of the [[Count palatine|Count Palatine]] at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire at the end of the [[12th century in Germany|12th]] and beginning of the [[13th century]]. The most important poets of the 13th century, namely [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]  and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]  stayed at Neuenburg Castle. Heinrich von Weldecke completed here the [[Eneas]] novel which was the foundation of the [[German language]] secular epic. ″When Veldeke was called to the court of Thuringia [..], he joined the entourage of a great patron and became the esteemed center of the most important literary circle that existed in Germany at the time″.&lt;ref name="Bunke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunke|first=Joachim|title=Courtly Culture: Literature and Society in the High Middle Ages|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520066342|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Old town of Freyburg ====
[[File:Neuenburg view from Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg view from Freyburg]]
In the last quarter of the 12th, [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Herman I]] from the [[Ludowinger]] dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the [[Unstrut|Unstrut River]]. The [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ″frey″ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freyburg an der Unstrut – Ein Beispiel landesherrlicher Städtepolitik.

The landgraves were not directly present in the town but resided in Neuenburg Castle. [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgrove Ludwig IV]] and his wife, the later Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], built the town parish church of St Mary’s to emphasize the baronial need for representation.&lt;ref name="Heinemeyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brekle|editor-first=Herbert E.|editor2-last=Dobnig-Jiilich|editor2-first=Edeltraud a.o.|title=New German Biography (NDB)|last=Barrera|first=Magdalena|chapter=Ludwig IV the Saint, Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony. |year=1987|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|isbn= 3428001826|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital ornamentation in the entrance area with its diamond-shaped net and the Romanesque sculpting of the compact [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is of outstanding quality in the way of the curves of the bodies and the graphic lines of the figures were sculptured. 
Freyburg’s regular layout is a grid of roads crossing each other in right angles, a distinct transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger dynasty]] in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its [[viticulture]] for which it is still known in the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beziehungen zwischen Kulturlandschaften und Tourismus.

==== Zscheiplitz Monastery ====
[[File:Church in Zscheiplitz.jpg|thumb|Church in Zscheiplitz]]
The [[Benedictine]] convent of nuns, the Zscheiplitz Monastery, was first mentioned in 1203 and is situated two kilometers west of Freyburg. The name of Zscheiplitz has its roots in the Slavic name ″ciplic″ (small). Around 1085, after the murder of [[Friedrich III, Landgraf of Thuringia|landgrave Friedrich III]], his widow Adelheid donated the estate of Zscheiplitz to the church. It was then turned into a Benedictine monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Zscheiplitz. Sühnekirche, Kloster, Rittergut, Dorfkirche, Weingut.

The church of Zscheiplitz was built as a one-nave church in the 12th century and extended by a gallery to the west and in the north during the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zscheiplitz.com/history/|title=Official Website of the Zscheiplitz Monastery|publisher=zscheiplitz monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vineyard of Schweigenberg ====
The [[vineyard]] of Schweigenberg is located west of Freyburg and was probably created by citizens of Freyburg upon the initiative of the [[List of rulers of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and / or the monasteries of Goseck and Zscheiplitz in the 13th century. It benefitted from favorable climatic conditions and agrarian innovations for a diversified subsistence economy in the region. This vineyard is still recognized in Germany as a prime example of [[Wine-growing in Germany|terraced winegrowing]] by way of hoe-farming as a monument of this traditional form of cultivation.

=== Component: Pforta ===
[[File:Pforta from air.jpg|thumb|left|Pforta from air]]
The [[Pforta|monastery of Pforta]]  was created by the [[Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-pforta.de/#/#4/|title=Official Website of Pforta Monastery|publisher=Pforta monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premises include functional buildings, the Romanesque House ([[Monastic grange|grange]]), the Kleine Saale [[canal]], as well as the vineyards of Köppelberg and Saalhäuser. The ensemble of Cistercian monuments attests to the order’s life and work and embodies the significant influence exerted in the wider [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] and beyond the boundaries of the region.

==== History ====
[[File:Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Monastery Pforta]]
Pforta Monastery was founded around 1132 on the initiative of [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishop Udo I of Naumburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Sankt Marien zur Pforte.''In: Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V.:''Macht.Glaube.Glanz: Auf dem Weg zum Welterbe.|trans-title= The Cistercian monastery Sankt Marien to Pforta.

The name of Porta, meaning Porta Coeli – i.e. Pearly Gates – , refers to the architecture of the richly ornamented western façade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the crucifixion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.

==== Architecture ====
[[File:Facade of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of Monastery Pforta]]
The [[minster (church)|minster]] was built in the 1130s in the plain character of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercians monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Jeep"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Germany. An Encyclopedia.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203801765|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1251, the Cistercians decided on an ambitious building project. Even though the new church building with its west façade was still ascetic in the interior decor, it clearly reflected the significant economic and political power of the monastery. The Gothic [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the minster is the architectural example of the regional [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] reception with French roots, transferring the latest shapes and forms inspired by French Gothic design and adapting them to local conditions. The glass paintings of the church, including in Europe’s oldest Cistercian tracery rose window preserved almost completely together with its glazing, are an extraordinary treasure of medieval paintings.
[[File:Chapel of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Monastery Pforta]]
The so-called Abbot’s Chapel (Abtskapelle) is considered to be an outstanding architectural example of the medieval infirmaries and nursing wards of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]]. Before its conversion into an [[abbot]]’s home, it had been part of the infirmary wing, allowing people to participate in the mass from there. Rare elements were found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the [[Hospital|infirmary]].

==== Hydraulic system ====
In 1180, the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] created the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] mill race called ″Kleine Saale″ (Little Saale), a [[canal]] of 10 kilometers length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Kulturlandschaft um Schulpforta.

The Benedictine monks of St George, the canons of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the Naumburg cathedral chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization. Maintenance work was managed by a water expert from Pforta Monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg. The Kleine Saale shows the Cistercian [[hydraulic engineering]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Wirtschaftstätigkeit der Zisterzienser im Mittelalter, Agrarwirtschaft.''In:'' Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft.|pages=84–112|trans-title=The economy of the Cisterciansin the Middle-Ages.

==== Grange ====
The Romanesque House is an impressive piece of evidence of a former [[Monastic grange|grange]] of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], Naumburg, [[Jena]] and [[Erfurt]]. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As a result of its aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the [[Margravate of Meissen|margraviates of Meissen]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] – and thus to [[Silesia]] – without being charged [[tax]]es or dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenfälschungen und die frühe Geschichte bis 1236.|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|date=2003|language=German.|isbn=9783412146016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winemaking ====
The Cistercian monks set about profitably using the land they had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and versatile way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines on the slopes of the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of [[orchard]]s, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and fishing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep [[Vineyard|slope vineyards]] between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Zisterzienser und ihre Weinberge in Brandenburg.Studien zur Geschichte, Kunst und Kultur der Zisterzienser.|trans-title=The Cistercians and their vineyards in Brandenburg.

== History ==
[[File:Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The area provided moderate climate, fertile soils, rich water sources and wood supply through forests and was populated by [[Stone Age]] hunters 380 000 years ago . From the [[Neolithic Age]]  onwards throughout all [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], the area was settled.&lt;ref name="Bogucki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogucki|first=Peter|title=Forest Farmers and Stockherders.

=== The Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Ebersorda.jpg|thumb|Ebersorda]]
The [[Migration Period]]  brought decisive changes from 375 AD onwards and also had an influence on the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]]. The local population, consisting of migrating [[Germanic peoples|Germanic Varini]] and Angles, merged to form the [[Thuringians]]. Following the defeat of the Thuringian army by Frankish troops in 531, the [[Merovingians]] as Frankish rulers settled groups of [[Frisians]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and probably also [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]] to the south and north of the Unstrut in exchange for payment of [[Lay Tithes|tithes]].&lt;ref name="Steuer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fries-Knoblach|editor-first=Janine|editor2-last=Steuer|editor2-first=Heiko|title=The Baiuvarii and Thuring|last=Steuer|first=Heiko|chapter=Thuringians and Bavarians – Location in Space and Time and Social Relations|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843839156|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumminger"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|title=Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian Period: An Ethnographic Perspective|last=Dumminger|first=Areas F.|chapter=Dwellings, settlements and settlement patterns of the sixth and seventh centuries in southwest Germany and adjacent areas.|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843830351|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These settlers were met by [[Sorbs (tribe)|Slav Sorb tribes]] originating from the region of the [[Dnieper]], who came westward as far as the [[Saale|River Saale]], crossed it repeatedly and beginning to settle on its western banks. The [[Sorbs]]  had more than 50 civitates, meaning central strongholds with relating settlements. Such a fortified district or “Gau” developed on the site of today’s town of Naumburg and was called “Wethau”; the centre was a Sorb castle complex in Wettaburg (now an urban district of Naumburg) .
The region by the Saale and Unstrut rivers had thus become a sensitive border area because it marked the border between the peoples of Germanic and [[Slavs|Slav]] origin and also the north-eastern border of [[Christianity]] in continental [[Europe]].

In 766, a successful Frankish attack was launched against Wettaburg Castle, that was the headquarters of the [[Sorbs]] in the Saale-Unstrut region. The [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]] was at its largest during the reign of [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]]’s son [[Charlemagne]] (768 – 814).

As elsewhere, Christianization ran parallel to military subjugation in the Saxon area.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard A.|title=The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity.|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Saale]] remained the lasting natural border with the Slavic territories. In conjunction with the hinterland, the Saale was protected from possible attacks from the east by a chain of closely neighboring strongholds and fortifications,including the ″[[Limes Sorabicus]]″. &lt;br /&gt;
The territory of the [[Frankish Empire]] extended in the first quarter of the [[9th century]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the Elbe and Saale in the east, from the [[North Sea]] in the north to [[Central Italy]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=A Sacred Kingdom: Bishops and the Rise of Frankish Kingship|date=2011|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=9780813218779|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most of Christian Europe was united in [[Charlemagne]]’s hands.  However, Charlemagne’s successors were not able to maintain Imperial unity.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Charlemagne.|date=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780333650554|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 919, Heinrich, the duke of Saxony, also known as [[Henry the Fowler]], became king of the Franks and the Saxons. As a result, the Saale-Unstrut region moved from a peripheral position in the Frankish empire to the focus of political interest. Heinrich expanded his power along the eastern border of the Empire by conquering the Slav tribes (928/929) and defeating the [[Hungarians]] by the Unstrut in 933.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmerson|first=Richard K.|title=Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedi.|date=2013|publisher=Routeledge|isbn=9780415973854|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Heinrich I’s expansion policy and the conquest of the Slav tribes, the character of the area east of the Saale and Unstrut changed from a direct border area to a connecting region between the old settlement land to the west and the newly conquered regions by the Elbe.&lt;ref name="Leyser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyser|first=Karl|title=Medieval Germany and its Neighbours, 900-1250.|date=1982|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the consent of the Pope and the German Imperial bishops, the Emperor arranged for [[diocese]]s and bishop’s churches to be established in [[Merseburg Cathedral|Merseburg]], [[Zeitz]] and [[Meissen]] in 968, forming a new church province for the eastern part of the Empire within the equally newly founded [[archbishopric of Magdeburg]].

==== The High Middle Ages ====
[[File:Schleberoda.jpg|thumb|Schleberoda]]
From the [[10th century]] onwards, the Ekkehardine dynasty gained influence in the Empire. Contemporaneous Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described the first prominent representative of this house, [[Ekkehard I]], as a person with an outstanding lack of humility ″He was an ornament to the Empire, a treasure of the land, a hope for his subjects and a terror to his enemies and he would have been completely perfect if he had only been able to remain humble″.&lt;ref name="Merseburg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merseburg|first=Thietmar of|title=Chronicles V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the murder of the margrave Ekkehard I on 30 April 1002, Ekkehard’s sons, Margrave Hermann (1009 – 1038) and [[Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave Ekkehard II]] (1009 – 1046), assumed power in 1009. They became the most powerful rulers in the eastern part of the Empire and moved their family seat from Kleinjena to the ″Neue Burg″ (New Castle, Naumburg). The rise of Naumburg as ecclesiastical, political, cultural and economic centre of the Saale-Unstrut region had begun.&lt;ref name="Bagge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagge|first=Sverre|title=Kings, Politics, and the Right Order of the World in German Historiography: C. 950-1150.|date=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9780415973854|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it has to be emphasized that Sorb ″Smurds″ and German residents lived largely peacefully alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Slaven und Deutsche.

The [[bishops of Naumburg]], the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and the [[margraves of Meissen]] as lords of the town of Naumburg promoted a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo I met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] at the Imperial Diet in Liège in March 1131, a meeting of central significance for the propagation of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian order]] in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mittelalter.|trans-title=Middle Ages. |author=Müller, Harald|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co|date=2008|language=German|isbn=9783050043661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called ″Landesausbau″ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to increase of population, new public assignments of protection and administration for the diocese of Naumburg led to crucial changes in social structure. The prestige attained by the Naumburg bishop’s seat is expressed by the construction of a new cathedral around 1210 during the period of office of Bishop Engelhard (1206 – 1242).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
For the Saale-Unstrut region, the Ludowingers were, together with the Wettin dynasty, the most influential aristocratic dynasty during the 12th and the 13th century. The Ludowingers created a princely court culture modeled to equal royal forms. The magnificent court of Count Palatine Hermann of Saxony (1181 – 1217) at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Im Schatten der Landgrafen: Studien zur adeligen Herrschaftsbildung im hochmittelalterlichen Thüringen.|trans-title=In the shadow of the margraves.

The [[Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt|Wettins]], with Margrave Heinrich the Illustrious (1221 – 1288), were appointed as margraves to the east of the Saale. They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the [[13th century in Germany|13th century]], creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region. The cooperation of the Cistercians with the Wettin and [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger]] dynasties contributed to the transfer of spiritual, cultural and technological knowledge into the areas intended for colonization. Nevertheless, the economic emphasis moved gradually towards the east during the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the importance of the relatively young [[Leipzig|town of Leipzig]] outdid that of the old trade fair town of Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Bedeutung der Zisterzienser für die Ostsiedlung, besonders in Ostschlesien.|trans-title=The importance of the Cistercians for the Eastern Settlement|page=68|author=Gottschalck, Joseph|publisher=Zeitschrift für Ostforschung|date=1966|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the late Middle Ages to the Present ===
Following the [[Reformation]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]](1485 – 1546) in nearby [[Wittenberg]], the Wettins and the region’s nobility turned to [[Protestantism]], promoting and funding the reformers. As a result of the alliance of Protestant rulers and spiritual leaders, the monasteries and religious establishments in Naumburg, Goseck, Zscheiplitz and Pforta were closed between 1533 and 1540 and their endowments and properties confiscated. Only the property rights held by the Naumburg Cathedral chapter remained untouched.&lt;ref name="Ocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocker|first=Christopher|title=Church Robbers and Reformers in Germany, 1525-1547: Confiscation and Religious Purpose in the Holy Roman Empire.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9789004152069|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From the [[18th century]] on, the castles along the Saale and Unstrut amidst their cultural landscape became prime subjects of [[Romanticism|romantic]] admiration. As a result of the [[First Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna]], the [[kingdom of Saxony]] was forced to cede territories to the Prussian king in 1815. The landscape by the [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]] now became part of the [[Prussian state]] until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Unlike many other regions, no drastic changes due to [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] altered this landscape.
It was due to Walter Hege’s photographs published in 1925, that the founder figure of [[Uta of Schauenburg|Uta]] became enormously popular but was exploited during the [[National Socialists]]’ regime. The regime turned Neuenburg Castle into a training centre for senior leaders of the German Girls’ Association (BDM) and the school at Pforta Monastery into a National Political Education Centre (NAPOLA) until the end of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta: Ergebnisse eines Arbeitsprojektes im Rahmen des Graduiertenkollegs "Kunstwissenschaft-Bauforschung-Denkmalpflege" der Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg und der Technischen Universität Berlin.|trans-title=Research on Monastery Pforta: Results of a working project and the Technical University Berlin. |author=Hubel, Achim; Cramer, Johannes|publisher=Janos Stekovics|date=2003|language=German|isbn=9783899230253}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Saale-Unstrut region was spared destruction during the [[Second World War]]. The liberation by American troops in the spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the [[Red Army]] and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of [[East Germany]] (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification of the two German states]] in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the [[Saxony-Anhalt|Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt]].

{{See also|Black body radiation|Thermal radiation}}

'''Planck's law''' describes the [[spectral density]] of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a [[black body]] in [[thermal equilibrium]] at a given [[temperature]] ''T'', when there is no net flow of matter or energy between the body and its environment.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt; The law is named after [[Max Planck]], who proposed it in 1900. It was a pioneering insight of [[modern physics]] and is of fundamental importance to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

==Description==
[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|right|300px|Planck's law accurately describes black body radiation and resolved the problem of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], and are shown here as a family of curves for different temperatures.]]
The [[Radiance|spectral radiance]] of a body, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, describes the amount of energy it emits in terms of radiation at different frequencies. It is the power emitted per unit area of the body, per unit solid angle of emission, per unit frequency. Planck showed that the spectral radiance of a body for [[frequency]] {{math|''ν''}} at [[absolute temperature]] {{math|''T''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(\nu, T) = \frac{ 2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{k_\mathrm B T} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]], {{math|''h''}} is the [[Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in the medium, whether material or vacuum.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 6 168"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pp=6,&amp;nbsp;168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chan8"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1960|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectral radiance can also be expressed per unit [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} instead of per unit frequency. In this case, it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(\lambda, T) =\frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm B T}} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The law may also be expressed in other terms, such as the number of photons emitted at a certain wavelength, or the energy density in a volume of radiation. The [[Radiance|SI units]] of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{nobreak|[[Watt|W]]·[[steradian|sr]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Hertz|Hz]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, while those of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

In the limit of low frequencies (i.e. long wavelengths), Planck's law tends to the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]], while in the limit of high frequencies (i.e. small wavelengths) it tends to the [[Wien approximation]].

[[Max Planck]] developed the law in 1900 with only empirically determined constants, and later showed that, expressed as an energy distribution, it is the unique stable distribution for radiation in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy distribution, it is one of a family of thermal equilibrium distributions which include the [[Bose–Einstein distribution]], the [[Fermi–Dirac distribution]] and the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]].

==Black body radiation==
{{main|Black-body radiation}}
Every [[physical body]] spontaneously and continuously emits [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Near [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the emitted radiation is nearly described by Planck's law. Because of its dependence on [[temperature]], Planck radiation is said to be thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of a body the more radiation it emits at every wavelength. Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a specific wavelength that depends on the temperature.  For example, at room temperature (~{{val|300|ul=K}}), a body emits thermal radiation that is mostly [[infrared]] and invisible. At higher temperatures the amount of infrared radiation increases and can be felt as heat, and the body glows visibly red. At even higher temperatures, a body is dazzlingly bright yellow or blue-white and emits significant amounts of short wavelength radiation, including [[ultraviolet]] and even [[x-ray]]s.  The surface of the sun (~{{val|6000|u=K}}) emits large amounts of both infrared and ultraviolet radiation; its emission is peaked in the visible spectrum.

Planck radiation is the greatest amount of radiation that any body at thermal equilibrium can emit from its surface, whatever its chemical composition or surface structure.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"/&gt; The passage of radiation across an interface between media can be characterized by the [[emissivity]] of the interface (the ratio of the actual [[radiance]] to the theoretical Planck radiance), usually denoted by the symbol {{math|''ε''}}. It is in general dependent on chemical composition and physical structure, on temperature, on the wavelength, on the angle of passage, and on the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hapke|1993|pp=362–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emissivity of a natural interface is always between {{nowrap|1={{math|''ε''}} = 0}} and 1.

A body that interfaces with another medium which both has {{nowrap|1={{math|''ε''}} = 1}} and absorbs all the radiation incident upon it, is said to be a black body. The surface of a black body can be modelled by a small hole in the wall of a large enclosure which is maintained at a uniform temperature with opaque walls that, at every wavelength, are not perfectly reflective. At equilibrium, the radiation inside this enclosure follows Planck's law, and so will the radiation coming out of the small hole.

Just as the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] is the unique maximum [[entropy]] energy distribution for a gas of material particles at thermal equilibrium, so is Planck's distribution for a [[photon gas|gas of photons]].&lt;ref name="Planck 1914"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loudon|2000|pp=3–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast to a material gas where the masses and number of particles play a role, the spectral radiance, pressure and energy density of a photon gas at thermal equilibrium are entirely determined by the temperature.

If the photon gas is not Planckian, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] guarantees that interactions (between photons and other particles or even, at sufficiently high temperatures, between the photons themselves) will cause the photon energy distribution to change and approach the Planck distribution.  In such an approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with a Planck distribution until they reach the equilibrium temperature. It is as if the gas is a mixture of sub-gases, one for every band of wavelengths, and each sub-gas eventually attains the common temperature.

The quantity {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ν'', ''T'')}} is the [[spectral radiance]] as a function of temperature and frequency.  It has units of [[Watt|W]]·[[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·[[steradian|sr]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Hertz|Hz]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SI units|SI system]].  An infinitesimal amount of power {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ν'', ''T'')&amp;nbsp;cos ''θ'' d''A''&amp;nbsp;d''Ω''&amp;nbsp;d''ν''}} is radiated in the direction described by the angle {{math|''θ''}} from the surface normal from infinitesimal surface area {{math|d''A''}} into infinitesimal solid angle {{math|d''Ω''}} in an infinitesimal frequency band of width {{math|d''ν''}} centered on frequency {{math|''ν''}}.  The total power radiated into any solid angle is the [[integral]] of {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ν'', ''T'')}} over those three quantities, and is given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]].  The spectral radiance of Planckian radiation from a black body has the same value for every direction and angle of polarization, and so the black body is said to be a [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian radiator]].

==Different forms==
Planck's law can be encountered in several forms depending on the conventions and preferences of different scientific fields. The various forms of the law for spectral radiance are summarized in the table below. Forms on the left are most often encountered in [[experimental physics|experimental fields]], while those on the right are most often encountered in [[theoretical physics|theoretical fields]].

&lt;/center&gt;

These distributions represent the spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit [[solid angle]], per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber or their angular equivalents). Since the radiance is [[isotropy|isotropic]] (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted at an angle to the [[normal (geometry)|normal]] is proportional to the projected area, and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per [[Lambert's cosine law]], and is [[polarization (waves)|unpolarized]].
&lt;!--Here would probably be a good place to put the form with angular dependance--&gt;

===Correspondence between spectral variable forms===
Different spectral variables require different corresponding forms of expression of the law. In general, one may not convert between the various forms of Planck's law simply by substituting one variable for another, because this would not take into account that the different forms have different units. Wavelength and frequency units are reciprocal.

Corresponding forms of expression are related because they express one and the same physical fact: for a particular physical spectral increment, a corresponding particular physical energy increment is radiated.

This is so whether it is expressed in terms of an increment of frequency, {{math|d''ν''}}, or, correspondingly, of wavelength, {{math|d''λ''}}. Introduction of a minus sign can indicate that an increment of frequency corresponds with decrement of wavelength. In order to convert the corresponding forms so that they express the same quantity in the same units we multiply by the spectral increment. Then, for a particular spectral increment, the particular physical energy increment may be written

:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda ( \lambda, T) \, d \lambda=-B_\nu(\nu ( \lambda) T) \, d \nu,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; which leads to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; B_\lambda(\lambda,T)=-\frac{d \nu}{ d \lambda}B_\nu(\nu (\lambda), T).&lt;/math&gt;

Also, {{math|''ν''(''λ'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''λ''}}}}, so that {{math|{{sfrac|''dν''|''dλ''}} {{=}} − {{sfrac|''c''|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.  Substitution gives the correspondence between the frequency and wavelength forms, with their different dimensions and units.&lt;ref name=SharkovConversions/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_\lambda (T)}{B_\nu (T)}=\frac{c}{\lambda ^2}=\frac{\nu ^2}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Evidently, the location of the peak of the spectral distribution for Planck's law depends on the choice of spectral variable. Nevertheless, in a manner of speaking, this formula means that the shape of the spectral distribution is independent of temperature, according to Wien's displacement law, as detailed below in the sub-section [[Planck's law#Properties|'''Percentiles''']] of the section [[Planck's law#Properties|Properties]].

===Spectral energy density form===
Planck's law can also be written in terms of the spectral [[energy density]] ({{math|''u''}}) by multiplying {{math|''B''}} by {{math|{{sfrac|4π|''c''}}}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u_i(T) = \frac{4\pi}{c} B_i(T). &lt;/math&gt;

These distributions have units of energy per volume per spectral unit.

===First and second radiation constants===
In the above variants of Planck’s law, the ''Wavelength'' and ''Wavenumber'' variants use the terms {{math|2''hc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''hc''|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} which comprise physical constants only. Consequently, these terms can be considered as physical constants themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohr|Taylor|Newell|2012|p=1591}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore referred to as the '''first radiation constant {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1''L''&lt;/sub&gt;}}''' and the '''second radiation constant {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}''' with

:{{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1''L''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2''hc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}

and

:{{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''hc''|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.

Using the radiation constants, the ''Wavelength'' variant of Planck’s law can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;L(\lambda,T) =\frac{c_{1L}}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right)-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''wavenumber'' variant can be simplified correspondingly.

{{math|''L''}} is used here instead of {{math|''B''}} because it is the SI symbol for ''spectral radiance''. The {{math|''L''}} in {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1''L''&lt;/sub&gt;}} refers to that. This reference is necessary because Planck's law can be reformulated to give [[spectral radiant exitance]] {{math|''M''(''λ'',''T'')}} rather than ''spectral radiance'' {{math|''L''(''λ'',''T'')}}, in which case '''{{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}''' replaces {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1''L''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, with

:{{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2π''hc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},

so that Planck’s law for ''spectral radiant exitance'' can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;M(\lambda,T) =\frac{c_{1}}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right)-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==
{{See also|Gas in a box|Photon gas}}
Consider a cube of side {{math|''L''}} with conducting walls filled with electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}. If there is a small hole in one of the walls, the radiation emitted from the hole will be characteristic of a perfect [[black body]]. We will first calculate the spectral energy density within the cavity and then determine the spectral radiance of the emitted radiation.

At the walls of the cube, the parallel component of the electric field and the orthogonal component of the magnetic field must vanish. Analogous to the wave function of a [[particle in a box]], one finds that the fields are superpositions of periodic functions. The three wavelengths {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, in the three directions orthogonal to the walls can be:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_i = \frac{2L}{n_{i}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are positive integers. For each set of integers {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} there are two linearly independent solutions (known as modes). According to quantum theory, the energy levels of a mode are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{n_1,n_2,n_3}\left(r\right)=\left(r+\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{hc}{2L}\sqrt{n_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2}. \qquad \text{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantum number {{math|''r''}} can be interpreted as the number of photons in the mode. The two modes for each set of {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} correspond to the two polarization states of the photon which has a spin of 1. For {{math|1=''r'' = 0}} the energy of the mode is not zero. This vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field is responsible for the [[Casimir effect]]. In the following we will calculate the internal energy of the box at [[absolute temperature]] {{math|''T''}}.

According to [[statistical mechanics]], the equilibrium probability distribution over the energy levels of a particular mode is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;P_r =\frac{\exp\left(-\beta E\left(r\right)\right)}{Z\left(\beta\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here

:&lt;math&gt;\beta\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{k_\mathrm{B}T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator {{math|''Z''(''β'')}}, is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of a single mode and makes {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}} properly normalized:

:&lt;math&gt;Z\left(\beta\right)=\sum_{r=0}^{\infty} e^{-\beta E\left(r\right)}=\frac{e^{-\beta\varepsilon/2}}{1-e^{-\beta\varepsilon}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have implicitly defined

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{hc}{2L}\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the energy of a single photon. As explained [[partition function (statistical mechanics)#Calculating the thermodynamic total energy|here]], the average energy in a mode can be expressed in terms of the partition function:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle E\right\rangle=-\frac{d\log\left(Z\right)}{d\beta}= \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{e^{\beta\varepsilon}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula, apart from the first vacuum energy term, is a special case of the general formula for particles obeying [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. Since there is no restriction on the total number of photons, the [[chemical potential]] is zero.

If we measure the energy relative to the ground state, the total energy in the box follows by summing {{math|⟨''E''⟩ − {{sfrac|''ε''|2}}}} over all allowed single photon states. This can be done exactly in the thermodynamic limit as {{math|''L''}} approaches infinity. In this limit, {{math|''ε''}} becomes continuous and we can then integrate {{math|⟨''E''⟩ − {{sfrac|''ε''|2}}}} over this parameter. To calculate the energy in the box in this way, we need to evaluate how many photon states there are in a given energy range. If we write the total number of single photon states with energies between {{math|''ε''}} and {{math|''ε'' + d''ε''}} as {{math|''g''(''ε'')d''ε''}}, where {{math|''g''(''ε'')}} is the [[density of states]] (which is evaluated below), then we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;U = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\varepsilon}{e^{\beta\varepsilon}-1}g(\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon. \qquad \mbox{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the density of states we rewrite equation (1) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{hc}{2L}n,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''}} is the norm of the vector {{math|1='''n''' = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}:

:&lt;math&gt;n=\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For every vector {{math|'''n'''}} with integer components larger than or equal to zero, there are two photon states. This means that the number of photon states in a certain region of {{math|''n''}}-space is twice the volume of that region. An energy range of {{math|d''ε''}} corresponds to shell of thickness {{math|d''n'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2''L''|''hc''}} d''ε''}} in {{math|''n''}}-space. Because the components of {{math|'''n'''}} have to be positive, this shell spans an octant of a sphere. The number of photon states {{math|''g''(''ε'')d''ε''}}, in an energy range {{math|d''ε''}}, is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon=2\frac{1}{8}4\pi n^{2}\,dn=\frac{8\pi L^{3}}{h^{3}c^{3}}\varepsilon^{2}\,d\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this in Eq. (2) gives:

:&lt;math&gt;U =L^3 \frac{8\pi}{h^3 c^3}\int_0^\infty \frac{\varepsilon^3}{e^{\beta\varepsilon}-1}\,d\varepsilon. \qquad \text{(3)}&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation one can derive the spectral energy density as a function of frequency {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} and as a function of wavelength {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{L^3} = \int_0^\infty u_\nu(T)\, d\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;u_\nu(T) = {8\pi h\nu^3\over c^3}{1\over e^{h\nu/k_\mathrm{B}T} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

And:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{L^3} = \int_0^\infty u_\lambda(T)\, d\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;u_\lambda(T) = {8\pi h c\over \lambda^5}{1\over e^{h c/\lambda k_\mathrm{B}T} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is also a spectral energy density function with units of energy per unit wavelength per unit volume. Integrals of this type for Bose and Fermi gases can be expressed in terms of [[polylogarithm]]s. In this case, however, it is possible to calculate the integral in closed form using only elementary functions. Substituting

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = k_\mathrm{B}Tx,&lt;/math&gt;

in Eq. (3), makes the integration variable dimensionless giving:

:&lt;math&gt;u(T) =\frac{8\pi (k_\mathrm{B}T)^{4}}{(hc)^{3}} J,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''J''}} is a [[Bose–Einstein integral]] given by:

:&lt;math&gt;J=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{3}}{e^x - 1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^{4}}{15}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total electromagnetic energy inside the box is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt;{U\over V} = \frac{8\pi^5(k_\mathrm{B}T)^4}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the volume of the box.

The combination {{math|{{sfrac|''hc''|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} has the value {{val|14387.770|u=μm·K}}.

This is '''not''' the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] (which provides the total energy ''radiated'' by a black body per unit surface area per unit time), but it can be written more compactly using the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''σ''}}, giving

:&lt;math&gt;{U\over V} = \frac{4 \sigma T^4}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

The constant {{math|{{sfrac|4''σ''|''c''}}}} is sometimes called the radiation constant.

Since the radiation is the same in all directions, and propagates at the speed of light ({{math|''c''}}), the spectral radiance of radiation exiting the small hole is

:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) = \frac{u_\nu(T) c}{4\pi},&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) = \frac{2 h\nu^3 }{c^2}~\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_\mathrm{B}T}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be converted to an expression for {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} in wavelength units by substituting {{math|''ν''}} by {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''λ''}}}} and evaluating

:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(T) = B_\nu(T)\left|\frac{d\nu}{d\lambda}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

Dimensional analysis shows that the unit of steradians, shown in the denominator of the right hand side of the equation above, is generated in and carried through the derivation but does not appear in any of the dimensions for any element on the left-hand-side of the equation.

This derivation is based on {{harvnb|Brehm|Mullin|1989}}.

===Outline===
[[File:BlackbodyEnergies.svg|right|thumb|Freeze-out of high-energy oscillators]]

Planck's law describes the unique and characteristic spectral distribution for electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium, when there is no net flow of matter or energy.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt; Its physics is most easily understood by considering the radiation in a cavity with rigid opaque walls. Motion of the walls can affect the radiation. If the walls are not opaque, then the thermodynamic equilibrium is not isolated. It is of interest to explain how the thermodynamic equilibrium is attained. There are two main cases: (a) when the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium is in the presence of matter, when the walls of the cavity are imperfectly reflective for every wavelength or when the walls are perfectly reflective while the cavity contains a small black body (this was the main case considered by Planck); or (b) when the approach to equilibrium is in the absence of matter, when the walls are perfectly reflective for all wavelengths and the cavity contains no matter. For matter not enclosed in such a cavity, thermal radiation can be approximately explained by appropriate use of Planck's law.

Classical physics led, via the [[Equipartition theorem]], to the [[Ultraviolet catastrophe]], a prediction that the total blackbody radiation intensity was infinite. If supplemented  by the classically unjustifiable assumption that for some reason the radiation is finite, classical thermodynamics provides an account of some aspects of the Planck distribution, such as the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], and the [[Wien displacement law]]. For the case of the presence of matter, quantum mechanics provides a good account, as found below in the section headed [[Planck's law#Physics#Einstein coefficients|Einstein coefficients]]. This was the case considered by Einstein, and is nowadays used for quantum optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the case of the absence of matter, quantum field theory is necessary, because non-relativistic quantum mechanics with fixed particle numbers does not provide a sufficient account.

===Photons===
Quantum theoretical explanation of Planck's law views the radiation as a gas of massless, uncharged, bosonic particles, namely photons, in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].  Photons are viewed as the carriers of the electromagnetic interaction between electrically charged elementary particles. Photon numbers are not conserved.  Photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with the Planck distribution.  For a photon gas in thermodynamic equilibrium, the internal energy density is entirely determined by the temperature; moreover, the pressure is entirely determined by the internal energy density. This is unlike the case of thermodynamic equilibrium for material gases, for which the internal energy is determined not only by the temperature, but also, independently, by the respective numbers of the different molecules, and independently again, by the specific characteristics of the different molecules. For different material gases at given temperature, the pressure and internal energy density can vary independently, because different molecules can carry independently different excitation energies.

Planck's law arises as a limit of the [[Bose–Einstein distribution]], the energy distribution describing non-interactive [[bosons]] in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the case of massless bosons such as [[photons]] and [[gluons]], the [[chemical potential]] is zero and the Bose-Einstein distribution reduces to the Planck distribution.  There is another fundamental equilibrium energy distribution: the [[Fermi–Dirac distribution]], which describes [[fermions]], such as electrons, in thermal equilibrium. The two distributions differ because multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state, while multiple fermions cannot. At low densities, the number of available quantum states per particle is large, and this difference becomes irrelevant. In the low density limit, the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac distribution each reduce to the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]].

===Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation===
{{Main|Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation}}

Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation is a succinct and brief account of a complicated physical situation. The following is an introductory sketch of that situation, and is very far from being a rigorous physical argument. The purpose here is only to summarize the main physical factors in the situation, and the main conclusions.

====Spectral dependence of thermal radiation====
There is a difference between conductive heat transfer and radiative heat transfer. Radiative heat transfer can be filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies.

It is generally known that the hotter a body becomes the more heat it radiates at every frequency.

In a cavity in an opaque body with rigid walls that are not perfectly reflective at any frequency, in thermodynamic equilibrium, there is only one temperature, and it must be shared in common by the radiation of every frequency.

One may imagine two such cavities, each in its own isolated radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium. One may imagine an optical device that allows radiative heat transfer between the two cavities, filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies. If the values of the spectral radiances of the radiations in the cavities differ in that frequency band, heat may be expected to pass from the hotter to the colder. One might propose to use such a filtered transfer of heat in such a band to drive a heat engine. If the two bodies are at the same temperature, the second law of thermodynamics does not allow the heat engine to work. It may be inferred that for a temperature common to the two bodies, the values of the spectral radiances in the pass-band must also be common. This must hold for every frequency band.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1957|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adkins|1983|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landsberg|1978|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This became clear to Balfour Stewart and later to Kirchhoff. Balfour Stewart found experimentally that of all surfaces, one of lamp-black emitted the greatest amount of thermal radiation for every quality of radiation, judged by various filters.

Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went a little further, and pointed out that this implied that the spectral radiance, as a function of radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that interfaced with its surrounds in just such a way as to absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded, directly to its surrounds without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the thermal radiation emitted from such a body would have that unique universal spectral radiance as a function of temperature. This insight is the root of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation.

====Relation between absorptivity and emissivity====
One may imagine a small homogeneous spherical material body labeled {{math|''X''}} at a temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, lying in a radiation field within a large cavity with walls of material labeled {{math|''Y''}} at a temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The body {{math|''X''}} emits its own thermal radiation. At a particular frequency {{math|''ν''}}, the radiation emitted from a particular cross-section through the centre of {{math|''X''}} in one sense in a direction normal to that cross-section may be denoted {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, characteristically for the material of {{math|''X''}}. At that frequency {{math|''ν''}}, the radiative power from the walls into that cross-section in the opposite sense in that direction may be denoted {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, for the wall temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For the material of {{math|''X''}}, defining the absorptivity {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} as the fraction of that incident radiation absorbed by {{math|''X''}}, that incident energy is absorbed at a rate {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'') ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}.

The rate {{math|''q''(''ν'',''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'',''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} of accumulation of energy in one sense into the cross-section of the body can then be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;q(\nu , T_X, T_Y) = \alpha _{\nu , X, Y}(T_X, T_Y)I_{\nu , Y}(T_Y) - I_{\nu , X}(T_X).&lt;/math&gt;

Kirchhoff's seminal insight, mentioned just above, was that, at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}, there exists a unique universal radiative distribution, nowadays denoted {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'')}}, that is independent of the chemical characteristics of the materials {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}}, that leads to a very valuable understanding of the radiative exchange equilibrium of any body at all, as follows.

When there is thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}, the cavity radiation from the walls has that unique universal value, so that {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'')}}. Further, one may define the emissivity {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} of the material of the body {{math|''X''}} just so that at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T''}}, one has {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') {{=}} ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') ''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') }}.

When thermal equilibrium prevails at temperature {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the rate of accumulation of energy vanishes so that {{math|''q''(''ν'',''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'',''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} 0}}. It follows that in thermodynamic equilibrium, when {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
:&lt;math&gt;0=\alpha _{\nu , X, Y}(T, T)B_{\nu}(T) - \epsilon _{\nu , X}(T) B_{\nu}(T).&lt;/math&gt;

Kirchhoff pointed out that it follows that in thermodynamic equilibrium, when {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha _{\nu , X,Y}(T,T) = \epsilon _{\nu , X}(T).&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the special notation {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} for the absorptivity of material {{math|''X''}} at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} (justified by a discovery of Einstein, as indicated below), one further has the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha _{\nu , X}(T) = \epsilon _{\nu , X}(T)&lt;/math&gt;

at thermodynamic equilibrium.

The equality of absorptivity and emissivity here demonstrated is specific for thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} and is in general not to be expected to hold when conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium do not hold. The emissivity and absorptivity are each separately properties of the molecules of the material but they depend differently upon the distributions of states of molecular excitation on the occasion, because of a phenomenon known as "stimulated emission", that was discovered by Einstein. On occasions when the material is in thermodynamic equilibrium or in a state known as local thermodynamic equilibrium, the emissivity and absorptivity become equal. Very strong incident radiation or other factors can disrupt thermodynamic equilibrium or local thermodynamic equilibrium. Local thermodynamic equilibrium in a gas means that molecular collisions far outweigh light emission and absorption in determining the distributions of states of molecular excitation.

Kirchhoff pointed out that he did not know the precise character of  {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'')}}, but he thought it important that it should be found out. Four decades after Kirchhoff's insight of the general principles of its existence and character, Planck's contribution was to determine the precise mathematical expression of that equilibrium distribution {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'')}}.

===Black body===
{{Main|Black body}}
In physics, one considers an ideal black body, here labeled {{math|''B''}}, defined as one that completely absorbs all of the electromagnetic radiation falling upon it at every frequency {{math|''ν''}} (hence the term "black"). According to Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, this entails that, for every frequency {{math|''ν''}}, at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}, one has {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') {{=}} ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''ν'',''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') {{=}} 1}}, so that the thermal radiation from a black body is always equal to the full amount specified by Planck's law. No physical body can emit thermal radiation that exceeds that of a black body, since if it were in equilibrium with a radiation field, it would be emitting more energy than was incident upon it.

Though perfectly black materials do not exist, in practice a black surface can be accurately approximated.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt; As to its material interior, a body of condensed matter, liquid, solid, or plasma, with a definite interface with its surroundings, is completely black to radiation if it is completely opaque. That means that it absorbs all of the radiation that penetrates the interface of the body with its surroundings, and enters the body. This is not too difficult to achieve in practice. On the other hand, a perfectly black interface is not found in nature. A perfectly black interface reflects no radiation, but transmits all that falls on it, from either side. The best practical way to make an effectively black interface is to simulate an 'interface' by a small hole in the wall of a large cavity in a completely opaque rigid body of material that does not reflect perfectly at any frequency, with its walls at a controlled temperature. Beyond these requirements, the component material of the walls is unrestricted. Radiation entering the hole has almost no possibility of escaping the cavity without being absorbed by multiple impacts with its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siegel|Howell|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lambert's cosine law===
{{Main|Lambert's cosine law}}

As explained by Planck,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a radiating body has an interior consisting of matter, and an interface with its contiguous neighbouring material medium, which is usually the medium from within which the radiation from the surface of the body is observed. The interface is not composed of physical matter but is a theoretical conception, a mathematical two-dimensional surface, a joint property of the two contiguous media, strictly speaking belonging to neither separately. Such an interface can neither absorb nor emit, because it is not composed of physical matter; but it is the site of reflection and transmission of radiation, because it is a surface of discontinuity of optical properties. The reflection and transmission of radiation at the interface obey the [[Helmholtz reciprocity|Stokes–Helmholtz reciprocity principle]].

At any point in the interior of a black body located inside a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} the radiation is homogeneous, isotropic and unpolarized. A black body absorbs all and reflects none of the electromagnetic radiation incident upon it. According to the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of a black body is not reflected at its surface, but is fully transmitted to its exterior. Because of the isotropy of the radiation in the body's interior, the [[spectral radiance]] of radiation transmitted from its interior to its exterior through its surface is independent of direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is expressed by saying that radiation from the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium obeys Lambert's cosine law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landsberg|1961|pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Born|Wolf|1999|pp=194–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the spectral flux {{math|''d''Φ(''dA'', ''θ'', ''d''Ω, ''dν'')}} from a given infinitesimal element of area {{math|''dA''}} of the actual emitting surface of the black body, detected from a given direction that makes an angle {{math|''θ''}} with the normal to the actual emitting surface at {{math|''dA''}}, into an element of solid angle of detection {{math|''d''Ω}} centred on the direction indicated by {{math|''θ''}}, in an element of frequency bandwidth {{math|''dν''}}, can be represented as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Born|Wolf|1999|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \Phi(dA,\theta,d\Omega,d\nu)}{d\Omega} = L^0(dA,d\nu)\,dA\,d\nu\,\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''dA'', ''dν'')}} denotes the flux, per unit area per unit frequency per unit solid angle, that area {{math|''dA''}} would show if it were measured in its normal direction {{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0}}.

The factor {{math|cos ''θ''}} is present because the area to which the spectral radiance refers directly is the projection, of the actual emitting surface area, onto a plane perpendicular to the direction indicated by {{math|''θ''}} . This is the reason for the name ''cosine law''.

Taking into account the independence of direction of the spectral radiance of radiation from the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium, one has {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''dA'', ''dν'') {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} and so

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \Phi(dA,\theta,d\Omega,d\nu)}{d\Omega} = B_\nu (T)\,dA\,d\nu\,\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus Lambert's cosine law expresses the independence of direction of the spectral radiance {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt; (''T'')}} of the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium.

===Stefan–Boltzmann law===
{{Main|Stefan–Boltzmann law}}

The total power emitted per unit area at the surface of a black body ({{math|''P''}}) may be found by integrating the black body spectral flux found from Lambert's law over all frequencies, and over the solid angles corresponding to a hemisphere ({{math|''h''}}) above the surface.

:&lt;math&gt;P=\int_0^\infty d\nu \int_h d\Omega\,B_\nu \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal solid angle can be expressed in [[spherical polar coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;d\Omega=\sin(\theta)\,d\theta\,d\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

So that:

:&lt;math&gt;P=\int_0^\infty d\nu \int_0^{\tfrac{\pi}{2}} d\theta \int_0^{2\pi}d\phi \, B_\nu(T) \cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)=\sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{2k_\mathrm{B}^4\pi^5}{15c^2h^3}\approx 5.670 400 \times 10^{-8}\, \mathrm{J\, s^{-1}m^{-2}K^{-4}}&lt;/math&gt;

is known as the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]].&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiative transfer===
{{Main|Radiative transfer}}

The equation of radiative transfer describes the way in which radiation is affected as it travels through a material medium. For the special case in which the material medium is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] in the neighborhood of a point in the medium, Planck's law is of special importance.

For simplicity, we can consider the linear steady state, without [[scattering]]. The equation of radiative transfer states that for a beam of light going through a small distance {{math|d''s''}}, energy is conserved: The change in the (spectral) [[radiance]] of that beam ({{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) is equal to the amount removed by the material medium plus the amount gained from the material medium. If the radiation field is in equilibrium with the material medium, these two contributions will be equal. The material medium will have a certain [[emission coefficient]] and [[absorption coefficient]].

The absorption coefficient {{math|''α''}} is the fractional change in the intensity of the light beam as it travels the distance {{math|d''s''}}, and has units of length&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is composed of two parts, the decrease due to absorption and the increase due to [[stimulated emission]]. Stimulated emission is emission by the material body which is caused by and is proportional to the incoming radiation. It is included in the absorption term because, like absorption, it is proportional to the intensity of the incoming radiation. Since the amount of absorption will generally vary linearly as the density {{math|''ρ''}} of the material, we may define a "mass absorption coefficient" {{math|''κ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''α''|''ρ''}}}} which is a property of the material itself. The change in intensity of a light beam due to absorption as it traverses a small distance {{math|d''s''}} will then be&lt;ref name="Chan8"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dI_\nu=-\kappa_\nu \rho I_\nu\,ds&lt;/math&gt;

The "mass emission coefficient" {{math|''j&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is equal to the radiance per unit volume of a small volume element divided by its mass (since, as for the mass absorption coefficient, the emission is proportional to the emitting mass) and has units of power⋅solid angle&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅frequency&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅density&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Like the mass absorption coefficient, it too is a property of the material itself. The change in a light beam as it traverses a small distance {{math|d''s''}} will then be&lt;ref name="Chan7"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1960|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dI_\nu=j_\nu \rho\,ds&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of radiative transfer will then be the sum of these two contributions:&lt;ref name="Chan9"&gt;{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1960|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI_\nu}{ds}=j_\nu\rho-\kappa_\nu\rho I_\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

If the radiation field is in equilibrium with the material medium, then the radiation will be homogeneous (independent of position) so that {{math|d''I&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} and:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_\nu B_\nu = j_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

which is another statement of Kirchhoff's law, relating two material properties of the medium, and which yields the radiative transfer equation at a point around which the medium is in thermodynamic equilibrium:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI_\nu}{ds}=\kappa_\nu\rho(B_\nu-I_\nu).&lt;/math&gt;

===Einstein coefficients===
{{Main|Atomic spectral line}}

The principle of [[detailed balance]] states that, at thermodynamic equilibrium, each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process.

In 1916, [[Albert Einstein]] applied this principle on an atomic level to the case of an atom radiating and absorbing radiation due to transitions between two particular energy levels,&lt;ref name="Einstein 1916"/&gt; giving a deeper insight into the equation of radiative transfer and Kirchhoff's law for this type of radiation. If level 1 is the lower energy level with energy {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and level 2 is the upper energy level with energy {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the frequency {{math|''ν''}} of the radiation radiated or absorbed will be determined by Bohr's frequency condition:&lt;ref name="Bohr 1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jammer 1989 113 115"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

If {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the number densities of the atom in states 1 and 2 respectively, then the rate of change of these densities in time will be due to three processes:

:{|cellpadding="12"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_\mathrm{spon}=A_{21} n_2&lt;/math&gt;
| Spontaneous emission
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_\mathrm{stim}=B_{21} n_2 u_\nu&lt;/math&gt;
| Stimulated emission
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_2}{dt}\right)_\mathrm{abs}=B_{12} n_1 u_\nu&lt;/math&gt;
| Photo-absorption
|}

where {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the spectral energy density of the radiation field. The three parameters {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, known as the Einstein coefficients, are associated with the photon frequency {{math|''ν''}} produced by the transition between two energy levels (states). As a result, each line in a spectra has its own set of associated coefficients. When the atoms and the radiation field are in equilibrium, the radiance will be given by Planck's law and, by the principle of detailed balance, the sum of these rates must be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;0=A_{21}n_2+B_{21}n_2 \frac{4\pi}{c}B_\nu(T)-B_{12}n_1 \frac{4\pi}{c}B_\nu(T)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the atoms are also in equilibrium, the populations of the two levels are related by the [[Boltzmann factor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_2}{n_1}=\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-h\nu/k_\mathrm{B} T}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the multiplicities of the respective energy levels. Combining the above two equations with the requirement that they be valid at any temperature yields two relationships between the Einstein coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}=\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_{21}}{B_{12}}=\frac{g_1}{g_2}&lt;/math&gt;

so that knowledge of one coefficient will yield the other two. For the case of isotropic absorption and emission, the emission coefficient ({{math|''j&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) and absorption coefficient ({{math|''κ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) defined in the radiative transfer section above, can be expressed in terms of the Einstein coefficients. The relationships between the Einstein coefficients will yield the expression of Kirchhoff's law expressed in the [[Planck's law#Radiative transfer|''Radiative transfer'']] section above, namely that

:&lt;math&gt;j_\nu=\kappa_\nu B_\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

These coefficients apply to both atoms and molecules.

==Properties==

===Peaks===
The distributions {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν̃&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} peak at a photon energy of&lt;ref name=KK-Peak&gt;{{harvnb|Kittel|Kroemer|1980|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \left[ 3 + W \left(\frac{-3}{e^3} \right) \right] k_\mathrm{B}T \approx 2.821\ k_\mathrm{B}T,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''W''}} is the [[Lambert W function]] and {{math|''e''}} is [[Euler's number]].

The distributions {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} however, peak at a different energy&lt;ref name=KK-Peak/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \left[ 5 + W \left(\frac{-5}{e^5} \right) \right] k_\mathrm{B}T \approx 4.965\ k_\mathrm{B}T,&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this is that, as mentioned above, one cannot go from (for example) {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} simply by substituting {{math|''ν''}} by {{math|''λ''}}. In addition, one must also multiply the result of the substitution by
:&lt;math&gt;\left | \frac{d\nu}{d\lambda} \right| = c/\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This {{math|{{sfrac|1|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} factor shifts the peak of the distribution to higher energies.

Dividing {{math|''hc''}} by this energy expression gives the wavelength of the peak. For this one can use {{math|{{sfrac|''hc''|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} = {{val|14387.770|u=μm·K}}.

The spectral radiance at these peaks is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;B_{\nu,\text{max}}(T) = \frac{ 2k_\mathrm{B}^3T^3(3+W(-3\exp(-3))^3}{h^2c^2} \frac{1}{e^{3+W(-3\exp(-3))} - 1}\approx \left( 1.896\times 10^{-19} \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{Hz} \cdot \text{K}^{3}} \right) \times T^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{\lambda,\text{max}}(T) =\frac{2k_\mathrm{B}^5T^5(5+W(-5\exp(-5))^5}{h^4c^3}\frac 1{e^{5+W(-5\exp(-5))} - 1}\approx \left( 4.096 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^{3} \cdot \text{K}^{5}} \right) \times ~T^5&lt;/math&gt;

===Approximations===
[[Image:RWP-comparison.svg|thumb|right|310px|Log-log plots of radiance vs. frequency for Planck's law (green), compared with the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] (red) and the [[Wien approximation]] (blue) for a black body at 8 mK [[temperature]].]]

In the limit of low frequencies (i.e. long wavelengths), Planck's law becomes the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]]&lt;ref name="Jeans 1905a"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeans|1905a|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1905"&gt;{{harvnb|Rayleigh|1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) \approx \frac{2 \nu^2 }{c^2} k_\mathrm{B} T&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\qquad B_\lambda(T) \approx \frac{2c}{\lambda^4} k_\mathrm{B} T.&lt;/math&gt;

The radiance increases as the square of the frequency, illustrating the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]. In the limit of high frequencies (i.e. small wavelengths) Planck's law tends to the [[Wien approximation]]:&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wien 1896 667"&gt;{{harvnb|Wien|1896|page=667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1906|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) \approx \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} e^{-\frac{h \nu}{k_\mathrm{B}T}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(T) \approx \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} e^{-\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B} T}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Both approximations were known to Planck before he developed his law. He was led by these two approximations to develop a law which incorporated both limits, which ultimately became Planck's law.

===Percentiles===
[[File:EffectiveTemperature 300dpi e.png|thumb|left|The Sun is an excellent approximation of a black body. Its [[effective temperature]] is ~{{val|5777|u=K}}.]]
[[Wien's displacement law]] in its stronger form states that the shape of Planck's law is independent of temperature. It is therefore possible to list the percentile points of the total radiation as well as the peaks for wavelength and frequency, in a form which gives the wavelength {{math|''λ''}} when divided by temperature {{math|''T''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowen|Blanch|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second row of the following table lists the corresponding values of {{math|''λT''}}, that is, those values of {{math|''x''}} for which the wavelength {{math|''λ''}} is {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|''T''}}}} [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] at the radiance percentile point given by the corresponding entry in the first row.

&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

That is, 0.01% of the radiation is at a wavelength below {{math|{{sfrac|910|''T''}}}}&amp;nbsp;µm, 20% below {{math|{{sfrac|2676|''T''}}}}&amp;nbsp;µm, etc. The wavelength and frequency peaks are in bold and occur at 25.0% and 64.6% respectively. The 41.8% point is the wavelength-frequency-neutral peak. These are the points at which the respective Planck-law functions {{math|{{sfrac|1|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, {{math|''ν''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|{{sfrac|''ν''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} divided by {{math|exp{{big|{{big|(}}}}{{sfrac|''hν''|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|{{big|)}}}} − 1}} attain their maxima. The much smaller gap in ratio of wavelengths between 0.1% and 0.01% (1110 is 22% more than 910) than between 99.9% and 99.99% (113374 is 120% more than 51613) reflects the exponential decay of energy at short wavelengths (left end) and polynomial decay at long.

Which peak to use depends on the application. The conventional choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by [[Wien's displacement law]] in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two halves may be more suitable. The latter is closer to the frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.

For the Sun, {{math|''T''}} is 5778&amp;nbsp;K, allowing the percentile points of the Sun's radiation, in nanometers, to be tabulated as follows when modeled as a black body radiator, to which the Sun is a fair approximation. For comparison a planet modeled as a black body radiating at a nominal 288&amp;nbsp;K (15&amp;nbsp;°C) as a representative value of the Earth's highly variable temperature has wavelengths more than twenty times that of the Sun, tabulated in the third row in micrometers (thousands of nanometers).

&lt;/center&gt;

That is, only 1% of the Sun's radiation is at wavelengths shorter than 251&amp;nbsp;nm, and only 1% at longer than 3961&amp;nbsp;nm. Expressed in micrometers this puts 98% of the Sun's radiation in the range from 0.251 to 3.961&amp;nbsp;µm. The corresponding 98% of energy radiated from a 288&amp;nbsp;K planet is from 5.03 to 79.5&amp;nbsp;µm, well above the range of solar radiation (or below if expressed in terms of frequencies {{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''λ''}}}} instead of wavelengths {{math|''λ''}}).

A consequence of this more-than-order-of-magnitude difference in wavelength between solar and planetary radiation is that filters designed to pass one and block the other are easy to construct. For example, windows fabricated of ordinary glass or transparent plastic pass at least 80% of the incoming 5778&amp;nbsp;K solar radiation, which is below 1.2&amp;nbsp;µm in wavelength, while blocking over 99% of the outgoing 288&amp;nbsp;K thermal radiation from 5&amp;nbsp;µm upwards, wavelengths at which most kinds of glass and plastic of construction-grade thickness are effectively opaque.

The Sun's radiation is that arriving at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). As can be read from the table, radiation below 400&amp;nbsp;nm, or [[ultraviolet]], is about 12%, while that above 700&amp;nbsp;nm, or [[infrared]], starts at about the 49% point and so accounts for 51% of the total. Hence only 37% of the TOA insolation is visible to the human eye. The atmosphere shifts these percentages substantially in favor of visible light as it absorbs most of the ultraviolet and significant amounts of infrared.

==History==

===Forerunners===

====Balfour Stewart====
In 1858, [[Balfour Stewart]] described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of [[lamp-black]] surfaces, at the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of [[Pierre Prevost]] and of [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]. He wrote "Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power."

Stewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the [[Helmholtz reciprocity|Helmholtz reciprocity principle]] (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.

Stewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid. According to historian D. M. Siegel: "He was not a practitioner of the more sophisticated techniques of nineteenth-century mathematical physics; he did not even make use of the functional notation in dealing with spectral distributions."&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{harvnb|Siegel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of ''vis viva''. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He concluded that his experiments showed that, in the interior of an enclosure in thermal equilibrium, the radiant heat, reflected and emitted combined, leaving any part of the surface, regardless of its substance, was the same as would have left that same portion of the surface if it had been composed of lamp-black. He did not mention the possibility of ideally perfectly reflective walls; in particular he noted that highly polished real physical metals absorb very slightly.

====Gustav Kirchhoff====
In 1859, not knowing of Stewart's work, [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff then went on to consider bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}.

Here is used a notation different from Kirchhoff's. Here, the emitting power {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'')}} denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index {{math|''i''}} at temperature {{math|''T''}}. The total absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature {{math|''T''}} . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart's, Kirchhoff's definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature {{math|''T''}} is denoted by {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} . Again, the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}}}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.

In a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860b}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Schirrmacher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}}}} has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index {{math|''i''}}. In this report there was no mention of black bodies.

In 1860, still not knowing of Stewart's measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}}}, has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index {{math|''i''}}.&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}}}} at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt;

But more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of '''"perfectly black bodies"''', which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck's black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff's proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled {{math|''i''}} as well as various perfect black bodies labeled {{math|BB}}. It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . His proof intended to show that the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}}}} was independent of the nature {{math|''i''}} of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.

His proof first argued that for wavelength {{math|''λ''}} and at temperature {{math|''T''}}, at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}} of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorption ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}}} is again just {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}}}} was equal to {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, which may now be denoted {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, a continuous function, dependent only on {{math|''λ''}} at fixed temperature {{math|''T''}}, and an increasing function of {{math|''T''}} at fixed wavelength {{math|''λ''}}, at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature {{math|''i''}} of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)

Thus '''Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation''' can be stated: ''For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature ''{{math|''T''}}'', for every wavelength ''{{math|''λ''}}'', the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by ''{{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''λ'', ''T'')}}''.'' (For our notation {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, Kirchhoff's original notation was simply {{math|''e''}}.)&lt;ref name="Chan8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1930|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. That function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} has occasionally been called 'Kirchhoff's (emission, universal) function',&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Paschen|Paschen, F.]] (1896), personal letter cited by {{harvnb|Hermann|1971}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hermann|1971}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|pages=26, 28, 31, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later.&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt; Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart's, and in some respects it was so.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; Kirchhoff's 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with "Carnot's principle", which is a form of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1862|page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Helge Kragh, "Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the "blackbody" radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empirical and theoretical ingredients for the scientific induction of Planck's law===
In 1860, Kirchhoff predicted experimental difficulties for the empirical determination of the function that described the dependence of the black-body spectrum as a function only of temperature and wavelength. And so it turned out. It took some forty years of development of improved methods of measurement of electromagnetic radiation to get a reliable result.&lt;ref name="Kangro 1976"&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, [[John Tyndall]] described radiation from electrically heated filaments and from carbon arcs as visible and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1865a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndall spectrally decomposed the radiation by use of a rock salt prism, which passed heat as well as visible rays, and measured the radiation intensity by means of a thermopile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1865b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, André-Prosper-Paul Crova published a diagram of the three-dimensional appearance of the graph of the strength of thermal radiation as a function of wavelength and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crova|1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; He determined the spectral variable by use of prisms. He analyzed the surface through what he called "isothermal" curves, sections for a single temperature, with a spectral variable on the abscissa and a power variable on the ordinate. He put smooth curves through his experimental data points. They had one peak at a spectral value characteristic for the temperature, and fell either side of it towards the horizontal axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crova|1880|p=577, Plate I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such spectral sections are widely shown even today.

In a series of papers from 1881 to 1886, Langley reported measurements of the spectrum of heat radiation, using diffraction gratings and prisms, and the most sensitive detectors that he could make. He reported that there was a peak intensity that increased with temperature, that the shape of the spectrum was not symmetrical about the peak, that there was a strong fall-off of intensity when the wavelength was shorter than an approximate cut-off value for each temperature, that the approximate cut-off wavelength decreased with increasing temperature, and that the wavelength of the peak intensity decreased with temperature, so that the intensity increased strongly with temperature for short wavelengths that were longer than the approximate cut-off for the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=15–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having read Langley, in 1888, Russian physicist V.A. Michelson published a consideration of the idea that the unknown Kirchhoff radiation function could be explained physically and stated mathematically in terms of "complete irregularity of the vibrations of ... atoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelson|1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Planck was not studying radiation closely, and believed in neither atoms nor statistical physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelson produced a formula for the spectrum for temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;I_\lambda=B_1 \theta^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp \left(-\frac{c}{\lambda^2\theta}\right)\lambda^{-6},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes specific radiative intensity at wavelength {{math|''λ''}} and temperature {{math|''θ''}}, and where {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''}} are empirical constants.

In 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the Lummer and Kurlbaum cavity radiation source was that it was an experimentally accessible source of black-body radiation, as distinct from radiation from a simply exposed incandescent solid body, which had been the nearest available experimental approximation to black-body radiation over a suitable range of temperatures. The simply exposed incandescent solid bodies, that had been used before, emitted radiation with departures from the black-body spectrum that made it impossible to find the true black-body spectrum from experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages= 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paschen|1895|pages=297–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planck's views before the empirical facts led him to find his eventual law===
Planck first turned his attention to the problem of black body radiation in 1897.&lt;ref name="Klein 1962"&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1962}}, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;
Theoretical and empirical progress enabled Lummer and Pringsheim to write in 1899 that available experimental evidence was approximately consistent with the specific intensity law {{math|''Cλ''&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|−''c''|''λT''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''c''}} denote empirically measurable constants, and where {{math|''λ''}} and {{math|''T''}} denote wavelength and temperature respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lummer|Pringsheim|1899|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; For theoretical reasons, Planck at that time accepted this formulation, which has an effective cut-off of short wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Planck 1900d"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1900d}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1900 539"&gt;{{harvnb|Rayleigh|1900|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kangro 1976 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finding the empirical law===
[[Max Planck]] produced his law on 19 October 1900&lt;ref name="Planck 1900a"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1900a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 1900b"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1900b}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an improvement upon the [[Wien approximation]], published in 1896 by [[Wilhelm Wien]], which fit the experimental data at short wavelengths (high frequencies) but deviated from it at long wavelengths (low frequencies).&lt;ref name="Wien 1896 667"/&gt; In June 1900, based on [[heuristic]] theoretical considerations, Rayleigh had suggested a formula&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1900"&gt;{{harvnb|Rayleigh|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he proposed might be checked experimentally. The suggestion was that the Stewart–Kirchhoff universal function might be of the form {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''Tλ''&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;exp(–{{sfrac|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''λT''}})}} . This was not the celebrated Rayleigh–Jeans formula {{math|8π''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''Tλ''&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which did not emerge until 1905,&lt;ref name="Jeans 1905a"/&gt; though it did reduce to the latter for long wavelengths, which are the relevant ones here. According to Klein,&lt;ref name="Klein 1962"/&gt; one may speculate that it is likely that Planck had seen this suggestion though he did not mention it in his papers of 1900 and 1901. Planck would have been aware of various other proposed formulas which had been offered.&lt;ref name="Kangro 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dougal"&gt;{{harvnb|Dougal|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 1900, Rubens told Planck that in the complementary domain (long wavelength, low frequency), and only there, Rayleigh's 1900 formula fitted the observed data well.&lt;ref name="Dougal"/&gt;

For long wavelengths, Rayleigh's 1900 heuristic formula approximately meant that energy was proportional to temperature, {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} const. ''T''}}.&lt;ref name="Klein 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dougal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1943|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that {{math|{{sfrac|''dS''|''dU&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|''T''}}}} and this leads to {{math|{{sfrac|''dS''|''dU&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|const.|''U&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} and thence to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''|''dU&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} −{{sfrac|const.|''U&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} for long wavelengths. But for short wavelengths, the Wien formula leads to {{math|{{sfrac|''T''}} {{=}} − const. ln ''U&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' + const.}} and thence to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''|''dU&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{=}} − {{sfrac|const.|''U&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} for short wavelengths. Planck perhaps patched together these two heuristic formulas, for long and for short wavelengths,&lt;ref name="Dougal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hettner|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce a formula
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 S}{dU_{\lambda}^2}=\frac{\alpha}{U_{\lambda}(\beta+U_{\lambda})}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 1900a"/&gt;

This led Planck to the formula
:&lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(T) =\frac{C\lambda^{-5}}{e^{\frac{c}{\lambda T}} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

where Planck used the symbols {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''c''}} to denote empirical fitting constants.

Planck sent this result to Rubens, who compared it with his and Kurlbaum's observational data and found that it fitted for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubens|Kurlbaum|1900a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planck added a short presentation to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula.&lt;ref name="Planck 1900a"/&gt; Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it all the way through the process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubens|Kurlbaum|1900b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra|Rechenberg|1982|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trying to find a physical explanation of the law===
{{See also|Planck–Einstein relation}}
Once Planck had discovered the empirically fitting function, he constructed a physical derivation of this law. His thinking revolved around entropy rather than being directly about temperature. Planck considered a cavity with perfectly reflective walls; the cavity contained finitely many hypothetical well separated and recognizable but identically constituted, of definite magnitude, resonant oscillatory bodies, several such oscillators at each of finitely many characteristic frequencies. The hypothetical oscillators were for Planck purely imaginary theoretical investigative probes, and he said of them that such oscillators do not need to "really exist somewhere in nature, provided their existence and their properties are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics and electrodynamics.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planck did not attribute any definite physical significance to his hypothesis of resonant oscillators, but rather proposed it as a mathematical device that enabled him to derive a single expression for the black body spectrum that matched the empirical data at all wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tentatively mentioned the possible connection of such oscillators with [[atom]]s. In a sense, the oscillators corresponded to Planck's speck of carbon; the size of the speck could be small regardless of the size of the cavity, provided the speck effectively transduced energy between radiative wavelength modes.&lt;ref name="Dougal"/&gt;

Partly following a heuristic method of calculation pioneered by Boltzmann for gas molecules, Planck considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of his hypothetical charged material oscillators. This acceptance of the probabilistic approach, following Boltzmann, for Planck was a radical change from his former position, which till then had deliberately opposed such thinking proposed by Boltzmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hermann|1971}}, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Heuristically, Boltzmann had distributed the energy in arbitrary merely mathematical quanta  {{math|''ϵ''}}, which he had proceeded to make tend to zero in magnitude, because the finite magnitude {{math|''ϵ''}} had served only to allow definite counting for the sake of mathematical calculation of probabilities, and had no physical significance. Referring to a new universal constant of nature, {{math|''h''}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1900c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planck supposed that, in the several oscillators of each of the finitely many characteristic frequencies, the total energy was distributed to each in an integer multiple of a definite physical unit of energy, {{math|''ϵ''}}, not arbitrary as in Boltzmann's method, but now for Planck, in a new departure, characteristic of the respective characteristic frequency.&lt;ref name="Planck 1900b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraghe"&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new universal constant of nature, {{math|''h''}}, is now known as [[Planck's constant]].

Planck explained further&lt;ref name="Planck 1900b"/&gt; that the respective definite unit, {{math|''ϵ''}}, of energy should be proportional to the respective characteristic oscillation frequency {{math|''ν''}} of the hypothetical oscillator, and in 1901 he expressed this with the constant of proportionality {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref name="planck"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1915|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=h\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Planck did not propose that light propagating in free space is quantized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ehrenfest|Kamerlingh Onnes|1914|page=873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ter Haar|1967|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stehle|1994|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of quantization of the free electromagnetic field was developed later, and eventually incorporated into what we now know as [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scully|Zubairy|1997|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Planck acknowledged that his imaginary resonators, having linear dynamics, did not provide a physical explanation for energy transduction between frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1906|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day physics explains the transduction between frequencies in the presence of atoms by their quantum excitability, following Einstein. Planck believed that in a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls and with no matter present, the electromagnetic field cannot exchange energy between frequency components.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914a"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pp=44–45, 113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the [[Linear#Physics|linearity]] of [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref name="Stehle 150"/&gt; Present-day quantum field theory predicts that, in the absence of matter, the electromagnetic field obeys [[Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian|nonlinear]] equations and in that sense does self-interact.&lt;ref name="Jauch Rohrlich"&gt;{{harvnb|Jauch|Rohrlich|1980}}, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karplus&gt;{{harvnb|Karplus|Neuman|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interaction in the absence of matter has not yet been directly measured because it would require very high intensities and very sensitive and low-noise detectors, which are still in the process of being constructed.&lt;ref name="Jauch Rohrlich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tommasini|Ferrando|Michinel|Seco|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Planck believed that a field with no interactions neither obeys nor violates the classical principle of equipartition of energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffreys|1973|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1906|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead remains exactly as it was when introduced, rather than evolving into a black body field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the linearity of his mechanical assumptions precluded Planck from having a mechanical explanation of the maximization of the entropy of the thermodynamic equilibrium thermal radiation field. This is why he had to resort to Boltzmann's probabilistic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boltzmann|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck's law may be regarded as fulfilling the prediction of [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] that his [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|law of thermal radiation]] was of the highest importance. In his mature presentation of his own law, Planck offered a thorough and detailed theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages =1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretical proof of which until then had been sometimes debated, partly because it was said to rely on unphysical theoretical objects, such as Kirchhoff's perfectly absorbing infinitely thin black surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cotton|1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent events===
It was not until five years after Planck made his heuristic assumption of abstract elements of energy or of action that [[Albert Einstein]] conceived of really existing [[Quantum|quanta]] of light in 1905&lt;ref name="Einstein 1905"&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a revolutionary explanation of black-body radiation, of photoluminescence, of the [[photoelectric effect]], and of the ionization of gases by ultraviolet light. In 1905, "Einstein believed that Planck's theory could not be made to agree with the idea of light quanta, a mistake he corrected in 1906."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Planck's beliefs of the time, Einstein proposed a model and formula whereby light was emitted, absorbed, and propagated in free space in energy quanta localized in points of space.&lt;ref name="Einstein 1905"/&gt; As an introduction to his reasoning, Einstein recapitulated Planck's model of hypothetical resonant material electric oscillators as sources and sinks of radiation, but then he offered a new argument, disconnected from that model, but partly based on a thermodynamic argument of Wien, in which Planck's formula {{math|''ϵ'' {{=}} ''hν''}} played no role.&lt;ref name="Stehle 132–137"&gt;{{harvnb|Stehle|1994|pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein gave the energy content of such quanta in the form {{math|{{sfrac|''Rβν''|''N''}}}}. Thus Einstein was contradicting the undulatory theory of light held by Planck. In 1910, criticizing a manuscript sent to him by Planck, knowing that Planck was a steady supporter of Einstein's theory of special relativity, Einstein wrote to Planck: "To me it seems absurd to have energy continuously distributed in space without assuming an aether."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1993|page=143}}, letter of 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Kuhn]], it was not till 1908 that Planck more or less accepted part of Einstein's arguments for physical as distinct from abstract mathematical discreteness in thermal radiation physics. Still in 1908, considering Einstein's proposal of quantal propagation, Planck opined that such a revolutionary step was perhaps unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1915|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, Planck had been consistent in thinking that discreteness of action quanta was to be found neither in his resonant oscillators nor in the propagation of thermal radiation. Kuhn wrote that, in Planck's earlier papers and in his 1906 monograph,&lt;ref name="Planck 1906"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no "mention of discontinuity, [nor] of talk of a restriction on oscillator energy,  [nor of] any formula like {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''nhν''}}." Kuhn pointed out that his study of Planck's papers of 1900 and 1901, and of his monograph of 1906,&lt;ref name="Planck 1906"/&gt; had led him to "heretical" conclusions, contrary to the widespread assumptions of others who saw Planck's writing only from the perspective of later, anachronistic, viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn's conclusions, finding a period till 1908, when Planck consistently held his 'first theory', have been accepted by other historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|pages=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of his monograph, in 1912, Planck sustained his dissent from Einstein's proposal of light quanta. He proposed in some detail that absorption of light by his virtual material resonators might be continuous, occurring at a constant rate in equilibrium, as distinct from quantal absorption. Only emission was quantal.&lt;ref name="Stehle 150"&gt;{{harvnb|Stehle|1994|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has at times been called Planck's "second theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=235–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not till 1919 that Planck in the third edition of his monograph more or less accepted his 'third theory', that both emission and absorption of light were quantal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colourful term "[[ultraviolet catastrophe]]" was given by [[Paul Ehrenfest]] in 1911 to the paradoxical result that the total energy in the cavity tends to infinity when the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical statistical mechanics is (mistakenly) applied to black body radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ehrenfest|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this had not been part of Planck's thinking, because he had not tried to apply the doctrine of equipartition: when he made his discovery in 1900, he had not noticed any sort of "catastrophe".&lt;ref name="Planck 1900d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1900 539"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kangro 1976 181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages = 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first noted by [[Lord Rayleigh]] in 1900,&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1900"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages = 144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1901&lt;ref&gt;See footnote on p. 398 in {{harvnb|Jeans|1901}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by Sir [[James Jeans]]; and later, in 1905, by Einstein when he wanted to support the idea that light propagates as discrete packets, later called 'photons', and by Rayleigh&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1905"/&gt; and by Jeans.&lt;ref name="Jeans 1905a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeans|1905b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeans|1905c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jeans|1905d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Bohr gave another formula with a further different physical meaning to the quantity {{math|''hν''}}.&lt;ref name="Einstein 1916"&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohr 1913"&gt;{{harvnb|Bohr|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jammer 1989 113 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Jammer|1989|pages=113, 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld 1923 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Sommerfeld|1923|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Heisenberg 1925 108"&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1925|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brillouin 1970 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Brillouin|1970|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Planck's and Einstein's formulas, Bohr's formula referred explicitly and categorically to energy levels of atoms. Bohr's formula was {{math|''W''{{sub|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} − ''W''{{sub|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{=}} ''hν''}} where {{math|''W''{{sub|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} and {{math|''W''{{sub|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} denote the energy levels of quantum states of an atom, with quantum numbers {{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The symbol {{math|''ν''}} denotes the frequency of a quantum of radiation that can be emitted or absorbed as the atom passes between those two quantum states. In contrast to Planck's model, the frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; has no immediate relation to frequencies that might describe those quantum states themselves.

Later, in 1924, [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] developed the theory of the statistical mechanics of photons, which allowed a [[gas in a box|theoretical derivation]] of Planck's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual word 'photon' was invented still later, by G.N. Lewis in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; who mistakenly believed that photons were conserved, contrary to Bose–Einstein statistics; nevertheless the word 'photon' was adopted to express the Einstein postulate of the packet nature of light propagation. In an electromagnetic field isolated in a vacuum in a vessel with perfectly reflective walls, such as was considered by Planck, indeed the photons would be conserved according to Einstein's 1905 model, but Lewis was referring to a field of photons considered as a system closed with respect to ponderable matter but open to exchange of electromagnetic energy with a surrounding system of ponderable matter, and he mistakenly imagined that still the photons were conserved, being stored inside atoms.

Ultimately, Planck's law of black-body radiation contributed to Einstein's concept of quanta of light carrying linear momentum,&lt;ref name="Einstein 1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Einstein 1905"/&gt; which became the fundamental basis for the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

The above-mentioned linearity of Planck's mechanical assumptions, not allowing for energetic interactions between frequency components, was superseded in 1925 by Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics. In his paper submitted on 29 July 1925, Heisenberg's theory accounted for Bohr's above-mentioned formula of 1913. It admitted non-linear oscillators as models of atomic quantum states, allowing energetic interaction between their own multiple internal discrete Fourier frequency components, on the occasions of emission or absorption of quanta of radiation. The frequency of a quantum of radiation was that of a definite coupling between internal atomic meta-stable oscillatory quantum states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Razavy|2011|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Heisenberg knew nothing of matrix algebra, but [[Max Born]] read the manuscript of Heisenberg's paper and recognized the matrix character of Heisenberg's theory. Then Born and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]] published an explicitly matrix theory of quantum mechanics, based on, but in form distinctly different from, Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics; it is the Born and Jordan matrix theory that is today called matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Born|Jordan|1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stehle|1994|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Razavy|2011|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg's explanation of the Planck oscillators, as non-linear effects apparent as Fourier modes of transient processes of emission or absorption of radiation, showed why Planck's oscillators, viewed as enduring physical objects such as might be envisaged by classical physics, did not give an adequate explanation of the phenomena.

Nowadays, as a statement of the energy of a light quantum, often one finds the formula {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}}, where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}}, and {{math|''ω'' {{=}} 2π''ν''}} denotes angular frequency,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Messiah|1958|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pauli|1973|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=38-1&lt;!--Lectures on Physics uses a nonstandard page number scheme. These comments will prevent bots from adding a dash when a hyphen is meant--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwinger 2001 203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BC 2006 2"/&gt; and less often the equivalent formula {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''hν''}}.&lt;ref name="Schwinger 2001 203"&gt;{{harvnb|Schwinger|2001|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BC 2006 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bohren|Clothiaux|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiff|1949|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement about a really existing and propagating light quantum, based on Einstein's, has a physical meaning different from that of Planck's above statement {{math|''ϵ'' {{=}} ''hν''}} about the abstract energy units to be distributed amongst his hypothetical resonant material oscillators.

[[File:Bgbo frosch ies.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|The [[common frog]] is a poikilotherm and is able to function over a wide range of body core temperatures.]]
A '''poikilotherm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|k|ə|l|ə|ˌ|θ|ɜr|m|,_|p|ɔɪ|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|ə|ˌ|θ|ɜr|m}}) is an [[animal]] whose internal temperature varies considerably.  It is the opposite of a [[homeotherm]], an animal which maintains [[thermal]] [[homeostasis]].  While the term in principle can apply to all [[organism]]s, it is generally only applied to animals, and mostly to [[vertebrate]]s. Usually the fluctuations are consequence of variation in the [[Ambient temperature|ambient environmental temperature]]. Many terrestrial [[ectotherm]]s are poikilothermic.&lt;ref name="hilde"&gt;{{cite book|page=429|isbn=0-471-29505-1|author=Milton Hildebrand; G. E. Goslow, Jr. Principal ill. Viola Hildebrand.|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|title=Analysis of vertebrate structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments to the point that they are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are [[homeotherm]]ic).  It is this distinction that often makes the term "poikilotherm" more useful than the vernacular "cold-blooded", which is sometimes used to refer to [[ectotherm]]s more generally.

Poikilothermic animals include types of vertebrate animals, specifically some fish, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as a large number of [[invertebrate]] animals.  The [[naked mole-rat]] is the only mammal that is currently thought to be poikilothermic.&lt;ref name="Daly et al., (1997)"&gt;Daly, T.J.M., Williams, L.A. and Buffenstein, R., (1997).  Catecholaminergic innervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue in the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). Journal of Anatomy, 190: 321-326. {{doi|10.1046/j.1469-7580.1997.19030321.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2010)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M. (2010). The Husbandry and Welfare of Non-traditional Laboratory Rodents. In "UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals", R. Hubrecht and J. Kirkwood (Eds).  Wiley-Blackwell.  Chapter 25, pp. 359-369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The term derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''poikilos'' ({{lang|el|ποικίλος}}), meaning "varied," ultimately from "thousand-making" and ''thermos'' ({{lang|el|θερμός}}), meaning "heat".

== Physiology ==
[[File:Homeothermy-poikilothermy.png|thumb|250 px|right|Sustained energy output of a poikilotherm (a [[lizard]]) and a [[homeotherm]] (a [[mouse]]) as a function of core body temperature. The homeotherm has a much higher output, but can only function over a very narrow range of body temperatures.]]

Poikilotherm animals must be able to function over a wider range of temperatures than homeotherms. The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order to function poikilotherms may have four to ten [[enzyme]] systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=T.|title=Coevolution of vertebrate genome, cell, and nuclear sizes|journal=Symposium on the Evolution of Terrestrial Vertebrates|pages=51–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex [[genome]]s than homeotherms in the same [[ecological niche]]. [[Frog]]s are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan Gregory|first=T.|title=Genome size and developmental complexity|journal=Genetica|date=1 January 2002|volume=115|issue=1|pages=131–146|doi=10.1023/A:1016032400147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because their metabolism is variable and generally below that of homeothermic [[animals]], sustained high-energy activities like powered [[flight]] in large animals or maintaining a large [[brain]] is generally beyond poikilotherm animals.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, P., Stone, G., &amp; Johnston, I. A. (2000): Environmental physiology of animals. ''Blackwell Science'', London. 644 pages, {{ISBN|0-632-03517-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolism of poikilotherms favors strategies such as sit-and-wait hunting over chasing prey for larger animals with high movement cost. As they do not use their [[metabolism]]s to heat or cool themselves, total energy requirement over time is low.  For the same body weight, poikilotherms need only 5 to 10% of the energy of [[homeotherm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, N. A., Reece, J. B., et al. (2002). Biology. 6th edition. Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations in poikilotherms==

*Some adaptations are behavioral. Lizards and [[snake]]s bask in the sun in the early morning and late evening, and seek shelter around noon.
*The eggs of the [[yellow-faced bumblebee]] are unable to regulate heat. A behavioral adaptation to combat this is incubation, where to maintain the internal temperatures of eggs, the queen and her workers will incubate the brood almost constantly, by warming their abdomens and touching them to the eggs. The bumblebee generates heat by shivering flight muscles even though they are not flying. 
*[[Termite]] mounds are usually oriented in a north-south direction so that they absorb as much heat as possible around dawn and dusk and minimise heat absorption around noon.
* Tuna are able to warm their entire bodies through a heat exchange mechanism called the [[rete mirabile]], which helps keep heat inside the body, and minimises the loss of heat through the [[gill]]s. They also have their swimming muscles near the center of their bodies instead of near the surface, which minimises heat loss.
*[[Gigantothermy]] means using a low ratio of surface area to volume to minimise heat loss, such as in [[sea turtle]]s.
*[[Camel]]s, although they are homeotherms, thermoregulate using a method termed "temperature cycling" to conserve energy. In hot deserts, they allow their body temperature to rise during the day and fall during the night, adjusting their body temperature to cycle over approximately 6°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal Physiology|last=Hill|first=Richard|publisher=Sinauer Associates|year=2016|isbn=978-1605354712|location=Sunderland, MA|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
It is comparatively easy for a poikilotherm to accumulate enough energy to reproduce.  Poikilotherms at the same [[trophic level]] often have much shorter generations than homeotherms: weeks rather than years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Such applies even to animals with similar ecological roles such as [[cat]]s and [[snake]]s.

This difference in energy requirement also means that a given food source can support a greater density of poikilothermic animals than homeothermic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, J.B, Steen, H. &amp; Stenseth, N.C. (1991): Population Dynamics of Poikilotherm and Homeotherm Vertebrates: Effects of Food Shortage. OICOS Vol. 60, No 2 (March, 1991), pp 269-272. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3544877 summary]&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the predator-prey ratio which is usually higher in poikilothermic fauna compared to homeothermic ones. However, when homeotherms and poikilotherms have similar niches, and compete, the homeotherm can often drive poikilothermic competitors to extinction, because homeotherms can gather food for a greater fraction of each day.

==In medicine==
In medicine, loss of normal thermoregulation in humans is referred to as "poikilothermia".  This is usually seen with sedative and hypnotic drugs or in '[[compartment syndrome]]'.  For example, [[barbiturate]]s, [[ethanol]], and [[chloral hydrate]] may precipitate this effect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  [[REM sleep]] is also considered a poikilothermic state in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sleep Medicine Essentials|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=12|author=Leon Rosenthal|authorlink=Physiologic Processes During Sleep|editor=Teofilo Lee-Chiong|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''polar capsule''' is constructed of a [[protein]]aceous and a [[polysaccharide]] layer, both layers of which continue into the polar filament.

The mouth of the capsule is covered with a cap-like structure. This structure may function as a [[stopper (plug)|stopper]], its digestion in the alimentary tract possibly triggering the discharge of the polar filaments.

Two ideas have been proposed to explain the eversion of the polar filaments. Firstly, that the hydrostatic pressure in the polar capsule pushes the filament out, rather like the [[cnidocyst]] of [[jellyfish]]. The second is that extrusion is an active process involving contractile proteins and is [[calcium]]-dependent (Uspenskaya, 1982).

A '''polemic''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|ɪ|k}}) is contentious [[rhetoric]] that is intended to support a specific position by aggressive claims and undermining of the opposing position.  Polemics are mostly seen in arguments about controversial topics. The practice of such argumentation is called ''polemics''. A person who often writes polemics, or who speaks polemically, is called a ''polemicist''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, Springfield, MA, 2005), s.v. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/polemic "polemic"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word is derived {{ety|gre|''πολεμικός'' (polemikos)|warlike, hostile}},&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American College Dictionary (Random House, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; {{ety||''πόλεμος'' (polemos)|war}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flemos πόλεμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemics often concern issues in [[religion]] or [[politics]]. A polemic style of writing was common in [[Ancient Greece]], as in the writings of the historian [[Polybius]]. Polemic again became common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times. Since then, famous polemicists have included the satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], the socialist philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], the [[novelist]] [[George Orwell]], the psycholinguist [[Noam Chomsky]], the social critic [[Christopher Hitchens]], the existential philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], author of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality|On the Genealogy of Morality: A Polemic]]''.

==Overview==
Polemics are usually addressed to important issues in [[religion]] and [[politics]]. Polemic journalism was common in [[continental Europe]] at a time when [[libel]] laws were not as stringent as they are now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |title=polemic, or polemical literature, or polemics (rhetoric) |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411123116/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support the study of the controversies of the 17th–19th centuries, a British research project has placed online thousands of polemical pamphlets from that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/rarebooks/named/hayflemingcollection/ | title=Pamphlet and polemic: Pamphlets as a guide to the controversies of the 17th-19th centuries |publisher= St Andrews University Library| accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussions around [[atheism]], [[humanism]] and Christianity have remained capable of polemic into the 21st century; for example, in 2007 Brian McClinton argued in ''[[Humani (organisation)|Humani]]'' that anti-religious books such as [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' are part of the polemic tradition.&lt;ref name=McClinton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClinton|first1=Brian|title=A Defence of Polemics|journal=Humani|date=July 2007|issue=105|pages=12–13|url=http://humanistni.org/filestore/image/polemics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] published a book titled ''Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A. C.|title=Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness|date=2008|publisher=Oberon Books|isbn=978-1-840-02728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Ancient Greece]], writing was characterised by what Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin called "strident adversariality" and "rationalistic aggressiveness", summed up by McClinton as polemic.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Sivin |first2=Nathan |title=The Way and the Word: Science and Medicine in Early China and Greece |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient historian [[Polybius]] practised "quite bitter self-righteous polemic" against some twenty philosophers, orators, and historians.&lt;ref name=Walbank&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walbank |first1=F. W. |title=Polemic in Polybius |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |date=1962 |volume=52 |issue=Parts 1 and 2 |pages=1–12 |jstor=297872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemical writings were common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times.&lt;ref name=Suerbaum&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suerbaum |first1=Almut |last2=Southcombe |first2=George |title=Polemic: Language as Violence in Medieval and Early Modern Discourse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFWrCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39 |year=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-07929-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, polemic had a religious dimension, as in [[Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Jewish texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from converting to other religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chazan, Robert |title=Fashioning Jewish identity in medieval western Christendom |page=7 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Medieval Christian writings]] were also often polemical; for example in their disagreements on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tolan, John Victor |title=Medieval Christian perceptions of Islam |page=420 |publisher=Routledge |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]], famously nailed to the door of the church in [[Wittenburg]], was a powerful polemic launched against the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; [[Robert Carliell]]'s 1619 defence of the new [[Church of England]] and diatribe against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] – ''Britaine's glorie, or An allegoricall dreame with the exposition thereof: containing The Heathens infidelitie in religion...'' – took the form of a 250-line poem.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, "Carleill, Robert (fl. 1619)", rev. Reavley Gair (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4680. Retrieved 27 May 2017. Pay-walled.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major political polemicists of the 18th century include [[Jonathan Swift]], with pamphlets such as his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', and [[Edmund Burke]], with his attack on the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]].&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulin|first1=Tom|title=The Art of Criticism: 12 Polemic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-art-of-criticism-12-polemic-1612930.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 November 2016|date=26 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s 1848 ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' was extremely polemical.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; Friedrich Engels's famous work [[Anti-Dühring]] was also a polemic against [[Eugen Dühring]].

In the 20th century, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' was a polemic against [[totalitarianism]], in particular of [[Stalinism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].  According to McClinton, other prominent polemicists of the same century include such diverse figures as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Michael Moore]].&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;

'''Pseudocopulation''' describes behaviors similar to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] that serve a reproductive function for one or both participants but do not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. It is most generally applied to a [[pollinator]] attempting to copulate with a [[flower]]. Some flowers [[mimicry|mimic]] a potential female mate visually, but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile.&lt;ref name=Orchid&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |first1=Leendert |last1=van der Pijl |first2=Calaway H. |last2=Dodson |title=Orchid Flowers: Their Pollination and Evolution |chapter=Chapter 11: Mimicry and Deception |publisher=[[University of Miami]] Press |location=Coral Gables |year=1966 |pages=129–141 |isbn=0-87024-069-2 |oclc=310489511 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[mimicry in plants]] is called '''Pouyannian mimicry'''.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 |title=A Classificatory Review of Mimicry Systems |year=1982 |last1=Pasteur |first1=G |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=13 |pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orchid]]s commonly achieve reproduction in this manner, secreting chemicals from glands (osmophores) in the [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, or [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], that are indistinguishable from the insect's natural [[pheromone]]s. The pollinator then has a [[pollinium]] attached to its body, which it transfers to the stigma of another flower when it attempts another 'copulation'. Pollinators are often [[bee]]s,  and [[wasp]]s of the order [[Hymenoptera]], and [[fly|flies]].

The cost to the pollinating insects might be seen as negligible, but study of ''[[Cryptostylis]]'' (an Australian orchid) pollinators shows that they may waste large amounts of [[sperm]] by ejaculating onto the flower. Thus there could be antagonistic [[coevolution]] such that pollinators become better at identifying their own species correctly and orchids become better mimics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/587532 |title=Orchid Sexual Deceit Provokes Ejaculation |year=2008 |last1=Gaskett |first1=A.

The notion of rape culture was developed by [[second-wave feminist]]s, primarily in the United States, beginning in the 1970s. Critics of the concept dispute the existence or extent of rape culture, arguing that the concept is too narrow or that, although there are cultures where rape is pervasive, the idea of a rape culture can imply that the rapist is not at fault but rather the society that enables rape.

==Origins and usage==
The term "rape culture" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by [[second-wave feminist]]s, and was applied to contemporary American culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2004 174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-32687-5|edition=1st|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in [[consciousness-raising]] efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor [[Psychology's Feminist Voices|Alexandra Rutherford]], most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/35/2/342.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was one extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was defined as a crime of violence rather than a crime of sex as it had been before and the focus of rape shifted from desire for sexual pleasure to one of male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;Brownmiller, Susan.

The first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in ''[[Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women]]'', edited by [[Noreen Connell]] and Cassandra Wilson&lt;!-- careful before wikilinking - currently leads to a singer --&gt; for the [[New York Radical Feminists]].&lt;ref name="FeministsConnell1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Radical Feminists|author2=Noreen Connell|author3=Cassandra Wilson|title=Rape: the first sourcebook for women|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ej1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rape+Culture%22|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=31 October 1974|publisher=New American Library|isbn=9780452250864|page=105|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, the group stated that "our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/NovDec_74/review_NovDec74.html |title=Book Review: Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women (New York Radical Feminists) |author=Freada Klein |website=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |date=November–December 1974 |publisher=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, along with [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s 1975 ''[[Against Our Will|Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape]]'', was among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape.

In a 1992 ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'' paper entitled "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as "rape-supportive culture" in Brownmiller's ''Against Our Will.''&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", ''Journal of Social Issues'', vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J. Maschke, "The legal response to violence against women",  Routledge 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-2519-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to be used more widely in multiple forms of media.

==Overview==
Feminists and gender activists conceptualize rape culture as a cultural environment that encourages gender violence, as well as perpetuating "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex" to blaming the victim for inviting rape.

[[Michael Parenti]] believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] suffered by rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;vq=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists{{who|date=October 2018}} posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with [[misogyny]] and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.

One explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain "bad" or "misbehaved" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an "otherness" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lonsway | first1 = Kimberly A. | last2 = Fitzgerald | first2 = Louise F. | year = 1994 | title = Rape Myths: In Review | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 133–64 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Dianne F.|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Jo|title=Women: a feminist perspective|date=1989|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co.|location=Mountain View, Calif.|isbn=9780874848014|edition=4th|chapter=The Rape Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common rape myth is that no event is random. This promotes the idea that the women who are raped were not raped for no reason, but that they deserved it. If women believe that they were the cause of the rape, they may not go to authorities.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Society also uses the stereotype of men being aggressive as an excuse for their actions. This justifies and normalizes rape. Society creates these myths, scaring women before they are even raped. Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the [[Just-world hypothesis|"just-world" hypothesis]] which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to his or her actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserve it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;

Brownmiller, in ''Against Our Will'', discusses three ideas that helped bring awareness to some clearly-defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just "evil" or "mentally ill" men as thought in previous decades. Finally, rape can occur in many different forms besides the stereotype of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;

The idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always "young, careless [and] beautiful" or they are "loose" women who "invite rape" by provoking men."&lt;ref name=Gordon1991&gt;Gordon, Margaret T., and Stephanie Riger.

Rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. In the 1960s, rapists were often seen as mentally ill or deviants in society, and this view persisted among some people into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt; 

As related to Brownmiller's final point about different forms of rape, a common non-believed "rape myth" was the idea of spousal rape or partner rape. Rape myths had suppressed the incidence of such events now known as "intimate partner rape"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |title=Intimate Partner Rape Resources |publisher=Band Back Together |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122010024/http://bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |archivedate=22 January 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[marital rape]]"; at one time, the view was that women could never claim to be raped by a spouse. Rape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined "[[acquaintance rape]]", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warshaw|first1=Robin|title=I Never Called It Rape|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gGJHAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780060551261|date=1988-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris O'Sullivan teaches that acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted.  O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at "frat life" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow "brothers", as they engage in contests over sex with women.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, ''Transforming a Rape Culture,'' edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, {{ISBN|0-915943-06-9}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as part of a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, "Fraternities and the Rape Culture", in ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, {{ISBN|0-915943-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectification of women".&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change. Reasoning about rape and rape culture is also influenced by gender and heterosexuality norms, and therefore is also changing through time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=anderson|first1=irina|last2=doherty|first2=kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herman"&gt;Herman, Dianne F.

Since the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of universities' and colleges' ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as "rape" and who is treated as a "genuine victim" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight. Their emotional responses are observed and reported during investigations to aid in deciding if the victim is lying or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, college administration officials have sometimes questioned accounts of victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventive legislation as the [[Clery Act]], which requires colleges to report on crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Feds-launch-investigation-into-Swarthmores-handling-of-sex-assaults.html|title=Feds launch investigation into Swarthmore's handling of sex assaults|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_d684d872-1e7e-11e3-978b-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Annual campus crime report may not tell true story of student crime|work=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture is closely related to [[slut-shaming]] and [[victim blaming]], in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt;&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape culture is real |url=http://cupwire.ca/articles/47672 |author=Ketterling, Jean |newspaper=The Xaverian Weekly |publisher=Canadian University Press |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman |first1=Ronet  |last2= |first2= |year=1988 |title=The factors related to rape reporting behavior and arrest: new evidence from the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=8 |doi= |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/25/1/8.abstract |accessdate=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim "deserved it" because she was defined as a slut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111120222031/http://wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|dead-url = yes|archivedate = 20 November 2011|title = RAPE MYTHS|date = May 2001|accessdate = |website = www.wcsap.org|publisher = |last = Anderson|first = Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did "want to have sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality: Interdisciplinary Readings|last=Moore|first=Newlyn B.|last2=Davidson, Sr.|first2=J.

Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; 

[[Prison rape]] is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of [[Just Detention International]], states "Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay."&lt;ref name=Clark2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/141594/why_does_popular_culture_treat_prison_rape_as_a_joke|title=Why Does Popular Culture Treat Prison Rape As a Joke?|author=Anna Clark|date=16 August 2009|website=Alternet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexualization ===
[[Sexualization]] and [[sexual objectification]] are practices that contribute to the normalization of hyper-sexualized perceptions of women, which is a theme in rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Eliana|last2=Gadalla|first2=Tahany M.|date=11 January 2010|title=Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2010–2035|doi=10.1177/0886260509354503|pmid=20065313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hald|first=Gert Martin|last2=Malamuth|first2=Neil M.|last3=Yuen|first3=Carlin|date=1 January 2010|title=Pornography and attitudes supporting violence against women: revisiting the relationship in nonexperimental studies|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=36|issue=1|pages=14–20|doi=10.1002/ab.20328|pmid=19862768|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyper-sexualized or [[Pornography|pornographic]] media is often attributed with perpetuating aggressive behaviors and attitudes supporting violence against women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Media depictions of violent sexual activity are also noted to increase behavioral aggression.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Mike|last2=D'alessio|first2=Dave|last3=Brezgel|first3=Keri|date=1 December 1995|title=A Meta-Analysis Summarizing the Effects of Pornography II Aggression After Exposure|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=258–283|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1995.tb00368.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexualizing imagery surfaces and reinforces misogynistic beliefs in some instances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This media can come in forms of movies, music, advertising, video games and more.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asking For It: The Alarming Rise of Rape Culture-and What We Can Do About It|last=Harding|first=Kate|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of pornography has shown to possibly encourage aggressive action as well.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Paul J.|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Robert S.|last3=Kraus|first3=Ashley|date=1 February 2016|title=A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=66|issue=1|pages=183–205|doi=10.1111/jcom.12201|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive associations between aggressive perceptions of women and consumption of pornography, especially violent pornography, have been found on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individuals who more frequently consume pornography are more likely to engage in sexually aggressive acts or harbor sexually aggressive attitudes than others who consume less pornography or do not consume pornography at all.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Victim blaming and slut shaming===
''[[Victim blaming]]'' is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=978-0915943067}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim her or his own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cole | first1 = Jennifer | last2 =Logan | first2 = T.K. | title = Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs |journal=Research in Nursing and Health | date = February 2008 | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–85 |doi=10.1002/nur.20234| pmid = 18163392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fehler-Cabral|first1=Giannina | last2 =Campbell | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Patterson | first3= Debra | title = Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]| date = December 2011 |volume=26|issue=18 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511403761 |pmid=21602203 | pages=3618–3639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming may also occur among a victim's peers, and college students have reported being ostracized if they report a rape against them, particularly if the alleged perpetrator is a popular figure or noted athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Reddington |first1 =Frances P.

''[[Slut shaming]]'' is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behavior. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A study of college women from sociologists at the University of Michigan and the University of California found that slut-shaming had more to do with a woman's social class than it did with their activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Taylor |first1 = Marisa | url= http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/29/slut-shaming-study.html | title= Slut-shaming has little to do with sex, study finds | website = america.aljazeera.com | publisher = [[Al Jazeera America]] | date=29 May 2014 | accessdate= 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slut shaming can create a double standard between men and women and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/journals/SPQ/Jun14SPQFeature.pdf|title=Good Girls: Gender, Social Class, and Slut Discourse on Campus|last=Armstrong|first=Elizabeth|date=2014|website=American Sociological Association|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SlutWalk]] movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wavaw.ca/slutwalk-vancouver-a-march-to-end-rape-culture/ | title=SlutWalk Vancouver: A march to end rape culture | website = wavaw.ca | publisher = Women Against Violence Against Women | date = 29 May 2013| accessdate= 23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

Others also link rape culture to environmental insecurities, where men objectify women as part of their struggle to control their immediate environment. It is also linked to gender segregation, and the belief that rape proves masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryle|first=Robyn|title=Questioning Gender: A Sociological Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK8086_VaGQC&amp;pg=482#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2011|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=978-1-4129-6594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manifestations of rape culture include [[denial]] of widespread rape,&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172024/americas-rape-problem-we-refuse-admit-there-one |title=America's Rape Problem: We Refuse to Admit That There Is One |last= Valenti |first= Jessica  |date=4 January 2013  |publisher= [[The Nation]] |accessdate=4 February 2013}}

One concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials. The result is that men who have committed sexual assault crimes may receive little to no punishment, which serves to strengthen the rape culture in the American judicial system and American society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hildebrand|first1=Meagen|last2=Najdowski|first2=Cynthia|title=The Potential Impact of Rape Culture on Juror Decision Making: Implications For Wrongful Acquittals in Sexual Assault Trials|journal=Albany Law Review|date=2015|volume=78|issue=3|pages=1059–1086}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the law as written not being put into effect in practice, legal definitions of rape have been criticized for placing a high burden of proof on victims to demonstrate non-consent.&lt;ref name= "Larcombe 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larcombe |first1=W |last2=Fileborn |first2=B |last3=Powell |first3=A |last4=Hanley |first4=N |last5=Henry |first5=N |title='I think it's rape and I think he would be found not guilty' focus group perceptions of (un) reasonable belief in consent in rape law |journal=Social and Legal Studies |date=2016 |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=611–629 |doi=10.1177/0964663916647442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals likely use legal definitions and jury convictions in their conceptualization of “real rape.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=KR |last2=Jewell |first2=JA |last3=Golding |first3=JM |last4=Kembel |first4=HB |title=Associations Between Sexual Behavior Norm Beliefs in Relationships and Intimate Partner Rape Judgments |journal=Violence Against Women |date=5 May 2016 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=426–51 |doi=10.1177/1077801216642871 |pmid=27153859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws, which are passed by (mostly male) lawmakers, tend to represent dominant groups' interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muehlenhard |first1=CL |last2=Peterson |first2=CD |last3=Humphreys |first3=TP |last4=Jozkowski |first4=KN |title=Evaluating the One-in-Five Statistic: Women's Risk of Sexual Assault While in College |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=4 April 2017 |volume=54 |issue=4–5 |pages=549-576 |doi=10.1080/00224499.2017.1295014 |pmid=28375675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larcombe et al.&lt;ref name= "Larcombe 2016" /&gt; posit "a legal definition of rape as non-consensual penetration achieved through unlawful force, coercion, fraud or exploitation – that is, containing a fault element that describes the tactic the perpetrator used to effect the assault – may conform more closely to social and social science definitions of rape."

=== Effects on women ===
According to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnett|first1=Ann|last2=Mattern|first2=Jody L.|last3=Herakova|first3=Liliana L.|last4=Kahl|first4=David H.|last5=Tobola|first5=Cloy|last6=Bornsen|first6=Susan E.|title=Communicating/Muting Date Rape: A Co-Cultural Theoretical Analysis of Communication Factors Related to Rape Culture on a College Campus|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=November 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=465–485|doi=10.1080/00909880903233150}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a number of rape myths that are held are "no means yes", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore "asking to be raped" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the "perpetrator" and want to create a type of backlash.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a "slutty woman" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

One effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Along with this were people believing women who had "allegedly been raped" were "asking for it" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physical injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, Dean G., Heidi S. Resnick, Benjamin E. Saunders, and Connie L. Best. "Chapter 10 Rape, Other Violence Against Women, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder." ''Adversity, Stress, and Psychotherapy''. Ed. Bruce P. Dohrenwend. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

After a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a "slut" or "easy" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Susan T. | last2 = Kuriloff | first2 = Peter J. | last3 = Lottes | first3 = Ilsa | year = 1994 | title = Understanding attributions of blame in stranger rape and date rape situations: An examination of gender, race, identification, and students social perceptions of rape victims | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 19| pages = 1719–1734 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01571.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt; Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others and make them feel isolated.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

Another effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self-reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had "used or damaged goods." Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal "pure and virginal" stereotype that men want.&lt;ref name=Bell1994/&gt; Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

If women do choose to discuss their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape.&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt; Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was "not a big deal" or "must not have happened."&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality.

Although there is a wide range of research on the consequences of sexual violence on victims, there is little information on the economic effect, especially for economically vulnerable victims such as Black and Latina women.&lt;ref name=Loya2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loya|first1=Rebecca M.|title=The Role of Sexual Violence in Creating and Maintaining Economic Insecurity Among Asset-Poor Women of Color|journal=Violence Against Women|date=2014|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1299–1320|doi=10.1177/1077801214552912|pmid=25288596}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consequences of sexual violence disproportionately harm these specific demographics, because they make up a large portion of the group afflicted by income-poverty and asset poverty. Simply being from one of these poverty backgrounds increases the risk of sexual violence and discourages victims from reporting a rape crime as there is less confidence in the police services and there is a higher crime rate in areas of poverty.&lt;ref name=Loya2014/&gt;

=== Effects on men ===
{{main|Toxic masculinity}}

"[[Toxic masculinity]]"—a concept posited by some feminist scholars—is a number of negative traits and expectations burdening men in society.

Most male rape victims would not come forward to the police or in a survey, out of feelings of shame. The male gender stereotype suggests that men should be tough enough to avoid rape, if raped by a man, or sexually driven enough to enjoy it, if raped by a woman. Men were less likely to report rape because they felt reporting it would undermine their masculinity. This was related to characteristics of submissiveness and weakness attributed to rape victims, opposite of gender stereotypes pertaining to men which focus on dominance and aggressiveness.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pino | first1 = Nathan W. | last2 = Meier | first2 = Robert F. | year = 1999 | title = Gender Differences in Rape Reporting | doi = 10.1023/A:1018837524712 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 40 | issue = 11/12| pages = 979–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Mccartney | first2 = Samantha | year = 2003 | title = Effects of Gender and Sexuality on Judgements of Victim Blame and Rape Myth Acceptance in a Depicted Male Rape | url = | journal = Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 391–98 | doi=10.1002/casp.741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like female victims, male victims also fear the stigmatization associated with rape. When they do report, they are often met with disbelief, dismissiveness, or blame from police and other services.&lt;ref name=Struckman-Johnson1992&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Struckman-Johnson|first1=Cindy|last2=Struckman-Johnson|first2=David|title=Acceptance of male rape myths among college men and women|journal=Sex Roles|date=August 1992|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=85–100|doi=10.1007/BF00290011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this, men are less likely than women to reveal the nature of the assault having been sexual or fail to mention any genital contact. They are also more likely to deny and hide how the attack affected them emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1980 | title = Male Rape Victims: Noninstitutionalized Assault | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 137 | issue = 2| pages = 221–23 | doi=10.1176/ajp.137.2.221 | pmid=7352580 | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = A | last2 = Divasto | first2 = P | last3 = Jackson | first3 = R | last4 = Voorhees | first4 = D | last5 = Christy | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male rape victims, in comparison to female victims, are more likely to blame themselves for the incident because they are thought to be more capable of fighting back or getting away from their attacker. 

Homosexual men, similar to heterosexual women, were made to feel like they had "asked for it" based on their behavior.&lt;ref name=Struckman-Johnson1992/&gt;

Men are more likely to believe myths about rape, dismiss the situation, or become assailants themselves because of the emphasis of what it means to be masculine in society.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999/&gt; Dianne Herman found that date rape was most likely to occur when a man had requested or initiated the date, the man paid for the date, the man drove, when drinking took place and when the couple found themselves alone. Because of the effort put into the date, men often felt entitled to some payment in the form of sexual gratification. When this did not happen, men felt it was more acceptable to rape. Herman claims that the American dating system emphasizes men as possessors of females, who can be seen as sexual objects ready to be "paid for."&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;

Marilyn Frye has stated that to dismantle rape culture would require the undoing of more than just the normalization and tolerance of sexual assault and rape - it would require addressing gender stereotypes in a patriarchal society and relieving both genders from their pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frye | first1 = Marilyn | year = 1996 | title = The Necessity of Differences: Constructing a Positive Category of Women | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 991–1010 | doi=10.1086/495128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, men are expected to be dominant: strong, violent, sexual, and controlling. Women are expected to be submissive: weak, passive, decorative, and controllable. Men are socialized to believe they need to prove their masculinity by taking this control and dominating women. This is not only enforced by expectations of men to be dominant but also society's discouragement of men showing any emotions, vulnerability, or sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999/&gt; This expectation is often traced back to cultural values of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 – Redefining Gender Violence – Transcripts from Converge!

While research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} there are a number of other countries that have been described as "rape supportive" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world.

===  In Pakistan ===
Violence against women is typical and the norm, especially marital abuse, as it is seen as a private matter not believed to be "appropriate for intervention or policy changes". Due to cultural beliefs, [[spousal abuse]] and especially rape is rarely considered a crime. This is due to Pakistan's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and dominant and women to be fragile and weak. Religious norms familiar to Pakistan also embrace violence and discrimination toward women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live without men. Normalization of violence and rape against women continues to be reflected in high rates of rape in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Ali2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gavino|first2=MI|date=April 2008|title=Violence against women in Pakistan: a framework for analysis|url=http://jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/1372.pdf|journal=JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association|volume=58|issue=4|pages=198–203|pmid=18655430|last1=Ali|first1=PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of rape that are prevalent are political rapes and honor ([[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hermeneutics and honor: negotiating female "public" space in Islamic/ate societies|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|isbn=9780932885210|location=Cambridge, Mass.|last1=Afsaruddin|first1=Asma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

Rape is rarely reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt; Women do not speak out about rape because they want to uphold their family's honor. Similar to the honor rapes where value is taken from someone's wife, rapes can dishonor entire families. Women whose rapes are found out fear being ostracized or abandoned and disowned by their families. Victims of rape that are discovered might lose their families, their husbands and their homes. They think of themselves as bayghairate, a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened and do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by their society. Women are highly discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

One ambiguity that perpetuates the negative stereotype and reaction toward women rape victims is the blurred understanding between rape and [[adultery]]. When a married woman is raped by another man, if she reports it, the women herself has the high possibility of being charged with the crime of adultery and sent to jail.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt; Because women are thought to be submissive and obedient to their husbands, the Pakistani culture emphasizes the need and expectation for a wife to be faithful to her husband in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt; Fear of being charged and punished for their own rape makes women keep quiet about their assaults. Women who do decide to report also face the possibility that they were raped by a government official or other law enforcement officer, thus diminishing the chance of the punishment for the perpetrator and increasing the chance of punishment for the victim.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

=== In India ===
{{main|Rape in India}}
India has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as "damaged goods" who then suffer further afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Vrushali|last2=Purkayastha|first2=Bandana|title=The transnational assemblage of Indian rape culture|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=41|issue=11|date=19 May 2017|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1322707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dhillon|first1=Amrit|title=Men blame women in western clothes: India's rape culture is thriving|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/lets-forget-what-we-said-five-years-ago-india-still-lives-with-a-rape-culture-20171207-h00ygg.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Smita|title=India's rape crisis is worsening, and there still isn't a national registry for sex offenders|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2017/03/10/india-rape-crisis-sex-offender-registry-561757.html|work=Newsweek|date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Everyone Blames Me": Barriers to Justice and Support Services for Sexual Assault Survivors in India|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors|work=Human Rights Watch|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Kavita|title=Rape Culture and Sexism in Globalising India - Sur - International Journal on Human Rights|journal=Sur - International Journal on Human Rights|date=3 December 2015|volume=12|issue=22|pages=255–259|url=http://sur.conectas.org/en/rape-culture-and-sexism-in-globalising-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural areas which operate outside the legal system the punishment for rape and murder can be something as trivial as 100 sit ups or push ups. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/2145393/india-where-punishment-rape-and-murder-includes-100-sit-ups&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape has also been used as a form of punishment in India as well extrajudicially. A famous example is the [[Kunan Poshpora incident]] where the soldiers of the [[Indian Army]] gang raped between 100-150 women as a form of punishment for their village being allegedly complicit in separatist activity, the Indian state did not charge anyone as of yet for this crime and has instead discredited those who have leaked this citing it as "baseless", showing a form of victim blaming on a state level. &lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/all-these-years-later-do-not-forget-the-kunan-poshpora-mass-rapes/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/467fca501a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is also done to intimidate communities, for example, the [[Kathua rape case]] where an 8-year-old girl named Asifa Bano who belonged to the nomadic [[Bakarwal]] community was abducted, drugged, tortured and then gang-raped inside a [[Hindu]] temple before being murdered and having her body disposed of in a forest. This act was done by local villagers with the help and participation of police officers. Following the discovery of the dead body there was then a classic example of victim-blaming when members of a local religious group, the Hindu Ekta Manch, led a protest in support of the accused which was attended by two local politicians in the [[BJP]]; India's current ruling party. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/kathua-rape-case-jammu-bar-association-calls-for-protest-on-thursday-118041100455_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/mar/03/kathua-rape-and-murder-case-amid-protests-in-support-of-accused-jammu-and-kashmir-government-says-1781586.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Certain states in India such as [[Haryana]], which borders the capital city [[New Delhi]] have a rape culture ingrained into the society where the victim is blamed if she is above 14 years of age and is then seen as having tarnished the family reputation. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thequint.com/videos/documentaries/rape-is-consensual-inside-haryanas-rape-culture&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the victim is seen as the main reason behind the rape or is seen as equally at fault as the perpetrator. Rape is essentially seen as consensual according to [[Panchayati raj]]. 

According to NCRB 2015 statistics, [[Madhya Pradesh]] has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = NCRB data shows 95% rape victims in India known to offenders; Madhya Pradesh tops the list | url= http://www.firstpost.com/india/ncrb-data-shows-95-rape-victims-in-india-known-to-offenders-3433136.html| location = Chennai, India | work = [[FirstPost]] | date = 9 May 2017 | accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jodhpur]] has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = NCRB Report: These 6 Indian cities have the highest rate of crimes against women| url= http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ncrb-report-2015-six-indian-cities-most-unsafe-for-women-3005926/ | location = Chennai, India | work = [[The Indian Express]] | date = 1 September 2016 | accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women and girls in the [[BIMARU]] region of North India are more vulnerable to be raped than in states like [[Kerala]] which has the highest HDI, literacy with a  more progressive and tolerant society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malhotra|first1=Aditi|title=A ‘Rape Map’ of India|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/03/a-rape-map-of-india/|work=WSJ|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In South Africa ===
In a study conducted by [[Rachel Jewkes]], Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the [[Eastern Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jewkes | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Sikweyiya | first2 = Yandisa | last3 = Morrell | first3 = Robert | last4 = Dunkle | first4 = Kristin | year = 2011 | title = Gender Inequitable Masculinity and Sexual Entitlement in Rape Perpetration South Africa: Findings of a Cross-Sectional Study | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0029590 | pmid = 22216324 | pmc = 3247272 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e29590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for "fun" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and "what boys do". Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub-areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewkes|first1=Rachel|last2=Sikweyiya|first2=Yandisa|last3=Morrell|first3=Robert|last4=Dunkle|first4=Kristin|title=Why, when and how men rape: Understanding rape perpetration in South Africa|journal=South African Crime Quarterly|date=8 March 2016|issue=34|doi=10.17159/2413-3108/2010/v0i34a874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to "cleanse themselves of diseases".&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leclerc-Madlala | first1 = Suzanne | year = 2002 | title = On the Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | url = | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 87–95 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Researchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Rape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Activist Pumla Dineo Gqola says that events like the rape trial of then Vice President and now President of South Africa, [[Jacob Zuma]] are not surprising and are a reflection of ideas of masculinity and femininity in contemporary South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Pumla Dineo Gqola.African Identities.

The high rate of rape in South Africa, combined with the inability of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system to contain the crisis, have been compared to a 'gender civil war'.{{by whom|date=June 2017}} The majority of women in South Africa are raped by people they know.

====University====

[[File:Herbert Baker clocktower, Rhodes University, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Rhodes University.The picture was taken at an anti-rape march during 2004.]]
On 17 April 2016, a list of the names of 11 men and titled 'Reference List' was posted anonymously on [[Facebook]]. The post gave no descriptions or made any allegations. However, within a matter of time students, were able to connect what these students had in common which were rape allegations. The students demanded a suspension and investigation of the individuals on the list. The police were called to intervene in order to neutralize the protests at [[Rhodes University]]. This put rape in universities in the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Seddon. The Daily Maverick.‘We will not be Silenced’: Rape Culture, #RUReferencelist, and the University Currently Known as Rhodes.

====National protest====
On 6 August 2016, four women staged a silent protest at the [[Electoral Commission of South Africa|IEC]] results announcement ceremony. The protesters said that they could not be silent given the rape and gender-based violence in South Africa. Even though President [[Jacob Zuma]] was acquitted of the charges, the young protesters says that an acquittal does not mean the president is innocent due to the failure of the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-06-four-women-the-president-and-the-protest-that-shoock-the-election-results-ceremony|title=Four women, the president and the protest that shook the election results ceremony|first=Ra'eesa|last=Pather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural values====
Cultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. [[Ukuthwala]], also known as "wife abduction", is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with the intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to the marriage. There are examples of this happening in Hindu societies of India as well. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or [[sexual cleansing]], is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically from illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such [[HIV/AIDS]]. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002/&gt;

===Societies without a rape culture===

There are societies in which rape is not culturally acceptable, in which there is no rape culture and in which rape is almost non-existent, such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Andrew Lawrence (2007). [https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/1308/3291941.PDF?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Dissertation: Evaluating Theories of Sexual Violence Using Rape Offenses in the National Crime Victimization Survey and the National Incident Based Reporting System].

The culture is also [[matrilineal]], so inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to lack rape culture without social equity of genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peletz|first1=Michael G.|title=The King Is Dead; Long Live the Queen!|journal=American Ethnologist|date=2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=39–41|doi=10.2307/3805147|jstor=3805147|doi-broken-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Some writers, academics and groups have disputed the existence or prevalence of rape culture or described the concept as harmful. Others believe that rape culture exists, but disagree with certain interpretations or analyses of it.

The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identified problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape|title=RAINN Urges White House Task Force to Overhaul Colleges' Treatment of Rape|date=6 March 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, RAINN cites a study by David Lisak, which estimated that 3% of college men were responsible for 90% of campus rapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Task Force to  Protect Students from Sexual Assault United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women|url=https://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|website=rainn.org|accessdate=2 February 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators.  RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|title=WH Task Force Recommendations|date=28 February 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Camille Paglia]]&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Emma (2013). "[http://www.macleans.ca/authors/emma-teitel/camille-paglia-on-rob-ford-rihanna-and-rape-culture/ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture]", Macleans, 16 November 2013; URL accessed 16 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; has described concerns about rape culture as "ridiculous" and "[[neuroticism|neurotic]]", an artifact of [[bourgeois]] [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied with education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women she says. Paglia argues that said individuals are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply [[evil]] people in the world, who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault.

Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' titled "It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria" suggested that "Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, C. (2014). [http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria]. Time Magazine, 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Heather MacDonald suggested that "In a delicious historical irony, the baby boomers who dismantled the university's intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H. (2008).  [http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html The Campus Rape Myth].  City Journal, Winter 2008, 18 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men".&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=493|editor=George Ritzer |editor2=J. Michael Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Researching the "Rape Culture" of America |accessdate=4 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D5GgDDEZ?url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers and others&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"&gt;Gilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan–Feb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7)&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men,&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"/&gt; even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;Robin Warshaw, ''[[I Never Called It Rape]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988 ([http://www.union.edu/offices/dean/sart/campus/ cited here])&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, {{ISBN|0-89608-628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=hooks |first=bell |chapter=Seduced By Violence No More |title=Transforming a Rape Culture | editor1-last  =Buchwald | editor1-first =Emilie | editor2-last  =Fletcher | editor2-first =Pamela | editor3-last  =Roth | editor3-first =Martha |publisher=Milkweed Editions |year=1993 |isbn=978-0915943067 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that "rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture" as "remarkably [[Misandry|misandric]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Kay|year=2014|title='Rape culture' fanatics don't know what a culture is|website=National Post|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140309204907/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|dead-url=yes|archivedate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that [[orientalists]] had appropriated the term to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|website= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf|title=Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|website= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SlutWalk ===
[[File:Toronto-Slutwalk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The first SlutWalk in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], 3 April 2011]]
[[SlutWalk]] is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by [[Toronto]] police officer Michael Sanguinetti on 24 January 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While addressing the issue of [[campus rape]] at a [[York University]] safety forum, Sanguinetti said that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized".&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SlutWalk movement are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2011/09/23/slutwalk-joburg-takes-to-the-streets |title=Slutwalk Joburg takes to the streets |newspaper=Times LIVE |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007174743/http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |archivedate=7 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual assault. Ringrose and Renold said that "the stigma relates to the way women dress and behave, but in fact male sexual aggression is the problem".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringrose|first=Jessica|last2=Renold|first2=Emma|date=1 May 2012|title=Slut-shaming, girl power and 'sexualisation': thinking through the politics of the international SlutWalks with teen girls|journal=Gender and Education|volume=24|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1080/09540253.2011.645023|issn=0954-0253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SlutWalk that took place in London promoted several different kinds of attire including lingerie, nipple, tassels, and T-shirts with slogans to demonstrate what women wear is not a form of consent for sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generocity.org/march-to-end-rape-culture-broadens-message-with-name-change/ |title=March to end rape culture |publisher=generocity |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original SlutWalk took place in the city of [[Toronto, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto" /&gt; [[Amber Rose]] is also a figure in the United States where she holds her annual Amber Rose SlutWalk in Los Angeles, California while also raising awareness for empowerment and the Amber Rose Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amberroseslutwalk.com|title=Amber Rose SlutWalk|last=|first=|date=|website=Amber Rose SlutWalk|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slutwalk in Latin America|SlutWalks]]&amp;nbsp;have taken place in some conservative Catholic countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. According to&amp;nbsp;"Sex and the Barrio"&amp;nbsp;writers Edgerton and Sotirova, SlutWalk protests began in South America taking on the name&amp;nbsp;"[[Marcha de las Putas]]".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio|title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America {{!}} World Policy Institute|website=www.worldpolicy.org|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are protesting the idea that women dressed in revealing clothing are asking to get raped. They held the walk in the South American capitol of Buenos Aires on 28 September 1990, a day that was named the Day for the Decriminalization of Abortion in Latin America.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; Due to the overwhelming Catholic influence, some SlutWalks have taken on an anti-Catholic tone in response to sermons, such as the one in [[Costa Rica]], where a leading clergyman preached that "Women should dress modestly to avoid being 'objectified'", adding that the purpose of sex is "fertilization".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; The march even reached the Cathedral of San Jose just as mass was concluding.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt;

[[File:Pinus; leaf (3 needle type) Resin Canal.jpg|thumb|Pinus; leaf (3 needle type) Resin Canal]]
'''Resin canals''' or '''resin ducts''' are elongated, tube-shaped intercellular spaces surrounded by [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] which secrete [[resin]] into the canal. These canals are orientated longitudinally and radially in between fusiform rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~xylem/WPS202/softwood/swslides/rescan.pdf|title=Resin Canal (also called Resin Duct)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually found in late wood: denser wood grown later in the season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~xylem/WPS202/softwood/resin.htm|title=SOFTWOOD ANATOMY...RESIN CANALS|last=Wheeler|first=Elisabeth|date=|website=www4.ncsu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resin]] is antiseptic and aromatic and prevents the development of fungi and deters insects.

== Types ==
* Normal resin canals exist naturally in the wood of the genera [[Spruce|''Picea'']], [[Larch|''Larix'']], [[Pine|''Pinus'']], [[Douglas-fir|''Pseudotsuga'']] and ''[[Shorea]]''.
* Traumatic resin canals may be formed in wounded trees that don't have normal resin canals. Wounding occurs from either fire, freezing or mechanical damage. These canals are irregularly shaped compared to normal resin canals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Resin canal characteristics (such as number, size and density) in pine species can determine its resistance to pests. In one study, biologists were able to categorize 84% of [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]], and 92% of [[Pinus flexilis|limber pines]], as being either susceptible or resistant to [[bark beetle]]s based only on their resin canals and growth rate over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrenberg, S., Kane, J.M. &amp; Mitton, J.B. Oecologia (2014) 174: 1283. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2841-2&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, scientists found [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] trees that survived drought and bark beetle attacks had resin ducts that were &gt;10% larger in diameter, &gt;25% denser (resin canals per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and composed &gt;50% more area of per ring.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, J.M. &amp; Kolb, T.E. Oecologia (2010) 164: 601. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1683-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's [[sneeze]] is "[[bless you]]", or, less commonly in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], "Gesundheit", the [[German language|German]] word for health (and the response to sneezing in German-speaking countries).  There are several proposed [[Bless you#Origins and legends|bless-you origins]] for use in the context of sneezing.

In non-English-speaking cultures, words referencing good [[health]] or a long [[life]] are often used instead of "bless you," though some also use references to God.

In some Asian cultures such as Korean and Japanese cultures, the practice of responding to another person's sneeze does not exist.

A '''routing diagram''' or '''route diagram''' in the field of [[management engineering]] is a type of [[diagram]], that shows a route through an accessible physical space.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bøgh Andersen, "Pervasive computing and space." ''Organizational Semiotics.'' Springer US, 2002. 133-152. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Routing diagrams are used in [[plant layout study]], and manufacturing plant design.  

== Overview ==
A routing diagrams shows a route through a physical space. They are often considered a type of flow diagram, but they differ from flowcharts, that a routing is pictured in a physical layout. There is a similarity with design of [[Electrical equipment]], where routing diagrams also in show "the physical layout of the facility and equipment and how the circuit how the circuit to the various equipment is run." &lt;ref&gt;Paul Gill (1997), ''Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture with a routing in geographical space is often called a route map. While the [[road map]] and [[transit map]] (such as the railway map, metro map, bus map, etc.) show all the roads or lines, the route map regularly shows one rad for a particular occasion. Likewise a ground plan or site map show all the space, buildings and/or rooms, the routing map shows one specific route on site.    

Routing diagrams are used in [[plant layout study]]. The routing diagram can consist of a [[floor plan]] with a trace attached, or a 3d [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross section]] of a building with a trace. The routing diagram transforms into a [[flow diagram]] when the physical dimensions are taken out of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Albert Herrmann (1950, ''Office Methods, Systems, and Procedures.'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1521">In [[biology]] a '''section''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: Sectio) is a [[taxonomic rank]] that is applied differently between ''[[botany]]'' and ''[[zoology]]''.

==In botany==
Within flora (plants), 'section' refers to a ''botanical'' rank below the genus, but above the species:
* [[domain (biology)|Domain]] &gt; [[kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] &gt; [[division (botany)|Division]] &gt; [[class (biology)|Class]] &gt; [[order (biology)|Order]] &gt; [[family (biology)|Family]] &gt; [[tribe (biology)|Tribe]] &gt; [[Genus]] &gt; sub-genus &gt; '''[[Section (botany)]]''' &gt; [[Species]]

==In zoology==
Within fauna (animals), 'section' refers to a ''zoological'' rank below the order, but above the family:

* [[domain (biology)|Domain]] &gt; [[kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] &gt; [[Phylum]] &gt; [[class (biology)|Class]] &gt; [[order (biology)|Order]] &gt; '''Section''' &gt; [[family (biology)|Family]] &gt; [[tribe (biology)|Tribe]] &gt; [[Genus]] &gt; [[Species]]

==In bacteriology==
The [[International Code of Nomenclature for Bacteria]] states that the Section rank is an informal one, between the subgenus and species (as in botany).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8808/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria: Bacteriological Code, 1990 Revision |chapter = Chapter 3, Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations, Rule 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">The '''skew binary number system''' is a [[Non-standard positional numeral systems|non-standard positional numeral system]] in which the ''n''th digit contributes a value of &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1} - 1&lt;/math&gt; times the digit (digits are indexed from 0) instead of &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; times as they do in [[binary number|binary]].  Each digit has a value of 0, 1, or 2. Notice that a number can have many skew binary representations. For example, a decimal number 15 can be written as 1000, 201 and 122. Each number can be written uniquely in skew binary canonical form where there is only '''at most''' one instance of the digit 2, which must be the first non-zero '''[[Least significant bit|least significant digit]]'''. In this case 15 is written canonically as 1000.

==Examples==
Skew binary representations of the numbers from 0 to 15 are shown in following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
! Decimal !! Skew binary !! binary
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1
|-
| 2 || 2 || 10
|-
| 3 || 10 || 11
|-
| 4 || 11 || 100
|-
| 5 || 12 || 101
|-
| 6 || 20 || 110
|-
| 7 || 100 || 111
|-
| 8 || 101 || 1000
|-
| 9 || 102 || 1001
|-
| 10 || 110 || 1010
|-
| 11 || 111 || 1011
|-
| 12 || 112 || 1100
|-
| 13 || 120 || 1101
|-
| 14 || 200 || 1110
|-
| 15 || 1000 || 1111
|}

==Arithmetical operations==
The advantage of skew binary is that each increment operation can be done with at most one [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry]] operation. This exploits the fact that &lt;math&gt;2 (2^{n+1} - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+2} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Incrementing a skew binary number is done by setting the only two to a zero and incrementing the next digit from zero to one or one to two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2004/IntroFuncProg/lecture08.html skew binary numbers]&lt;/ref&gt; 
When numbers are represented using a form of [[run-length encoding]] as linked lists of the non-zero digits, a form called the [[sparse representation of a number|sparse representations of numbers]] by Okasaki,&lt;ref name="Okasaki" /&gt; incrementation and decrementation can be performed in constant time.

Other arithmetic operations are performed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elmasry|first1=Amr|last2=Jensen|first2=Claus|last3=Katajainen|first3=Jyrki|title=Two Skew-Binary Numeral Systems and One Application|journal=Theory of Computing Systems|date=2012|volume=50|pages=185–211|doi=10.1007/s00224-011-9357-0|url=http://www.cphstl.dk/Paper/TOCS-2011/journal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by switching between the skew binary representation and the binary representation.

===From skew binary representation to binary representation===
Given a skew binary number, its value can be computed by a loop, computing the successive values of &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1}-1&lt;/math&gt; and adding it once or twice for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th digit is 1 or 2 respectively. A more efficient method is now given, with only bit representation and one substraction.

The skew binary number of the form &lt;math&gt;b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; without 2 and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s is equal to the binary number &lt;math&gt;0b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d^{c}&lt;/math&gt; represents the digit &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times. The skew binary number of the form &lt;math&gt;0^{c_0}21^{c_1}0b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s is equal to the binary number &lt;math&gt;0^{c_0+c_1+2}1b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

===From binary representation to skew binary representation===
Similarly to the preceding section, the binary number &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s equals the skew binary number &lt;math&gt;b_1\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since addition is not defined, adding &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to incrementing the number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times. However, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the logarithm of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and incrementation takes constant time. Hence transforming a binary number into a skew binary number runs in time linear in the length of the number.

==Applications==
Skew binary numbers find applications in [[skew binomial heap]]s, a variant of [[binomial heap]]s that support worst-case O(1) insertion, and in [[skew binary random access lists]], a [[purely functional data structure]].  They also find use in [[Brodal queue|bootstrapped skew binomial heaps]], which have excellent asymptotic guarantees.&lt;ref name="Okasaki"&gt;Okasaki, Chris. ''Purely Functional Data Structures.''&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[smoothsort]] is implemented using [[perfect binary tree]]s (rather than the more common Leonardo trees), the heap is divided into trees which correspond to the digits of the skew binary representation of the heap size.

'''Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity''', or '''SMOS''', is a [[satellite]] which forms part of [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Living Planet Programme]]. It is intended to provide new insights into Earth's [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. In addition, it is intended to provide improved weather forecasting and monitoring of snow and ice accumulation.&lt;ref name = "ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAMBA2VMOC_LPsmos_0.html ESA's water mission SMOS] European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"&gt;SMOS Project Team, [http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506200325/http://ursi-f-2005.jrc.it/fullpapers/URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1.pdf |date=2006-05-06 }} European Space Agency&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"&gt;SMOS Special Issue of ESA Bulletin [http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESA_Publications/SEMU9CWX3RF_0.html ESA Bulletin] Special Issue  137, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"&gt;''SMOS: The Challenging Sea Surface Salinity Measurement from Space'', J.

==History==
The project was proposed in November 1998; in 2004 the project passed ESA-phase "C/D" and,&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"&gt;[http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/indexsmos.html The Living Planet Program Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (MIRAS on RAMSES)] Mission SMOS at Centre d'Etudes Spatailes de la BIOsphere (CESBIO)&lt;/ref&gt; after several delays, it was launched on 2 November 2009 from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] on a [[Rockot]] rocket.&lt;ref name=bbc &gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=European water mission lifts off | date=2 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8331962.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first data from the [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis|MIRAS]] ([[Microwave]] Imaging [[Radiometer]] using [[Aperture]] Synthesis) instrument was received on 20 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMDGULX82G_index_0.html|title=First SMOS data received|date=20 November 2009|publisher=ESA|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMOS programme cost is about €315 million ($465 million; £280 million). It is led by ESA but with significant input from French and Spanish interests.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The satellite is part of ESA's Earth Explorer programme – eight spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing [[environmental science|environment]]al concern. The first is already in orbit – a mission called [[GOCE]], which is mapping variations in the pull of [[gravity]] across the Earth's surface. SMOS is the second Explorer to launch; and a third spacecraft, known as [[CryoSat-2]] (the first [[CryoSat]] failed on launch), was launched on 8 April 2010. CryoSat will assess the state of the world's ice cover.

==Launcher==
The satellite was launched on 2 November 2009 (04:50 (01:50 GMT)) to a nearly circular orbit of 763&amp;nbsp;km aboard a [[Rokot]], a modified [[Russians|Russian]] [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] (ICBM) [[SS-19]] launched from a decommissioned SS-19 launcher from Northern Russia's  [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]].&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Amos | title=Smos satellite unfurls instrument | date=3 November 2009 | publisher=BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8341400.stm | accessdate = 2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMOS satellite was launched together with the [[Proba-2]], a technology demonstration satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html Successful launch qualification test for PROBA2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302233049/http://www.esa.int/esaTQM/1220880349148_index_0.html |date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97# ESA's SMOS Mission to be launched in July 2009 from Plesetsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061131/http://www.eurockot.com/alist.asp?cnt=20040811&amp;main=3&amp;subm=97 |date=2009-01-26 }} The Rockot Missions.

==Science==
The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4% (at 35–50&amp;nbsp;km [[spatial resolution]]).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt; This aspect is managed by the HYDROS project.  Project Aquarius will attempt to monitor sea surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 [[Practical salinity unit|psu]] (10- to 30-day average and a spatial resolution of 200&amp;nbsp;km x 200&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name = "CESBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A.

Soil moisture is an important aspect of climate, and therefore [[forecasting]]. Plants transpire water from depths lower than 1 meter in many places and satellites like SMOS can only provide moisture content down to a few centimeters, but using repeated measurements in a day, the satellite can extrapolate soil moisture.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ESA Bulletin"/&gt;  The SMOS team of ESA hope to work with farmers around the world, including the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to use as ground-based calibration for models determining soil moisture, as it may help to better understand [[crop yield]]s over wide regions.&lt;ref name = "SD_080424152254"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080424152254.htm How Dry We Are: European Space Agency To Test Earth's Soil Moisture Via Satellite]-Science News, Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean [[salinity]] is crucial to the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate through the global [[water cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The water cycle and Global Warming|url=http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=18912&amp;articleId=35166|publisher=WHOI|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity in combination with temperature determine ocean circulation by defining its density and hence [[thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High-latitude salinity effects and interhemispheric thermohaline circulations|url=http://wind.mit.edu/~jscott/AMOC/bryan_86.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ocean salinity is one of the variables that regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and release and therefore has an effect on the oceanic [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Cycle - NASA Science|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/ocean-earth-system/ocean-carbon-cycle/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Information from SMOS is expected to help improve short and medium-term weather forecasts, and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management.  In addition, climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The SMOS satellite carries a new type of instrument called [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS). Some eight metres across, it has the look of helicopter rotor blades; the instrument creates images of radiation emitted in the [[microwave]] [[L-band]] (1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz). MIRAS will measure changes in the wetness of the land and in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="IEEE Proceedings 2010-05-Font-Camps-Borges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"/&gt;

===Operations and ground segment===
The [[CNES]] Satellite Operations [[ground segment|Ground Segment]] will operate the spacecraft with telecommunications from ESA's [[S-band]] facility located in [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The Data Processing Ground Segment ([[Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology|CDTI]], [[Villafranca]], [[Spain]]) will process SMOS data through the [[X-band]]. Higher level processing of information will be done by scientists globally.&lt;ref name = "URSI-F-2005-Art_6.1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">'''Span''' is the distance between two intermediate supports for a structure, e.g. a [[beam (structure)|beam]] or a [[bridge]].
A span can be closed by a solid beam or by a rope. The first kind is used for bridges, the second one for [[electric power loan transmission|power line]]s, overhead telecommunication lines, some type of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] or for [[aerial tramway]]s.

[[Image:Bending.svg|frame|right|Side view of a [[Simply supported#Beams|simply supported]] beam (top) bending under an evenly distributed load (bottom).]]
The span is a significant factor in finding the strength and size of a beam as it determines the maximum [[bending moment]] and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]. The maximum bending moment &lt;math&gt;M_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and deflection &lt;math&gt;\delta_{max}&lt;/math&gt;in the pictured beam is found using:&lt;ref name='gere'&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanics of Materials |edition=Eighth| isbn = 978-1-111-57773-5|last1=Gere|first1= James M.|last2=Goodno|first2=Barry J.|page=1086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{max} = \frac {q L^2} {8}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{max} = \frac {5 M_{max} L^2} {48 E I} = \frac {5 q L^4} {384 E I}&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; = Uniformly distributed load
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = Length of the beam between two supports (span)
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[Modulus of elasticity]]
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = [[Area moment of inertia]]

Note that the maximum bending moment and deflection occur midway between the two supports. From this it follows that if the span is doubled, the maximum moment (and with it the [[tensile stress|stress]]) will quadruple, and deflection will increase by a factor of sixteen.

For long-distance rope spans, used as power line, antenna or for aerial tramways, see [[list of spans]].

The '''Sznajd model''' or '''United we stand, divided we fall''' ('''USDF''') model is an [[econophysics]] model suggested in 2000&lt;ref name=RefOriginal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|last2=Sznjad|first2=Jozef|title=Opinion evolution in closed community|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics C|volume=11|issue=06|pages=1157–1165|doi=10.1142/S0129183100000936|arxiv=cond-mat/0101130|bibcode=2000IJMPC..11.1157S}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to gain fundamental understanding about opinion dynamics using methods from [[statistical physics]]. The Sznajd model implements a phenomenon called [[social validation]] and thus extends the [[Ising spin model]]. In simple words, the model states:
* '''Social validation''': If two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will start to agree with them.
* '''Discord destroys''': If a block of adjacent persons disagree, their neighbors start to argue with them.
{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Models}}

== Mathematical formulation ==
For simplicity, one assumes that each individual&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has
an opinion S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; which might be [[Boolean network|Boolean]] (&lt;math&gt;S_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; for ''no'', &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for ''yes'')  in its simplest formulation, which means that each individual either agrees or disagrees to a given question.

In the original 1D-formulation, each individual has exactly two neighbors just like beads on a [[bracelet]]. At each time step a pair of individual &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random to change their nearest neighbors' opinion (or: [[Ising spin]]s) &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}&lt;/math&gt; according to two dynamical rules:
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. This models '''social validation''', if two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will change their opinion.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively: If the given pair of people disagrees, both adopt the opinion of their other neighbor.

=== Findings for the original formulations ===
In a closed (1 dimensional) community, two [[steady state]]s are always reached, namely complete consensus (which is called ''[[ferromagnetic]] state'' in physics) or [[stalemate]] (the ''[[antiferromagnetic]] state'').
Furthermore, [[Monte Carlo simulations]] showed that these simple rules lead to complicated dynamics, in particular to a [[power law]] in the decision time distribution with an exponent of -1.5.&lt;ref name=RefApplications&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|title=Sznajd model and its applications|journal=Acta Physica Polonica B|date=2005|volume=36|issue=8|arxiv=physics/0503239|bibcode=2005AcPPB..36.2537S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications ===
The final (antiferromagnetic) state of alternating all-on and all-off is unrealistic to represent the behavior of a community. It would mean that the complete population uniformly changes their opinion from one time step to the next. For this reason an alternative  dynamical rule was proposed. One possibility is that two spins &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; change their nearest neighbors according to the two following rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Sanchez|first1=Juan R.|title=A modified one-dimensional Sznajd model|arxiv=cond-mat/0408518}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Social validation''' remains unchanged: If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;

== Relevance ==
In recent years, [[statistical physics]] has been accepted as modeling framework for phenomena outside the traditional physics. Fields as [[econophysics]] or [[sociophysics]] formed, and many [[quantitative analyst]]s in [[finance]] are physicists. The [[Ising model]] in statistical physics has been a very important step in the history of studying [[Critical phenomena|collective (critical) phenomena]]. The Sznajd model is a simple but yet important variation of prototypical Ising system.&lt;ref name=RefSocialPhysics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castellano|first1=Claudio|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|last3=Loreto|first3=Vittorio|title=Statistical physics of social dynamics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=0710.3256|volume=81|issue=2|pages=591–646|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.591|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..591C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron has been recognized by the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft#Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] (German Physical Society) for an outstanding original contribution using physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|url=http://www.dpg-physik.de/dpg/gliederung/fv/soe/YSA/preistraeger_YSA.html|publisher=Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft|accessdate=15 October 2014|location=Bad Honnef, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Sznajd model belongs to the class of '''binary-state dynamics on a networks''' also referred to as [[Boolean network]]s. This class of systems includes the [[Ising model]], the [[voter model]] and the [[q-voter model]], the [[Bass diffusion model]], [[threshold model]]s and others.&lt;ref name=RefBinaryStateDynamics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleeson|first1=James P.|title=Binary-State Dynamics on Complex Networks: Pair Approximation and Beyond|journal=Physical Review X|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.3.021004|arxiv=1209.2983|bibcode=2013PhRvX...3b1004G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sznajd model can be applied to various fields:
* The [[finance]] interpretation considers the spin-state &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; as a bullish trader placing orders, whereas a &lt;math&gt;S_i=0&lt;/math&gt; would correspond to a trader who is bearish and places sell orders.

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J. McFadden, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' '''9''' (2002), part 4, pp. 23&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">The '''Trauzl lead block test''', also called the '''Trauzl test''' or just '''Trauzl''', is a test used to measure the [[explosive strength|strength]] of [[explosive material]]s. It was developed by [[Isidor Trauzl]] in 1885.

The test is performed by loading a 10-gram foil-wrapped sample of the explosive into a hole drilled into a [[lead]] block with specific dimensions and properties (a soft lead cylinder, 200 mm diameter and 200 mm high, with the hole 125 mm deep and 25 mm diameter)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=PmuqCHDC3pwC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=trauzl+block+dimensions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ocMzdi_u-n&amp;sig=2qjffubawLeXzx2mF2eWvVK_dkQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=trauzl%20block%20dimensions&amp;f=false|title=History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact: A Chronological and Biographical Reference|last=Krehl|first=Peter O. K.|date=2008-09-24|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540304210|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The hole is then topped up with sand, and the sample is detonated electrically. After detonation, the volume increase of the cavity is measured. The result, given in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is called the '''Trauzl number''' of the explosive.

The Trauzl test is not useful for some modern higher-powered explosives as their power often cracks or otherwise ruptures the lead block, leaving no hole to measure.&lt;ref name="Lead-Block Test for Explosives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepper|first=Bessie|author2=F. Everett Reed |author3=William E. Gordon |title=Lead-Block Test for Explosives|journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry|date=September 1955|volume=47|issue=9|pages=1794–1800|doi=10.1021/ie50549a028|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie50549a028|accessdate=8 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the test uses an [[aluminium]] block to avoid exposure of participants to [[Lead poisoning|lead-related]] [[Dangerous goods|hazards]].

'''Uhuru''' was the first [[satellite]] launched specifically for the purpose of [[X-ray astronomy]].  It was also known as the '''X-ray Explorer Satellite''', '''SAS-A''' (for "Small Astronomy Satellite" A, being first of the three-spacecraft SAS series), '''SAS 1''', or '''Explorer 42'''. The [[space observatory|observatory]] was launched on December 12, 1970 into an initial orbit of about 560&amp;nbsp;km [[apogee]], 520&amp;nbsp;km [[perigee]], 3 degrees inclination, with a period of 96 minutes. The mission ended in March 1973. Uhuru was a scanning mission, with a spin period of ~12 minutes. It performed the first comprehensive survey of the entire sky for [[X-ray]] sources, with a sensitivity of about 0.001 times the intensity of the Crab nebula.

==Objectives==
The main objectives of the mission were:&lt;ref name=heasarc_about_uhuru&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/uhuru/uhuru_about.html  HEASARC "The Uhuru Satellite"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To survey the sky for cosmic X-ray sources in the 2–20 keV range to a limiting sensitivity of 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; joule/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sec), 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; the flux from the Crab Nebula
* To determine discrete source locations with a precision of a few square minutes of arc for strong sources and a few tenths of a square degree at the sensitivity limit
* To study the structure of extended sources or complex regions with a resolution of about 30 arc minutes
* To determine gross spectral features and variability of X-ray sources
* To perform, wherever possible, coordinated and/or simultaneous observations of X-ray objects with other observers.

==Instrumentation==
The payload consisted of two sets of [[proportional counter]]s, each with ~0.084 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; effective area. 
The counters were sensitive with more than 10% efficiency to X-ray [[photon]]s in the ~2–20 [[keV]] range. 
The lower energy limit was determined by the attenuation of the beryllium windows of the counter plus a thin thermal shroud that was needed to maintain temperature stability of the spacecraft.
The upper energy limit was determined by the transmission properties of the counter filling gas. 
Pulse-shape discrimination and [[Nuclear electronics|anticoincidence]] techniques were used to filter out emissions of particles and undesirable high-energy photons in the background. 
Pulse-height analysis in eight energy channels was used to obtain information on the energy [[Spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the incident photons. 
The two sets of counters were placed back to back and were collimated to 0.52° × 0.52° and 5.2° × 5.2° (full width at half maximum) respectively. 
While the 0.52° detector gave finer angular resolution, the 5.2° detector had higher sensitivity for isolated sources.&lt;ref name=heasarc_about_uhuru/&gt;

==Results==
Uhuru achieved several outstanding scientific advances, including the discovery and detailed study of the pulsing accretion-powered [[X-ray binary|binary X-Ray source]]s such as [[Cen X-3]], [[Vela X-1]], and [[Her X-1]], the identification of [[Cygnus X-1]], the first strong candidate for an astrophysical [[black hole]], and many important extragalactic sources.
The Uhuru Catalog, issued in four successive versions, the last being the 4U catalog, was the first comprehensive X-ray catalog, contains 339 objects and covers the whole sky in the 2—6 keV band.&lt;ref name=4U_catalog&gt;Forman et al. (1978), ApJS, 38, 357.  [http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/uhuru/archive/uhuru_archive.html  HEASARC archive for Uhuru]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final version of the source catalog is known as the 4U Catalog;&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/uhuru/uhuru4.html 4U catalog browse version.]&lt;/ref&gt; earlier versions were the 2U and 3U catalogs.  Sources are referenced as, e.g., "[[4U 1700-37]]".

==Naming==
The satellite's name, "Uhuru", is the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "freedom". It was named in recognition of the hospitality of [[Kenya]] from where it was launched, from the  Italian [[San Marco platform|San Marco launch platform]] near Mombasa.

[[File:wiki snake eats mouse.jpg|thumb|right|Thermographic image: an ectothermic snake is eating a homeothermic mouse]]
'''Warm-blooded''' [[animal]] [[species]] can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, [[homeothermy|homeothermic]] species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are [[birds]] and [[mammals]]. Other species have various degrees of [[thermoregulation]].

Animal body temperature control varies by species, so the terms "warm-blooded" and "[[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]" (though still in everyday use) suggest a false idea of there being only two categories of body temperature control, and are no longer used scientifically.

==Terminology==
In general, warm-bloodedness refers to three separate categories of [[thermoregulation]].
*[[Endotherm]]y is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures through internal means such as muscle shivering or increasing their [[metabolism]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἔνδον ''endon'' "within" θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). Some writers{{Who|date=September 2010}} restrict the meaning of endothermy to mechanisms that directly raise the animal's metabolic rate to produce heat. The opposite of endothermy is [[ectothermy]]. 
*[[Homeotherm]]y maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence and temperatures. The stable internal temperature is often higher than the immediate environment (Greek: ὅμοιος ''homoios'' "similar", θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). The opposite is [[poikilothermy]]. Mammals and birds are homeothermic.
*Tachymetabolism maintains a high "resting" metabolism (Greek: ταχύς ''tachys/tachus'' "fast, swift", μεταβάλλειν ''metaballein'' "turn quickly"). In essence, tachymetabolic creatures are "on" all the time. Though their resting metabolism is still many times slower than their active metabolism, the difference is often not as large as that seen in [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] creatures. Tachymetabolic creatures have greater difficulty dealing with a scarcity of food.

==The variety of thermoregulation types==
A large proportion of the creatures traditionally called "warm-blooded", like birds and mammals, fit all three of these categories (i.e., they are endothermic, homeothermic, ''and'' tachymetabolic).  However, over the past 30 years, studies in the field of animal thermophysiology have revealed many species belonging to these two groups that do not fit all these criteria.  For example, many [[bat]]s and small birds are [[poikilothermic]] and [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] when they sleep for the night (or, in nocturnal species, for the day).  For these creatures, the term [[heterothermy]] was coined.

Further studies on animals that were traditionally assumed to be [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] have shown that most creatures incorporate different variations of the three terms defined above, along with their counterparts ([[ectothermic|ectothermy]], [[poikilothermy]], and [[bradymetabolism]]), thus creating a broad spectrum of body temperature types. Some [[fish]] have warm-blooded characteristics, such as the [[opah]]. [[Swordfish]] and some [[shark]]s have [[circulatory system|circulatory]] mechanisms that keep their [[brain]]s and [[eye]]s above ambient temperatures and thus increase their ability to detect and react to [[predation|prey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/110/2 Hot Eyes for Cold Fish -- Wong 2005 (110): 2 -- ScienceNOW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Warm brain and eye temperatures in sharks |author1=Block, B.A. |author2=Carey, F.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B | publisher=Springer | volume=156 | issue=2 |date=March 1985 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux6865g5610x54n4/ | doi=10.1007/BF00695777 | pages=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=6503 | title=Warm eyes give deep-sea predators super vision | publisher=University of Queensland | date=11 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunas and some sharks have similar mechanisms in their muscles, improving their stamina when swimming at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Warm-Blooded Fish | author=McFarlane, P. | journal=Monthly Bulletin of the Hamilton and District Aquarium Society |date=January 1999 | url=http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/breeding/McFarlane_Warm_Blooded_Fish.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat generation==
Body heat is [[thermogenesis|generated]] by [[metabolism]].  This refers to the chemical reactions [[cell (biology)|cell]]s use to break down [[glucose]] into water and [[carbon dioxide]] and, in so doing, generate ATP ([[adenosine triphosphate]]), a high-energy compound used to power other cellular processes. Muscle contraction is a type of metabolic process that generates heat energy, and heat is also generated through friction when blood flows through the circulatory system.

All organisms metabolize food and other inputs, but some make better use of the output than others. Like all energy conversions, metabolism is rather inefficient, and around 60% of the available energy is converted to heat rather than to ATP. In most organisms, this heat is simply lost to the environment. However, endothermic homeotherms (the animals generally characterized as "warm-blooded") both produce more heat and have better ways to retain and regulate it than other animals. They have a higher basal metabolic rate, and also a greater capacity to increase their metabolic rate when engaged in strenuous activity. They usually have well-developed insulation in order to retain body heat, fur in the case of mammals and [[feather]]s in birds. When this insulation is insufficient to maintain body temperature, they may resort to [[shivering]]—rapid muscle contractions that quickly use up ATP, thus stimulating cellular metabolism to replace it and consequently produce more heat. In general, in hot environments, they use evaporative cooling to shed excess heat, either by [[perspiration|sweating]] (some mammals) or by panting (many mammals and all birds)—in general, mechanisms not present in poikilotherms.

==Defense against fungi==
It has been hypothesized that warm-bloodedness evolved in mammals and birds because it provided defense against fungal infections.  Very few fungi can survive the body temperatures of warm-blooded animals.  By comparison, insects, reptiles, and amphibians are plagued by fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228411.700-killer-fungi-made-us-hotblooded.html#.UeTeVY0wd8E|year=2011|title=Killer Fungi Made us Hotblooded|last=Dunn |first=Rob|work=New Scientist|accessdate=27 April 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aviv Bergman, Arturo Casadevall. 2010.

The '''Wild Salmon Center''' (WSC) is an international conservation organization that works to protect wild [[salmon]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], [[char]], [[trout]] and the [[ecosystems]] on which these species depend.&lt;ref&gt;Chivers, CJ. The New York Times. "Salmon Find a Surprising..." October 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Headquartered in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], United States, the WSC works with communities, businesses, governments, and other non-profits to protect and preserve healthy salmon ecosystems in the North Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;"About Us" http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/about/index.php accessed on: 05/05/11&lt;/ref&gt;  WSC programs range in location from Russia, Japan, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and California.

==Background==
The WSC was founded as a non-profit by Pete Soverel and Tom Pero in 1992, and was run entirely by volunteers during its first five years.  Originally the WSC received funding for research and conservation through organizing angling trips to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East. These expeditions were a joint venture between the WSC and [[Moscow State University]].  In 1998, WSC hired Guido Rahr as Executive Director, formerly with the conservation organization Oregon Trout, where he developed an approach to salmon conservation that focused on proactive protection of the strongest remaining populations (stronghold strategy).  The organization expanded rapidly between 1999 and 2010.  A new organization called The Conservation Angler was created in 2003 to take over the [[ecotourism]] programs, allowing the WSC to focus solely on science and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford: Graduate School of Business. "The Wild Salmon Center" May 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the WSC programs, State of the Salmon, a science-based program created in 2003 in collaboration with [[Ecotrust]], used data to track the health and trends of wild salmon populations.  This data was then analyzed, and used to inform salmon management and conservation throughout the [[Pacific Rim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateofthesalmon.org/ State of the Salmon]. accessed on: 05/15/2011&lt;/ref&gt; While State of the Salmon has concluded, sustainable fisheries work continues with a new organization, [[Ocean Outcomes]], which was incubated and launched by Wild Salmon Center in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://wildsalmoncenter.org/2015/02/10/ocean-outcomes/&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean Outcomes is a global fishery improvement organization targeting high risk fisheries - the fisheries that face the biggest conservation challenges and have the most to gain from improvements. O2 works hand-in-hand with commercial fisheries and local communities to improve the sustainability of global fisheries.

==Stronghold Strategy==
Adopted in 1999, the WSC has been focused on a proactive "salmon stronghold" conservation strategy as a regional and international approach to salmon conservation.&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian. '[http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/wild_salmon_center_wants_to_di.htm Wild Salmon Center wants to Redirect...]" September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Salmon strongholds refer to river ecosystems that contain the most abundant and [[biologically diverse]] populations of wild salmon. Select areas on the [[Kamchatka]] Peninsula, Sakhalin Island, and the [[Russian Far East]] mainland, as well as key watersheds in the lower 48 US States, British Columbia, [[Bristol Bay]] and much of [[Alaska]] are considered salmon strongholds .&lt;ref&gt;Oceanography.  "Salmon Strongholds" September 2010 Vol. 23/3 P.14&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its efforts to protect habitat in Oregon, the Wild Salmon Center is a member of the [[North Coast State Forest Coalition]]. In identifying and then protecting salmon strongholds, the WSC aims to conserve healthy salmon stocks before they decline and ensure [[sustainable]] fish populations survive for the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/programs/north_america/strongholds.php Programs].
