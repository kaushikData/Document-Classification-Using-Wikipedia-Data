The '''Ballygawley land mine attack''' was a bomb attack carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) on the 13 July 1983. The IRA exploded a [[landmine]] under an [[Ulster Defense Regiment]]'s (UDR) mobile patrol at Ballygawley Road, near [[Dungannon]] in [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Four UDR soldiers were killed in the incident.

==Background==

After the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] floods of recruits signed up to join the IRA. [[Irish Republicanism|Republicans]] in Tyrone were especially angry over the death of [[Martin Hurson]]  who was from the small Tyrone village of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], Hurson was one of Cappagh's most famous  sons. Cappagh became a Republican stronghold in the 1980s. Lots of young men flocked to join the [[East Tyrone Brigade]] to avenge Hurson's death. Some of those who joined after being radicalized by the Hunger Strike would go onto become famous IRA Volunteers like [[Declan Arthurs]] &amp; [[Martin McCaughey]] who were both small children when the conflict broke out in 1969.

[[Sinn Fein]] member [[Francie Molloy]] said the following on Hurson's funeral and the effect his death had on the young people of Cappagh:

"There was people everywhere. The village was black with them. It was the first sign in Tyrone of thousands and thousands of people assembling to honor the remains of a native son coming home. Martin was young when he went to jail and young when died on hunger strike. His death just made young people more determined that they were going to replace him. They saw ten men dead as the British government taking people out of the struggle. I think the young people of Cappagh and surrounding areas decided there and then that they were going to replace everyone one of them and replace them tenfold. And that is what they did. The number of young people who joined up in response was massive."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=pf6BAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=peter%20taylor%20provos%20avenge%20hurson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj04IKwt-nPAhXLAMAKHXAqAHYQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=martin%20hurson&amp;f=false|title=The Provos: The IRA and Sinn Fein|first=Peter|last=Taylor|date=29 May 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The attack==

Four [[British Army]] ([[Ulster Defence Regiment]]) [[British soldiers|soldiers]] (Ronald Alexander, Thomas Harron, John Roxborough, and Oswald Neely), all Protestant members of the 6th Battalion [[Ulster Defence Regiment|UDR]], were travelling in their mobile patrol along a road in Tyrone close to the small town of [[Ballygawley, County Tyrone|Ballygawley]].
IRA Volunteers from the East Tyrone Brigade planted a 500lb landmine along the road the UDR patrol was coming along. The IRA unit noticed the UDR took a similar route every so often and had spotted weakness in the patrol. The IRA Volunteers were watching the UDR patrol while being well hidden, once the UDR patrol was close to the landmine the IRA Volunteers detonated the landmine by remote control killing the four UDR soldiers almost straight away. This was the highest casualty rate suffered by the UDR in a single incident during [[The Troubles]] &amp; worst attack suffered by the security forces since 1981. The attack was carried out by an [[Active Service Unit]] (ASU) of the IRA's [[East Tyrone Brigade]] which was one of the most active &amp; successful Brigade areas in the IRA during the 1980s.

==Aftermath==
Within five years the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade would launch two more high-profile attacks in Ballygawley. In 1985 during the [[Attack on Ballygawley barracks]] an IRA unit led by [[Patrick Joseph Kelly]] &amp; [[Jim Lynagh]] attacked the Ballygawley RUC barracks shooting dead two RUC officers who were at the front of the station, a 200lb bomb destroyed the whole barracks and injured 3 more RUC officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=7&amp;month=12&amp;year=1985|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the IRA killed eight British soldiers and injured twenty eight others during the [[Ballygawley bus bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=20&amp;month=08&amp;year=1988|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lot of Republicans saw this as revenge for the [[Loughgall Ambush]] the year before when the SAS shot dead 8 IRA Volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=8&amp;month=05&amp;year=1987|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baroque architecture''' is the building style of the [[Baroque]] era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] vocabulary of [[Renaissance architecture]] and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the [[Catholic Church]]. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.  Common features of Baroque architecture included gigantism of proportions; a large open central space where everyone could see the altar;  twisting columns, theatrical effects, including light coming from a cupola above;  dramatic interior effects created with bronze and gilding; clusters of sculpted angels and other figures high overhead;  and an extensive use of [[trompe-l'oeil]], also called "quadratura,"  with painted architectural details and figures on the walls and ceiling, to increase the dramatic and theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), Flammarion, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Renaissance drew on the wealth and power of the Italian courts and was a blend of secular and religious forces, the Baroque was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) is usually given as the beginning of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque architecture and its embellishments were on the one hand more accessible to the emotions and on the other hand, a visible statement of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church. The new style manifested itself in particular in the context of the new religious orders, like the [[Theatines]] and the [[Jesuits]] who aimed to improve popular piety.

[[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]], such as the example of [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] (1726-1743), developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images.

The architecture of the High Roman Baroque can be assigned to the papal reigns of [[Urban VIII]], [[Innocent X]] and [[Alexander VII]], spanning from 1623 to 1667. The three principal architects of this period were the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Francesco Borromini]] and the painter [[Pietro da Cortona]] and each evolved his own distinctively individual architectural expression.

Dissemination of Baroque architecture to the south of Italy resulted in regional variations such as [[Sicilian Baroque]] architecture or that of [[Naples]] and [[Lecce]]. To the north, the Theatine architect [[Camillo-Guarino Guarini]], [[Bernardo Vittone]] and Sicilian born [[Filippo Juvarra]] contributed Baroque buildings to the city of [[Turin]] and the [[Piedmont]] region.

A synthesis of Bernini, Borromini and Cortona’s architecture can be seen in the late Baroque architecture of northern Europe which paved the way for the more decorative [[Rococo]] style.

By the middle of the 17th century, the Baroque style had found its secular expression in the form of grand palaces, first in France—with the [[Château de Maisons]] (1642) near Paris by [[François Mansart]]—and then throughout Europe.

During the 17th century, Baroque architecture spread through Europe and Latin America, where it was particularly promoted by the Jesuits.

== Precursors and features of Baroque architecture ==
[[Michelangelo]]'s late Roman buildings, particularly [[St. Peter's Basilica]], may be considered precursors to Baroque architecture. His pupil [[Giacomo della Porta]] continued this work in Rome, particularly in the façade of the Jesuit church [[Il Gesù]], which leads directly to the most important church façade of the early Baroque, [[Santa Susanna]] (1603), by [[Carlo Maderno]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Maderno’s facade, see Wittkower R., ''Art &amp; Architecture in Italy 1600–1750'', 1985 edn, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive features of Baroque architecture can include:
* 	in churches, broader naves and sometimes given oval forms
*	fragmentary or deliberately incomplete architectural elements
*	dramatic use of light; either strong light-and-shade contrasts (''[[chiaroscuro]]'' effects) as at the church of [[Weltenburg Abbey]], or uniform lighting by means of several windows (e.g. church of [[Weingarten Abbey]])
*	opulent use of colour and ornaments (''putti'' or figures made of wood (often gilded), plaster or stucco, marble or faux finishing)
*	large-scale ceiling frescoes
*	an external façade often characterized by a dramatic central projection
*	the interior is a shell for painting, sculpture and stucco (especially in the late Baroque)
*	illusory effects like [[trompe l'oeil]] (an art technique involving extremely realistic imagery in order to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects appear in three dimensions.) and the blending of [[painting]] and [[architecture]]
*	pear-shaped domes in the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Czech Baroque architecture|Czech]], [[Baroque in Poland|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]
*	Ornate detail is key in identifying Baroque architecture ex, [[Palace of Versailles]]

=== Baroque and colonialism ===
[[File:Church of Immaculate Conception, Panjim 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|During the Portuguese colonization of [[Goa]], India brought about many churches with baroque architecture ([[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]]).]]

Though the tendency has been to see Baroque architecture as a European phenomenon, it coincided with, and is integrally enmeshed with, the rise of European [[colonialism]]. Colonialism required the development of centralized and powerful governments with Spain and France, the first to move in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;Though there is a vast literature on the subject, a succinct overview can be found in: Francis Ching, [[Mark Jarzombek]], Vikram Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'', Wiley Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialism brought in huge amounts of wealth, not only in the silver that was extracted from the mines in Bolivia, Mexico and elsewhere, but also in the resultant trade in commodities, such as sugar and tobacco. The need to control trade routes, monopolies, and slavery, which lay primarily in the hands of the French during the 17th century, created an almost endless cycle of wars between the colonial powers: the [[French religious wars]], the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 and 1648), [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco–Spanish War]] (1653), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), and so on. The initial mismanagement of colonial wealth by the Spaniards bankrupted them in the 16th century (1557 and 1560), recovering only slowly in the following century. This explains why the Baroque style, though enthusiastically developed throughout the [[Spanish Empire]], was to a large extent, in Spain, an architecture of surfaces and façades, unlike in France and Austria where we see the construction of numerous huge palaces and monasteries. In contrast to Spain, the French, under [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619–1683), the minister of finance, had begun to industrialize their economy, and thus, were able to become, initially at least, the benefactors of the flow of wealth. While this was good for the building industries and the arts, the new wealth created an inflation, the likes of which had never been experienced before. Rome was known just as much for its new sumptuous churches as for its vagabonds.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pater. ''Renaissance Rome''.  (University of California Press, 1976) pp.70–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==

=== Rome and Southern Italy ===
{{See also|Sicilian Baroque}} A number of ecclesiastical buildings of the Baroque period in Rome had plans based on the Italian paradigm of the basilica with a crossed dome and nave, but the treatment of the architecture was very different from what had been carried out previously. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in the Gesù, was the church of Santa Susanna, designed by Carlo Maderno. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, but it still maintains rigor.

The same concerns with plasticity, massing, dramatic effects and shadow and light is evident in the architectural work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by his design of [[Santi Luca e Martina]] (construction began in 1635) with what was probably the first curved Baroque church façade in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Anthony. ''Borromini'', 1979, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are even more evident in his reworking of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656–68). The façade with its [[chiaroscuro]] half-domed portico and concave side wings, closely resembles a theatrical stage set and the church façade projects forward so that it substantially fills the tiny trapezoidal piazza. Other Roman ensembles of the Baroque and Late Baroque period are likewise suffused with theatricality and, as urban theatres, provide points of focus within their locality in the surrounding cityscape.

Probably the most well known example of such an approach is [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The piazza, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, is formed principally by two colonnades of free standing columns centred on an Egyptian [[obelisk]]. Bernini's own favourite design was his oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] decorated with polychome marbles and an ornate gold dome. His secular architecture included the [[Palazzo Barberini]] based on plans by Maderno and the [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]] by [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's rival, the architect [[Francesco Borromini]], produced designs that deviated dramatically from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance. His building plans were based on complex geometric figures, his architectural forms were unusual and inventive and he employed multi-layered symbolism in his architectural designs. Borromini's architectural spaces seem to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of Michelangelo. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a complicated plan arrangement that is partly oval and partly a cross and so has complex convex-concave wall rhythms. A later work, the church of [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same playful inventiveness and antipathy to the flat surface, epitomized by an unusual "corkscrew" lantern above the dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in Rome. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]. Fontana's academic approach, though lacking the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects he trained, who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to Paris. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome—[[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727)—had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Basilica di Superga]] near [[Turin]] by [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]

The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober and classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

=== Northern Italy ===
In the north of Italy, the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects&amp;mdash;[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]], and [[Bernardo Vittone]]&amp;mdash;to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[solid geometry|stereometry]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details, and the airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roof-line and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. The rustic ambiance encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini, none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

[[File:Wignacourt Arch 2016-05-08.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Wignacourt Arch]], one of the earliest Baroque structures in Malta]]

The Baroque style was introduced in Malta in the early 17th century, possibly by the Bolognese architect and engineer [[Bontadino de Bontadini]], who was responsible for the construction of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] between 1612 and 1615. The earliest Baroque structures in Malta were the decorative elements within the aqueduct, such as the [[Wignacourt Arch]] and [[Wignacourt Aqueduct#Fountains|several fountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonello|first1=Giovanni|authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello|title=Histories of Malta – Convictions and Conjectures|date=2003|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9789993210276|pages=44–61|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Histories_of_Malta.html?id=SB4jAQAAIAAJ|chapter=Bontadino de Bontadini – The Murder of the First Baroque Architect in Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hauptaltar der St. John’s Co-Cathedral.JPG|thumb|left|The High Baroque altar of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]]]]

Baroque architecture became popular after [[Francesco Bounamici]] designed the [[Church of the Jesuits]] in [[Valletta]] in 1635. In the subsequent decades, many churches, public buildings, city gates, palaces and other structures were constructed or rebuilt in this style. New churches were built in the Baroque style, while older ones were rebuilt or redecorated.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baroque Architecture|url=http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|website=Culture Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630172716/http://culturemalta.org/48/47/Baroque-Architecture|archivedate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the interior of [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], which was completely redesigned by [[Mattia Preti]] in the 1660s, and the [[Our Lady of Victories Church, Valletta|Church of Our Lady of Victories]], which had its façade rebuilt in 1752.

The architect [[Lorenzo Gafà]] designed many Baroque churches between the 1660s and the 1700s, including the [[Saint Lawrence's Church, Vittoriosa|Church of St. Lawrence]] in [[Birgu]] (1681–97), [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Mdina]] (1696–1705) and the [[Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in [[Victoria, Gozo]] (1697–1711).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. II G-Z|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auberge de Castille.jpeg|thumb|[[Auberge de Castille]]]]

The most monumental Baroque building in Malta is [[Auberge de Castille]], which was rebuilt in 1741–45 by [[Andrea Belli]].&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt; Other examples of secular Baroque architecture in Malta include [[Hostel de Verdelin]] ({{circa}} 1650s), parts of [[Fort Manoel]] (1723–33), the [[Mdina Gate]] (1724) and the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] (1757–60).

The Baroque style remained popular in Malta until the late 18th and early 19th century, when the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style was introduced. However, traditional Maltese architecture continued to have significant Baroque influences.&lt;ref name="culturemalta"/&gt;

[[File:La Granja Palacio.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso|Royal Palace of La Granja]]]]
As Italian Baroque influences penetrated across the [[Pyrenees]], they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of [[Juan de Herrera]], which had been in vogue since the late 16th century. As early as 1667, the façades of [[Granada Cathedral]] (by [[Alonso Cano]]) and [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén Cathedral]] (by [[Eufrasio López de Rojas]]) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom.
[[File:Santiago GDFL catedral 050318 43.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The most impressive display of Churrigueresque spatial decoration may be found in the west façade of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]).]]
In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The [[Churriguera]] family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herreresque classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the [[Churrigueresque]]. Within half a century, they transformed [[Salamanca]] into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. Among the highlights of the style, the interiors of the [[Granada Charterhouse]] offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking [[chiaroscuro]] effects in his ''Transparente'' for the [[Toledo Cathedral]].
[[File:Universidad de Valladolid. Fachada.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|[[Facade of the University of Valladolid]] (1716-1718).]]
The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]'s blend of [[Solomonic column]]s and [[composite order]], known as the "supreme order". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety.

Two of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic façades of the [[University of Valladolid]] (Diego Tomé, 1716-1718) and [[Hospicio de San Fernando]] in [[Madrid]] (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald [[Antonio Gaudí]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. The focus of the florid ornamentation is an elaborately sculptured surround to a main doorway. If we remove the intricate maze of broken pediments, undulating cornices, stucco shells, inverted tapers, and garlands from the rather plain wall it is set against, the building's form would not be affected in the slightest.

{{main article|New Spanish Baroque|Andean Baroque|Churrigueresque}}
[[File:Catedral de México.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]], [[Mexico City]], started in 1573]]
The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin-towered façades of many American cathedrals of the 17th century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when a Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in [[Cusco]] was built. Even then, the new style hardly affected the structure of churches.

To the north, the richest province of 18th-century [[New Spain]]&amp;mdash;Mexico&amp;mdash;produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as Mexican Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the [[Sagrario Metropolitano]] in [[Mexico City]]. Other fine examples of the style may be found in remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at [[Ocotlán, Tlaxcala|Ocotlán]] (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college.emory.edu/culpeper/BAKEWELL/images/ocotlan-ch.jpg Exterior] and [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/bevans/Art454L-58-Tlaxcala/F00006.JPG Interior]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Augustine Church - Paoay, Ilocos Norte.jpg|thumb|[[Paoay Church]] in the Philippines is a fine example of [[Earthquake Baroque]].]]
The true capital of Mexican Baroque is [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], where a ready supply of hand-painted ceramics ([[talavera (pottery)|talavera]]) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian flavour. There are about sixty churches whose façades and domes display glazed tiles of many colours, often arranged in Arabic designs. The interiors are densely saturated with elaborate gold leaf ornamentation. In the 18th century, local artisans developed a distinctive brand of white stucco decoration, named "alfenique" after a Pueblan candy made from egg whites and sugar.

The Peruvian Baroque was particularly lavish, as evidenced by the [[Monastery of San Francisco, Lima|monastery of San Francisco]] at [[Lima]] (1673). While the rural Baroque of the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba]] in [[Córdoba, Argentina]], followed the model of Il Gesu, provincial "mestizo" (crossbred) styles emerged in [[Arequipa]], [[Potosí]], and [[La Paz]]. In the 18th century, architects of the region turned for inspiration to the [[Mudéjar]] art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian façade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of La Merced in Lima. Similarly, the Church of La Compañia in [[Quito]] suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted façade and a surfeit of spiral [[salomónica]].

Earthquake Baroque is a style of Baroque architecture found in the [[Philippines]], which suffered destructive [[earthquake]]s during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], were rebuilt in a [[Baroque]] style. Similar events led to the [[Pombaline Downtown|Pombaline]] architecture in [[Lisbon]] following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and [[Sicilian Baroque]] in [[Sicily]] following the [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693 earthquake]].

Nothwithstanding a prodigality of sensually rich surface decoration associated with Baroque architecture of the Iberian Peninsula, the royal courts of [[Madrid]] and [[Lisbon]] generally favoured a more sober architectural vocabulary distilled from 17th-century Italy. The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|royal palaces of Madrid]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and [[Convent of Mafra|Mafra]] were designed by architects under strong influence of Bernini and Juvarra. In the realm of church architecture, Guarini's design for Santa Maria della Divina Providenza in Lisbon was a pace-setter for structural audacity in the region (even though it was never built).

In Portugal, the first fully Baroque church was the [[Church of Santa Engrácia]], in Lisbon, designed by royal architect [[João Antunes]], which has a Greek cross floorplan and curved facades. Antunes also designed churches in which the inner space is rectangular but with curved corners (like the Menino de Deus Church in Lisbon), a scheme that is found in several 18th-century churches in Portugal and Brazil. The court of John V, on the other hand, favoured Roman baroque models, as attested by the work of royal architect [[Ludovice]], a German who designed the [[Convent of Mafra|Royal Palace of Mafra]], built after 1715.

By the mid-18th century, northern Portuguese architects had absorbed the concepts of Italian Baroque to revel in the plasticity of local granite in such projects as the surging 75-metre-high [[Torre dos Clérigos]] in [[Porto]]. The foremost centre of the national Baroque tradition was [[Braga]], whose buildings encompass virtually every important feature of Portuguese architecture and design. The Baroque shrines and palaces of Braga are noted for polychrome ornamental patterns, undulating roof-lines, and irregularly shaped window surrounds.

Brazilian architects also explored plasticity in form and decoration, though they rarely surpassed their continental peers in ostentation. The churches of Mariana and the Rosario at Ouro Preto are based on Borromini's vision of interlocking elliptical spaces. At São Pedro dos Clérigos, Recife), a conventional stucco-and-stone façade is enlivened by "a high scrolled gable squeezed tightly between the towers".

Even after the Baroque conventions passed out of fashion in Europe, the style was long practised in Brazil by [[Aleijadinho]], a brilliant and prolific architect in whose designs hints of Rococo could be discerned. His church of Bom Jesus de Matozinhos at Congonhas is distinguished by a picturesque silhouette and dark ornamental detail on a light stuccoed façade. Although Aleijadinho was originally commissioned to design São Francisco de Assis at São João del Rei, his designs were rejected, and were displaced to the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|church of São Francisco]] in Ouro Preto instead.

[[File:Gyoribencestemplom.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Széchenyi Square of [[Győr]], [[Hungary]]]]
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the first great Baroque building was the Jesuit Church of [[Trnava]] (today in [[Slovakia]]) built by Pietro Spozzo in 1629–37, modelling the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome. [[Jesuits]] were the main propagators of the new style with their churches in [[Győr]] (1634–1641), [[Košice]] (1671–1684), [[Eger]] (1731–1733) and [[Székesfehérvár]] (1745–1751). The reconstruction of the territories devastated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] was carried out in Baroque style in the 18th century. Intact Baroque townscapes can be found in [[Győr]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Eger]], [[Veszprém]], [[Esztergom]] and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]] of [[Buda]]. The most important Baroque palaces in Hungary were the [[Buda Castle|Royal Palace]] in Buda, [[Grassalkovich Palace]] in [[Gödöllő]], and [[Eszterháza|Esterházy Palace]] in [[Fertőd]]. Smaller Baroque edifices of the Hungarian aristocracy are scattered all over the country. Hungarian Baroque shows the double influence of Austrian and Italian artistic tendencies as many German and Italian architects worked in the country. The main characteristics of the local version of the style were modesty, lack of excessive decoration, and some "rural" flavour, especially in the works of the local masters. Important architects of the Hungarian Baroque were Andreas Mayerhoffer, Ignác Oraschek and Márton Wittwer. Franz Anton Pilgram also worked in the Kingdom of Hungary, for example on the great [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of [[Jászó|Jasov]] (today in [[Slovakia]]). In the last decades of the 18th century Neo-Classical tendencies became dominant. The two most important architects of that period were Melchior Hefele and [[Jakab Fellner]].

By the time Hungarian varieties of Baroque architecture appeared with several types of forms, shapes and decorations. Those that have become famous and nice, have been copied. That's why the Hungarian baroque edifices make groups based on similarities. The major kinds of buildings are the following: Eszterháza-type, Széchenyi-type, Gödöllő-type, religious (ecclesiastical) baroque, houses, and others (castles, peasant houses).

[[File:Château de Maisons-Laffitte 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Château de Maisons]] near Paris by [[François Mansart]] (1642)]]

The centre of Baroque secular architecture was France, where the open three-wing layout of the palace was established as the canonical solution as early as the 16th century. But it was the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] that determined the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take. For the first time, the [[corps de logis]] was emphasized as the representative main part of the building, while the side wings were treated as hierarchically inferior and appropriately scaled down. The medieval tower has been completely replaced by the central projection in the shape of a monumental three-storey gateway.

De Brosse's melding of traditional French elements (e.g. lofty [[mansard roof]]s and a complex roof-line) with extensive Italianate quotations (e.g. ubiquitous rustication, derived from [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]]) came to characterize the [[Louis XIII style]]. Probably the most accomplished formulator of the new manner was [[François Mansart]], a tireless perfectionist credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. In his design for [[Château de Maisons]] (1642), Mansart succeeded in reconciling academic and Baroque approaches, while demonstrating respect for the gothic-inherited idiosyncrasies of the French tradition.

[[File:Versailles Chapel - July 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Versailles's chapel as seen from the ''tribune royale'', an outstanding example of French Baroque&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Château of Maisons demonstrates the ongoing transition from the post-medieval [[chateau]]x of the 16th century to the villa-like country houses of the 18th. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each storey, mostly in [[pilaster]] form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation.

The next step in the development of European residential architecture involved the integration of the gardens in the composition of the palace, as is exemplified by [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]), where the architect [[Louis Le Vau]], the designer [[Charles Le Brun]] and the gardener [[André Le Nôtre]] complemented one another. From the main cornice to a low plinth, the miniature palace is clothed in the so-called "colossal order", which makes the structure look more impressive. The creative collaboration of Le Vau and Le Nôtre marked the arrival of the "Magnificent Manner" which allowed to extend Baroque architecture outside the palace walls and transform the surrounding landscape into an immaculate mosaic of expansive vistas.

[[File:Les Invalides in Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Les Invalides]] in Paris by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1676)]]

The same three artists scaled this concept to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later main [[Palace of Versailles|residence at Versailles]]. On a far grander scale, the palace is an exaggerated and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century. [[Mannheim]], [[Nordkirchen]] and [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] were among many foreign residences for which Versailles provided a model.

The final expansion of Versailles was superintended by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], whose key design is the [[Dome des Invalides]], generally regarded as the most important French church of the century. Hardouin-Mansart profited from his uncle's instruction and plans to instill the edifice with an imperial grandeur unprecedented in the countries north of Italy. The majestic hemispherical dome balances the vigorous vertical thrust of the orders, which do not accurately convey the structure of the interior. The younger architect not only revived the harmony and balance associated with the work of the elder Mansart but also set the tone for Late Baroque French architecture, with its grand ponderousness and increasing concessions to [[academicism]].

The reign of [[Louis XV]] saw a reaction against the official [[Louis XIV Style]] in the shape of a more delicate and intimate manner, known as [[Rococo]]. The style was pioneered by [[Nicolas Pineau]], who collaborated with Hardouin-Mansart on the interiors of the royal [[Château de Marly]]. Further elaborated by [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Le Pautre]] and [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]], the "''genre pittoresque''" culminated in the interiors of the [[Château de Chantilly|Petit Château at Chantilly]] (c. 1722) and [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris (c. 1732), where a fashionable emphasis on the curvilinear went beyond all reasonable measure, while sculpture, paintings, furniture, and porcelain tended to overshadow architectural divisions of the interior.

==The Low Countries==

===Flanders and Belgium===
[[File:Leuven Sint-Michielskerk.jpg|thumb|Church of St. Michel in [[Leuven]], Belgium by [[Willem Hesius]] (1650)]]

Baroque architecture in the south, [[Flanders and Belgium]] developed rather differently from in the Protestant . After the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the Southern Netherlands remained in Catholic hands, ruled by the Spanish [[Habsburg]] Kings. Important architectural projects were set up in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In them, florid decorative detailing was more tightly knit to the structure, thus precluding concerns of superfluity. A remarkable convergence of Spanish, French, and Dutch Baroque aesthetics may be seen in the [[Abbey of Averbode]] (1667). Another characteristic example is the Church of St. Michel at [[Leuven|Louvain]], with its exuberant two-storey façade, clusters of half-columns, and the complex aggregation of French-inspired sculptural detailing.

Six decades later, a [[Flanders|Flemish]] architect, Jaime Borty Milia, was the first to introduce [[Rococo]] to Spain ([[Cathedral of Murcia]], west façade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, [[Ventura Rodríguez]], responsible for the dazzling interior of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] in [[Zaragoza]] (1750).

Some Flemish architects such as [[Wenceslas Cobergher]] were trained in Italy and their works were inspired by architects such as [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Cobergher's most major project was the Basilica of Our Lady of [[Scherpenheuvel-Zichem|Scherpenheuvel]] which he designed as the center of a new town in the form of a [[heptagon]].

The influence of the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on architecture was very important. With his book "I [[Palazzi di Genova]]" he introduced novel Italian models for the conception of profane buildings and decoration in the Southern Netherlands. The courtyard and portico of his own house in Antwerp ([[Rubenshuis]]) are good examples of his architectural activity. He also took part in the decoration of the Antwerp Jesuit Church (now [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]]) where he introduced a lavish Baroque decoration, integrating sculpture and painting in the architectural program.

===Northern Netherlands===
{{main article|Dutch Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Koninklijk Paleis Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam City Hall]] by [[Jacob van Campen]] (1646)]]
There is little Baroque about Dutch architecture of the 17th century. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch [[Palladianism]] is marked by sobriety and restraint. Two leading architects, [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]], used such eclectic elements as giant-order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples in a coherent combination that anticipated Wren's Classicism.

The most ambitious constructions of the period included the [[town hall|seats of self-government]] in [[Amsterdam]] (1646) and [[Maastricht]] (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the [[House of Orange]] are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, [[Huis ten Bosch]] and [[Mauritshuis]], are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes and mannerisms. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the Stadholder's summer residence of [[Het Loo]].

The [[Dutch Republic]] was one of the [[great powers]] of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch colonial architecture, once flourishing in the [[Hudson River]] Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in [[Willemstad]], [[Curaçao]].

== England ==
{{Main article|English Baroque|Edwardian Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Greenwich Hospital from Thames.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]] by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] (1694)]]

Baroque aesthetics, whose influence was so potent in mid-17th-century France, made little impact in England during [[the Protectorate]] and the first [[English Restoration|Restoration years]]. For a decade between the death of [[Inigo Jones]] in 1652 and [[Christopher Wren]]'s visit to Paris in 1665 there was no English architect of the accepted premier class. Unsurprisingly, general interest in European architectural developments was slight.

It was Wren who presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner, which differed from the continental models by a clarity of design and a subtle taste for classicism. Following the [[Great Fire of London]], Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches, where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views. His most ambitious work was [[St Paul's Cathedral]], which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France. In this majestically proportioned edifice, the [[Palladian]] tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium. Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture (e.g. by [[Thomas Archer]] in [[St. John's, Smith Square]], 1728).
[[File:England1 144.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]]]]

Although Wren was also active in secular architecture, the first truly Baroque [[English country houses|country house]] in England was built to a design by [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], starting in 1687. The culmination of Baroque architectural forms comes with Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. Each was capable of a fully developed architectural statement, yet they preferred to work in tandem, most notably at [[Castle Howard]] (1699) and [[Blenheim Palace]] (1705).

Although these two palaces may appear somewhat ponderous or turgid to Italian eyes, their heavy embellishment and overpowering mass captivated the British public, albeit for a short while. Castle Howard is a flamboyant assembly of restless masses dominated by a cylindrical domed tower which would not be out of place in [[Dresden]] or [[Munich]]. Blenheim is a more solid construction, where the massed stone of the arched gates and the huge solid portico becomes the main ornament. Vanbrugh's final work was [[Seaton Delaval Hall]] (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724, the style had lost currency in Britain.

== Holy Roman Empire ==
{{Main article|Czech Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] in [[Berlin]]]]
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Baroque period began somewhat later. Although the [[Augsburg]] architect [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) and some theoretists, including [[Joseph Furttenbach the Elder]] already practiced the Baroque style, they remained without successors due to the ravages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. From about 1650 on, construction work resumed, and secular and ecclesiastical architecture were of equal importance. During an initial phase, master-masons from southern Switzerland and northern Italy, the so-called ''magistri Grigioni'' and the Lombard master-masons, particularly the [[Carlone]] family from Val d'Intelvi, dominated the field. However, Austria came soon to develop its own characteristic Baroque style during the last third of the 17th century. [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]] was impressed by [[Bernini]]. He forged a new ''Imperial'' style by compiling architectural motifs from the entire history, most prominently seen in his [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna. [[Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt]] also had an Italian training. He developed a highly decorative style, particularly in façade architecture, which exerted strong influences on southern Germany.

[[File:Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpg|thumb|right|250|[[Karlskirche]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
Frequently, the Southern German Baroque is distinguished from the Northern German Baroque, which is more properly the distinction between the Catholic and the Protestant Baroque. In the Catholic South, the Jesuit church of [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]] was the first to bring Italian style across the Alps. However, its influence on the further development of church architecture was rather limited. A much more practical and more adaptable model of church architecture was provided by the Jesuit church in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]]): the wall-pillar church, a [[barrel-vault]]ed nave accompanied by large open chapels separated by wall-pillars. As opposed to St. Michael's in Munich, the chapels almost reach the height of the nave in the wall-pillar church, and their vault (usually transverse barrel-vaults) springs from the same level as the main vault of the nave. The chapels provide ample lighting; seen from the entrance of the church, the wall-pillars form a theatrical setting for the side altars. The wall-pillar church was further developed by the [[Vorarlberg]] school, as well as the master-masons of [[Bavaria]]. This new church also integrated well with the [[hall church]] model of the German late Gothic age. The wall-pillar church continued to be used throughout the 18th century (e.g. even in the early neo-classical church of [[Rot an der Rot Abbey]]), and early wall-pillar churches could easily be refurbished by re-decoration without any structural changes, such as the church at Dillingen.

[[File:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Interior of [[Vierzehnheiligen]] church in [[Bavaria]]]]
However, the Catholic South also received influences from other sources, such as the so-called ''radical Baroque'' of [[Bohemia]]. The radical Baroque of [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]], both residing at [[Prague]], was inspired by examples from northern Italy, particularly by the works of [[Guarino Guarini]]. It is characterized by the curvature of walls and intersection of oval spaces. While some Bohemian influence is visible in Bavaria's most prominent architect of the period, [[Johann Michael Fischer]] (the curved balconies of some of his earlier wall-pillar churches), the works of [[Balthasar Neumann]], in particular the [[Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen]], are generally considered to be the final synthesis of Bohemian and German traditions.

In the [[Slovene Lands]], especially in [[Carniola]], Baroque arrived in the first half of the 17th century mostly through Italian influences. [[Ljubljana]] emerged as an important regional center of Baroque architecture in the early 18th century, mostly with the work of northern Italian artists such as [[Andrea Pozzo]], [[Francesco Robba]], [[Carlo Martinuzzi]] and [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]]. Their work in the today's [[Slovenia]]'s capital incoporated many northern, especially Bohemian and Austrian elements, yet Slovenian baroque maintains a recognizably Italian touch to it.
[[Lower Styria]] was more influenced by various Austrian schools, especially [[Joseph Hueber]] and his pupils who built a number of manors in what is now eastern Slovenia.

[[File:Praha 2005-09-15 St Nicholas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[St. Nicholas Church (Prague)|Church of St Nicholas]], [[Lesser Town]], the most famous Baroque church in [[Prague]]]]
Protestant sacred architecture was of lesser importance during the Baroque, and produced only a few works of prime importance, particularly the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Dresden]]. Architectural theory was more lively in the north than in the south of Germany, with [[Leonhard Christoph Sturm]]'s edition of [[Nikolaus Goldmann]], but Sturm's theoretical considerations (e.g. on Protestant church architecture) never really made it to practical application. In the south, theory essentially reduced to the use of buildings and elements from illustrated books and engravings as a prototype.

Palace architecture was equally important both in the Catholic South and the Protestant North. After an initial phase when Italian architects and influences dominated ([[Vienna]], [[Rastatt]]), French influence prevailed from the second decade of the 18th century onwards. The French model is characterized by the horseshoe-like layout enclosing a cour d'honneur (courtyard) on the town side (chateau entre cour et jardin), whereas the Italian (and also Austrian) scheme presents a block-like villa. The principal achievements of German Palace architecture, often worked out in close collaboration of several architects, provide a synthesis of Austro-Italian and French models. The most outstanding palace which blends Austro-Italian and French influences into a completely new type of building is the [[Würzburg Residence]]. While its general layout is the horseshoe-like French plan, it encloses interior courtyards. Its façades combine Lucas von Hildebrandt's love of decoration with French-style classical orders in two superimposed stories; its interior features the famous Austrian "imperial staircase", but also a French-type [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms on the garden side, inspired by the "apartement semi-double" layout of French castles.

[[Ukrainian Baroque]] is an architectural style that emerged in Ukraine during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] era, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ukrainian Baroque is distinct from the Western European Baroque in having more moderate ornamentation and simpler forms, and as such was considered more constructivist. One of the unique features of the Ukrainian baroque, were [[Onion dome|bud and pear-shaped domes]], that were later borrowed by the similar [[Naryshkin baroque]].&lt;ref&gt;Власов В.Г. Большой энциклопедический словарь изобразительного искусства В 8т. [http://cih.ru/ae/af41.html  Нарышкинский стиль]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ukrainian Baroque buildings have been preserved, including several buildings in [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] and the [[Vydubychi Monastery]].
The best examples of [[Baroque painting]] are the church paintings in the [[Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra)|Holy Trinity Church]] of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Rapid development in engraving techniques occurred during the Ukrainian Baroque period. Advances utilized a complex system of [[symbol]]ism, allegories, heraldic signs, and sumptuous ornamentation.

In Russia, Baroque architecture passed through three stages—the early [[Naryshkin Baroque|Moscow Baroque]], with elegant white decorations on red-brick walls of rather traditional churches, the mature [[Petrine Baroque]], mostly imported from the Low Countries, and the late [[Rastrelli|Rastrelliesque Baroque]], which was, in the words of William Brumfield, "extravagant in design and execution, yet ordered by the rhythmic insistence of massed columns and Baroque statuary."

The first baroque churches were built in the estates of the [[Naryshkin]] family of Moscow [[boyar]]s. It was the family of [[Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina|Natalia Naryshkina]], [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s mother. Most notable in this category of small suburban churches were the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession in Fili]] (1693–96), the Holy Tritity church in Troitse-Lykovo (1690–1695) and the Saviour in Ubory (1694–97). They were built in red [[brick]] with profuse detailed decoration in white stone. The [[Bell tower|belfry]] was not any more placed beside the church as was common in the 17th century, but on the [[facade]] itself, usually surmounting the octagonal central church and producing daring vertical compositions. As the style gradually spread around [[Russia]], many monasteries were remodeled after the latest fashion. The most delightful of these were the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]] in Moscow, as well as [[Krutitsy]] [[metochion]] and Solotcha Cloister near [[Riazan]]. Civic architecture also sought to conform to the baroque aesthetics, e.g., the [[Sukharev Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and there is also a neo-form of this style like the [[State Historical Museum|Principal Medicine Store]] on [[Red Square]]. The most important architects associated with the Naryshkin Baroque were [[Yakov Bukhvostov]] and [[Peter Potapov]].

[[Petrine Baroque]] is a name applied by art historians to a style of Baroque architecture and decoration favoured by [[Peter the Great]] and employed to design buildings in the newly founded Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], under this monarch and his immediate successors. Unlike contemporaneous [[Naryshkin Baroque]], favoured in [[Moscow]], the Petrine Baroque represented a drastic rupture with Byzantine traditions that had dominated [[Russian architecture]] for almost a millennium. Its chief practitioners—[[Domenico Trezzini]], [[Andreas Schlüter]], and [[Mikhail Zemtsov]]—drew inspiration from a rather modest Dutch, Danish, and Swedish architecture of the time. Extant examples of the style in St Petersburg are the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], the [[Twelve Colleges]], the [[Kunstkamera]], [[Kikin Hall]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].The Petrine Baroque structures outside St Petersburg are scarce; they include the [[Menshikov Tower]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Kadriorg Palace]] in [[Tallinn]].

[[File:Copenhagen amalienborg seen from opera house.jpg|thumb|[[Amalienborg Palace]], a Baroque quarter in the center of [[Copenhagen]]]]

During the golden age of the [[Swedish Empire]], the architecture of Nordic countries was dominated by the Swedish court architect [[Nicodemus Tessin the Elder]] and his son [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger]]. Their aesthetic was readily adopted across the Baltic, in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].

Born in Germany, Tessin the Elder endowed Sweden with a truly national style, a well-balanced mixture of contemporary French and medieval Hanseatic elements. His designs for the royal manor of [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]] seasoned French prototypes with Italian elements, while retaining some peculiarly Nordic features, such as the [[hip roof|hipped roof]] (''säteritak'').

Tessin the Younger shared his father's enthusiasm for discrete palace façades. His design for the [[Stockholm Palace]] draws so heavily on Bernini's unexecuted plans for the [[Louvre]] that one could well imagine it standing in Naples, Vienna, or Saint Petersburg. Another example of the so-called International Baroque, based on Roman models with little concern for national specifics, is the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The same approach is manifested is Tessin's polychrome domeless [[:File:Kalmarer Dom aussen.jpg|Kalmar Cathedral]], a skillful pastiche of early Italian Baroque, clothed in a giant order of paired Ionic pilasters.

It was not until the mid-18th century that Danish and Russian architecture were emancipated from Swedish influence. A milestone of this late period is [[Nicolai Eigtved]]'s design for a new district of [[Copenhagen]] centred on the [[Amalienborg Palace]]. The palace is composed of four rectangular mansions, originally owned by four of Denmark's greatest noble families, arranged across the angles of an octagonal square. The restrained façades of the mansions hark back to French antecedents, while their interiors contain some of the finest Rococo decoration in Northern Europe. Amalienborg Palace has served as the residence of the [[Danish royal family]] since the late 18th century.

[[Istanbul]], once the capital of the Ottoman Empire, hosts many different varieties of Baroque architecture.
As reforms and innovations to modernize the country came out in 18th and 19th century, various architecture styles were used in Turkey, one of them was the Baroque Style. As [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish architecture]] (which is also a combination of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]) combined with Baroque, a new style called Ottoman Baroque appeared.
Baroque architecture is mostly seen in mosques and palaces built in this centuries. The [[Ortaköy Mosque]], is one of the best examples of the Ottoman Baroque architecture.

The [[Tanzimat]] Era caused more architectural development. The architectural change continued with [[Sultan Mahmud II]], one of the most reformist sultans in Turkish History. One of his sons, [[Sultan Abdülmecid]] and his family left the [[Topkapı Palace]] and moved to the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which is the first European-style palace in the country.

Baroque architecture in Istanbul was mostly used in palaces near the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Golden Horn]]. [[Beyoğlu]] was one of the places that Baroque and other European style architecture buildings were largely used. The famous streets called [[Istiklal Avenue]], [[Nişantaşı]], [[Bankalar Caddesi]] consist of these architecture style apartments.
The Ottoman flavour gives it its unique atmosphere, which also distinguishes it from the later "colonial" Baroque styles, largely used in the Middle East, especially [[Lebanon]].
Later and more mature Baroque forms in Istanbul can be found in the gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] which also has a very "eastern" flavour, combining Baroque, Romantic, and Oriental architecture.

'''Bartolomé Clavero Salvador''' is a Spanish jurist and historian, specialized in [[legal history]].

He is a tenured full professor at [[University of Seville]] (http://www.us.es/acerca/directorio/ppdi/personal_3531). His works on [[usury]], [[majorat]] or the concept of State in the [[Ancien Régime]] (its absence, indeed), with a polemic content and a materialistic point of view, rendered him to be considered by historiography{{what|date=May 2017}} apart from legal. He was a personal friend and biographer of [[Francisco Tomás y Valiente]], who was murdered by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

[[File:Vin de messe.jpg|thumb|Preparation for the holy communion]]

== Historical Background and Author ==
The play was written circa 1491.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is believed that the play was performed by an [[East Anglia]]n [[Touring theatre|touring company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28111952|title=The Cambridge companion to medieval English theatre|last=|first=|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Beadle, Richard.|year=|isbn=9780521459167|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=272|oclc=28111952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original author is unknown, however it is believed that he was a member of [[clergy]], as he has great knowledge of [[Religious text|Scripture]], [[Mass in the Catholic Church|The Mass]], and [[Liturgy of the Hours|The Office]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/823860659|title=Croxton Play of the sacrament|others=Sebastian, John T., 1975-, Consortium for the Teaching of the Middle Ages.|isbn=9781580441810|location=Kalamazoo|oclc=823860659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Surviving Manuscript ==
A singular manuscript of the play is the only surviving text available. The manuscript is found in 338r–356r of Dublin, Trinity MS F.4.20, catalogue no. 652.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The initials "R.C" are located on the bottom right corner of the text. Gail Gibson hypothesizes that these initials belong to a Vicar by the name of Robert Cooke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19323694|title=The theater of devotion : East Anglian drama and society in the late Middle Ages|last=McMurray.|first=Gibson, Gail|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226291024|location=Chicago|pages=40|oclc=19323694}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Tamara Atkin argues that they belong to the printer Robert Copeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkin|first=Tamara|date=2009|title=Playbooks and Printed Drama: A Reassessment of the Date and Layout of the Manuscript of the Croxton "Play of the Sacrament"|jstor=40267538|journal=The Review of English Studies|volume=60|issue=244|pages=197|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the author, there is no way to definitively know what these initials really mean.

== Similarities to the Passion of Christ ==
The main plot points throughout the play correspond to the main plot points from [[Passion of Jesus|the Passion]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lampert|first=Lisa|date=2001|title=The Once and Future Jew: The Croxton ‘Play of the Sacrament,' Little Robert of Bury and Historical Memory.|url=|journal=Jewish History|volume=15| issue = 3|pages=235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Aristorius is Christian, his selling of the host symbolizes [[Judas]] betraying Christ. The host is nailed to a post, relating to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. The cauldron symbolizes [[Burial of Jesus|Christ's burial]], while the oven symbolizes [[Hell]]. The image of Christ revealed at the end represents the [[resurrection of Christ]].

== Antisemitism controversy ==
The play is largely [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]], and Lisa Lampert views the play as a text that vilifies "the Jew" and casts them as a murderer and constant enemy of a Christian. She states that the play asserts that the Jews murdered Christ in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anthony Bale notes that while the play is largely antisemitic, viewing it as simply antisemitic would be a mistake. He asserts that the Jews are used to examine the aspects of religion, international trade, identity, and most importantly the efficacy of the Eucharist. He also asserts that the corrupt Christian (Aristorius) is presented as much at fault as the Jewish men who buy the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/495597810|title=The Jew in the medieval book : English antisemitisms 1350-1500|last=1975-|first=Bale, Anthony Paul,|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521142038|location=Cambridge|pages=58|oclc=495597810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jews as a substitute for Lollards ==
There is a lot of discussion around whether or not the Jews were actually meant to symbolize [[Lollardy|lollards]]. At the time that the play was created, Jews had been absent from England for almost two centuries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Celia Cutts believes that the focus of the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine was meant to target these lollards, and persuade them away from their heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutts|first=C.|date=1944-03-01|title=The Croxton Play: An Anti-Lollard Piece|url=https://doi.org/10.1215/00267929-5-1-45|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=45–60|doi=10.1215/00267929-5-1-45|issn=0026-7929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have claimed that East Anglia was very tolerant in the fifteenth century, as long as the nonconformists were discreet and presented no threat to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19323694|title=The theater of devotion : East Anglian drama and society in the late Middle Ages|last=McMurray.|first=Gibson, Gail|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226291024|location=Chicago|pages=30|oclc=19323694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, those who oppose this theory claim the lack of evidence of lollardry during this time disproves it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Ann Eljenholm|date=1988|title=The Croxton "Play of the Sacrament": A Re-Reading|jstor=41153343|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=22|issue=2|pages=118–119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The play begins with the Vexillators appearing to the audience with banners. They inform the audience of the plot. After the summary, the Vexillators ask that the audience never doubt Christ. They tell the audience that the play is set in Croxton,&lt;ref&gt;There are several places in England called [[Croxton (disambiguation)|Croxton]]. The East Anglian connection suggests either [[Croxton, Cambridgeshire]] or [[Croxton, Norfolk]].&lt;/ref&gt; and then the play begins.

Aristorius appears, praising his success as a merchant, and thanking God for allowing him to sell his goods. Isoder enters, and says that he will do anything in his power to ensure that Aristorius remains successful. Jonathas then enters, thanking Mohammed for all that he possesses. Jonathas is a Jewish man who is skeptical of the holy host and Christian ways. He, along with his friends Jason and Jasdon, have discuss how insane it is for Christian men to “believe on a cake” in their religion. The cake is referring to the [[holy host]]. They wish to desecrate a host in the name of their god, and discuss ways in which they can secure one.

The Jewish men visit Aristorius, and ask him to sell the host. He initially refuses, as they are not of the Christian faith. Jonathas increases his offer to 100 pounds, which Aristorius is unable to turn down. Aristorius is afraid that he will get caught stealing the host, but Jonathas convinces him to do it at night time. Aristorius goes to visit the priest, and gets him drunk on wine – enabling him to steal the host.

Once they receive the consecrated host, Jonathas, Jason, Jasdon, Malchus, and Masphat decide to stab the host to see if it bleeds. To their surprise, it bleeds. Now terrified of the host, they decide to boil it in hot oil. When Jonathas tries to throw the host in the oil, it clings to his hand. He tries to wash it away in water, but again it stays attached. The men decide to pin it to a host, and pull Jonathas until he is released. The host is not removed, and the men wind up pulling so hard that his arm detaches from his body. Defeated, the men go to bed and vow to keep their plot a secret.

Coll and Brundich now enter. It is revealed that Brundich is a corrupt man, who makes his patients ill again to get the most money possible out of them. Coll tells Brundich of Jonathas’ troubles, and Brundich proceeds to attempt to treat him. Jonathas refuses this treatment, and tells Brundich to leave.

Jonathas has his men remove the host and toss it in the bubbling oil. The oil then turns to blood, and overflows. They then toss the host in a hot oven, where it begins to ooze blood and then eventually explode. After the explosion, an image of Christ appears to the men.

Christ asks the Jewish men why they despise him so much. He proceeds to blame them for the desecration of his body both presently and in the past. Still, he says that he will forgive them. The men repent their sins, and Christ heals Jonathas’ arm when he dips it in the cauldron.

Upon confessing his sins to the Bishop, Jonathas brings the Bishop back to the image of Christ. The Bishop converts the image back into bread, and goes back to the church. Aristorius confesses his sins, and asks forgiveness from the Bishop.

At the end of the play, all of the men attend a sermon at the church. The Jewish men convert, and proclaim belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The Bishop then asks for God’s blessing, and says in Latin “Te Deum Laudamus” (we praise you, God) which ends the play.

'''Dagmar Hagelin''' (September 29, 1959 - disappeared on January 27, 1977) was a 17-year-old [[Swedes|Swedish]]-[[Argentine]] girl who disappeared during the [[Dirty War]] on January 27, 1977, and is presumed to have been arrested by security forces in [[El Palomar, Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22584&amp;a=477423&amp;lid=puff_477419&amp;lpos=bild |title=SVT om Dagmar Hagelin |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612231647/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22584&amp;a=477423&amp;lid=puff_477419&amp;lpos=bild |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina, and murdered in a case of [[mistaken identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&amp;a=1352702&amp;from=rss |title=2008-12-18 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612231557/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&amp;a=1352702&amp;from=rss |archivedate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagmar's father, Argentine-Swedish businessman [[Ragnar Hagelin]] has ever since worked to have the responsible people brought to justice, accusing [[Alfredo Astiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/jag-mordade-inte-dagmar-hagelin-1.442778 |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=Jag mördade inte Dagmar Hagelin |trans-title=I did not murder Dagmar Hagelin |author1=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]] |author2=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Alfredo Astiz was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity in Argentina between the years of 1976 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/utrikes/livstid-for-hagelins-formodade-bodel_6584978.svd |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |title=Livstid för Hagelins förmodade bödel |trans-title=Lifetime sentence for Hagelin's supposed executioner |author=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]] |location=Stockholm |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagmar's father, Ragnar Hagelin commented to Swedish media on the sentence that he, "couldn't describe the happiness he felt that after 34 years of struggles, Dagmar’s killer would finally pay for his crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=4769247 |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |work=[[Dagens Eko]] |title=Domen mot Astiz gläder Dagmar Hagelins pappa |trans-title=The verdict against Astiz pleases Dagmar Hagelin's father |first=Lotta |last=Myhrén |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a pilot named Julio Poch was indicted for the murder of Hagelin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/argentina-indicts-death-flights-navy-pilot/story-fn3dxity-1225883663982?nk=c3f62a49375fc8976b826b0e71ac7586 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |title=Argentina indicts 'death flights' navy pilot |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=24 June 2010|accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragnar Hagelin resided in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, until his death in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.1807811/nu-stalls-hagelins-mordare-infor-ratta |newspaper=[[Expressen]] |title=Nu ställs Hagelins mördare inför rätta |trans-title=Hagelin's murderer is now brought to justice |first=Christel |last=Persson |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-10-23/dagmar-hagelins-pappa-har-avlidit|newspaper=[[Sydsvenskan]]| title=Dagmar Hagelins pappa har avlidit|accessdate=2016-10-23|language=Swedish}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mistaken identity==
It is believed that Hagelin was a victim of mistaken identity when on January 27, 1977, she went to visit a friend in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. Her friend, who was politically active, had been arrested the night before by Alfredo Astiz's forces and had told during interrogations that another politically active friend of her would visit the next day. Hagelin, who had decided to visit her friend on a spur of the moment, was approached by the forces and shot when she tried to escape. She was taken to [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]], a noted [[torture]] centre, where she was later killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22584&amp;a=477423&amp;lid=puff_477419&amp;lpos=bild |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |title=Astiz begärs häktad för Hagelinmordet - rapport |trans-title=Astiz arrest is sought for Hagelin murder - report |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612231647/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22584&amp;a=477423&amp;lid=puff_477419&amp;lpos=bild |archivedate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagelin was 17 years old at the time of her death.

'''Dan Cruickshank''' (born 26 August 1949) is a British [[Art history|art historian]] and [[BBC]] [[television]] presenter, with a special interest in the history of [[architecture]].

==Biography==

===Professional career===
Cruickshank holds a BA in Art, Design and Architecture&lt;ref name="Celebrity Productions Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityproductions.info/displayer_celebrities.php/58/Dan_Cruickshank|title=Bio|website=Celebrity Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly a Visiting Professor in the Department of Architecture at the [[University of Sheffield]]&lt;ref&gt;http://eustonarch.org/about-us/meet-the-team/&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the London faculty of the [[University of Delaware]]. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Artists, a member of the Executive Committee of the [[Georgian Group]] and on the Architectural Panel of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and is an Honorary Fellow of [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]].&lt;ref name="Celebrity Productions Bio"/&gt;

He has served as Historic Buildings Consultant for ADAM Architecture since 1999 and has been involved in the repair and restoration of many historical buildings including [[Spencer House (St. James's, London, England)|Spencer House]] in St James’s, [[Heveningham Hall]] in [[Suffolk]] and numerous early 18th-century houses in [[Spitalfields]] and other parts of London.&lt;ref name="raa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertadamarchitects.com/RAA_team/biog_DC_short.htm |title=Professor Dan Cruickshank Biography |accessdate=27 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820011146/http://www.robertadamarchitects.com/RAA_team/biog_DC_short.htm |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014 he was appointed President of Subterranea Britannica, a UK-based society for all those interested in man-made and man-used underground structures and space.&lt;ref name="subbrit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.subbrit.org.uk/about | title = About Subterranea Britannica | accessdate = 8 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His professional publications include ''London – the Art of Georgian Building'', ''The National Trust and Irish Georgian Society Guide to the Georgian Buildings of Britain and Ireland'' and ‘’Life in the Georgian City’’. He edited the 20th edition of ''[[Banister Fletcher|Sir Banister Fletcher]]’s History of Architecture'' and ''Timeless Architecture: a study of key buildings in architectural history'' and is a contributing editor to ''Architects’ Journal'', ''The Architectural Review'' and ''Perspectives on Architecture''.

===Television work===
Cruickshank began his career with the BBC as consultant, writer and presenter on the architectural programmes ''[[One Foot in the Past]]'' and ''The House Detectives''. He also contributed films to the ''[[Timewatch]]'' and ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' strands.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/tvfactual/dancruickshankknobhead.shtml |title=Presenter Dan Cruickshank Biography |accessdate=27 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427003146/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/tvfactual/dancruickshank.shtml |archivedate=27 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he wrote and presented the series ''[[Invasion (TV documentary)|Invasion]]'' in which he examined attempts and plans to invade [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] over the years by exploring coastal [[fortress]]es and [[defense (military)|defensive]] structures around the coast of the country to discover their military heritage.

Further series included ''[[Britain's Best Buildings]]'' examining architecturally – or culturally-significant buildings in Great Britain, ''[[Under Fire (TV series)|Under Fire]]'' visiting museums and buildings in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Israel]] to see how recent warfare has affected the country's historic artefacts, and ''[[What the Industrial Revolution Did for Us]]'' focusing on the scientific, technological and political changes of the 19th century.

In 2003, Cruickshank presented a documentary entitled ''[[Towering Ambitions: Dan Cruickshank at Ground Zero]]'' following the debate and discussion that led to the selection of [[Daniel Libeskind|Daniel Libeskind's]] design for the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[New York City]]; while in 2005 he presented a documentary on the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection — rolls of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrocellulose film|nitrate film]] shot in the early 20th century, depicting everyday life in [[Great Britain|Britain]], which were discovered in 1994 in [[Blackburn]].

In 2004, Cruickshank was at the centre of a controversy when historian [[Marc Morris]] pointed out that a documentary about [[Harlech Castle]] shown on BBC4 and billed as "written and presented by Dan Cruickshank" contained obvious borrowings from Morris's earlier [[Channel 4]] series, ''Castle''. The BBC subsequently stated that Cruickshank was not responsible and that it was an error by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/28/broadcasting.bbc "Broadcaster gets apology from BBC as history repeats itself", ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2004]. Accessed 16 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Channel 4's head of history programming, Hamish Mykura, commented that "When a programme claims to have an author's voice, it should be that author's voice and no one else's".  The BBC subsequently made a "goodwill payment" to Morris in recognition of the error.

Perhaps his greatest success to date came with ''[[Around the World in 80 Treasures]]'', charting Cruickshank's five-month trip around the world to visit eighty man-made artefacts or buildings that he had selected, in order to chart the history of mankind's [[civilization|civilisation]]. 

In 2006, Cruickshank presented ''[[Marvels of the Modern Age]]'', a series focusing on the development of [[modernism]] in [[design]], from [[Greek Architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture]], to [[Bauhaus]] and  the present.

''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture]]'', a 2008 series in which he travelled around the world visiting what he considered to be the world's most unusual and interesting buildings.

In 2010, he embarked on a 3 part series on the history of the railways in Britain for [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV channel, including visits to [[Chester]] to examine the events surrounding the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847, and [[Manchester]] for the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] which opened in 1830. The series was entitled "Great Railway Adventures" and first appeared on UK television in the spring of 2010. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.

===Personal life===
Cruickshank lives in a Georgian house in [[Spitalfields]], London, which he shares with his partner, the painter Marenka Gabeler, their son Alexander and daughter, Isabel, from a previous marriage.&lt;ref name="obs1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/15/dan-cruickshank-historian-spitalfields-interiors | title=My Space: Dan Cruickshank, historian | accessdate = 12 Jan 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=15 November 2009 | first=Alistair | last=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellen Fries''' (23 September 1855 at Rödslegård in [[Törnsfall]], [[Kalmar län]] – 31 March 1900 in [[Stockholm]]) was a Swedish feminist and writer. She became the first female [[Ph.D.]] in [[Sweden]] in 1883.

== Biography ==

She was the daughter of [[Colonel]] Patrik Constantin Fries and Beata Maria Borgström. She studied at the [[Åhlinska flickskolan]], and graduated with a professional degree from [[Wallinska skolan]] in Stockholm 19 May 1874. She studied language and art by travelling to Paris and Leipzig and was a language teacher at [[Wallinska skolan]] in 1875-1877.
The universities in Sweden had been opened to both genders in 1870. Fries enlisted as a student at [[Uppsala University]] 12 October 1877. She studied history, Nordic language and political science and was given the scholarship Kraemerska stipendiet. She became the first female Ph.D. in Sweden 31 May 1883. She was a teacher in history at [[Wallinska skolan]] in Stockholm 1884-1886 and at [[Åhlinska flickskolan]] from 1885; in 1890, she became its principal.

In 1884, she was one of six to summon the first meeting of the feminist movement [[Fredrika-Bremer-förbundet]]; she initiated the foundation of ''[[Svenska kvinnors nationalförbund]]'' (Swedish Council of Women) in 1896, and one of the five co-founders of the [[Nya Idun]] society.

From 1881, she was active in the feminist paper of [[Sophie Adlersparre]], ''[[Tidskrift för hemmet]]'', mainly contributing with biographies of women, and she was also joint editor of the paper in 1883-85. She contributed with articles as a freelancer to various papers, such as ''[[Dagny (magazine)]]'' 1886–95, ''[[Framåt (paper)]]'' 1886, ''[[Verdandi (paper)]]'' 1888, ''[[Hemåt (paper)]]'' 1892, ''[[Nya Idun]]'' 1891–92, ''[[Stockholms Dagblad]]'' 1884–85 and ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' 1885 as well as in the dictionary ''[[Nordisk Familjebok]]''.

In 1886 and 1899–1900, she lectured about the 17th  and 18th centuries at [[Pedagogiska lärokursen]] in Stockholm.

{{Politics of Basque Country (autonomous community)}}
'''Euskadiko Ezkerra''' ('''EE'''; {{lang-en|Basque Country Left}}) was a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[socialist]] political organisation. It was founded as a coalition of  '''[[Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia]]''' ('''EIA''', ''Basque Party for Revolution'' or ''Party for Basque Revolution'') and other Basque [[Marxism|Marxist]] forces in 1977 to present lists for the [[Spanish general election, 1977|Spanish general elections]] in the constituencies of [[Vizcaya (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Vizcaya]], [[Guipúzcoa (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Guipúzcoa]] and [[Álava (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Álava]], while '''[[Navarrese Left Union|UNAI]]''', an allied coalition, was to present a list in the constituency of [[Navarra (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Navarre]].

==History==
[[File:Gernika37-87 euskadiko ezkerra 01.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Mural painted at [[Gernika]] in 1987, commemorating the [[bombing of Gernika]].]]
EE's list in Guipúzcoa won one seat in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Spanish Congress]] for [[Francisco Letamendia]], one in the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] for [[Juan María Bandrés]], a lawyer for [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] members, and none in the other constituencies. Many prominent members of EE eventually separated from the coalition and integrated into [[Herri Batasuna]] (HB). EE called for "no" in the Referendum for [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] in 1978.

[[File:Eelogo.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Their initial logo had half an [[ikurriña]] (Basque flag) in the left side, and two white and black capital E's in the right side.]]
Several of the members of [[ETA political-military|ETA (pm)]] joined peaceful political action in EE after they abandoned violence and negotiated pardons from the [[Spain|Spanish]] government.

In 1982 it merged with some sectors of [[Communist Party of Euskadi|PCE-EPK]] (the Basque branch of [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|PCE]]) and became a party under the name EE-IPS, ''Euskadiko Ezkerra-Izquierda para el Socialismo'' ("Left for Socialism"), while often using the simpler name Euskadiko Ezkerra. Its general secretary in this period was [[Mario Onaindia]], a former ETA member during the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, later replaced by Kepa Aulestia.

EE called for a "no" on the membership of Spain in [[NATO]] in the referendum held in 1986. While the "yes" vote won nationally, the "no" campaign triumphed in the Basque Autonomous Community.

After the split of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) and the creation of [[Eusko Alkartasuna]] (EA) in 1987, EE established several coalitions with the latter. In 1991 EE entered in the government of the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] in coalition with both PNV and EA.

Later, in 1991, a majority of party affiliates approved a merger with [[Socialist Party of the Basque Country]] (PSE), the branch of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) for the Basque Autonomous Community. The resulting party is the current PSE-EE.

However a section of Euskadiko Ezkerra disagreed with the PSE merger, and, since the Euskadiko Ezkerra name was retained by the majority of members who approved the merger with the PSE, the remaining faction went on to create a new party, [[Euskal Ezkerra]] ('''EuE''', ''Basque Left'') which, in turn, merged soon after with Eusko Alkartasuna.

'''George Grub''' (1812–1892) was a Scottish church historian.

==Life==
Grub was born at [[Old Aberdeen]] on 4 April 1812, was the only child of George Grub, a respectable citizen and convener of the trades at Old Aberdeen, by his wife, Christian Yolum. 
He entered [[King's College, Aberdeen]], at the age of thirteen and a half, and afterwards entered the law-office of Alexander Allan, advocate in Aberdeen, under whom he served the apprenticeship required by the [[Society of Advocates in Aberdeen]].

Passing as advocate in 1836, he was in 1841 appointed librarian to the society. 
This post he held until his death. 
In 1843 he became lecturer on Scots law in [[Marischal College, Aberdeen]], and for forty-eight years was practically the sole teacher of law in the university of Aberdeen first, as holding this lectureship; next, after the union of King's and Marischal Colleges (1860–81), as 'substitute' for Professor [[Patrick Davidson]], who held the chair of law at King's College, but never lectured. After Davidson's death in 1881, Grub became professor of law in the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/special-collections/provenance/owner/497/|title=Grub, George|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, he graduated A.M. at Aberdeen, and in 1864 he received the degree of LL.D. from his university, and on resigning the chair in 1891 he was presented by his former students and fellow-citizens with his portrait painted by Sir [[George Reid (Scottish artist)|George Reid]].{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}

By birth an inheritor of the Scottish non-juring tradition, he was himself an accomplished theologian ; he had followed with enthusiasm the whole course of the [[Oxford Movement]]; and in the congregation to which he belonged (St. John's Episcopal Church, Aberdeen) he had supported his clergyman, [[Patrick Cheyne]], throughout a prosecution in regard to eucharistic doctrine, which had weighty consequences, for it led to the charge and prosecution of the bishop of Brechin, [[Alexander Penrose Forbes]], and the intervention of Pusey and Keble in defence of that prelate. It took some time to heal the sores occasioned by that controversy.{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}

There was at Aberdeen in the early 'thirties' a group of young men, all of them Aberdeen lawyers, all of them episcopalians, and all of them earnest students of history and antiquities [[John Hill Burton]], [[Joseph Robertson (historian)|Joseph Robertson]] (1810-1866), and [[John Stuart (genealogist)|John Stuart]] (1813-1877). 
With these Grub associated on equal terms. Like them he contributed to the ''Aberdeen Magazine'' (1831-2), and took part in a far more important undertaking, the formation of the Spalding Club. 
For this club he edited (1840-2), in conjunction with Joseph Robertson, Gordon's ''History of Scots Affairs,'' 3 vols. (1853), Thomas Innes's ''History of Scotland, Civil and Ecclesiastical'' (the ''Life of Thomas Innes'' which he contributed to this volume was reprinted in the edition of Innes's ''Critical Essays,'' published in the ''Historians of Scotland'' series), and (1869) the index volume of the ''Illustrations of the Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff.'' &lt;ref name="CBEL"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uak8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA906&amp;ots=A3SV6oC5Py&amp;dq=George%20Grub%20Aberdeen&amp;pg=PA906|volume=3|editor=F W Bateman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1969|page=906}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1861, his own work, by which he is best known, ''An Ecclesiastical History of Scotland from the Introduction of Christianity to the Present Time'' (it closes with the death of Bishop Skinner on 15 April 1857), in four volumes, was published at Edinburgh,&lt;ref name="CBEL"/&gt; and at once stamped him as the foremost authority on the subject in Scotland.{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}

Clear and unaffected in style, this work is learned and exact, but it suffers somewhat from the fact that his extreme scrupulosity as to literal truth caused him to hold too severely in check the wit and liveliness which were so conspicuous and charming in his conversation. As an historian he was determined to be fair, albeit he is at no pains to conceal (what he was proud of) his enthusiastic toryism and his profound attachment to the Scottish episcopal church. 
In the preface, Grub acknowledges the help he had received from Joseph Robertson and Mr. Norval Clyne; he regrets that for the history of the Roman Catholic church after the Reformation he had not been able to obtain more accurate materials; and he says that the work had occupied him more than nine years. In spite of the more recent researches on the Celtic period of Scottish history, the book is by no means out of date ; but it is unfortunate that no second edition of it was called for until Grub was too old to undertake the labour of preparing one. He had made notes for this which it is understood were lent to the Rev. W. Stephen, D.D., Dumbarton, for his ''History''.{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}
 
Grub contributed to ''Chambers's Encyclopædia'' the articles ''Scotland'' and ''Church of Scotland;'' that on ''Scottish Literature'' in the earlier editions was also his, but failing health prevented him from undertaking its revision for the new edition. 
To the [[Aberdeen Philosophical Society]], he contributed the ''Life of Bishop Elphinstone;'' ''The Life of Bishop Burnet, and his Character as a Historian and Biographer;'' ''Dr. James Beattie and his Friends;'' ''The Antiquities of Dunkeld;'' ''Froude's History and Mary, Queen of Scots;'' ''Elgin Cathedral;'' ''Review of the Evidence as to the Complicity of Queen Mary in the Murder of Darnley;'' and, in concert with his lifelong friend and companion, Mr. Norval Clyne, ''The Ecclesiastical and Baronial Antiquities of the Cathedral of Brechin and Castle of Edzell.'' An unpublished paper on [[Henry Scougal]] supplied materials for the ''Life'' of that author prefixed to the latest edition of Scougal's devotional treatise, ''The Life of God in the Soul of Man'' (Aberdeen, 1892).{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}

==Family==
His wife, Ann Lyall, died many years before him, leaving him two sons, the Rev. [[George Grub (priest)|George Grub]], rector of the Episcopal Church, Ayr, and the Rev. Charles Grub, rector of St. Mary's, Montrose.{{sfn|Cooper|1901}}

==Works==
His ''[[Ecclesiastical History of Scotland]]'' (1861), written from the standpoint of an [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]],  is dry, but concise, clear, fair-minded, and trustworthy. Grub also edited (along with [[Joseph Robertson (historian)|Joseph Robertson]]) Gordon's ''[[Scots Affairs]]'' for the [[Spalding Club]], of which he was one of the founders.

'''Grupos Armados Españoles''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''Spanish Armed Groups''; '''GAE''') was a Spanish [[Right-wing terrorism|right-wing paramilitary]] [[Spanish nationalism|Spanish nationalist]] and ''parapolicial'' group active from 1979 to 1980, primarily in the [[Southern Basque Country]]. A report by the Office for Victims of Terrorism of the [[Basque Government]] in June 2010 attributed 6 murders in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] to the group, and linked it to the [[Spanish police]], [[SECED]] and [[Guardia Civil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2010/03/21/domingo/1269147158_850215.html Luis R. Aizpeolea, "Las otras víctimas"], El País, 21 de octubre de 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings attributed to the GAE==
:''This list may be incomplete, because many of their attacks were never claimed. Additionally the acronyms GAE and others ([[Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey]], [[Anti Terrorismo ETA]] or ATE, [[Primera Línea de Fuerza Nueva]], [[Batallón Vasco Español]], [[Alianza Apóstolica Anticomunista (Spain)|Alianza Apóstolica Anticomunista]] or Triple A and, later, [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] and [[GANE]]) seem to have been indistinctly used by the same Spanish nationalist networks capriciously.

* September 28, 1979 : [[Tomás Alba Irazusta]], town councillor of [[Herri Batasuna]] in the municipality of [[Donostia]]. Killed on in [[Astigarraga]] ([[Guipuzkoa]]).
* January 15, 1980: Killing of Carlos Saldise Corta (member of the [[Gestoras pro Amnistía]]) in [[Lezo, Spain|Lezo]] ([[Guipuzkoa]]). 
* January 20, 1980: [[Alonsotegi bombing]]. 4 killed and 10 injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1980/01/22/espana/317343609_850215.html El grupo de ultraderecha GAE reivindica el atentado de Baracaldo.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged links with the repressive apparatus of the Spanish State==
The report of the Office of Victims of Terrorism of the [[Basque Government]] (2010) said that the GAE was a well organized right-wing group, that "acted with a high level of tolerance, when no complicity with important sectors of the police apparatus of the time", while acknowledging that" and criticized the impunity and lack of investigation about group actions.

Gungnae was chosen to become the capital city by the kingdom's second ruler, [[Yuri of Goguryeo|King Yuri]] during the 10th month of the year 3 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_dynasty_detail.htm?lang=e&amp;current_page=3&amp;No=10034857 King Yuri(1)]  "[[KBS World]]", Retrieved 2015-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; The city was sacked several times until the rise of the 19th ruler, [[Gwanggaeto the Great]], who greatly expanded Goguryeo's territory and made it a formidable power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Water Jung, 《Nation building:the geopolitical history of Korea》, University Press of America, 1998. {{ISBN|0761812733}} p.18&lt;/ref&gt; When King Gwanggaeto died in 413, his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo]], inherited the throne and moved the capital down to [[Pyongyang]] in 427.&lt;ref&gt;Hyon-hui Yi, Song-su Pak, Naehyeon Yun, 《New history of Korea》, Jimoondang, 2005, p.224 {{ISBN|8988095855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city played a central role of the kingdom after the power transfer.&lt;ref name="Goguryeo"&gt;Ho-tae Cheon, 《The Dreams of the Living and Hopes of the Dead:Goguryeo Tomb Murals》, Seoul National University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|8952107292}} p.4, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a master's degree from [[Hitotsubashi University]]’s department of sociological research and then attained a doctorate in the same field.

He is the managing director of the “Chūgokujin Sensō Higaisha no Yōkyū wo Sasaeru Kai”, which provides legal support for Chinese victims of Japanese war crimes, and within that organization he heads an executive committee charged with seeking a formal apology and reparations from the Japanese government for the [[Pingdingshan massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suopei.jp/information/yobikake/post_510.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ironbridge002.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[The Iron Bridge]] of [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]]'s [[Coalbrookdale]] works]]

An '''ironmaster''' is the manager, and usually owner, of a [[forge]] or [[blast furnace]] for the processing of [[iron]]. It is a term mainly associated with the period of the [[Industrial Revolution]], especially in [[Great Britain]].

The ironmaster was usually a large scale [[entrepreneur]] and thus an important member of a community.  He would have a large country house or [[mansion]] as his residence.  The organization of operations surrounding the [[smelting]], [[refining]] and [[casting]] of iron was labour-intensive, and so there would be a large number of workers reliant on the furnace works.

There were ironmasters (possibly not called such) from the 17th century onwards, but they became more prominent with the great expansion in the British iron industry during the Industrial Revolution.

==17th century==
An early ironmaster was [[John Winter (royalist)|John Winter]] (about 1600–1676) who owned substantial holdings in the [[Forest of Dean]]. During the [[English Civil War]] he cast cannons for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher = Collins |author = Wedgewood, C.V. |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25430542M/The_King's_War_1641_-_1647 |title = The King's War 1641 - 1647 |edition = |publication-date = 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Winter developed his interest in the iron industry, and experimented with a new type of [[Ferrous metallurgy#Transition to coke in England|coking oven]]. This was a precursor to the later work of [[Abraham Darby I]] who successfully used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] to smelt iron.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Jeremy |title=Civil War and Restoration in Monmouthshire |publisher=Logaston Press |year=2005 |isbn=1-904396-41-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Portrait of John Wilkinson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|"Iron mad" [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]], (1728-1808)]]

===Abraham Darby===

Three successive generations of the same family all bearing the name [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|Abraham Darby]] are renowned for their contributions to the development of the English iron industry. Their works at [[Coalbrookdale]] in Shropshire nurtured the start of improvements in [[metallurgy]] that allowed large-scale production of the iron that made the development of the [[steam engine]] and [[railway]]s possible, although their most notable innovation was [[The Iron Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Darby, Abraham|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Wilkinson===

One of the best known ironmasters of the early part of the industrial revolution was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] (1728–1808), who was considered to have "iron madness", extending even to making [[cast iron]] [[coffins]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J.R. ''[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29428  Wilkinson, John (1728–1808)]''. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isaac Lowthian Bell - britischer Industrieller.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Lowthian Bell]], (1816-1904) by [[Frank Bramley]]]]

[[Lowthian Bell]] (1816–1904) was, like Abraham Darby, the forceful patriarch of an ironmaking dynasty. Both his son [[Sir Hugh Bell, 2nd Baronet|Hugh Bell]] and his grandson Maurice Bell were directors of the Bell iron and steel company. His father, Thomas Bell, was a founder of [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]], an iron and alkali company. The firm had works at Walker, near Newcastle upon Tyne, and at [[Port Clarence]], [[Middlesbrough]], contributing largely to the growth of those towns and of the economy of the northeast of England. Bell accumulated a large fortune, with mansions including [[Washington New Hall]], [[Rounton Grange]] near [[Northallerton]], and the mediaeval [[Mount Grace Priory]] near [[Osmotherley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Howell | first=Georgina | title=[[Gertrude Bell]]: Queen of the Desert, Shaper of Nations | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year=2008|edition=paperback|pages=5–6, 64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/30/101030690 | title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | work=Lowthian Bell |last=Tweedale |first=Geoffrey | year=2011 | accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/news/arts-and-crafts-mount-grace/ | title=Arts and crafts revival planned at Mount Grace | publisher=English Heritage | date=14 January 2010 | accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan===

[[Henry Bolckow]] (1806–1878) and [[John Vaughan (Ironmaster)|John Vaughan]] (1799–1868) were lifelong business partners, friends, and brothers-in-law. They established what became the largest of all [[Victorian era]] iron and steel companies, [[Bolckow Vaughan]], in Middlesbrough. Bolckow brought financial acumen, and Vaughan brought ironmaking and engineering expertise. The two men trusted each other implicitly and "never interfered in the slightest degree with each other's work.

'''John Geraint Jenkins''' (1929 – 15 August 2009), known as '''J. Geraint Jenkins''', was a Welsh maritime historian and historian of rural crafts.

== Career ==

Jenkins was born in 1929 into a Welsh-speaking "seafaring" family based near [[Llangrannog]] in [[Ceredigion]]; he attended the village school and [[Cardigan Grammar School]], before completing his university education at the University Colleges of Wales at [[University College of Wales, Swansea|Swansea]] and [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref name="nmw" /&gt;

He graduated from the Aberystwyth in 1950 with a degree in geography and anthropology, and then completed a master's degree there under [[E. G. Bowen]] and [[Alwyn J. Rees]]. He worked at a museum in [[Leicester]] from 1952 to 1953, when he was appointed Assistant Keeper at the [[Museum of English Rural Life]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], which came with a part-time lectureship at the [[University of Reading]] (which housed the museum). In 1960, he returned to Wales as Assistant Keeper of the [[St Fagans National Museum of History|Welsh Folk Museum]] at [[St Fagans]], and nine years later he secured promotion as Keeper of Material Culture. He then moved in 1977 to the [[Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum]] in [[Cardiff]], to be closer to the sea and his interest in maritime history; he regarded the decade he spent there as the happiest of his career. In 1981, the [[University of Wales]] conferred on him a [[Doctor of Science|doctor of science]] degree. But his move back to St Fagans and the Folk Museum in 1987 to be its Curator was less happy, owing in part to clashes with management and what Jenkins regarded as English interference. He retired early in 1992, and moved to [[Penbryn]]. He was the [[High Sheriff of Dyfed]] in 1994–95 and joined [[Ceredigion County Council]], serving as its Chairman in 2002–03.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;Meic Stephens, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/j-geraint-jenkins-maritime-historian-and-authority-on-rural-crafts-1792723.html J.

Jenkins died on 15 August 2009, leaving a widow, Nansi, and two sons, David and Gareth; another son, Richard, had died in 2000.&lt;ref name="nmw" /&gt; According to his obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'', "Geraint Jenkins played a leading role in the preservation and interpretation of the maritime history of Wales. He published more than 50 books, many to do with the seafaring traditions of west Wales, and was an acknowledged authority on the subject. He also made expert studies of other aspects of Welsh folk life, including traditional farm implements, rural crafts, the woollen industry and Cardiff ship-owners."&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt;

'''Josef Vincent Polišenský''' (1915–2001) was a Czech academic historian and Latin Americanist. He is best known in the English-speaking world for his book ''Tragic Triangle: The Netherlands, Spain and Bohemia, 1617–1621'' (Prague, Charles University, 1991), a study of the international political context of the [[Bohemian Revolt]].

His earlier study of the Bohemian Revolt, ''The Thirty Years War'', was translated into English by [[Robert John Weston Evans|R.J.W. Evans]] and published in England by B. T. Batsford (1970) and in the U.S. by University of California Press (1971).

He also wrote a general history of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia in a 1947 book, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline''.

'''Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich''' (born '''Elisabeth Charlotte Henrich''' and identified in some sources simply as '''Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf''': 15 September 1901 - 16 June 1979) was a [[Germany|German]] novelist and historian of the [[ancient history|classical period]].&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/liselotte-welskopf-henrich|title=Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich  ...  deutsche Schriftstellerin, Althistorikerin, Fürsprecherin der Dakota 115.

At the age of 10 she wrote a long letter to the [[Francisco I. Madero|Mexican president]], urging him to proceed with greater humanity against [[Yaqui|Yaqui insurgents]].&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;

==Life==
Liselotte Henrich was born in [[Munich]], the child of Rudolf Henrich, a liberal-leaning lawyer, and his wife, born Marie Bernbeck.   In 1907 the family moved to [[Stuttgart]], where Liselotte first attended school, and in 1913 they relocated again, now to [[Berlin]].   At school she followed a humanist curriculum, passing her [[Abitur|school final exams (Abitur)]] in 1921 as a pupil at the [[:de:Rothenburgstraße (Berlin)#Auguste-Victoria-Lyzeum|Augusts-Victoria Lyceum]].   While still at school she decided to become a writer and historian.   As a child her leisure pursuits included [[mountaineering]] in [[the Alps]].&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;   On leaving school she studied [[Economics]], [[Ancient History]], [[Jurisprudence]] and [[Philosophy]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick-William University (as the "Humboldt" was then known)]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=ECWlautwww/&gt;   She received her doctorate in 1925 for a piece of work on the organisation of the international shoe trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Essence and Expertise: German Women Economists, 1890--1933, and the Shifting Ground of Social Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iMMdQCaQdoC&amp;pg=PA261| year=2006| publisher=ProQuest| isbn=978-0-542-79411-7|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''"cum magna laude"'' citation she received for her doctorate supported the urgings of one of her supervisors, [[Ulrich Wilcken]], that she should progress to a [[habilitation]] (higher academic qualification) which would have opened the conventional route to an academic career, but the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|inflation of the early 1920s]] had left the family finances in no position to support a further period of study.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;   Starting in 1925 she was employed as a statistician in the private sector, before switching to the public sector in 1928.   Her father died in 1926.&lt;ref name=RWBiog/&gt;   She worked in Berlin as a [[:de:Statistisches Reichsamt|government statistician]] between 1928 and 1945.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ&gt;{{cite web|url= http://leibnizsozietaet.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/08_jaehne.pdf|author=[[:de:Armin Jähne|Armin Jähne]]| pages=119–131| title=Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf (1901 – 1979). Gedanken zu ihrem 100. Geburtstag|publisher=Leibniz-Sozietät der Wissenschaften zu Berlin e.V.| accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 she began to participate in [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance activity]], which led her to the [[Confessing Church]].&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;   As the realities of the government mandated [[Shoah]] became apparent, she supported persecuted Jews and concentration camp inmates with food and medicaments.   One victim of Nazi persecution whom she was able to hide from the authorities in her Berlin apartment during 1944/45 was a [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] called {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Welskopf|de}}, whom she would later marry.&lt;ref name=RWBiog/&gt;   Although the precise nature and extent of her resistance activity remain unclear, some details are summarized in her novel "Jan und Jutta", published in 1953.&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;&lt;ref name=JuJ&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan und Jutta|author= Liselotte Welskopf Henrich|isbn= 978-3-354-00568-6| publisher= Mitteldeutscher Verlag; Auflage: 22. Auflage (1989)}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1944 she was interrogated by the [[Gestapo]] but not arrested.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;

[[Second World War|War]] ended in May 1945, leaving a large region surrounding Berlin [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation zone]].   She remained in what would later become known as [[East Berlin]].  Between May 1945 and July 1946 Welskopf-Henrich worked as a senior secretary with the city administration, based at Berlin-Charlottenburg.&lt;ref name=ECWlautwww/&gt;   In 1946/47 she took on a leadership position with "Baustoff-Ost GmbH", a building materials organisation.   Through the immediate postwar years much of her work was focused on questions involving economic planning.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;

In 1946 she joined the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party (KPD)]].   Sources indicate that this was probably a reaction to the nightmare of Nazi atrocities and the nightmare destruction and military take-over of Berlin involved in the [[Red army]] invasion, and not the result of some belated quasi-religious conversion to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;   Although she remained uncritical of party rule, in the words of one commentator she was in the first instance not so much a communist as a "friend of the people" (''"....in erster Linie nicht Kommunistin, vielmehr Menschenfreundin"'').&lt;ref name=AdlerBlutlautHR/&gt;   Her joining the Communist Party may also have been related to her marriage to [[:de:Rudolf Welskopf|Rudolf Welskopf]] whose (second) wife she became on 11 May 1946, and who had been a [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] member since 1930.&lt;ref name=RWBiog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welskopf-henrich.de/biografie_arw.htm|title=Kurzbiografie von Rudolf Welskopf (1902 - 1979)|work=110.

In April 1946, following the [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|contentious merger]] that resulted in the creation of the new [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"'' / SED)]], Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich was one of the hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet zone]] who lost no time in signing their party membership across to what rapidly developed to become the ruling party in a new kind of [[single party state|one-]][[German Democratic Republic|party dictatorship]].&lt;ref name=ECWlautwww/&gt;   Membership of the SED in 1946 reflected a widespread commitment to the construction of an antifascist democratic society in Germany, a society without exploitation, repression or race-based hatred, committed to social justice and peace.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;   At the time this went hand in hand with a life-long involvement with Marxism.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;   In order better to inform herself, around this time she voluntarily attended level 1 evening classes in Marxism-Leninism.&lt;ref name=LWHlautAJ/&gt;

The Welskopf-Henrich's son, Rudolf, was born in 1948.&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;

In 1949 Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich applied to join a scheduled course in [[Ancient History]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].   Despite her background as a government economist, she was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Schuller: Inhalte althistorischer Forschungen in der DDR, In: Isolde Stark (Hrsg.): Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf und die Alte Geschichte in der DDR. Beiträge der Konferenz vom 21. bis 23. November 2002 in Halle/Saale. Stuttgart, Franz Steiner Verlag 2005, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;   Between 1952 and 1960 she was employed as a research assistant at the Humboldt, and was mandated to supervise lectures.   She received hr [[habilitation]] in 1959 for work on the theme of Leisure as a Problem in the Lives and Thoughts of the Hellenes, from [[Homer]] to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=DieMusse&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Musse als Problem im Leben und Denken der Hellenen von Homer bis Aristoteles : (T. 1-3) |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34701115_Die_Musse_als_Problem_im_Leben_und_Denken_der_Hellenen_von_Homer_bis_Aristoteles_T_1-3|author=Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Intriguingly, the dissertation which she had originally intended to submit was rejected because of its poor quality.   It had been based on a collection  of quotations from Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on ancient history.   The rejected dissertation was nevertheless later published.&lt;ref name=Produktionsverhaeltnisse&gt;{{cite web|author=Welskopf, Elisabeth Charlotte|date= 1957|title=Die Produktionsverhältnisse im Alten Orient und in der griechisch-römischen Antike. |publisher=Berlin. Akademie-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is apparent from the rejected text that when she submitted it Welskopf-Heinrich had already moved on from a Stalinist standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Isolde Stark: Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf. Eine biographische Skizze, In: Dieselbe (Hrsg.): Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf und die Alte Geschichte in der DDR. Beiträge der Konferenz vom 21. bis 23. November 2002 in Halle/Saale. Stuttgart, Franz Steiner Verlag 2005, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;   Her son, writing much later in the foreword to an edition of "Bertholds neue Welt", another book of hers that was published only posthumously, identified the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]] as a turning point in his mother's ideological position, although her analytical mindset ensured that even before this she was unable to be as uncritical of Soviet-style state "socialism" as her husband.&lt;ref name="Welskopf-Henrich2015"/&gt;

In January 1960 the Humboldt gave her a lectureship and in October 1960 a professorship in Ancient History.   A year later she became the head of the Ancient History department at the Humboldt's General Historical Institute.&lt;ref name=ECWlautwww/&gt;   In June 1964 she became the first woman to be elected a full member of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=ECWlautwww/&gt;   In 1966 Welskopf formally retired.   She nevertheless retained charge of her university department till 1968 because her intended successor, Johannes Mathwich, had not yet received his anticipated doctorate.
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=45%|"You are dangerous because you are a journalist, even though you probably have endearing and valuable qualities as a private individual.  And I know very well that your [western] newspaper prefers to write about opposition figures when you write about East German writers.   I am not an opposition figure.   Of course I'm not a member of the "East German National Council" - an utterly fictitious rumour - any more than I'm a member of the [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala tribe]].

}}
After her retirement from the university Welskopf launched herself into a new project, which concerned the [[Polis|Greek "polis"]].   Her approach was probably unique.   It was structured neither as a conventional East German academic project, nor as a [[West Germany|West German]] equivalent.   Instead, she funded it herself and worked on it supported by 60 academics from both East and West Germany along with researchers from other countries.   The result was published in four volumes in 1974 as "Die Hellenistische Polis – Krise – Wandlung – Wirkung" (''"The Hellenistic Polis - Crisis - Transformation - Functioning"'').   She followed up with an even more ambitious project, classifying social classes in [[Ancient Greece]], using inputs by around 100 contributors from 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Welskopf-Henrich2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich (main text)|author2=Rudolf Welskopf (''foreword'')|title=Vorwort (foreword)|work=Bertholds neue Welt| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNKpBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6|date=19 January 2015|publisher=Palisander Verlag| isbn=978-3-95784-018-9|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This appeared posthumously in seven volumes between 1981 and 1985.

Welskopf-Henrich's academic standing meant that she was able to travel abroad.   Her son writes of regular family holiday trips to [[Hungary]] after 1956 and to Czechoslovakia after 1968.   As her books became more popular at home and her international reputation also grew she was even able to travel beyond the confines of [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet sponsored]] [[Soviet Empire|fraternal socialism]].   Between 1963 and 1974 Welskopf-Henrich undertook a succession of trips to the [[United States]] and to [[Canada]] in order to study the lives and traditions of the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|"Indians"]].&lt;ref name="Adam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: O-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA560|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-628-2|page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The scholarly care which enabled her to replace popular stereotypes with a more "human face" for the north American indigenous peoples led to her being honoured with the soubriquet "Lakota-Tashina" (literally: ''"protective cover of the Lakota"'').&lt;ref name=LWHlautUH/&gt;&lt;ref name=LWHlautDEZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1978/28/zu-kaffee-und-kuchen-bei-lakota-tashina/komplettansicht| title=Zu Kaffee und Kuchen bei Lakota-Tashina:  Ein Leben lang setzte sich Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich für die Indianer ein|author=Dieter E.

On 16 June 1979 Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich died suddenly in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], close to the mountains where she had spent her holidays as a child.   She was 77.   She had been predeceased by her husband earlier that year.   They are buried together in [[:de:Friedhof Adlershof|Berlin-Köpenick]].&lt;ref name=AdlerFriedhof&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adlershof.de/termin/event/detail/14/12/2014/bezirksbuergermeister-enthuellt-informationstafeln-fuer-ehrengraeber-in-adlershof/|title=Bezirksbürgermeister enthüllt Informationstafeln für Ehrengräber in Adlershof|date=14 December 2014|publisher=Roland Sillmann i.A.

=="Belletristic" Works==
Applying academic discipline, Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich's "North American Indian" novels were able to appeal to an intellectually minded readership by combining research based context with imagination driven plots, targeted in the first instance on younger readers.   She also composed the original filmscript for the 1966 film [[The Sons of Great Bear]], a film adaption of her six part novel [[:de:Die Söhne der Großen Bärin|Die Söhne der Großen Bärin (''"Sons of the Great Bear"'')]].  The [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] film, starring [[Gojko Mitić]], turned out to be the first in a long and successful series of films on the "North American Indian" theme.&lt;ref&gt;Berghahn, Daniela (2005). Hollywood Behind the Wall: The Cinema of East Germany. Manchester University Press. {{ISBN|9780719061721}}.  Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;   Her "North American Indian"  quintet "Das Blut des Adlers" (''"Blood of the Eagle"'') was also extremely popular in the German Democratic Republic.&lt;ref name=AdlerBlutlautHR/&gt;

Her novel "Zwei Freunde" (''"Two Friends"'') concerned the [[Weimar Republic]] and the early manifestations of [[Naziism]].  The book was actually written in 1943. "Jan und Jutta" was in most respects an autobiographical account of her own experiences (as "Jutta") and those of the man who later became her husband (as "Jan") during the final years of the [[Second World War]]. She intended to continue the series with her postwar work "Bertolds neue Welt" (''"Bertold's new world"''), but abandoned that idea.   She probably sensed that her critical perspective of developments in the German Democratic Republic would make such books unsuitable for publication.   "Bertolds neue Welt" was eventually published only in 2015.&lt;ref name="Welskopf-Henrich2015"/&gt;

In 1954 her story "Der Bergführer" (''"The Mountain Guide"'') was published in [[Leipzig]] by [[:de:Mitteldeutscher Verlag|Mitteldeutscher Verlag]]. It concerned Karl Unteregger, a young mountain guide working in the [[Dolomites]] in 1939.  The narrative deals with nazism but also captures the dramatic mountain landscape. Its publication scheduled for 1950, the story had to be changed for political reasons, which led to historical discrepancies. The book met with little success at the time, and it was only in 2015 that it was reissued, now faithful to the original manuscript.&lt;ref name=KaUnlautLWH&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Bergführer |author=Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich|publisher=Palisander Verlag| date=September 2015| isbn=978-3-938-30594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Lycurgeia''''' ({{lang-grc|Λυκούργεια}}, ''Lykoúrgeia'') is a lost [[tetralogy]] by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[Theatre of ancient Greece|dramatist]] [[Aeschylus]] that concerned [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Lycurgus of Thrace|Lycurgus]]' conflict with [[Dionysus]] and its aftermath. The four plays that made up the ''Lycurgeia'' survive only in fragments quoted by ancient authors, and the reconstruction of much of their content is a matter of conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;The following synopsis largely follows Gantz (1980) 140&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the '''''[[Edoni]]''''' ({{lang|grc|Ἠδωνοί}}, ''Ēdōnoí''), Dionysus presumably arrived in [[Thrace]] where King Lycurgus attempted to suppress the worship of the new god. The second play, the '''''[[Maenad|Bassarids]]''''' ({{lang|grc|Βασσαρίδες}}, ''Bassarídes''), is supposed to have treated the death of [[Orpheus]] at the hands of Thracian women in the thrall of Dionysus. Very little is known of the third play, the '''''Youths''''' ({{lang|grc|Νεανισκοί}}, ''Neaniskoí''), but [[M.L. West]] has proposed that it culminated in the acceptance of the cult of Dionysus in Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;West (1990) 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[satyr play]] was named '''''Lycurgus''''' ({{lang|grc|Λυκοῦργος}}, ''Lykoûrgos'') after the king, and might have presented his attempt to domesticate the satyrs, civilizing their bestial nature and forcing them to perform at his feasts in "honour not of Dionysus, but of himself and [[Ares]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein (2009) 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Freund''' (1902-1972) was German historian and Professor at the University of Kiel.

Freund's view was that [[Louis Napoleon]] was the only real revolutionist in 1848. Freund wrote, "After the solemn republican respectablity of 1848 it seemed that only with the Napoleonic experiment did a great [[revolutionary]] [[élan]] appear on the stage of history".&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsche Zeitschrift'', pg 181-183.&lt;/ref&gt; "The state created by Napoleon was anti-socialist, but it was not the [[laissez-faire]] state of capitalism.  The social ideals of the disciples of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] were given by Napoleon, for the first time, a military and authoritarian aspect."&lt;ref&gt;''Liberalism and the Challenge of Fascism, Social Forces in England and France (1815-1870)'', [[J. Salwyn Schapiro]], McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., NY, 1949. pg 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monmu period'''  is a [[chronology|chronological]] timeframe during the [[Asuka period]] of Japanese history. The Mommu period describes a span of years which were considered to have begun in the 1357th year of the Yamato dynasty.&lt;ref name="murray402"&gt;Murray, David. (1894). {{Google books|ez0qAAAAYAAJ|''The Story of Japan,'' p. 402|page=402}}, citing William Bramsen. (1880). {{Google books|9jKgVty_XFoC|''Japanese Chronological Tables'', pp. 54–55|page=54}}; compare, the Japanese [[National Diet Library]] website explains that [http://www.ndl.go.jp/koyomi/e/ "Japan organized its first calendar in the 12th year of Suiko (604)"], which was a pre-''nengō'' time frame.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[periodization]] is consistent with the traditional dates asserted for the reign of [[Emperor Monmu]], from 697 through 707.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, {{Google books|ez0qAAAAYAAJ| p. 402|page=402}}; the system of counting from year-periods (nengō) do not ordinarily overlap with the reigns of the early monarchs; and generally, a new one was chosen whenever it was deemed necessary to commemorate an auspicious or ward off a malign event.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periodization==
The adoption of the [[Sexagenary cycle]] calendar (''Jikkan Jūnishi'') in Japan is attributed to [[Empress Suiko]] in 604;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Jikkan Jūnishi''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 420|page=420}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this Chinese calendar continued in use throughout the Mommu period.

In 645, the system of {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]s|年号,|''nengō'',|lit. "year name"}} was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', p. 30.|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the reign of [[Emperor Kōtoku]], this method of segmenting [[time]] was temporarily abandoned or allowed to lapse.  This interval continued during the Monmu period.

Neither Empress Mommu's reign nor the Monmu periodization are included in the list of ''nengō'' for this explicit duration of [[time]], which comes after [[Suchō]] and before [[Taihō (era)|Taihō]].

In the post-Taika or pre-Taihō chronology, the first year of Emperor Monmu's reign (文武天皇元年 or 文武統皇1年) is also construed as the first year of the Mommu period (文武1年).&lt;ref name="tsuchihashi16"&gt;Tsuchihashi, Paul. (1952). [https://books.google.com/books?ei=7QY6TbbKOYT58AaIpuTaCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=0HfrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Tsuchihashi+paul&amp;q=saimei#search_anchor  ''Japanese Chronological Tables from 601 to 1872'', p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-nengō period==
Non-nengō periods in the pre-Taihō calendar were published in 1880 by [[William Bramsen]].&lt;ref name="murray402"/&gt; These were refined in 1952 by [[Paul Tsuchihashi]] in ''Japanese Chronological Tables from 601 to 1872.''&lt;ref name="tsuchihashi16"/&gt;

The pre-Tahiō calendar included two non-nengō gaps or [[Interval (time)|intervals]] in the chronological series:
:*[[Taika (era)|Taika]], August 645&amp;ndash;February 650.&lt;ref name="nussbaum924"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Taika''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC| p. 924.|page=924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Hakuchi (era)|Hakuchi]], February 650&amp;ndash;December 654.&lt;ref name="nussbaum280"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Hakuchi''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 280|page=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:**Non-nengō dating systems
:*[[Shuchō]], July&amp;ndash;September 686.&lt;ref name="nussbaum889"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Shuchō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC| p. 889|page=889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:**Non-nengō dating systems
:*[[Taihō (era)|Taihō]], March 701&amp;ndash;May 704.&lt;ref name="nussbaum924"&gt;Nussbaum, "''Taihō''" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 924|page=924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nengō were not promulgated (or were allowed to lapse) during the gap years between Hakuchi and Shuchō, and in another gap between Shuchō and Taihō.

'''Nikolai Aleksandrovich Baskakov''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Алекса́ндрович Баска́ков}}; 1905-1995) was a Russian Turkologist, linguist, and ethnologist. He created a systematization model of the Turkic language family (Baskakov's classification), and studied Turkic-Russian contacts in the 10-11th centuries CE. During 64 years of scientific work (1930-1994), Baskakov published almost 640 works including 32 books. The main area of Baskakov's scientific interests was linguistics, but he also studied folklore and ethnography of the Turkic peoples, and also was a musician and composer.

==Life==
Baskakov was born in 1905 in [[Solvychegodsk]] in [[Vologda Governorate]] (now [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]) in a large family of a district government official. His father came from a family banished in the beginning of the 19th century from [[Saint Petersburg]] to the [[Vologda]] province, and mother was a daughter of an official and a teacher. In a book about Russian surnames of Turkic origin (1979) Baskakov gives the following comment about his surname:  "Surname ''Baskakov'' comes from a Tatar [[baskak]], Amragan (*Amyr-khan), a viceroy in the second half of the 13th century in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. The Turkic origin of this surname is confirmed by the very root of the surname ''basqaq'' "the one who puts seal, a viceroy of the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]]", and by the heraldic data: a curved sword in the center and an image of a Tatar over the crest who is holding a red curved saber" (p.&amp;nbsp;245).

As a young student, in 1916, Baskakov met an old friend of his father's, Bessonov, a Russian [[dragoman]] or envoy to [[Jedda]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The Russian diplomat's stories about eastern countries affected young Baskakov's imagination. He took a great interest in the East, and Turkey in particular. He began reading about Turkey and even tried to study the Turkish language by himself. In N.Baskakov's words, "This pursuit probably affected choice of my speciality - Turkology, which my father later named "missionary work", or maybe my speciality was prompted by the genes of my ancestors, Turks or Mongols?".

In 1918, when Baskakov was attending the gymnasium in the town [[Gryazov]], he took part in a piano class at Gryazov's musical school. From that time music accompanied him throughout his life. Post-revolutionary shocks of 1920s immediately tested the vicissitudes of life, from 1919 to 1922. While studying in a unified labor school reorganized from his gymnasium, N.Baskakov worked as an ordinary clerk, and as a draftsman in the public health department. In 1922 N.Baskakov graduated from high school and went to Gryazov pedagogical school, but the aspirations to become an [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] did not leave him.

In 1923 Baskakov came to [[Moscow]] to enter the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]]. He naively entered in a questionnaire that he sympathized with "[[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarchists-collectivists]]" group that had just joined [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)]], and on the first interview was refused admittance. After that, without hesitation, he turned to a private Institute of the Word headed by [[Musin-Pushkin]], now a Linguistics Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. But unable to meet the payments, he had to leave Moscow and to return to Vologda, to work in pedagogical school. At the start of 1924 Baskakov was dismissed first from his pedagogical school, and then from Vologda pedagogical school, for participation in an anti-religious dispute where he advocated that God is good, and the Satan is evil, and that God always wins, and that people need religion.

Baskakov fled to [[Ukraine]], near [[Cherkassy]], and earned living as a tutor. In 1924, Baskakov went to [[Leningrad]] and attempted to enter the Oriental Institute, but failed again. A third attempt was a success, Baskakov was accepted to the [[San-Gali]] State Institute of People's Education. San-Gali State Institute was a two-year educational institution that was preparing teachers for high school. A number of prominent "former people" found shelter there.

In 1925, Baskakov was admitted to the Moscow State University Ethnographic branch of the Historical  Ethnological faculty. During his study Baskakov traveled to [[Karakalpak ASSR]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kirgizia]] and [[Khwarezm|Khorezm]] area of [[Uzbekistan]] to gather material on [[Uyghur language|Uigurs]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kirghiz]] and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] languages, ethnography, language and folklore of [[Karakalpaks]] and  [[Khwarezm|Khorezm]] [[Uzbeks]]. His instructors were [[A.N. Maksimov]], P.F. Preobrajensky, V.K. Trutovsky, M.N. Peterson, V.A. Gordlevsky, folklore also the literature, N.K. Dmitriev, and [[Vasily Bartold]] lectured on history of [[Central Asia]] and [[Zhetysu|Jeti-su]] Türks.

In 1929 Baskakov graduated from the University with a degree in history, archeology, ethnography, languages, folklore and literature of Türkic  peoples. Baskakov was retained by the faculty of Turkic philology, with additional duties at the Central Ethnographical Museum, and continued expeditions to the [[Karakalpak ASSR]], and [[Khwarezm|Khorezm]]. In 1930, Baskakov was sent to  Karakalpak ASSR regional department of national education to chair a committee to institute a transitional [[Latin alphabet]] for the Karakalpak people, to substitute for their traditional [[Arabic]] alphabet. In 1930-1931, Baskakov helped to organize the Karakalpak Regional Museum and a Scientific Institute.

In 1931, Baskakov returned to Moscow and joined Linguistic Commission of Research Association for National (ethnic) and Colonial problems at the Communist University of Eastern Workers (CUEW), and became a docent of CUEW. In 1934 Baskakov was appointed to the [[Russian SFSR]] Central Committee of New Alphabet (CCNA) and sent to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kirgizia]] and [[Altay people|Oirot]] (present [[Altai Mountains|Mountain Altai]]) to study problems of "language construction" in the native schools. N.Baskakov was sent to all territories populated by [[Nogais]] ([[Astrakhan]], [[Dagestan ASSR]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimea ASSR]]) with an aim to "create" a "Nogai literary language" with a new quasi-Cyrillic alphabet.

In 1936, Baskakov became a docent of Uigur language faculty in the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]], later a Language and Literacy Institute of USSR peoples. In 1938, as a reward for his publications, Baskakov became a PhD in Philology without writing a thesis dissertation. In 1939-1940, Baskakov worked on country-wide transitioning of the Türkic peoples from the Arabic to a slew of quasi-Cyrillic alphabets, visiting Kazan, Ufa, Tashkent and Alma-Ata. During World War II, Baskakov was sent to [[Altay people|Oirot]] ([[Altaians]]). Living in Altai enabled Baskakov to collect rich material on dialects and folklore of Altaians across their land. In 1943, Baskakov returned to Moscow to work in [[Nicholas Marr|N. Ya. Marr]] Institute of Language and Thinking of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In that institution, under its many different names, Baskakov worked for almost 50 years. He visited Lithuania, Northern Caucasus, Turkmenia and Khakassia helping to establish new scientific institutions. In 1950, Baskakov wrote a dissertation themed "Karakalpak language. Parts of speech and word-formation" for the Doctor of Philology degree. In 1989, Baskakov retired from active work, but continued voluntary work, and remained a chief scientist in the Karakalpak branch of the Uzbek SSR Academy of Sciences.

Baskakov was an honorary member of the Great Britain Royal Asian society, Turkish linguistic society, International Uralo-Altai society (Hamburg), Scientific organization of Polish Orientalists, Scientific organization of Hungarian Orientalists Kereshi-Choma, a corresponding member of Finno-Ugric society (Helsinki).

==Scientific contribution==
Retirement allowed Baskakov to work on collected material and publications. Before the beginning of the 20th century, few Türkic languages were studied and reflected in dictionaries and grammar books, without which was impossible to teach languages or conduct constructive research. Baskakov actively joined in creation of lexicographical and grammatical works for poorly studied and totally unknown major Türkic languages.

Studying a number of Türkic languages simultaneously, Baskakov evaluated the degree of their genetic affinity, and learned the principles of Türkic typology, which eventually resulted in creation of a synthesizing concept, a new classification of Türkic languages. First published in 1952, the Baskakov taxonomical classification, unlike the previous classifications built on limited number of linguistic attributes, accounted for grammatical system and lexical structure of the Türkic languages as a whole, coordinating formation of separate language groups with the history of their peoples.

Baskakov's classification of Türkic languages was published twice as a textbook ''Introduction to study of Türkic languages'' (1962 and 1969), and is well known to the Türkologists of the world. Baskakov's classification remains the only classification built with understanding of the history of the Türkic peoples known at the time.

From the end of the 1970s Baskakov developed a typological model of the grammatical system of Türkic  languages. Baskakov developed a complete concept of Türkic language type, described in three monographs, "Historical structural typology of Türkic languages" (1975), "Historical typological morphology of Türkic languages" (1979), and "Historical typological phonology of Türkic languages" (1988). Baskakov's concept recognized isomorphism of all language levels, from the top syntax level.
 
From the end of the 1970s, Baskakov developed a typological model of the grammatical system of Türkic languages. Baskakov's concept on the most ancient typological structure of Türkic languages found "hypothetically initial pre-agglutinative form of Türkic, where abstract grammatical constructions were formed from main roots in postposition, and were gradually transformed to analytical elements, and then to affixes of the synthetic form".

Even though typologically the languages of the Altai family are related, their genetic relationship is contested. Baskakov advocated a genetic relationship of Türkic, Mongolian, Tunguso-Manchurian, Korean and Japanese languages.

==Major publications==
By the end of the 1930s, Baskakov published works on [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Uyghur language|Uigur]] and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] languages. Baskakov participated in creation of the first bilingual Türkic-Russian and Russian-Türkic dictionaries for Uigur (1939), [[Altay language|Altay]] (1947), and [[Khakas language|Khakass]] (1953), and headed the creation of  Russian-Uigur (1941), Nogai-Russian (1963), Russian-Altai (1964), Russian-Karakalpak (1967) and Turkmen-Russian (1968) dictionaries. Baskakov participated in creation of first trilingual dictionaries for Türkic languages, [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]]-Russian-Moldavian (1973), [[Karaim language|Karaim]]-Russian-Polish (1974). Publication of trilingual dictionaries was preceded by two his publications that established main principles of composing trilingual dictionaries (1968, 1971). The Uigur, Altai, Khakass, and Nogai dictionaries had brief grammatical descriptions of the languages.

Baskakov's first description of grammar in Türkic languages was published in "Brief grammar of Karkalpak language" ([[Turtkul]], 1932). It was continued in subsequent works "Nogai language and its dialects" (1940) and "Karakalpak language, vol. 2. Phonetics and morphology" (1952). Baskakov continues traditions of Türkic  grammar represented in popular Altai grammar and in grammatical works of [[P.L. Melioransky]] and [[V.L. Gordlevsky]]. Baskakov published dialectal material, a series "Northern dialects of Altai (Oirot) language" in three parts, "Dialect of taiga Tatars (Tuba-Kiji)" (1966), "Dialect of Kumandy-kiji" (1972), "Dialect of Kuu Tatars-Chelkans (Kuu-kiji)" (1985) (''Türkic''  "kiji" = "people", a frequent ethnonym-forming suffix). The descriptions have shown full linguistic independence of these little-known languages.

Baskakov wrote a series of historical etymological works about the names of the Türkic peoples and tribes (Kypchaks, Kirghizes, Bashkirs, Kumans, Badjanks, Tuvinians, Khakases), edited epic publications of Türkic peoples (Altai heroic epos "Madai-kara", Khakass heroic epos "Altyn-Aryg"). In 1991, Baskakov composed the national hymn of the republic Karakalpakistan and hymn of Mountain Altai republic.

==Linguistical controversies==
In the 1990s, after the fall of the former USSR and the opening of communication channels from it to the world, there surfaced criticism from the Turkish scholars, who advocated existence of only three languages inside Türkic family: [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] and [[Sakha language|Sakha]] (Yakut), while the others are not languages, but dialects with very close affinity, artificially divided and segregated into languages, splitting the uniform Türkic world. Baskakov's position was that the Türkic world is not divided, but consists of living languages that develop into independent vernaculars. At the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of Türkic peoples had their individuality, in addition to the territory each ethnos had its history, consciousness and self-name, culture, folklore, and language, some peoples had their own literary form, with rich old tradition of literature, and a system of their subordinated dialects, and the affinity among them is not dialectal, but linguistical.

The process of separation of Türkic languages also continues now in different conditions, in 1978 was introduced literacy at [[Dolgans]], in 1989 introduced at [[Tofalars]], [[Siberian Tatars]] are on the way to introduce their literacy. Each people resolves this subject for themselves. In these conditions the existing peoples and languages of Türkic family should be carefully preserved as rare gifts of the nature, and should be given full opportunity to develop, while Turkish language, the largest language of the Türkic family with immense literature and long history, can be used as a language of interethnic dialogue.

The '''North East Film Archive''' (NEFA) is a not-for-profit organisation which exists to collect, preserve and provide access to [[film]], [[television]] and other moving image material related to the history of a region of [[England]], which is defined as the [[Tees Valley]] area and the counties of [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Tyne and Wear]]. Since July 2012 the archive merged with The YFA(Yorkshire Film Archive), a registered charity (no. 1093468), and now comes under the YFA Banner and charity, Hence the name change to NEFA.

==History and overview==
The NEFA was founded in January 1998 as an unofficial consortium of four bodies which already held substantial [[film]] and [[television]] collections within the region: what was then the University of Teesside (now [[Teesside University]]), [http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/ Tyne and Wear Archives Service] (TWAS, the [[county record office]] for [[Tyne and Wear]]), Trade Films (see below) and [http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/archives/ Cumbria Archives Service] (the county record office for [[Cumbria]]).  Initial funding was provided by Northern Arts (what was then the [[UK Government]]'s regional agency for distributing public arts funding in the north-east of England), and the organisation began life with a full-time [[curator]] and a part-time [[archivist]].  In 2001, responsibility for distributing core funding to the English regional [[film archive]]s passed from Northern Arts to the newly formed [[UK Film Council]]'s [[Regional screen agencies|regional agency]], [http://www.northernmedia.org/ Northern Film and Media].  A temperature and humidity controlled vault facility was built for the NEFA on the Teesside campus during 2003, and was formally opened the following year.  In December 2003, NRFTA Ltd. was formed as a [[company limited by guarantee]] (no. 04994213), thus making the archive an independent legal entity.  In February 2006, responsibility for providing a moving image archive service to [[Cumbria]] passed from the NRFTA to the [http://www.nwfa.mmu.ac.uk/ North West Film Archive].  As of February 2010 the NEFA has a staff of two (one full-time and one part-time), both of whom are based at [[Teesside University]].  The NEFA is one of a network of eight regional film archives in [[England]].  It is an 'emerging archive' member institution of the [http://www.bufvc.ac.uk.faf/ UK Film Archive Forum].In July 2012, NEFA merged with the Yorkshire Film Archive (YFA), a registered charity (no. 1093468), and now comes under the YFA banner and charity. Together,they have a growing collection currently containing over 50,000 titles - 17,000 held by YFA, and 33,000 held by NEFA - ranging from films made by the early film pioneers of the late 1890s, to recent footage of changing landscapes and life across both regions.

==Current operations==
The NEFA is based at [[Teesside University]] in [[Middlesbrough]], where most of the collection is stored.  Limited storage facilities are also operated at [http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/ Tyne and Wear Archives Service] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] as well, but all work on the collection now takes place at Teesside.  Viewing facilities for members of the public are available at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], but [[Film preservation|preservation]] and cataloguing work no longer takes place there.  As with any archive, the NEFA undertakes three core activities.

* '''Acquisition'''.  There is no system of [[legal deposit]] for audiovisual media in the UK, and so moving image archives have to identify appropriate materials for preservation and persuade their owners to deposit them.
* '''[[Film preservation|Preservation]]'''.  [[Film]], [[magnetic tape]] and [[Optical disc|digital optical media]] are among the most technically complex of any archival medium to preserve for the long-term.  NEFA staff carry out this task through a combination of preserving original media and copying where this is necessary to prevent the loss of content.
* '''Access'''.  This includes dealing with viewing requests from individual researchers, organising public screenings and licensing material to [[film]] and [[Television|TV]] programme makers, and for online use.  Access work can also involve negotiating [[copyright]] clearance and overcoming technical issues needed to provide high-quality access copies.

The NEFA is funded from a combination of sources, including public money, revenue from commercial footage licensing to broadcasters (all other paid-for services are charged on a cost-covering basis) and 'in kind' contributions from its constituent organisations, principally [[Teesside University]] and [http://tyneandweararchives.org.uk/ Tyne and Wear Archives Service].  The NEFA's work is overseen by a [[board of directors]], and its permanent staff are all employees of [[Teesside University]].

==The collection==
The collection policies of the English regional film archives are all broadly similar.  They do not collect fictional feature films or TV programmes produced outside their regions and/or intended for network broadcast: this is the responsibility of the [[National Film and Television Archive]].  The NEFA's collection consists mainly of regional TV news and regionally produced network output, industrial, promotional, educational and advertising films, and amateur film and video.  Among its major collections are:

* [[BBC]] regional news filmed location reports for the north-east and [[Cumbria]], covering 1957-1991.
* News, drama and documentary material produced by [[Tyne Tees Television]], from 1956 to the mid-1990s.
* The complete output of Turners, a Newcastle-based production unit which made industrial and educational films from 1947-1995.
* The complete output of Trade Films, a Newcastle-based production unit which made campaigning films and videos for the trade union movement between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s.
* The film and video collection of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI), produced by its corporate production unit based at the chemical works in [[Billingham]], covering 1935-1992.
* A collection of training and [[public information film]]s made by the [[Durham Constabulary|Durham Police Constabulary]].
* A collection of amateur film and video dating from 1928 to the present day.

==NEFA Curators==

* December 2000 to 27 May 2001: Position vacant
* 28 May 2001 to 18 November 2006: Leo Enticknap

{{Forms of government}}

'''Ochlocracy''' ({{lang-el|ὀχλοκρατία|translit=okhlokratía}};  {{lang-la|ochlocratia}}) or '''mob rule''' is the rule of [[government]] by mob or a mass of people, or, the [[intimidation]] of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for [[majoritarianism]], it is akin to the {{lang-la|'''mobile vulgus'''|label=[[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]]}} meaning "the fickle [[crowd]]", from which the English term "mob" originally was derived in the [[Glorious Revolution|1680s]].

Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term "[[wikt:mobocracy|mobocracy]]", which arose in the 18th century as a colloquial neologism.

Ochlocracy, or mob rule, is often incorrectly equated with [[tyranny of the majority]]; however, ochlocracy involves illegal action and does not necessitate a majority and usually consists of a minority.

== Terminology ==
[[Polybius]] appears to have coined the term in his 2nd century BC work ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' (6.4.6).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it to name the "pathological" version of popular rule—in opposition to the good version, which he refers to as democracy. There are numerous mentions of the word "ochlos" in the [[Talmud]] (where "ochlos" refers to anything from "mob", "populace", to "armed guard"), as well as in [[Rashi]], a Jewish commentary on the Bible. The word is recorded in English since 1584, derived from the [[French language|French]] ''ochlocratie'' (1568), which stems from the original Greek ''okhlokratia'', from ''okhlos'' ("mob") and ''kratos'' (meaning "rule, power, strength").

Ancient Greek political thinkers regarded ochlocracy as one of the three "bad" forms of government ([[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and ochlocracy) as opposed to the three "good" forms of government ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[democracy]]). They distinguished "good" and "bad" according to whether the government form would act in the interest of the whole community ("good") or in the exclusive interests of a group or individual at the expense of justice ("bad").

This (Polybian) terminology for forms of state in ancient Greek philosophy has become customary. [[Aristotle]] termed democracy as "[[politeia|polity]]" (sometimes translated as "[[republic]]", which confusingly is used by other Aristotle-translators for "[[aristocracy]]", instead) while giving the name of "democracy" to ochlocracy.

An '''ochlocrat''' is one who is an advocate or partisan of ochlocracy. It also may be used as an adjective ('''ochlocratic''' or '''ochlocratical''').

The threat of "mob rule" to a [[democracy]] is restrained by ensuring that the [[rule of law]] protects [[minority group|minorities]] or individuals against short-term [[demagoguery]] or [[moral panic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesús Padilla Gálvez]], Democracy in Times of Ochlocracy, Synthesis philosophica, Vol. 32 No.1, 2017, pp. 167-178.{{cite web |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/190389 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224042438/http://hrcak.srce.hr/190389 |archivedate=2017-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although considering how laws in a democracy are established or repealed by the majority, the protection of minorities by rule of law is questionable. Some authors, like Bosnian political theoretician Hasanović, connect the emergence of ochlocracy in democratic societies with the decadence of democracy in neoliberalism where "the democratic role of the people has been reduced mainly to the electoral process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/26803846/Ochlocracy_in_the_Practices_of_Civil_Society_A_Threat_for_Democracy|title=Ochlocracy in the Practices of Civil Society: A Threat for Democracy?|first=Jasmin|last=Hasanović|date=|journal=Studia Juridica et Politica Jaurinensis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515004503/http://www.academia.edu/26803846/Ochlocracy_in_the_Practices_of_Civil_Society_A_Threat_for_Democracy|archivedate=2018-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
[[Anarchism]], meaning "without rulers", is a term covering various anti-authoritarian philosophies and movements which are [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-anarchy-a-definition|title=Anarchy: A Definition|author=|date=|website=theanarchistlibrary.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219150630/https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-anarchy-a-definition|archivedate=2018-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/anarchist-faq/a-1-4-83ba7fe75e15|title=Are anarchists socialists?|first=An Anarchist|last=FAQ|date=24 February 2016|website=medium.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219150501/https://medium.com/anarchist-faq/a-1-4-83ba7fe75e15|archivedate=19 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are dedicated to the replacement of [[State (polity)|states]] and/or [[governments]] (either [[capitalist]] governments or all governments) by various suggested alternatives such as [[autonomous]] self-realizing [[direct democracy|direct-democratic]] structures. Anarchism is not ochlocratic but to the contrary includes theories of structure and mutual support rooted in [[direct democracy]] and [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]].

==Mobs in history==
Historians{{Who|date=January 2012}} often comment on mob rule as a factor in the [[rise of Rome]] and its maintenance,{{Dubious|date=January 2012}} as the city of [[Rome]] itself was large—between 100,000 and 250,000 citizens—while the [[aristocracy]] and even [[military]] was very small by comparison to the citizenry.{{Vague|date=January 2012}} Lapses in this control often led to loss of official power (and often enough, the lives of the officials)—most notably in the reign of [[Commodus]] when [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander|Cleander]] unwisely used the [[Praetorian Guard]] against a mob which had come to call for his head. As historian [[Edward Gibbon]] relates it:

{{quotation|The people...demanded with angry clamors the head of the public enemy. Cleander, who commanded the Praetorian Guards, ordered a body of [[cavalry]] to sally forth and disperse the seditious multitude. The multitude fled with precipitation towards the city; several were slain, and many more were trampled to death; but when the cavalry entered the streets their pursuit was checked by a shower of stones and darts from the roofs and windows of the houses. The footguards, who had long been jealous of the prerogatives and insolence of the Praetorian cavalry, embraced the party of the people. The tumult became a regular engagement and threatened a general massacre. The Praetorians at length gave way, oppressed with numbers; and the tide of popular fury returned with redoubled violence against the gates of the palace, where Commodus lay dissolved in luxury, and alone unconscious of the [[civil war]]...Commodus started from his dream of pleasure and commanded that the head of Cleander should be thrown out to the people. The desired spectacle instantly appeased the tumult...&lt;ref name=Gibbon&gt;

This followed a previous incident in which the [[List of Roman legions|legions of Britain]] had demanded and received the death of [[Tigidius Perennis|Perennis]], the prior administrator. The mob thus realized that it had every chance of success.

The [[Salem Witch Trials]] in [[Province of Massachusetts|colonial Massachusetts]] during the 1690s, in which the unified belief of the townspeople overpowered the logic of the law, also has been cited as an example of mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/mobrule.htm|title=Mob Rule and Violence in American Culture|author=|date=|website=colorado.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221030848/http://amath.colorado.edu/carnegie/lit/lynch/mobrule.htm|archivedate=2010-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837 [[Abraham Lincoln]] wrote about [[lynching]] and "the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country—the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.classicreader.com/book/3237/12/ Opposition to Mob-Rule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109025333/http://www.classicreader.com/book/3237/12/ |date=2009-01-09 }}", ''The Writings of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mob violence played a prominent role in the early history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arrington |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Bitton |first2=Davis |authorlink1=Leonard J.

'''Padmavathy Bandopadhyay''' (born 4 November 1944) is the first woman [[Air Marshal]] of the [[Indian Air Force]]. She is the second woman in the Indian armed forces to be promoted to a [[three-star rank]].

==Early Life==
Bandopadhyay was born in 1944 at [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Her mother was bedridden with tuberculosis, and Padma ended up being her primary caregiver at the age of 4-5 years. In addition, her neighbor in the [[Gole Market]] neighborhood in New Delhi was [[S._I._Padmavati|Dr S.I. Padmavati]], Professor of Medicine at [[Lady Hardinge Medical College]]. She has said that her experience with her mother’s illness and hospitalization at [[Safdarjung Hospital]] and having a neighboring lady doctor with the same name as her were early motivations to become a doctor.&lt;ref name="memoirs"&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Lady-Blue-memoirs-First-Marshal-ebook/dp/B078K451F9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
She studied at [[Delhi_Tamil_Education_Association_Senior_Secondary_Schools | DTEA]] in the Humanities stream. After graduating from school, she made the difficult and uncommon transition from Humanities to Science stream in Delhi University. She studied [[Pre-medical]] at [[Kirori Mal College]] and then joined [[Armed Forces Medical College, Pune]] in 1963.

==Career==
She joined the [[Indian Air Force|IAF]] in 1968. She married S. N. Bandopadhyay, a fellow air force officer &lt;ref name="tejasvini"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rETtLRO4z8o&lt;/ref&gt;. She was awarded the [[Vishisht Seva Medal]] (VSM) &lt;ref name="bharat-rakshak"&gt;http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Database/11528&lt;/ref&gt; for her conduct during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Sati Nath and Padma were the first IAF couple to receive a Presidents award in the same investiture parade &lt;ref name="limca-records"&gt; https://books.google.com/books?id=-MxaDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT252&amp;dq=first%20VSM%20couple&amp;pg=PT252#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20VSM%20couple&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;.

In her career she has been first woman to become a Fellow of the Aerospace Medical Society of India and the first Indian woman to have conducted scientific research at the North Pole &lt;ref name="anusanshan"&gt;http://www.anusandhan.net/women/suc_padma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. She is also the first woman Armed Forces officer to have completed the Defence Service Staff College course in 1978 &lt;ref name"betterindia"&gt;https://www.thebetterindia.com/83280/brave-women-soldiers-indian-armed-forces/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''[[Pakistan]]'s role in the [[War on Terror]]''' is a widely discussed topic among [[policy-makers]] of various countries, political analysts and international [[delegate]]s around the world.

At least 60,000 people have been killed in Pakistan due to terror attacks since the beginning of the war on terror, while the economic losses have been measured at $120 billion. Since 2001, the country has also hosted millions of [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan refugees]] who fled the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-27/trump-s-afghan-strategy-poised-to-fail-pakistan-s-premier-says|title=Trump Afghan Strategy Poised to Fail, Pakistan Premier Says|work=Bloomberg|first=Ismail|last=Dilawar|first2=Faseeh|last2=Mangi|date=28 August 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://san-pips.com/index.php?action=ra&amp;id=pvt_list_1 |title=Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), Independent Think Tank in Pakistan |publisher=San-pips.com |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major developments==

The [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] born [[Abu Zubaydah|Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah]], was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S. and Pakistan raids during the week of 23 March 2002. During the raid, the suspect was shot three times while trying to escape capture by military personnel. Zubaydah is said to be a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/04/01/pakistan.alqaeda/ |title=Officials: Captured man says he's al Qaeda brass |publisher=CNN |date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year on 11 September 2002, [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] was arrested in Pakistan after a three-hour gunfight with police forces. Bin al-Shibh is known to have shared a room with [[Mohamed Atta]] in Hamburg, Germany and to be a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations.

It is said bin al-Shibh was supposed to be another hijacker, however the [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] rejected his visa application three times, leaving him to the role of financier. The trail of money transferred by bin al-Shibh from Germany to the United States links both Mohammad Atta and [[Zacarias Moussaoui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/09/14/36623.html |title=Financier of 9/11 attacks arrested |publisher=English.pravda.ru |date=15 April 2002 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2003, [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]] was arrested during [[CIA]]-led raids on the suburb of [[Rawalpindi]], nine miles outside of the Pakistani capital of [[Islamabad]]. Mohammed at the time of his capture was the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Warren Richey |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0505/Did-harsh-interrogation-tactics-help-US-find-Osama-bin-Laden |title=Did harsh interrogation tactics help US find Osama bin Laden? |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpasban.com/pakistans-role-in-the-war-on-terror/ |title=Pakistan's role in the War on Terror « Pakpasban |publisher=Pakpasban.com |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed having escaped capture the week before during a previous raid, the Pakistani government was able to use information gathered from other suspects captured to locate and detain him. Mohammed was indicted in 1996 by the United States government for links to the [[Oplan Bojinka]], a plot to bomb a series of U.S. civilian airliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=129838&amp;page=1 |title=Qatari Royal Family Linked to Al Qaeda – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other events Mohammed has been linked to include: ordering the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter [[Daniel Pearl]], the [[USS Cole bombing]], [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]]'s attempt to blow up a civilian airliner with a shoe bomb, and the terrorist attack at the [[Ghriba synagogue bombing|El Ghriba synagogue]] in [[Djerba]], Tunisia. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has described himself as the head of the al-Qaeda military committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/ |title=Top al Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan |publisher=CNN |date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst all this, in 2006, Pakistan was accused by NATO commanding officers of aiding and abetting the Taliban in Afghanistan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/3231 |title=NATO faces defeat in Afghanistan |publisher=Asiantribune.com |date=16 November 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but NATO later admitted that there was no known evidence against the ISI or Pakistani government of sponsoring terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/11/stories/2006101107441600.htm|title=No evidence against Pakistan: NATO|author=The Hindu|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=4 June 2007|work=The Hindu |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan government also accuses the ISI of providing help to militants including protection to the recently killed Mullah Dadullah, Taliban's senior military commander, a charge denied by the Pakistani government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article2540127.ece Taliban military leader killed by Nato forces] [[Belfast Telegraph]], 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; India, meanwhile continues to accuse Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] of planning several terrorist attacks in Kashmir and elsewhere in the Indian republic, including the [[Mumbai train bombings|11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]], which Pakistan alleges is due to "homegrown" insurgencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/30/india.bombs/index.html?section=cnn_world#|title=Pakistan spy agency behind Mumbai bombings|author=CNN|date=30 September 2006|accessdate=30 September 2006|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other countries like Afghanistan and the UK have also accused [[State-sponsored terrorism#Pakistan|Pakistan of State-sponsored terrorism]] and [[Terrorist Financing|financing terrorism]].

The upswing in American military activity in Pakistan and neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] corresponded with a great increase in American military aid to the Pakistan government. In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately $9 million in American military aid.

In the three years after, the number increased to $4.2 billion, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11. Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns that these funds were given without any accountability, as the end uses not being documented, and that large portions were used to suppress civilians' human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] unrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/militaryaid/report.aspx?aid=877 Billions in Aid, With No Accountability] [[Center for Public Integrity]] Posted: 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=59395 An alliance of convenience By Burhanuddin Hasan] [[The News International]], Pakistan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516014922/http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=59395 |date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December of 2016, ''The Spectato''r reported that Pakistan is winning its war on terror.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/12/pakistan-is-winning-its-war-on-terror/|title=Pakistan is winning its war on terror|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article reported the major steps taken by the [[Nawaz Sharif]], during his third term as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, which has resulted in an overall drop in violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''The Guardian'' reported that in 2016, [[Narendra Modi]], [[Prime Minister of India]] referred to Pakistan as the "mothership of terrorism", as part of a reprised campaign to increase international pressure on Pakistan for allegedly harboring and supporting militant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/22/donald-trump-kabul-praises-fight-to-win-afghanistan-strategy|title=Trump's Afghan shift praised in Kabul but leaves Pakistan wary|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, ''The Guardian'' reported that as part of a new US strategy in Afghanistan by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], more pressure was to be put on Pakistan over alleged support for insurgent groups, with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump|Trump]] saying in a televised statement that "we can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond." The new strategy was supported by Afghan government officials, a spokesman for the Afghan president said that "this is the first time the US government is coming with a very clear-cut message to Pakistan to either stop what you're doing or face the negative consequences." Pakistani security officials rejected the statements, stating, "They are shifting blame to Pakistan" and "Pakistan itself is the victim of terrorism. We are fighting militants and have conducted many ground and aerial operations and destroyed their sanctuaries. We want to eradicate them physically and ideologically.". As part of a regional approach, Trump said he would encourage India to play more of a role (whom are already providing economic and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan), former officials and analysts have pointed out that the fear of a greater Indian presence in Afghanistan was the justification used by Pakistan's military and intelligence leaders to maintain backing for Afghan militants, as a buffer against Indian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/22/donald-trump-kabul-praises-fight-to-win-afghanistan-strategy|title=Trump's Afghan shift praised in Kabul but leaves Pakistan wary|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waziristan==
{{main|Waziristan War|Islamic Emirate of Waziristan}}
With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top al Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan |publisher=CNN |date=1 March 2003 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training ground for European militants==
In 2009, a politically instable Pakistan emerged as a new global hub for anti-West militancy, but, because of the constant threat of US attacks, recruits were reportedly more likely to spend their time under instruction and in training than carrying out assertive action.  In his report on the matter, focusing on an alarming influx of European extremists, ''[[Reuters]]'' security correspondent William Maclean wrote,

{{quote|Long a favored destination of British militants of Pakistani descent, Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas are now attracting Arabs and Europeans of Arab ancestry who three years ago would probably have gone to Iraq to fight U.S. forces.

With the Iraq war apparently winding down, security sources say, the lure for these young men is to fight U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan or to gain the skills to carry out attacks back home in the Middle East, Africa or the West.

One consequence: Western armies in Afghanistan increasingly face the possibility of having to fight their own compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean 2009. [[Dennis C. Blair|Dennis Blair]], US national intelligence director, declared in February that the main threat posed by Europe-based extremists was members of al Qaeda and its affiliates who "returned from training in Pakistan to conduct attacks in the West", a prominent concern since mid-2006.  Official Western estimates put at several hundred the number of non-Afghan militants receiving training in tribal areas.  Little was known about the details of the training and whether or not numbers had increased or held steady in recent months.  Many assumed, though, that increased activity in Pakistan was in large part a result of American success in [[Iraq]] (Maclean 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He added that the matter was likely to surface in a meeting on 6 May between United States President [[Barack Obama]], [[Pakistani President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari]] and [[Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]], the first-mentioned looking to bring an end to the employment of Pakistan's tribal zones as a launching pad for al Qaeda activity around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Fibiger Bang''' (born 25&amp;nbsp;June 1973) is a [[Danes|Danish]] comparative [[historian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://saxoinstitute.ku.dk/staff/beskrivelse/?id=245266 Personal website] at SAXO Institute, University of Copenhagen&lt;/ref&gt; Bang's main research interests are [[Roman economy|Roman economic history]] and [[Roman Empire|imperial power]], [[historical sociology]] and [[world history]], as well as the reception of [[Classical antiquity|Classical culture]] in later ages.

== Life ==
Born in [[Horsens]], [[Denmark]], in 1973, Bang studied [[History]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] from 1992 to 1999. In 1997, he was a visitor at the [[University of Leicester]], where he studied [[Roman Archaeology]]. In 1999, he moved to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]], [[University of Cambridge]], to work on his [[PhD]] in the Faculty of Classics. During the autumn of 2001, he was a visitor at the [[University of Chicago]]. 

In 2002, Bang was appointed assistant professor in the department of history at the [[University of Copenhagen]] before defending his PhD in Cambridge in the summer of 2003. In 2005, he was made associate professor in Copenhagen and during the same year he initiated and was elected chair of a European-based research network, ''Tributary Empires Compared'', to stimulate historical comparison between the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tec.saxo.ku.dk Tributary Empires Compared]&lt;/ref&gt; This network was funded by [[COST]] till 2009. During his employment in Copenhagen, Bang has been a visiting professor at the [[University of Tübingen]] in summer 2004 and at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in summer 2011; a research leave in 2007 allowed him another stay in Cambridge, this time associated with [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]]. 

Bang has authored, edited or co-edited nine volumes as of December 2012, as well as written a substantial number of articles, chapter contributions, reviews and essays. In addition to his academic activities, Bang writes on an occasional basis for the Danish newspaper, [[Weekendavisen]].

[[Air-to-air combat]] is the engagement of flying machines in [[warfare]] in which one or more aircraft tries to destroy one or more other aircraft. The Korean War saw the greatest amount of air-to-air combat since World War II. During the war the United States claimed to have shot down around 700 fighters.{{#tag:ref|During the [[Korean War]] experienced [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pilots flew against USAF forces.&lt;ref name="Brune p. 215"&gt;{{harvnb|Brune|1996|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="A"}}&lt;ref name="Dorr-Thompson p. 186"&gt;{{harvnb|Dorr|Thompson|2003|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the USAF reviewed its figures in an investigation code-named ''Sabre Measure Charlie'' and downgraded the kill ratio of the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] against the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] by half from 14:1 to 7:1.&lt;ref name="Dorr-Thompson p. 186"/&gt; One of the factors inflating US numbers was that most dogfights took place over enemy-controlled area. The only way to confirm kills was through gun camera photography. USAF pilots were credited with a kill if the gun camera showed their guns striking the enemy aircraft even if no one actually saw it go down.&lt;ref name="Scott p. 153"&gt;{{harvnb|Zhang|2004|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Soviet kill claims were also highly exaggerated, based upon inherent flaws in their film grading procedures. For instance, the S-13 gun camera was not aligned with either the gunsight or either cannons' ballistics. It ran only while the firing buttons were depressed. Film graders commonly included unit commanders and political commisars who would confirm a "kill"—sometimes even if one had not been claimed by a pilot—when the camera's crosshairs touched the target for two movie frames. During the first 16 months of combat Soviet V-VS units claimed 218 F-86s destroyed when only 36 (35 to the two elite IADs and one to the 50th IAD) had been lost. This results in a 600 per cent inflation rate in victory credits over actual Sabres destroyed.

The [[Vietnam War]] saw a move away from cannon fire to air-to-air missiles.&lt;ref name="Boyne p. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyne|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although US forces maintained [[air supremacy]] throughout the war, there were still occasional dogfights and several US [[flying ace|aces]]. The North Vietnamese side claimed the [[Vietnam People's Air Force]] had [[List of Vietnam War flying aces|17 aces]] throughout the war, including Nguyen Van Coc, who is also the top ace of Vietnam War with 9 kills: seven acknowledged by the [[United States Air Force]].

During the 1947 conflict over [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], the Indian Air Force did not engage the [[Pakistan Air Force]] in air-to-air combat; however, it did provide effective transport and close air support to the Indian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barua|2005|p=192|Ref=Barua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] was the first time the [[Indian Air Force]] actively engaged an enemy air force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pradhan|Chavan|2007|p=xiv|Ref=ybChavan}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the conflict had ended, India lost between 65 and 75 aircraft and Pakistan lost between 20 and 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070506/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of the developing world"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas M.

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of 1980–88, there were nearly 1,000 air-to-air engagements between Iran and Iraq, including the only known instances of helicopters dogfighting and shooting down other helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/persiancats.html |title=Persian Cats &amp;#124; Military Aviation |work=Air &amp; Space Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Falklands War]] of 1982 witnessed air combat between Argentine and British military aircraft. The Falkland Islands' runways were short and thus unable to support fighter jets, forcing Argentina to launch fighters from the mainland, which had an adverse effect on their loiter time. The Argentine forces lost 23 aircraft in air-to-air combat, out of a total of 134 fixed wing aircraft and helicopters lost during the conflict. During the 1990–91 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] 33 of Iraq's 750 fixed wing aircraft were claimed as downed (23 were confirmed), compared to 14 coalition aircraft claimed as downed (4 losses are confirmed, one [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and three UAVs&lt;ref&gt;Desert Storm Air War: The Aerial Campaign against Saddam's Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.

'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychoanalysis]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]], and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].

==Description==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22). Psychohistory holds that ritual child sacrifice  once  occurred  in most cultures.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[parenting]] practice and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the roots of violence|year=1980|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780374522698}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistorians, on the other hand, suggest that social behavior such as [[crime]] and [[war]] may be a self-destructive re-enactment of earlier abuse and neglect; that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and  social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===Areas of study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The history of childhood – which looks at such questions as:
::*How have children been raised throughout history
::*How has the family been constituted
::*How and why have practices changed over time
::*The changing place and value of children in society over time
::*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed
:2. [[Psychobiography]] – which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
:3. Group psychohistory – which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the [[Loaded language|loaded terms]], [[metaphor]]s and repetitive words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Primalpages"/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
{{OR-section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!-- Only one of the people Wikipedia articles linked in this section makes any use of the word "psychohistory" in its body. That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the "Tanka prose" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of "practitioners" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the "history" of the "discipline" of "psychohistory" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. --&gt;
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of "psycho-history" to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

Psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of modern psychohistorical research, which uses different methods.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
[[Lloyd deMause]] has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Joseph F.|year=2009|title=Psychohistory: Creating a New Discipline|url=|journal=Journal of Psychohistory|volume=37|issue=1|pages=2–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.

The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsFoundations"&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132–146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| rowspan="2" valign="top" | Infanticidal
| valign="top" | ''[[Early infanticidal childrearing]]:''&lt;br /&gt;Ritual sacrifice. High infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape and tortures.
| rowspan="2" | [[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies ("late" infanticidal childrearing).
|-
| valign="top" | ''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Infant exposure|exposed]] to death.
|-
| valign="top" | Abandoning
| valign="top" | Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name="EMOL" /&gt;
| valign="top" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].
|-
| valign="top" | Ambivalent
| valign="top" | The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.
| valign="top" | The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries.  early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].
|-
| valign="top" | Intrusive
| valign="top" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.
|-
| valign="top" | Socializing
| valign="top" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.
| valign="top" | Use of guilt, "mental discipline", [[humiliation]], [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | Helping
| valign="top" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than "[[socialize]]" them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;
| valign="top" | [[Children's rights movement]], [[natural childbirth]], the abandonment of [[circumcision]], [[attachment parenting]], [[Taking Children Seriously]], unconditional parenting, [[Parent Effectiveness Training]], [[deschooling]] and [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]].

Psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the "helping mode") are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name="PsFoundations" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.  An example of this are reports of [[Sex-selective abortion|selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;A.

This is reflected in political contrasts – for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W.

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{cite book

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay "The Evolution of Childhood" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of "helping mode" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] – deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to "psychohistory" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, facing criticism in the academic community,&lt;ref name="OnWriting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367–388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; with critics referring to it as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-21714-2 |pages=337–357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies, and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance.

DeMause has received criticism on several levels. His formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = "Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective". In ''Past, Present and Personal: The Family and The Life Course in American History''  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1986  | location = NY  | pages = 68–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the "black legend" view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been called a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources, e.g. Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800''. However, deMause received criticism for his repeated, detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical "abuses." There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336–354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories are not representative of the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |author=Marc Comtois | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061651/http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html|archivedate=March 12, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Institute for Psychohistory'' was founded by [[Lloyd deMause]]. It has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory]]''. Also the ''International Psychohistorical Association'' was founded by Lloyd deMause (in 1977) as a professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. The association hosts an annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title= Conference and Membership |url= http://www.psychohistory.us/conference-and-membership.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Psychohistory Forum'', publishes the quarterly journal ''Clio’s Psyche''.  It was founded in 1983 by historian and psychoanalyst Paul H. Elovitz. This organization of academics, therapists, and laypeople holds regular scholarly meetings in New York City and at international conventions. It also sponsors an [http://groups.google.com/group/cliospsyche online discussion group].

In Germany, scientists taking an interest in psychohistory met annually since 1987. In 1992, the ''Gesellschaft für Psychohistorie und politische Psychologie e.V'' (“Society for Psychohistory and Political Psychology”) was founded. This society issues the ''Jahrbuch für Psychohistorische Forschung'' (“Annual of Psychohistorical Research”)

'''Robert William "Bob" Davies,''' best known as '''R. W. Davies''', (born 23 April 1925) is [[professor emeritus]] of Soviet Economic Studies, [[University of Birmingham]]. Obtaining his [[PhD]] in 1954, Davies was promoted to full professor and made chair of the [[Centre for Russian and East European Studies]] (CREES) at the University of Birmingham in 1965. He retired from active teaching in 1989.

A collaborator and co-author with historian [[E. H. Carr]] on two volumes of his massive 14 volume ''History of Soviet Russia,'' Davies is best known for having carried Carr's work forward into the 1930s with seven additional volumes of [[economic history]] under the general title, ''The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia.''

[[File:Portrait of Rai Sanyo.jpg|thumb|Rai San'yō&lt;br&gt; ([[Kyoto University]] Museum)]]
'''Rai San'yō''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|頼 山陽}}; 21 January 1780, [[Aki Province]]&amp;nbsp;– 16 October 1832, [[Kyoto]]) was a Japanese [[Confucianist]] philosopher, historian, artist and poet of the later [[Edo period]]. His true name was '''Rai Noboru'''.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born to a [[samurai]] family of the [[Hiroshima Domain]]. His father, Rai Shunsui, was a respected [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian teacher]].&lt;ref name="H"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hdNsVCZw1JAC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=Rai+San'yo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIqvCemKGOyAIVzyWICh2Ugggu#v=onepage&amp;q=Rai%20San'yo&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Sources of East Asian Tradition, the Modern Period'' (vol.2)] edited by William Theodore de Bary @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Baisi, was a poet of some note. He first studied humanities with his uncles, who were notable Neo-Confucian scholars.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA575&amp;dq=Rai+San'yo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIqvCemKGOyAIVzyWICh2Ugggu#v=onepage&amp;q=Rai%20San'yo&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Sources of Japanese Tradition: Volume 2, 1600 to 2000, Volume 2] edited by De Bary, Gluck and Keene @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1797, he went to the [[Yushima Seidō|Shōheikō]], a training school for government bureaucrats in [[Edo]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2ceIdkc9CqgC&amp;pg=PA914&amp;dq=Rai+San'yo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIqvCemKGOyAIVzyWICh2Ugggu#v=onepage&amp;q=Rai%20San'yo&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600–1900''] by Haruo Shirane @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wintry Trees by Rai San'yo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|Wintry Trees]]

Wishing to devote himself to writing instead, at the age of nineteen he detached himself from his [[Han system|domain]] and became a wandering scholar. This was a serious crime without receiving special permission so, to save him from greater punishment, his father disinherited him and locked him in his room for three years.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; He spent this time studying and writing. It was there he conceived the idea for his ''[[Nihon Gaishi]]'' ("Unofficial History of Japan") and began composing the first chapters. Many years before, his father had been engaged in writing an official history, but permission had been suddenly withdrawn.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

In 1811, he moved to Kyoto, opened a school and continued to work on his history.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; He soon became part of a circle of writers and scholars that included {{ill|Yanagawa Seigan|jp|梁川星巌}} and [[Ōshio Heihachirō]] and came under the influence of the [[Kokugaku]] movement. He was finally able to achieve financial independence and travelled throughout Japan, writing [[Kanshi (poetry)|Kanshi]] poetry.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;

[[File:Титульный лист Нихон гайси 1874 года издания.jpg|thumb|Title page from the 1874 edition of ''Nihon Gaishi'']]

In 1827, he completed the ''Nihon Gaishi'', his life work,&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; It was modeled on the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and was in 22 volumes, covering Japanese history from the emergence of the [[Minamoto clan]] through the reign of [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]]. It was the first comprehensive study of its kind. The work was dedicated to the ''[[daimyō]]'', [[Matsudaira Sadanobu]], who praised it and presented it to the [[shogunate]] for approval. Despite winning that approval, it was later banned in several domains, possibly because it advocated strengthening the powers of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; It has been cited as a major influence on the ''[[Sonnō jōi]]'' movement.

He was also the author of "Records of Japan's Government",&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; in 16 volumes; "Morality and Duty", in 3 volumes; several books of verse and travel diaries. He was also an [[Ink wash painting|ink wash]] painter of modest reputation, associated with the [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga School]]. 

In his later years, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and succumbed to the disease while working at his desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37043897|title=Breeze through bamboo : kanshi of Ema Saikō|last=1787-1861.|first=Ema, Saikō,|date=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=Sato, Hiroaki, 1942-, 佐藤, 紘彰(1942- )|isbn=0231110642|location=New York|oclc=37043897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11444">'''Robert Vincent "Bill" Daniels''' (1926–2010) was an American [[historian]] and educator specializing in the history of the [[Soviet Union]]. He is best remembered as the author of two seminal [[monograph]]s on the history of Soviet Russia —''The Conscience of the Revolution'' (1960) and ''Red October'' (1967) — and as author or editor of an array of widely used [[Russia|Russian history]] [[textbooks]] which helped to shape the thinking of two generations of American college students.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Robert V. Daniels, known to his friends and acquaintances by the nickname "Bill," was born on January 4, 1926 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He was the son of Robert W. Daniels, a career officer in the [[United States Army]], and Helen Hoyt Daniels.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/burlingtonfreepress/obituary.aspx?n=robert-v-daniels-bill&amp;pid=141328023 "Robert V. 'Bill' Daniels,"] ''Burlington Free Press,'' March 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Daniels family moved extensively throughout Bill's childhood, but he generally returned each summer to [[Burlington, Vermont]], the town from whence his parents hailed and where his grandparents remained.

Daniels graduated from [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans school]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; The next year he joined the [[United States Navy]], where he went through the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] before being assigned as [[paymaster]] on the ''USS Albany.''&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

In 1945, Daniels married Alice Wendell. The couple remained together for over six decades, raising two daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Daniels received his [[Bachelor's degree|A.B.]] in [[Economics]] in 1946, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]].''&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; He later received his [[Master's Degree|M.A.]], and [[Doctorate of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in history from [[Harvard University]], one of the pioneer academic programs in the field of Russian area studies.&lt;ref name="UV"&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~history/?Page=archive2009/daniels.html&amp;SM=employeesubmenu.html "Robert V. Daniels,"] University of Vermont. Retrieved March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels' dissertation on the [[Left Opposition]] of [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Gregory Zinoviev|Grigorii Zinoviev]] in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]] up to the year 1924, was directed by historians [[Michael Karpovich]] and [[Merle Fainsod]].&lt;ref name="RVD8"&gt;Robert Vincent Daniels, ''The Conscience of the Revolution: Communist Opposition in Soviet Russia.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1960; pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels' dissertation was subsequently revised and expanded for publication as ''The Conscience of the Revolution'' in 1960.&lt;ref name="RVD8" /&gt;

===Academic career===

Daniels' first academic position was at [[Bennington College]].&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; From there he moved to the [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], where he remained until coming home to the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1956.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; Daniels remained at UVM as a professor of History until his retirement in 1988.&lt;ref name="UV" /&gt;

Daniels was the first director of the Area and International Studies program at the University of Vermont, serving in that capacity from 1962 to 1965.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; From 1964 to 1969 he was the chair of the History Department at UVM.&lt;ref name="UV" /&gt; He was also the director of the Experimental Program of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Daniels retired from the University of Vermont in 1988, assuming the title of Emeritus Professor.

As was the case with many historians of the Soviet period, Daniels became greatly interested in the process of development in Russia following the 1991 collapse of communism and authored several books on the topic. He also was a contributor of analysis on the changing situation in Russia to liberal magazines such as ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' and ''[[The Nation]].''

In 1992, Daniels was elected President of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies]] (AAASS), the main academic society for scholars of Russia, [[Central Europe|Central]], and [[Eastern Europe]] in the United States. He was a co-recipient of the AAASS award for distinguished contributions to Slavic Studies in 2001.&lt;ref name="UV" /&gt;

In 2004, Daniels was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by the University of Vermont and the university created the Robert V. Daniels Award for Outstanding Contributions in the field of International Studies.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

===Political career===

Daniels was active in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt; He was elected to the [[Vermont Senate|Vermont State Senate]] as a Democrat in 1973 from [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]] and re-elected several times, serving in that capacity until 1982.&lt;ref name="UV" /&gt;

[[File:Daniels-RedOctober.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dust jacket of the first edition of Daniels' book ''Red October'' (1967).]]

===Death and legacy===

Bill Daniels died March 28, 2010. He was 84 years old at the time of his death.

==Scholarship==

Although best remembered as the author and editor of a series of paperback academic textbooks targeted at university undergraduates, Daniel contributed two important works of history during the decade of the 1960s.

In ''The Conscience of the Revolution: Communist Opposition in Soviet Russia,'' Daniels revisited the origins of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] in Russia, depicting the Bolshevik organization as a multi-tendency organization from its inception through the assertion of full control by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the [[collectivization]] campaign of 1929. "Fundamental changes were taking place in the movement during these years," Daniels argued, and therefore "present-day Communism must accordingly be regarded as the evolutionary product of circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, ''The Conscience of the Revolution,'' pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view stood in opposition to the dominant [[totalitarian model]] of the day, which tended to depict the Soviet Union as monolithic and immutable without the exertion of external force.

In ''Red October: The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917,'' published in 1967 at the time of the 50th anniversary of the [[1917 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Daniels returned to his vision of a multi-tendency Bolshevik Party. In this work, Daniels detailed the confusion and process of persuasion by Lenin over the party leadership which culminated in the [[insurrection]] of November 1917. As Daniels himself noted, his book was dedicated to showing the process by which the Bolsheviks managed to seize power at the center of the Russian empire, rather than examining the social background of the revolutionaries and their opponents, contributing factors in Russian society, or the nature of the revolution at the periphery of the empire, away from the urban center.&lt;ref&gt;Robert V. Daniels, ''Red October: The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.'' New York: Charles Scirbner's Sons, 1967; pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniels' emphasis on the multi-tendency nature of the early Bolshevik organization, with its implications of multiple possible paths of development rather than an inherent road to [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[dictatorship]], presaged the work of a generation of younger political historians such as [[Stephen F. Cohen]] and the wave of [[social history|social historians]] who came to the fore in the profession of Soviet studies during the decades of the 1970s and 1980s.

'''Salvador''', also known as '''São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Savior''; ''Saint Savior from the Bay of All Saints'') is the capital of the [[Brazilian state]] of [[Bahia]]. With 2.9 million people &lt;small&gt;(2017)&lt;/small&gt;, it is the largest [[city proper]] in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] and the [[list of largest cities in Brazil|4th-largest city proper]] in the country, after [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Brasília]].

Founded by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1549 as the first [[capital of Brazil|capital]] of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], Salvador is one of the oldest colonial cities in the [[Americas]]. A sharp [[escarpment]] divides its Lower Town (''{{lang|pt|Cidade Baixa}}'') from its Upper Town (''{{lang|pt|Cidade Alta}}'') by some {{convert|85|m|ft|sp=us}}. The ''{{lang|pt|Elevador Lacerda}}'', Brazil's first [[elevator]], has connected the two since 1873. The [[Pelourinho]] district of the upper town, still home to many examples of Portuguese colonial architecture and historical monuments, was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1985. The [[Cathedral of Salvador|city's cathedral]] is the [[diocese of Salvador|see]] of the [[archbishop of Salvador|primate of Brazil]] and [[#Carnival|its Carnival celebration]] has been reckoned as the largest party in the world. Salvador was the first [[Slavery in Brazil|slave port]] in the [[Americas]] and the [[Africa]]n influence of the slaves' descendants makes it a center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] (''{{lang|pt|negro}}'') culture. The city is noted for its [[#Cuisine|cuisine]], [[#Music|music]], dance and [[#Pelourinho|architecture]]. [[Porto da Barra Beach]] in [[Barra (neighborhood)|Barra]] has been named one of the best beaches in the world. [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova]] was the site of the city's games during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 Brazilian World Cup]] and [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013 Confederations Cup]].

Salvador forms the heart of the ''{{lang|pt|Recôncavo}}'', Bahia's rich agricultural and industrial maritime district, and continues to be a major Brazilian port. Its metropolitan area, housing 3 899 533 people &lt;small&gt;(2018)&lt;/small&gt; forms the wealthiest one in Brazil's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]] &lt;small&gt;(2015)&lt;/small&gt;.

Salvador lies on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates the [[Bay of All Saints]], the largest bay in Brazil, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2014/11/maior-baia-do-pais-tem-ilhas-esconde-naufragios-e-e-retrato-da-desigualdade.html |title=All Saints Bay }}. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first reached by [[Gaspar de Lemos]] in 1501, just one year after [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]]'s purported [[discovery of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecoviagem.uol.com.br/brasil/bahia/salvador/ |title=Salvador - Bahia - A primeira cidade do Brasil, capital cultural - EcoViagem |publisher=Ecoviagem.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his [[second voyage of Amerigo Vespucci|second voyage]] for [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Portuguese explorer|explorer]] [[Amerigo Vespucci]] sighted the bay on [[All Saints' Day]] (November 1) 1502 and, in honor of the date and [[Ognissanti, Florence|his parish church]] in [[Florence]], he named it the Bay of the [[Jesus Christ|Holy Savior]] of All the [[Saint (Catholism)|Saints]].{{sfnp|Bargellini &amp; al.|1977|pp=337-340}} The first [[Europeans|European]] to settle nearby was [[Diogo Álvares Correia]] ("Caramuru"),{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} who was shipwrecked off the end of the peninsula in 1509. He lived among the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]], marrying [[Guaibimpara]] and others. In 1531, [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] led an expedition from Mount St Paul (''{{lang|pt|Morro de São Paulo}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.climatefinder.com/places/SBSV |contribution=SBSV |url=http://www.climatefinder.com |title=Climate Finder }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1534, [[Francisco Pereira Coutinho]], the first [[list of captains of Bahia|captain]] of [[captaincy of Bahia|Bahia]], established the settlement of [[Pereira (Bahia)|Pereira]] in modern Salvador's [[Ladeira da Barra]] neighborhood. Mistreatment of the Tupinambá by the settlers caused them to turn hostile and the Portuguese were forced to flee to [[Porto Seguro]] {{circa|lk=no|1546}}.{{sfnp|Schwartz|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=InAVH-gPgdkC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} An attempted restoration of the colony the next year ended in shipwreck and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=hisbah&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.historia-bahia.com/caramuru.htm |contribution=Caramuru: O patriarca da Nação Brasileira |url=http://www.historia-bahia.com |title=Guia Geográfico: História da Bahia |last=Bacelar |first=Jonildo }}. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Brazil and the rest of the [[Portuguese Empire]] were initially administered as part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Funchal|Diocese of Funchal]] in [[Portugal]] but, in 1551, Salvador became the [[cathedral|seat]] of the first [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] erected in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] |date=25 February 1551 |title=Super specula militantis Ecclesiae... }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first parish church&lt;ref name=sepalha/&gt; was the mud-and-thatch Church of [[Mary Help of Christians|Our Lady of Help]] (''{{lang|pt|Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Ajuda}}'') erected by the [[Jesuits]] ([[Society of Jesus]]),{{refn|group=n|This church was first rebuilt in stone and mortar in 1579 and then demolished in 1912 to widen a road.

In 1572, the [[Governorate General of Brazil|Governorate of Brazil]] was divided into the separate governorates of [[Governorate General of Bahia|Bahia]] in the north and [[Governorate General of Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]] in the south. These were reunited as Brazil six years later, then redivided from 1607 to 1613. By that time, [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] had [[Iberian Union|become temporarily united]] with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and was ruled from [[Madrid]] by its kings. In 1621, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] replaced the Governorate of Brazil with the [[State of Brazil|states of Brazil]], still based in Salvador and now controlling the south, and the [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]], which was centered on [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] and controlled what is now northern Brazil. As Spain was then prosecuting a [[Dutch War of Independence|war against the independence of the Dutch]], the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[Dutch East India Company|East]] and [[Dutch West India Company|West India companies]] [[Dutch–Portuguese War|tried to conquer Brazil]] from them. Salvador played a strategically vital role against [[Dutch Brazil]], but was [[Capture of Bahia|captured and sacked]] by a West India Company fleet under [[Jacob Willekens]] and [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Hein]] on 10 May 1624. [[Johan van Dorth]] administered the colony before his assassination, freeing its [[slavery in Brazil|slaves]]. [[Recapture of Bahia|The city was recaptured]] by a Luso-Spanish fleet under [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Mendoza]] on 1 May 1625. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|John Maurice]]'s two subsequent attempts to retake the town in [[Second Battle of Salvador da Bahia|April]] and [[First Battle of Salvador da Bahia|May]] of 1638 were unsuccessful.

In 1763, the colonial administration was removed to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and elevated to a [[Viceroyalty of Brazil|viceroyalty]]. Salvador remained the heart of the ''{{lang|pt|Recôncavo}}'', Bahia's rich agricultural maritime district,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.narradoresdoreconcavo.com.br/index/reconcavo |title=Recôncavo Baiano |access-date=20 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420043752/http://www.narradoresdoreconcavo.com.br/index/reconcavo |archive-date=20 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was largely outside Brazil's early modernization. The area formed a center of royal Portuguese support against heir apparent {{nowrap|[[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]}}'s [[Brazilian independence|declaration of independence]] from European Portugal on September 7, 1822. Its elites initially remained loyal to the [[Portuguese crown]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} while rebels from [[Cachoeira]] [[siege of Bahia|besieged them]] for a year until finally receiving Portugal's surrender of the town on July 2, 1823, which is now celebrated as Bahia Independence Day.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The local elite was similarly hesitant during [[Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca]]'s later coup that established the [[First Brazilian Republic|republic]] in 1889.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

Owing to whales' use of the [[Bay of All Saints]] as a mating ground, Salvador became a large [[History of whaling|whaling]] port in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] during the 19th century but the trade had already begun to fall off by the 1870s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=239}}

Under the [[Brazilian Empire|empire]] and [[First Brazilian Republic|republic]] periods, however, the town slowly began to industrialize. In 1873, Brazil's first elevator, the powerful hydraulic ''{{lang|pt|Elevador Lacerda}}'', was constructed to connect the city's upper and lower towns.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=239}} Having undergone several upgrades, it continues in use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvadorbahia.org/ Cidade Baixa e Alta] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=tudobeleza |url=http://eyesonbrazil.com/2008/07/15/salvador-da-bahia-first-national-capital/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215326/http://eyesonbrazil.com/2008/07/15/salvador-da-bahia-first-national-capital/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-10 |title=Salvador da Bahia – First National Capital |publisher=Eyes On Brazil |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[First World War]], it was joined by a second elevator{{refn|group=n|The development of the tramways and elevators, however, ended a long-running trade for porters and chairmen carrying people and goods up the steep staircase streets of the escarpment.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=239}}}} and Salvador was connected to four [[rail transport in Brazil|railroads]]: the [[Bahia &amp; Alagoinhas Railway|Bahia &amp; Alagoinhas]] to [[Joazeiro]], the [[Bahia Central Railway|Bahia Central]], the [[Nazareth Tramway]], and a short line to [[Santo Amaro, Bahia|Santo Amaro]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Its central districts and the major suburbs of Bomsim and Victoria were served by [[List of town tramway systems in Brazil#Bahia|four streetcar lines]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=239}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} which had begun to electrify.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} It also served as a [[port|port of call]] for most [[steamship]] lines trading between [[Europe]] and South America.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

In 1985, [[UNESCO]] listed the city's [[Pelourinho]] neighborhood as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{citation |contribution=Historic Centre of Salvador de Bahia |contribution-url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/309 |title=World Heritage List |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/ |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.iphan.gov.br/portal/montarPaginaSecao.do;jsessionid=C8A07C68C0AB14EAB447EEA1E7BCAEF1?id=18121&amp;retorno=paginaIphan Centro Histórico da cidade de Salvador] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, a major municipal project cleaned and restored the neighborhood in order to develop it as the cultural center and heart of the city's tourist trade.

In 2010, the city of Salvador was the third-most populous city in [[Brazil]], after [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm |title=The largest Brazilian cities - 2010 IBGE Census (in Portuguese) |publisher=Noticias.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city had 474,827 opposite-sex couples and 1,595 [[same-sex couple]]s. The population of Salvador was 53.3% [[female]] and 46.7% [[male]].&lt;ref name="censo2010.ibge.gov.br"/&gt;

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], there were 2,675,000 people residing in the city of Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=29 |title=2010 IGBE Census |language=Portuguese |publisher=Censo2010.ibge.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145644/http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=29 |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The census revealed the following self-identification: 1,382,543 persons identify as [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) (51.7%); 743,718 as [[African Brazilian|Black]] (27.8%); 505,645 as [[White Brazilian|White]] (18.9%); 35,785 as [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] (1.3%); and 7,563 as [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]](0.3%).&lt;ref name="censo2010.ibge.gov.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn |title=2010 IGBE Census |language=Portuguese |publisher=Censo2010.ibge.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador's population is the result of 500 years of [[miscegenation]]. The majority of the population has African, European and Native American roots. The African ancestry of the city is from [[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecoviagem.uol.com.br/brasil/bahia/salvador/ |title=African ancestries in Salvador {{en icon}} |publisher=Ecoviagem.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Salvador-JesuitChurch4-CCBY.jpg|thumb|Former [[Cathedral of Salvador|Jesuit church of Salvador]] (17th century), now cathedral]]According to an [[autosomal]] DNA study from 2008, the ancestral heritage of the population of Salvador was estimated to be 49.20% [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], 36.30% [[Europe]]an and 14.50% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.sbg.org.br/congress/sbg2008/pdfs2008/23959.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426180856/http://web2.sbg.org.br/congress/sbg2008/pdfs2008/23959.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also analyzed the genetic backgrounds of people by type of surname. Those with surnames with a religious connotation were 53.1% African in genetic ancestry and tended to be in lower economic classes. During the colonial era, it was typical practice for Portuguese priests and missionaries to baptize converted African slaves and Native Americans with surnames of religious connotations. These have been passed down to their descendants.

A 2015 autosomal DNA study found out the following ancestral composition in Salvador: 50.5% of African ancestry, 42.4% of European ancestry and 5.8% of Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep09812|title=Genomic ancestry and ethnoracial self-classification based on 5,871 community-dwelling Brazilians (The Epigen Initiative)|first1=M.

individuals living in poor environments (page 4).&lt;ref name="nature.com" /&gt;

Another 2015 autosomal DNA found out Salvador to be 50.8% African, 42.9% European and 6.4% Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8696.full.pdf?with-ds=yes |title=Origin and dynamics of admixture in Brazilians and its effect on the pattern of deleterious mutations |date= |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:IURD Salvador.jpg|thumb|[[Protestant Church]] in Iguatemi neighborhood|alt=]][[File:Casa de Oxumarê-13729.jpg|thumb|A temple of Afro-Brazilian religious expression in Salvador.]]
In Salvador, religion is a major contact point between Portuguese and African influences and, in the last 20 years, Brazil's version of a North American-influenced Pentecostalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |title=Religion Salvador  |language=pt |publisher=Touristlink.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salvador was the seat of the first [[Diocese|bishopric]] in colonial Brazil (established 1551), and the first bishop, ''Pero Fernandes Sardinha'', arrived already in 1552.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/BeagleLibrary/1810_Southey_A854.01.html |title=1st bishop in Brazil  |publisher=Darwin-online.org.uk |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jesuit]]s, led by the [[Manuel da Nóbrega]], also arrived in the 16th century and worked in converting the [[Indigenous peoples]] of the region to Roman [[Catholicism]].

Many religious orders came to the city, following its foundation: [[Franciscans]], [[Benedictines]] and [[Carmelites]]. Subsequently, to them are created the Third Orders, the Brotherhoods, and Fraternities, which were composed mainly of professional and social groups. The most prominent of these orders were the Terceira do Carmo Order and the de São Francisco Order, founded by white men, and the Nossa Senhora do Rosário and São Beneditino Brotherhoods, composed of black men.&lt;ref name="latinamerica3000.ru"&gt;[http://www.latinamerica3000.ru/en/tourism/destinations/Salvador?mode=gal222222&amp;mode=gal2222&amp;mode=gal22 Salvador - Religion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144005/http://www.latinamerica3000.ru/en/tourism/destinations/Salvador?mode=gal222222&amp;mode=gal2222&amp;mode=gal22 |date=14 July 2014 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many churches maintained by religious men, were housed the Santíssimo Sacramento brotherhoods.

Besides these organizations, the expansion of [[Catholicism]] in the city was consolidated through social care work. Santa Casa the Misericórdia was one of the institution that did this kind of work, maintaining hospitals, shelters for the poor and the elderly, as well providing assistance to convicts and to those who would face death penalties.&lt;ref name="latinamerica3000.ru" /&gt; The [[convent]]s, on their part, were cultural and religious formation centers, offering seminar coursed that often were attended by the lay.

Even with the present evolution, and the growth of [[Protestantism]] and other religions in the city, the Catholic faith remains as one of its most distinctive features, drawing a lot of people to its hundreds of churches. Some aspects, like the use of Portuguese in the Masses, the simplification of the liturgy, and the adoption of "[[pop music|pop]]" [[religious]] [[song]]s are key factors to the triumph of [[Catholicism]]. In the Nossa Senhora do Rosário dos Pretos Church, Masses are held in the Yorubá language, making use of African chants and typical clothes, which attract many people from the [[African Brazilian]] communities.&lt;ref name="latinamerica3000.ru" /&gt;

Most enslaved Africans in Bahia were brought from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], especially the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba-speaking]] nation (''Iorubá'' or ''Nagô'' in Portuguese) from present-day [[Benin]]. The enslaved were forced to convert to Roman Catholicism, but their original religion [[Yoruba religion|Yorùbá]] was combined with Roman Catholicism to make the syncretic religion known as, [[Candomblé]], which has survived in spite of prohibitions and persecutions. The enslaved Africans managed to preserve their religion by attributing the names and characteristics of their Yorùbá deities to Catholic saints with similar qualities. Still today all Candomble sessions are conducted in Yoruba, not Portuguese.[[File:Casa de Iemanjá-893.jpg|thumb|The religious house that holds the Afro-Brazilian goddess Yemoja in Salvador.]]These religious entities have been syncretised with some Catholic entities. For instance, Salvador's [[Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Salvador)|Feast of Bonfim]], celebrated in January, is dedicated to both Our Lord of Bonfim ([[Jesus Christ]]) and Oxalá. Another important feast is the Feast de Yemanja every 2 February, on the shores of the borough of Rio Vermelho in 

Salvador, on the day the church celebrates Our Lady of the Navigators. 8 December, Immaculate Conception Day for Catholics, is also commonly dedicated to Yemanja' with votive offerings made in the sea throughout the Brazilian coast.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Throughout [[History of Brazil|Brazilian history]] Salvador has played an important role. Because of its [[Location (geography)|location]] on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the [[Portuguese empire]] throughout the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]], maintaining close commercial ties with [[Portugal]] and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazilaccommodation.org/salvador.html Economy of Salvador] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072920/http://www.brazilaccommodation.org/salvador.html |date=21 August 2013 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In the last ten years many high-rise [[office]] and [[apartment]] [[building]]s were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpeacejournal.com/apps/blog/show/prev?from_id=7196252&amp;sms_ss=twitter&amp;at_xt=4de040cf9da5b2dc,0 About Salvador]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404004858/http://www.worldpeacejournal.com/apps/blog/show/prev?from_id=7196252&amp;sms_ss=twitter&amp;at_xt=4de040cf9da5b2dc%2C0 |date=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its beaches, humid tropical climate, numerous up-to-date [[shopping mall]]s (The Shopping Iguatemi was the first shopping mall in Northeastern Brazil) and pleasant high-class residential areas, the city has much to offer its residents.

Economically Salvador is one of Brazil's more important cities. Since its founding the city has been one of Brazil's most prominent [[port]]s and international trading centers. Boasting a large oil refinery, a petrochemical plant and other important industries, the city has made great strides in reducing its historical dependence on [[Agriculture in Brazil|agriculture]] for its prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatcities.org/pg.asp?ID=34 |title=Salvador - Great Cities (U.S. Website) |publisher=Great Cities |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador is the second most popular tourism destination in Brazil, after [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topdobrasil.com.br/praias/nordeste/ba/praias-de-salvador.php |title=Praias de Salvador Bahia Praias do Brasil: Brasil, Praias do Rio, do Nordeste e outras praias do Brasil |publisher=Topdobrasil.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201195143/http://www.topdobrasil.com.br/praias/nordeste/ba/praias-de-salvador.php |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism and cultural activity are important generators of employment and income, boosting the arts and the preservation of artistic and cultural heritage.

Chief among the points of interest are its famous ''Pelourinho'' (named after the colonial [[pillory|pillories]] that once stood there) district, its historic churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerador Automático de Meta-Tags &lt;http://buscas.com.br/meta-tags&gt; |url=http://www.visiteabahia.com.br/visite/salvador/pelourinho/index.php |title=Historic Churches in Pelourinho |publisher=Visiteabahia.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[beach]]es. Salvador's tourism [[infrastructure]] is considered one of the most modern in World, especially in terms of lodging. The city offers accommodation to suit all tastes and standards, from youth hostels to international [[hotel]]s. [[Construction]] is one of the most important activities in the city, and many international (mainly from Spain, [[Portugal]] and England)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/bbc/ult272u59941.shtml |title=Folha Online - Growth in construction has attracted many international investors |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national developers are investing in the city and in the Bahian [[littoral zone]].

[[Ford Motor Company]] has a plant in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, in the city of [[Camaçari]], assembling the [[Ford EcoSport]], [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Ford Fiesta|Ford Fiesta Sedan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parana-online.com.br/editoria/economia/news/410985/?noticia=FORD+AMPLIARA+FABRICA+DE+CAMACARI+NA+BAHIA |title=Car Models - Ford Bahia |publisher=Parana-online.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Automotive industry]] in [[Northeastern Brazil]].

In December 2001, [[Monsanto Company]] inaugurated, at the Petrochemical Pole of Camaçari, in Metropolitan Region of Salvador, the first plant of the company designed to produce raw materials for the [[herbicide]] [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] in [[South America]]. The investment is equivalent to US$500 millions; US$350 millions were spent in this initial phase. The Camaçari Plant, the largest unit of Monsanto outside of the United States, is also the only Monsanto plant manufacturing raw materials for the Roundup production line. The company started the civil works for the new plant in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pautasocial.com.br/pauta.asp?idPauta=37175 |title=Monsanto Company in Salvador |language=Portuguese |publisher=Pautasocial.com.br |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017131920/http://www.pautasocial.com.br/pauta.asp?idPauta=37175 |archive-date=17 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism and recreation==
[[File:Praia do Porto da Barra 3.jpg|thumb|[[Porto da Barra Beach]] in [[Barra (neighborhood)|Barra]] neighborhood|alt=]]
[[File:Entardecer elevedor lacerda.jpg|thumb|Salvador, capital of [[Bahia]] state, is the center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture.|alt=]]
[[File:Parque de Pituaçu.jpg|thumb|Pituaçu Park|alt=]]
The Salvador [[coastline]] is one of the longest for cities in Brazil. There are {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[beach]]es distributed between the High City and the Low City, from Inema, in the railroad suburb to the Praia do Flamengo, on the other side of town. While the Low City beaches are bordered by the waters of the [[All Saints Bay]] (the country's most extensive bay), the High City beaches, from Farol da Barra to Flamengo, are bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The exception is [[Porto da Barra Beach]], the only High City beach located in the All Saints Bay.

The capital's beaches range from calm inlets, ideal for swimming, sailing, diving and underwater fishing, as well as open sea inlets with strong waves, sought by [[surfer]]s. There are also beaches surrounded by [[reef]]s, forming natural pools of stone, ideal for children.

Interesting places to visit near Salvador include:
* According to the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', in 2007, [[Porto da Barra Beach]] was the third best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gavin McOwan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/feb/16/beach.top10?page=2 |title=Top 10 beaches of the world &amp;#124; Travel |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 2007-02-16|accessdate=2010-04-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The large island of [[Itaparica]] in the Bay of All Saints can be visited either by a car-ferry, or a smaller foot-passenger ferry, which leaves from near the [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]] near the Lacerda Elevator.
* [[BA-099]] Highway, or "Line of Coconut" and "Green Line" of towns and cities, with exquisite beaches, north of Salvador heading towards [[Sergipe]] state.
* [[Morro de São Paulo]] in the Valença region across the Bay of All Saints – an island that can be reached by ferry from Salvador (2 hours), by plane, or by bus to Valença and then by 'Rapido' ('fast') speedboat or smaller ferry. Morro de São Paulo is formed by five villages of the Tinharé [[Island]].

The city is served by many [[shopping mall]]s, including Shopping Iguatemi,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Shopping Iguatemi|Portuguese Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Salvador Shopping,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Salvador Shopping|Portuguese Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Shopping Barra,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Shopping Barra|Portuguese Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Shopping Paralela.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Shopping Paralela|Portuguese Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador has four [[parks]], green areas protected, as Jardim dos Namorados Park, Costa Azul Park, Park of the City, Park of Pituaçu.

Jardim dos Namorados is located right next to Costa Azul Park and occupies an area of 15 hectares in [[Pituba (Neighborhood)|Pituba]], where many families used to spend their vacations in the 1950s. It was inaugurated in 1969, initially as a leisure area. It underwent a complete renovation in the 1990s, with the construction of an amphitheater with room for 500 people, sports courts, playgrounds and [[parking]] for cars and tourist buses.

Park of the City is an important preservation area of the [[Atlantic forest]]. It was completely renovated in 2001, becoming a modern social, cultural and leisure place. The new park has 720 square meter of green area right in the middle of the city. Among the attractions are Praça das Flores (Flowers square), with more than five thousand ornamental plants and flowers.

Besides its environment, the [[park]] has an [[infrastructure]] for [[children]], with a special schedule of events taking place every October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drhostel.com/travelguide/salvador-tourist-guide-information/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922094447/http://www.drhostel.com/travelguide/salvador-tourist-guide-information/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-22 |title=Salvador Guide Information |publisher=Drhostel.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aereo de Salvador..jpg|alt=Aereo Salvador.|thumb|Aereo Salvador.]]
Created by state decree in 1973, Pituaçu Park occupies an area of 450 hectares and is one of the few Brazilian ecological parks located in an [[urban area]]. It is surrounded by [[Atlantic forest]], with a good variety of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. There is also an artificial pond in the park, built in 1906 along with the Pituaçu Dam, whose purpose was to supply water to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.360brazil.co.uk/salvador-tourism-and-recreation/ |title=Salvador: tourism and recreation  |publisher=360brazil.co.uk |date=2013-02-03 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of possible leisure activities, ranging from cycloboats rides on the pond, to a {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} long cycloway circling the entire reserve. A museum is also located in the park. Espaço Cravo is an outdoor museum with 800 pieces created by Mario Cravo, comprising Totems, winged and three-dimensional figures, as well as [[drawing]]s and [[painting]]s.

==Culture==
Salvador's historical and cultural aspects were inherited by the intermarriage of such ethnic groups as Native-Indian, African and European. This mixture can be seen in the [[religion]],  [[cuisine]], cultural manifestations, and custom of Bahia's people. African cultural practices are particularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibahia.com/especiais/vozesdobrasil/cidades/ Salvador metropolitan area and African Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422113544/http://www.ibahia.com/especiais/vozesdobrasil/cidades/ |date=22 April 2014 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:Anchieta Pelourinho Cyark.jpg|thumb|right|Perspective view of the Salvador Bahia Pelourinho's Anchieta Plaza, cut from a [[3D scanner|Laser Scan]] preservationist project conducted by nonprofit [[CyArk]].]]
[[Gregório de Mattos]], born in Salvador in 1636, was also educated by the Jesuits. He became the most important [[Baroque literature|Baroque poet]] in colonial Brazil for his religious and satirical works. [[Father António Vieira]] was born in Lisbon in 1608, but was raised and educated in the Jesuit school of Salvador and died in the city in 1697. His erudite [[sermon]]s have earned him the title of best writer of the [[Portuguese language]] in the Baroque era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brazil |first=Projecto |url=http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |title=Portuguese language in the Baroque era |publisher=Projectobrazil.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Independence of Brazil]] (1822), Salvador continued to play an important role in Brazilian literature. Significant 19th century writers associated with the city include [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Castro Alves]] (1847–1871) and diplomat [[Ruy Barbosa]] (1849–1923). In the 20th century, Bahia-born [[Jorge Amado]] (1912–2001), although not born in Salvador, helped popularize the culture of the city around the world in novels such as ''[[Jubiabá]]'', ''[[Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos]]'', and ''[[Tenda dos Milagres (novel)|Tenda dos Milagres]]'', the settings of which are in Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triposo.com/loc/Salvador2C_Bahia/culture Culture in Salvador] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Acarajes.jpg|thumb|[[Acarajé]] is a traditional street food in Salvador.|alt=]]
The local cuisine, spicy and based on seafood (shrimp, fish), strongly relies on typically African ingredients and techniques, and is much appreciated throughout Brazil and internationally. The most typical ingredient is ''[[Palm oil|azeite-de-dendê]]'', an oil extracted from a palm tree (''Elaeis guineensis'') brought from [[West Africa]] to Brazil during colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html Cuisine of Salvador] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the milky [[coconut]] juice, they prepared a variety of [[seafood]] based dishes, such as Ensopados, Moquecas and Escabeche. The [[sugar cane]] bagasse was mixed with molasses and Rapadura, in the creation of coconut desserts like Cocada Branca and Preta. The remaining of the Portuguese Stew sauce was mixed with [[manioc]] flour to make a mush, which is a traditional Indian dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |title=Cuisine - Salvador  |language=pt |publisher=Touristlink.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the markets of Salvador, it is possible to find stands selling typical dishes of the colonial era. In the Sete Portas Market, customers eat Mocotó on Friday nights since the 1940s, when the market was inaugurated. In the [[restaurant]]s of [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]], Sarapatel, stews and several fried dishes are served regularly. In the São Joaquim, Santa Bárbara and São Miguel markets, there are stands selling typical food. They are also sold at stands located on the [[beach]]es, specially crab stews and oysters. The restaurants that sell typical dishes are located mostly along the coast and in Pelourinho. They prepare a wide variety of recipes that take [[palm oil|palm tree oil]].

Traditional dishes include ''[[caruru (food)|caruru]]'', ''[[vatapá]]'', ''[[acarajé]]'', ''[[bobó-de-camarão]]'', ''[[moqueca]]'' baiana, and ''abará''. Some of these dishes, like the acarajé and abará, are also used as offerings in [[Candomblé]] rituals. But Salvador is not only typical [[food]]. Other recipes created by the slaves were the Haussá Rice (rice and jerked [[beef]] cooked together), the Munguzá, used as offering to the Candomblé deity Oxalá (who is the father of all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons very much. So did the Bolinhos the Fubá, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipetê (used in the [[ritual]]s to the deity [[Oxum]]) became the [[Shrimp bobó]], and the Akará (honoring the deities Xangô and Iansã) became the world-famous Acarajé. The city has restaurants specialized on [[World|international]] cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of [[Brazil]], especially from [[Minas Gerais]] and the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast region]].

===Capoeira===
[[File:Bloco da Capoeira, Circuito Campo Grande 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Capoeira]] in Salvador]]
[[Capoeira]] is a unique mix of [[dance]] and [[martial art]] of Afro-Brazilian origin, combining agile dance moves with unarmed combat techniques. Capoeira in Portuguese literally means "chicken coop". The presence of capoeira in Brazil is directly connected to the importation of African slaves by the Portuguese, and Salvador is considered the home of modern capoeira branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelblog.org/South-America/Brazil/Bahia/Salvador/blog-618906.html |title=Caopeira  |publisher=Travelblog.org |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, Salvador-born masters [[Mestre Bimba]] and [[Mestre Pastinha]] founded capoeira schools and helped standardize and popularize the art in Brazil and the world.

The party official begins when Rei Momo ("King Momo", the King of Carnival) is handed the [[key to the city]] in the morning of the Thursday before [[Mardi Gras]]. In the Campo Grande, streets are lined with grandstands (''{{lang|pt|camarotes}}''). 60-foot-long trucks known as ''{{lang|pt|Trios Eléctricos}}'' carry a [[kick line]] of scantily-clad dancers along with the city's best-loved performers, such as [[Ivete Sangalo]], [[Daniela Mercury]], [[Cláudia Leitte]], [[Chiclete com Banana]], and [[Carlinhos Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke |first=James |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DB143BF937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Carnival of Salvador in The |publisher=New York Times |date=14 February 1993 |accessdate=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the music played is [[axé]] or [[samba-reggae]]. Groups known as ''{{lang|pt|blocos}}'' participate, with the most famous being the ''{{lang|pt|blocos afros}}'' such as Malé Debalé, Olodum, and Filhos de Gandhi.

The parades are organized into separate circuits. The Osmar Circuit, the oldest, goes from Campo Grande to [[Castro Alves]] Square. The Downtown Circuit runs through downtown and [[Pelourinho]]. The Dodô Circuit goes from Farol da [[Barra (Neighborhood)|Barra]] to [[Ondina (Neighborhood)|Ondina]] along the [[coast]]. Since the Osmar Circuit is the oldest, it is where the event's most traditional groups parade. In Dodô, where the artist box seats are located, the party becomes lively toward the end of the [[afternoon]] and continues until [[morning]].

===Music===

===Libraries===
The first books that arrived in Salvador, were brought by the [[Jesuits]], who came with Tomé de Souza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_americas/v061/61.3metcalf.html |title=Tomé de Souza in Salvador |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[libraries]] or [[bookstore]]s that appeared were under the control of the religious missionaries and were mostly composed of books on [[religion]].

===Handcrafts===
[[File:Interior do Mercado Modelo.jpg|thumb|right|Internal view of Mercado Modelo]]
The handcraft legacy of Bahia using only raw materials ([[straw]], [[leather]], [[clay]], [[wood]], [[seashell]]s and [[bead]]s), the most rudimentary crafts are reasonably inexpensive. Other pieces are created with the use of metals like [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]] and [[brass]]. The most sophisticated ones are ornamented with precious and semi-precious gems. The craftsmen and women generally choose religion as the main theme of their work.

They portray the images of Catholic saints and Candomble deities on their pieces. The good luck charms such as the clenched fist, the four-leaf clover, the garlic and the famous Bonfim ribbons express the city's religious syncretism. Nature is also portrayed on these pieces, reflecting the local [[wildlife]]. Music appears in the atabaque drums, the rain sticks, the water drums and the famous berimbau, along with other typical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvadorhotels.brazilhotels.4k.com/Culture-salvador.php Salvador Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128102447/http://www.salvadorhotels.brazilhotels.4k.com/Culture-salvador.php |date=28 January 2012 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador holds an international reputation as a city where musical instruments that produce unique sounds are made. These instruments are frequently used by world-famous artists in their recording sessions. The main handcrafts production in Salvador is located in [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]], which is the biggest handcraft center in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalmercadomodelo.com.br/ |title=Model Market of Salvador |publisher=Portalmercadomodelo.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four paved [[highway]]s connect the city to the national highway system. Running north from the Farol ([[lighthouse]]) de Itapoã are hundreds of miles of wonderful [[beach]]es. The beaches are accessible by the [[BA-099]] highway or (Line of Coconut and Green Line), a (toll) [[road]], which is kept in excellent condition, running parallel to the [[coast]], with access roads leading off to the coast itself. The [[road]] runs along [[dune]]s of snow-white sand, and the coast itself is an almost unbroken line of [[coconut palm]]s. The communities along the coast range from [[fishing]] [[village]]s to [[Beach|Praia do Forte]].

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Salvador BA (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Barra (Neighborhood)|Barra]] neighborhood in South Zone]]
Although the creation of Salvador was masterminded by the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and its project conducted by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[engineer]] Luís Dias (who was responsible for the city's original design), the continuous growth of the capital through the decades was completely spontaneous. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The walls of the city-fortress could not hold the expansion of the city, towards the Carmo and the area where now stands [[Castro Alves]] Square. At the time of its foundation, Salvador had only two squares and the first neighborhood ever built here was the Historic City Center. [[Pelourinho]] and Carmo came subsequently, created as a consequence of the growing need of space that the [[Religion in Brazil|religious]] orders had. With the rapid expansion, the [[neighborhood]]s grew and many of them were clustered in the same area, so today there are not accurate records as to their exact number. For [[urban area|urban]] management purposes, the city is currently divided on 17 political-administrative zones. However, due to their very [[culture of Brazil|cultural]] relevance and to postal conveniences, the importance of the neighborhoods of Salvador remains intact.

[[File:Vista de Salvador da ponta da Barra.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Salvador|alt=]]

Salvador is divided into a number of distinct neighborhoods, with the most well known districts being [[Pelourinho]], [[Comércio]], and Old Downtown, all located in West Zone. [[Barra (Neighborhood)|Barra]], with its Farol da Barra, [[beach]]es and which is where one of the Carnival circuits begins, Barra is home of the Portuguese Hospital and Spanish Hospital, the neighborhood is located in South Zone. [[Vitória (Neighborhood)|Vitória]], a neighborhood with many high rise buildings, is located in South Zone.
[[Campo Grande (Neighborhood)|Campo Grande]], with its Dois de Julho Square and the monument to Bahia's independence, is also located in South Zone, as is [[Graça (Neighborhood)|Graça]], an important residential area.
[[Ondina (Neighborhood)|Ondina]], with Salvador's [[Zoo|Zoobotanical Garden]] and the site where the Barra-Ondina Carnival circuit ends, the neighborhood is home of the Spanish Club, is also a neighborhood in the South Zone.

[[Itaigara (Neighborhood)|Itaigara]], [[Pituba (Neighborhood)|Pituba]], Horto Florestal, [[Caminho das Árvores (Neighborhood)|Caminho das Árvores]], Loteamento Aquárius, [[Brotas (Neighborhood)|Brotas]], Stiep, Costa Azul, Armação, Jaguaribe and Stella Maris are the wealthiest and the New Downtown neighborhoods in the East Zone and the city. [[Rio Vermelho (Neighborhood)|Rio Vermelho]], a neighborhood with a rich architectural history and numerous restaurants and bars, is located in the South Zone. [[Itapoã (Neighborhood)|Itapoã]], known throughout Brazil as the home of [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and for being the setting of the song "Tarde em Itapoã", is located in East Zone.

The Northwest area of the city in along the Bay of All Saints, also known as ''Cidade Baixa'' ("Lower city"), contains the impoverished suburban neighborhoods of [[Periperi]], Paripe, Lobato, Liberdade, Nova Esperança, and Calçada. The neighborhood of [[Liberdade (neighbourhood)|Liberdade]] (Liberty) has the largest proportion of [[Afro-Brazilian]]s of Salvador and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smec.salvador.ba.gov.br/net/piraja/liberdad.htm |title=Liberdade Neighborhood |publisher=Smec.salvador.ba.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413121653/http://www.smec.salvador.ba.gov.br/net/piraja/liberdad.htm |archivedate=13 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelourinho===
{{Main article|Historic Center (Salvador)}}
[[File:Largodopelo.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Salvador-CCBY-2.jpg|thumb|Old houses in the historical center of Salvador.]]
The [[Historic Center (Salvador)|Historic Center of Salvador]] was designated in 1985 a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The city represents a fine example the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[urbanism]] from the middle of the 16th century with its higher [[Public administration|administrative]] town and its lower [[commercial district|commercial]] town, and a large portion of the city has retained the old character of its streets and colourful houses.

As the first capital of [[Empire of Brazil|Portuguese America]], Salvador cultivated slave labor and had its [[pillory|pillories]] ("{{lang|pt|pelourinhos}}") installed in open places like the Terreiro de Jesus and the squares know today as [[Tomé de Sousa]] and [[Castro Alves]]. The pillories were a symbol of [[authority]] and [[justice]] for some and of lashings and injustice for the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Projecto Brazil |url=http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |title=Projecto Brazil  |publisher=Projectobrazil.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one erected for a short time in what is now the Historical Center, and later moved to what is now the Praça da Piedade (Square of Piety), ended up lending its name to the historical and architectural complex of [[Pelourinho]], part of the city's upper town.

Since 1992, the [[Pelourinho]] neighborhood has been subject to a nearly US$100 million "[[Building restoration|restoration]]" that has led to the rebuilding of hundreds of buildings' façades and the expulsion of the vast majority of the neighborhood's Afro-descendent population. This process has given rise to substantial political debate in the State of [[Bahia]], since the Pelourinho's former residents have been for the most part excluded from the renovation's economic benefits (reaped by a few).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolt of the Saints: Memory and Redemption in the Twilight of Brazilian Racial Democracy|last=Collins|first=John|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780822353065|location=Durham|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major restoration effort resulted in making the area a [[tourist]] [[Tourist attraction|attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/BraPelourinho.htm |title=New Pelourinho |publisher=Gosouthamerica.about.com |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador's considerable wealth and status during [[colony|colonial]] times (as [[capital (political)|capital]] of the colony during 250 years and which gave rise to the Pelourinho) is reflected in the magnificence of its colonial [[palace]]s, [[church (building)|churches]] and [[convent]]s, most of them dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. These include:

* [[Cathedral of Salvador]]: Former [[Jesuit]] church of the city, built in the second half of the 17th century. Fine example of [[Mannerist]] architecture and decoration.
* [[São Francisco Church and Convent (Salvador)|Convent and Church of São Francisco]]: Franciscan convent and church dating from the first half of the 18th century is another fine example of the Portuguese [[colonial architecture]]. The [[Baroque]] decoration of the church is among the finest in Brazil.
* [[Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Salvador)|Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim]]: [[Rococo]] church with [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] inner decoration. The image of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim is the most venerated in the city, and the Feast of Our Lord of Good Ending (''Festa de Nosso Senhor do Bonfim'') in January is the most important in the city after [[#Carnival|Carnival]].
* [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]] (Model Market): In 1861, at the Cayrú Square, the Customs Building was constructed, with a rotunda (large circular room with a domed ceiling) at the back end, where ships anchored to unload their merchandise.
* [[Lacerda Elevator]] (''{{lang|pt|Elevador Lacerda}}''): Inaugurated in 1873, this elevator was planned and built by the businessman Antônio Francisco de Lacerda, The four elevator cages connect the {{convert|72|m|ft}} between the [[Thomé de Souza]] Square in the upper city, and the Cayru Square in the lower city. In each run, which lasts for 22 seconds, the elevator transports 128 persons, 24 hours a day.

==Sports==
[[File:Estádio Roberto Santos (2009).jpg|thumb|Pituaçu Stadium|alt=|left]]
Salvador provides visitors and residents with various sport activities. The [[Arena Fonte Nova|Fonte Nova Arena]], also known as Estádio Octávio Mangabeira is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium inaugurated on 28 January 1951 in Salvador, [[Bahia]], with a maximum capacity of 66,080 people. The stadium has now been replaced with a new stadium named [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova]] with a capacity of 56,000 people. This stadium hosted matches of [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and the subsequent [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], as well as the football competition in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].  The stadium is owned by the Bahia government, and is the home ground of [[Esporte Clube Bahia]]. Its formal name honors Octávio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954. The stadium is nicknamed Fonte Nova, because it is located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras. The stadium was in 2007 closed due to an accident, and the E.C. Bahia home matches now happen in another stadium, in Pituaçu.

[[Esporte Clube Bahia]] and [[Esporte Clube Vitória]] are Salvador's main football teams. Bahia has won 2 national titles, [[Taça Brasil|Brazil Trophy]] in 1959 and the Brazilian League in 1988, while Vitória was a runner up in the Brazilian league in 1993 and [[Copa do Brasil|Brazil Cup]] in 2010.

Currently, Salvador has a national racing schedule with dozens of events, also receiving the [[Mini Transat 6.50]] and Les Illes du Soleil races.&lt;ref name="accommodationbrazil.org"/&gt;

[[Rowing boat]] races started in the city more than a hundred years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campos.rj.gov.br/noticia.php?id=15339 |title=Rowing boat in Salvador |publisher=Campos.rj.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111202838/http://www.campos.rj.gov.br/noticia.php?id=15339 |archivedate=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally practiced by young men from traditional families, who spent their [[summer]] vacations there. The sport is a leisure option in Cidade Baixa (the lower part of the city). [[Esporte Clube Vitória]] and Clube São Salvador were the pioneers in the sport. Nowadays, these two entities and also Clube de Regatas Itapagipe lead the competitions that take place in the city. With the recent renovation of the Dique do Tororó area, Salvador received new lanes for the practice of the sport.

'''Scott Oden''' (born June 24, 1967) is an American writer best known for his [[historical novel]]s set in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  His work imitates the styles and themes of the 1930s pulps, most notably the historical fiction and fantasy of Texan author [[Robert E. Howard]].

==Biography==
Oden was born in [[Columbus, Indiana]] in 1967.  He graduated from Albert P. Brewer High School in 1985 and attended John C. Calhoun State Community College in [[Decatur, Alabama]], where he studied English and History.  Oden began writing at the age of 14, and his first published work was a role-playing game called "Rogue Warrior" in 1986—only memorable, Oden says, for the artwork supplied by a teen-aged [[Cully Hamner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guts Lit Wire|url=http://guyslitwire.blogspot.com/2010/12/interview-with-scott-oden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oden's breakthrough novel was 2005's ''[[Men of Bronze]]''.  It was followed in 2006 by ''[[Memnon (novel)|Memnon]]'' and in 2010 with ''[[The Lion of Cairo]]'', which mixed pulp-style action and sorcery with Crusader politics in [[Fatimid Egypt]].

==Influences==
Oden identifies his writing influences as [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Mary Renault]], [[Harold Lamb]], [[Karl Edward Wagner]], and [[Steven Pressfield]].

The '''Sicani''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Σικανοί ''Sikanoi'') or '''Sicanians''' were one of three [[Ancient Italic people|ancient people]]s of [[Sicily]] present at the time of [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Greeks|Greek]] colonization. The Sicani dwelt east of the [[Elymians]] and west of the [[Sicels]], having, according to [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;Diod., v.6.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; the boundary with the last in the ancient Himera river ([[Salso]]) after a series of battles between these tribes.

==History==
The Sicani are thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily with a recorded name. The Greek historian [[Thucydides]]&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''His.'' VI,2,3,4.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed they immigrated from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (perhaps [[Valencia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sicily_-_History/id/5462681|publisher=Experience Festival|title=Sicily: Encyclopedia II – Sicily – History|date=7 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001248/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sicily_-_History/id/5462681|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7kGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=segre+sicano&amp;source=web&amp;ots=nafG4zc6s6&amp;sig=x-ViYce3dJazDQqY72a3_4RHjVc|publisher=Ensayo historico|title=Aapologetico de la literatura española contra los opiniones|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; driven by the [[Ligurians]] from the river [[Sicanus]], drawing his information from the Sicilian historian [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], but his basis for saying this is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-VmL59CfkcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=Thucydides+Sicani&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pFiBFCDMUE&amp;sig=Yhc2JLurSz8Is4r1lRLl3STfu4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result|title=Greek Identity in the Western Mediterranean|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] of [[Tauromenium]] considered them as aboriginal.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in [[Diodorus Siculus]] V,6,1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars think the Sicani may have been an [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe that gained control of areas previously inhabited by native tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John|title=The ancient Greeks: a critical history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=most+scholars+now+believe+that+the+sicans+and+Sicels,+as+well+as+the&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z0FtTO2tMMGblgflqoSKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20scholars%20now%20believe%20that%20the%20sicans%20and%20Sicels%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the&amp;f=false|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03314-0|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavation has shown that they had received some [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elymians]] are thought to be the next recorded people to settle Sicily, perhaps from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Anatolia]], or [[Liguria]]. They settled in the north-west corner of the island, forcing the Sicanians to move across eastward. The [[Sicels]] were the next to arrive, from mainland [[Italy]], and settled in the east. Historical records start with the Phoenicians, who established colonies in the 11th century BCE, and especially with the Greeks, who founded the colony of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], which eventually became the largest Greek city, in [[730s BC|734 BCE]]. Other Greek colonies were established around the island. The indigenous [[Sicilians]] were gradually absorbed by these colonizing peoples and finally disappeared as distinct peoples under Roman occupation.

The '''Slovak Red Cross Museum''' (Slovakian: '''Múzeum Slovenského Červeného kríža''') or simply '''SCK Museum''' is a specialized [[museum]] of the Slovak Red Cross with a nationwide scope. The museum operates under the authority of the Supreme Board of the Slovak Red Cross as an independent entity registered in the Slovak Ministry of Culture's Museum register.

Its mission is to document, research, preserve, collect, interpret and exhibit significant objects and themes in the areas of Red Cross history and [[humanitarian]] history in the territory of what is now the [[Slovak Republic]]. It is also Slovak's largest [[archive]] on humanitarian [[history]] of Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=muzeum&amp;ix=msck |title=Muzeum |publisher=muzeum.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the year 2000, the Supreme Body of the Slovak Red Cross entrusted Dr. [[Zora Mintalová - Zubercová]] to found the Slovak Red Cross Museum. The museum was established on February 1, 2000 and as soon as on February 24, 2000 it was ceremonially opened by an exhibition named „The Red Cross at Peace and War Times“.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viator.sk/get_presentation.php?pid=1951 |title=Muzeum Slovenskeho Cerveneho Kriza|publisher=SCK |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is headquartered in the 1927 former [[dispensary]] building of the Red Cross in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]], [[Slovakia]].
The town of Martin was choose as the seat of the Slovak Red Cross Museum, because it has got a long Red Cross tradition. In 1924 – 1938, Martin was the seat of the Slovak division of the [[Czechoslovak]] RC. This is mostly the credit of Dr. [[Alice Masarykova|Alica Masaryková]], the first president of the Czechoslovak RC (CSRC). She ensured and organized nationwide activities of the Red Cross from Martin: sanitary movement, nursing, [[humanitarian aid]], activities of young CSRC members and many others. An extensive publishing
activity of the CSRC had been associated with the names of renowned Slovak writers. The museum thoroughly documents and presents these history activities of the Red Cross in Slovakia.

==Activities==
As a result of its [[scientific]] and [[research]] activities the museum provides 2 to 3 premiere [[exhibitions]] each year. It also publishes books and textbooks on humanitarian history as well as on Slovak Red Cross history. The SCK-museum offers through its school [[awareness]] program specialized lectures on international [[humanitarian law]] for schools and other organizations, to teach the students the basic humanitarian principles and to promote [[humanism]] among the young generation. 
Documents and catalogues of the museum archive are provided through the museum's science program to [[researchers]] and students for preparation of their projects, seminars, or [[theses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zms.sk/doc/VS-SR-2010.pdf |title=Vyrocna sprava- Zvaz Muzei|publisher=ZMS |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2006 the SCK museum organized an international scientific conference "Červený Kríž, Alica G. Masaryková a Slovensko" under the patronage of the first lady of the Slovak Republic, Mrs. [[Silvia Gašparovičová]]. The conference was hosted in the Milan Rastislav Štefánik Institute in Martin. Among the 97 invited speakers and guests were also Sylvia Countess of Limerick, [[CBE]]; Dr. Marie L. Neudorflova from the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]], Dr. Bohumila Ferenčuhová from the [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21088">'''Succession of states''' is a [[political philosophy|theory]] and practice in [[international relations]] regarding ''successor states''. A '''successor state''' is a [[sovereign state]] over a territory and populace that was previously under the sovereignty of another state. The theory has its root in 19th-century [[diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/article/40377/the-term-state-succession-under-international-law-signifies-the-transmission-of-the-rights-and-obligations-of-one-state-to-another-in-consequence-of-territorial-sovereignty.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806182721/http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/article/40377/the-term-state-succession-under-international-law-signifies-the-transmission-of-the-rights-and-obligations-of-one-state-to-another-in-consequence-of-territorial-sovereignty.html |archivedate=2017-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor state often acquires a new [[international legal personality]], which is distinct from a [[continuing state]], also known as a continuator, which despite change to its borders retains the same legal personality and possess all its existing rights and obligations (such as a [[rump state]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=James|title=The Creation of States in International Law|year=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780199228423|pages=667–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partial and universal state succession ==
A state  succession can be characterized as either being ''universal'' or ''partial''. A universal state succession occurs when one state is completely extinguished and its sovereignty is replaced by that of one or more successor states. A partial state succession occurs when the state continues to exist after it has lost control of a part of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheir.org/kinds-of-state-succession.html|title=Kinds of State Succession|author=|date=|website=www.sheir.org|deadu=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807023508/http://www.sheir.org/kinds-of-state-succession.html|archivedate=2017-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a partial state succession is the case of the split of [[Bangladesh]] from [[Pakistan]], there was no challenge to Pakistan's claim to continue to exist and to retain its membership of the United Nations: it was a continua tor and not a successor. Bangladesh eventually was recognized as a new state: it was a successor and had to apply for UN membership.

An example of a universal state succession is the dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Neither part claimed any continuity: both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] were new successor states.

== Rights and obligations of successor states ==
Consequent upon the acquisition of [[International legal personality|international personality]], the difficult matter of succession to treaty rights and obligations arises.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"&gt;''Commonwealth and Colonial Law'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;
Succession may refer to the transfer of rights, obligations, and/or property from a previously well-established ''prior'' state (the predecessor state) to the new one (the successor state). Transfer of rights, obligations, and property can include overseas assets ([[diplomatic mission|embassies]], [[foreign-exchange reserves|monetary reserves]], [[museum]] artifacts), participation in [[treaty|treaties]], membership in [[international organization|international organizations]], and [[debt|debts]]. Often a state chooses piecemeal whether or not it wants to be considered the successor state. 

A special case arises, however, when the [[predecessor state]] was signatory to a [[human rights]] treaty, since it would be desirable to hold the successor state accountable to the terms of that treaty, regardless of the successor state's desires. [[Daniel Patrick O'Connelll]] wrote, "Practice is tending towards a de facto succession to at least those conventions which have a humanitarian aim."&lt;ref&gt;D.P. O'Connell, ''The Law of State Succession'', 1956, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties ===
In an attempt to codify the rules of succession of states, the [[Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties]] was drafted in 1978. It [[enter into force|entered into force]] on November 6, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXIII-2&amp;chapter=23&amp;clang=_en|title=Vienna Convention on succession of States in respect of treaties|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2018-06-26|publisher=[[United Nations Treaty Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 22 states are currently parties to the convention.

=== Population and nationality ===
A difficult question is what the consequences are for the inhabitants of a territory undergoing state succession. If the succession is partial, the inhabitants can become nationals of a state whose territory they reside outside of. If the succession is universal, they can become [[statelessness|stateless]], as the state that they held citizenship to ceases to exist. O'Connell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the first place, there is considerable disagreement as to the manner in which change of nationality may be brought about. One school of thought asserts that the nationality of inhabitants of absorbed territory is automatically changed at the moment of the substitution of the one State for the other. A second option considers that the inhabitants in question acquire the nationality of the successor state only by an express or tacit submission to the new sovereign. The more recent and widely accepted theory regards nationality as a matter solely of domestic jurisdiction, and contends that the successor State has a discretion as to the manner in which it extends its nationality to the inhabitants of territory which it acquires.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. O'Connell, ''The Law of State Succession'', 1956, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other scholars disagree and instead claim that the population is [[naturalized]] and receives citizenship of the new state. Charles Hyde wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whenever a State acquires from another part of its territory, the inhabitants of the area transferred, who were nationals of the former sovereign, are, in the absence of an agreement collectively naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hyde, ''II INTERNATIONAL LAW 1090'', 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ian Brownlie]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of the view that the population follows the change of sovereignty in matters of nationality&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brownlie, "The Relations of Nationality in Public International Law", 39 ''The British Yearbook of International Law'', 284, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rudolf Graupner wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most treaties on international law asserts that territorial change effects "automatically" a change of the nationality concerned unless there be special stipulations in the respective treaties. Which people are affected is often in dispute, but the people who are actually concerned are said to become automatically nationals of the successor State, i.e. they lose the old and immediately acquire the new nationality through the very act of annexation, cession, etc. Mostly, the existence of a rule of international law to that effect is assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Graupner, "Nationality and State Succession General Principles of the Effect of Territorial Changes on Individuals in International Law". {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512004807/https://www.jstor.org/stable/743190?seq=1 |date=2018-05-12 }}, 1945, p. 89. {{jstor|743190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Classification of cases==
In their application to the acquisition of independence, distinctions should be drawn between different cases though the line of demarcation is not always clear:&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt;

* Bilateral and multilateral treaties necessarily give rise to different considerations.
* There are ''real'' treaties and ''personal'' treaties. Real treaties affect the territory itself, such as boundary agreements or the grant of transit rights, which can continuing irrespective of the personality of the state. The new state must take over the country in the condition in which it finds it, as the parent state cannot give more than it possesses. Such treaties can be described as "treaties creating purely local obligations."&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt;

==Exceptions to orderly succession==
There are several recent examples where succession of states, as described above, has not been entirely adhered to. This is mostly a list of the exceptions that have occurred since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. In previous historical periods, the exceptions would be too many to list.

===Afghanistan===
The [[Taliban]] state in [[Afghanistan]] (the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]) became the ''de facto'' government of nearly all the country in the mid-1990s, but the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] was still recognised by many nations and retained the UN seat.

===China===
The [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was established in 1949 in [[Mainland China]], claiming "succession" from the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC). However, the succession of the PRC as the state of "China" was not initially recognized by many states because of Cold War politics and because the ROC continued to exist on the island of [[Taiwan]] and other islands, such as [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]. [[Pratas Islands|Pratas]] and [[Taiping Island|Taiping]]. Despite this situation, the ROC in [[Taiwan]] maintained their membership as "'''China'''" in the [[United Nations]], and a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]. However, the PRC was granted the seat of "China" in the [[United Nations]] and Security Council in 1971, in place of the ROC whose recognition was withdrawn and the representatives it had sent were expelled as unlawful representatives of China. This was done through the adoption of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|General Assembly Resolution 2758]]. {{As of|2014}}, the PRC exercises sovereignty over [[mainland China]], while the ROC continues to be unrecognised by the United Nations but exercises sovereignty over the [[Taiwan Area]], with both claiming they are the sole legitimate government of both the mainland and Taiwan.

===Ireland===
[[Ireland (state)|Ireland]], then called the [[Irish Free State]], seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. The new state took the view that when a new state comes into being after formerly being part of an older state, its acceptance of treaty relationships established by the older state is a matter for the new state to determine by express declaration, or by conduct in the case of each individual treaty.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt; In practice, however, the Irish regarded the commercial and administrative treaties of the United Kingdom previously applying to the territory of the Irish Free State as remaining in force.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt;

===Israel===
[[Israel]] took the view that, by virtue of its declaration of [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|independence in 1948]], a new international personality was created and that it started with a clean slate and was bound only by such of the former international obligations affecting the territory as Israel might accept.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt;

===Kampuchea/Cambodia===
When the [[Democratic Kampuchea]] led by [[Pol Pot]] was militarily displaced by the [[Vietnam]]ese-backed [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], the country's [[United Nations]] seat was held by Democratic Kampuchea for many years.

===Ottoman Empire/Turkey===
There is some debate over whether the modern [[Republic of Turkey]] is a continuing state to the [[Ottoman Empire]] or a successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8350310|title=Turkey: Successor or Continuing State of the Ottoman Empire?|first=EMRE|last=ÖKTEM|year=2011|volume=24|number=3|pages=561–583|journal=[[Leiden Journal of International Law]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017172010/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8350310|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two entities fought on opposing sides in the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–23), and even briefly co-existed as separate administrative units (whilst at war with one another): Turkey with its capital in [[Ankara]] and the Ottoman Empire from [[Istanbul]], but this type of scenario is also common in [[civil war]]s. The nationalist faction, led by [[Mustafa Kemal]] who defected from the Ottoman army, established the modern republic as a nation state (or new government regime) by defeating the opposing elements in the independence war. There remains debate whether the Turkish War of Independence was a war of independence, or a civil war that led to a regime change.

===Pakistan===
When Pakistan became independent it claimed that it was automatically a member of the [[United Nations]], as [[British India]] had been a [[India and the United Nations|founding member of the United Nations]] despite its colonial status. The United Nations Secretariat however expressed the following opinion:&lt;ref name="Stevens 1966"/&gt;

{{quote|From the viewpoint of International Law, the situation is one in which part of an existing State breaks off and becomes a new State. On this analysis there is no change in the international status of India; it continues as a State with all treaty rights and obligations, and consequently with all rights and obligations of membership in the United Nations. The territory which breaks off—Pakistan—will be a new State. It will not have the treaty rights and obligations of the old State and will not, of course, have membership in the United Nations. In International Law the situation is analogous to the separation of the Irish Free State from Britain, and Belgium from the Netherlands. In these cases the portion which separated was considered a new State, and the remaining portion continued as an existing State with all the rights and duties which it had before.}}

===Soviet Union===
International convention since the end of the [[Cold War]] has come to distinguish two distinct circumstances where such privileges are sought by such a successor state, in only the first of which may such successor states assume the name or privileged international position of their predecessor. The first set of circumstances arose at the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) in 1991. One of this federation's constituent republics, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] has declared itself to be "the continuator state of the USSR" on the grounds that it contained 51% of the population of the USSR and 77% of its territory. In consequence, [[Russia and the United Nations|Russia]] agreed that it would acquire the USSR's seat as a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bühler|first=Konrad G.|title=State Succession and Membership in International Organizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty7NAG1Jl-8C&amp;pg=PA161|series=Legal Aspects of International Organization Series|volume=Volume 38|year=2001|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789041115539|pages=161–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also accepted by the rest of the former states of the USSR; in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, at the time President of the Russian Federation, informed the Secretary-General that the membership of the Soviet Union in the Security Council and all other United Nations organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml|title=Member States of the United Nations - Russia*|publisher=the United Nations|accessdate=28 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230101646/http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Soviet embassies became Russian embassies.

On the other hand, the [[Baltic states]] represent a special case. An important tenet of the modern states of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] is that their incorporation into the [[Soviet Union]] from 1940 to 1991 constituted an illegal occupation. In 1991 when each Baltic state regained their independence [[State continuity of the Baltic states|they claimed continuity]] directly from their pre-1940 status. Many other states share this view, and as such, these states were not considered either predecessor or successor states of the Soviet Union. As a consequence, the Baltic states were able to simply re-establish diplomatic relations with countries, re-affirm pre-1940 treaties still in force, and resume membership to international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bühler|first=Konrad G.|title=State Succession and Membership in International Organizations|series=Legal Aspects of International Organization Series|volume=Volume 38|year=2001|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789041115539|pages=177–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia===
After four of the six constituent republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] [[Secession|seceded]] in 1991 and 1992, the [[rump state]], renamed the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], stated it was the continuation of the state of Yugoslavia—against the objections of the newly independent republics.  Representatives from [[Belgrade]] continued to hold the original Yugoslavian UN seat—however, the [[United States]] refused to recognize it. The remaining territory of the federation was less than half of the population and territory of the former federation.  In 1992 the [[Security Council]] on September 19 ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 777|Resolution 777]]) and the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on September 22, decided to refuse to allow the new federation to sit in the General Assembly under the name of "Yugoslavia" on the theory that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia|had dissolved]]. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]]) was admitted as a new member to the United Nations in 2000; in 2006, [[Montenegro]] declared independence and [[Serbia]] continued to hold the federation's seat. Additionally, [[Kosovo]] [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence in 2008]].

{{see also|Timeline of the Han dynasty|Timeline of the Jin dynasty (265–420)}}

This is a '''timeline of the [[Three Kingdoms]]''' period (220–280) of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. In a strict academic sense, the Three Kingdoms period refers to the interval between the founding of the state of [[Cao Wei]] (220–266) in 220 and the conquest of the state of [[Eastern Wu]] (229–280) by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin dynasty]] (265–316) in 280.  However, many Chinese historians and laymen extend the starting point of this period back to the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] that took place in 184 during the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25–220).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">'''William Robertson Coe II''' (28 November 1926 &amp;ndash; 23 November 2009) was an American academic, [[archaeologist]] and [[Mayanist]] scholar, renowned for his extensive [[archaeological field survey|field work]] and publications on [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] sites. He is best known for his decades of work and investigations at [[Tikal]], the major site in the [[Petén Basin]] region of modern-day [[Guatemala]] and one of the largest and most dominant Maya sites of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]]. Coe led the excavation and investigation project at Tikal during the 1960s, and was responsible for coordinating much of the site's restoration work and compiling the voluminous documentation of the field seasons' reports. His academic career was spent in association with the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he studied and later taught as professor in anthropology, and its [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] where he curated the museum's American collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">'''William Andrew "Bill" Saturno'''  is an American [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Mayanist]] scholar who has made significant contributions toward the study of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. As of February 2015, Saturno holds a position as Assistant Professor in Archaeology at [[Boston University]]'s College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). . He is also the Director of the Proyecto San Bartolo-Xultun at the Instito de Antropologia e Historia in Guatemala, a National Space SciResearch Scientist at the Marshall Space Flight Center, as well as a Research Associate at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. Prior to his position at BU, Saturno was a lecturer at the University of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saturno|first1=William|title=Dr. William Saturno Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/files/2015/10/Saturno-CV-2015-Feb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Saturno is most well known for his discovery of the discovery in 2001 of one of the oldest extant murals yet discovered in the Maya region, at the site of San Bartolo in northeastern Guatemala.[1]  Of this discovery, he has said that it was his favorite and most challenging experience of his career, and that "being the first person to see them [the murals] after more than 2,000 years, uncovering them bit by bit, with each part more beautiful than the last, is an experience unlikely to be matched." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Biography|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/william-saturno/|website=National Geographic Explorers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, Saturno and Franco Rossi discovered what they believe to be a workroom of a Xultún record keeper. The Mayan hieroglyphics at the site included representations of dates roughly 7000 years in the future, casting doubt on the speculation that the conclusion of the Long Count calendar would result in a 2012 doomsday scenario
His current research interests are New World and Mesoamerican civilizations, landscape archaeology, remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application in archaeology, Mesoamerican iconography and religion, the evolution of complex societies, and archaeology in pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. William Saturno, Biography|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/profile/saturno/|website=Boston University: Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and personal life ==
Born in Albany, New York, Saturno wanted to be an archaeologist since he was a small child, and first became interested in ancient Maya civilization when he visited the Maya site of Palenque while working in Mexico. Having worked in archaeology for over 20 years, in an interview with National Geographic he stated: "I see being an archaeologist as both a great privilege and a great responsibility. I have been entrusted with the recovery, interpretation, and preservation of the material remains of the past, with the history of an ancient people, and the heritage of a modern one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Biography|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/william-saturno/|website=National Geographic Explorers}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last 7 years, when he is not teaching or conducting field work, Saturno has led scholarly tours in Guatemala and Maya Mexico for Archaeological Tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholar: William Saturno|url=http://archaeologicaltrs.com/scholars/prof-william-saturno-2/|website=Archaeological Tours}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Saturno currently lives with his wife and their three sons James, David, and Giancarlo, in Clinton, Connecticut and enjoys soccer, opera, and snowboarding in his free time.

== Education and academia ==

He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Arizona with a B.A. in Anthropology and Latin American Studies after attending Binghampton University for a time. He then acquired his Master of Arts Degree from Harvard University in 1995 and his PhD in Anthropology from Harvard University in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saturno|first1=William|title=Dr. William Saturno Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/files/2015/10/Saturno-CV-2015-Feb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Harvard University, he worked as a Teaching Fellow, Undergraduate Tutor, and Teaching Assistant in the Anthropology Department. Following the completion of their PhD program, Saturno then went on to become a lecturer in 2000, and  an Assistant Professor in 2003. At this time he also became a Research Scientist at NASA, in the Marshall Space Flight Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saturno|first1=William|title=Dr. William Saturno Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/files/2015/10/Saturno-CV-2015-Feb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Saturno has been awarded more than 2.3 million dollars from over 45 grants throughout his career as an archaeologist, including the extremely prestigious Peabody Museum Research Grant, National Endowment for the Humanities Collaborative Research Grant, and the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation for his work in San Bartolo and the, National Aeronautics and Space Administration IPA for work in Archaeological Remote Sensing (CV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Biography|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/william-saturno/|website=National Geographic Explorers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fieldwork and projects==

His most famous discovery to date, Saturno has worked continuously in San Bartolo since 2001 in an ongoing project. Work originally centered on the Preclassic murals of San Bartolo, but more recently is focused on the large, nearby city of Xultun and the changes in Maya politics and kingship from the Preclassic to European contact.

Since 2013, he has directed field work in Northern Peru, using remote sensing techniques like Landsat and ASTER to find archaeological features in the area and commercial sugarcane plantation environments.  ancient Peruvians adapted to their coastal desert environment and how ancient land use has had lasting effects on environmental functions.

He has also conducted extensive excavation, survey, and mapping of ancient Maya and Peruvian archaeological sites, including the ancient Maya city of Copan and Rio Bravo in Belize.

==Publications and media appearances==

Saturno has written 3 books to date and contributed to over 8 compilated archaeological volumes. In 2000 he published his PhD dissertation as In the Shadow of the Acropolis: Rio Amarillo and Its Role in the Copan Polity. He published The Murals of San Bartolo, El Peten, Guatemala, Part 1: The North Wall and its companion The Murals of San Bartolo, El Peten, Guatemala, Part 2: The West Wall with noted Maya scholar Karl Taube in 2005 and 2010, respectively.  He has also written several academic articles on the subjects of San Bartolo, ancient Maya religion and iconography, Maya political organization  and collapse, among many other Mesoamerican subjects, most recently in the journals "Ancient Mesoamerica", "American Anthropologist", "Antiquity", and "Science".

Saturno works extensively with National Geographic, from which he has received many grants, and has appeared in many of their broadcasts on the ancient Maya, and the ancient Mayan 'prophecy' about the 2012 'Apocalypse' (he very vocally disagreed with the interpretation of the Maya calendar predicting the end of the world) as well as several National Geographic LIVE events. Most recently he has appeared in National Geographic LIVE's event New Light on the Ancient Maya in 2013 and will be appearing in another of their events, In Search of the Ancient Maya, where he will be giving an overview of the archaeological history of the Classic Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Search of the Ancient Maya with William Saturno|url=http://www.bu.edu/news/2012/12/11/boston-university-professor-reminds-us-the-mayan-calendar-doesn%E2%80%99t-say-the-world-will-end/|publisher=National Geographic Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was featured in The History Channel's Indiana Jones and the Ultimate Quest.

'''Ġebel ġol-Baħar''' is an alleged [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temple]] located underwater off the coast of [[St. Julian's]], [[Malta]]. The site was identified in 1999 by retired real estate investor Hubert Zeitlmair,&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Mark|title=The Truth, And Some Other Stuff, Is Out There|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/aliens.html|website=Archaeology.org|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106105840/http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/aliens.html|archivedate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follower of [[Zecharia Sitchin]], but it was never studied properly and archaeologists are not convinced that the site is actually a temple.

==Site==
The site is located on an underwater plateau approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[St. Julian's]]. The plateau is 900 by 500&amp;nbsp;metres long, and its highest point seems to be man-made, and is 19&amp;nbsp;metres below sea level.

The site contains large boulders which Zeitlmair believed to be man-made and not natural, and which are covered in vegetation. Zeitlmair describes it as consisting of a cluster of three [[stone circle]]s with 'rooms' with a diameter of 9 to 11&amp;nbsp;metres, with parts having a height up to 6 to 10&amp;nbsp;metres. An 'avenue' goes up to the entrance of the structure, which faces east. Tracks on the seabed resembling cart ruts were also observed on the site.&lt;ref name=micallef2006/&gt;

==Discovery==
The site was discovered on 13 July 1999 by Shaun Arrigo and his brother Kurt, who were working under the instructions of Hubert Zeitlmair, a retired German real estate investor interested in [[pseudoarchaeology]]. The discovery was reported in the local media in October 1999, but after some time interest died down.&lt;ref name=micallef2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Micallef|first1=Etienne|title=16th May 2006 - The Cornerstone of Atlantis Seminar|url=http://www.csacmalta.org/uploads/media/OrAcLe_No_18.pdf|website=The Oracle|publisher=Calypso Sub Aqua Club|accessdate=27 April 2015|pages=20–21|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of the site were conducted by Zeitlmair in November 1999 and May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zeitlmair|first1=Hubert|last2=Zeitlmair|first2=Dagmar|title=Report of marine exploration at the underwater temple site of Ĝebel Ĝol-Bahar in May / June 2000|url=http://www.maltadiscovery.org/en/index.html#uwr_02,07_Under_water_research/02.htm|website=maltadiscovery.org|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeitlmair believes that the temple was built by aliens in around 10,000 BC to 12,000 BC, and was submerged at the end of the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]] during the [[Genesis flood narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Tony|title=Hubert Zeitlmair|url=http://atlantipedia.ie/samples/tag/hubert-zeitlmair/|website=Atlantipedia|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that he has been guided by his "primeval ancestors, namely... the God Pa.tha-i-da.na Asu.ara tSi.dha, and the Goddess Ashtar-tara Queen of Atlantis" who he met on Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zeitlmair|first1=Hubert|title=Home|url=http://maltadiscovery.org/en/index.html#home,00_Home/01.htm|website=maltadiscovery.org|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His judgment does not fit within Malta's prehistoric chronology, as the earliest known human habitation of the island began in around 5900 BC.&lt;ref name="times2018-03-16"&gt;{{cite news|title=700 years added to Malta's history|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180316/life-features/700-years-added-to-maltas-history.673498|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=16 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316111529/https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180316/life-features/700-years-added-to-maltas-history.673498|archivedate=16 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the site bears similarities to the temple of [[Ħaġar Qim]] on mainland Malta.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The site was given the name ''Ġebel ġol-Baħar'', meaning "Stones in the Sea" in the [[Maltese language]]. It has also been linked with the island of [[Atlantis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater Temples &amp; Atlantis|url=http://www.carnaval.com/malta/atlantis/|website=carnaval.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zeitlmair has published a book about this in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeitlmair|first1=Hubert|title=Die Säulen von Atlantis - Malta|date=2001|publisher=Ancient-Mail-Verlag|isbn=9783935910002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5N0SAwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Die+S%C3%A4ulen+von+Atlantis+-+Malta|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Maltese archaeologists are not convinced that the site is a megalithic temple.&lt;ref name=philipcoppens&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coppens|first1=Philip|title=Malta: the small island of the giants|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/malta.html|website=philipcoppens.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people who dived there said that the boulders which make up the site are not megalithic, but are modern ones which were dumped illegally.&lt;ref name=micallef2006/&gt;

In 2013, marine scientists at the [[University of Malta]] discovered that 20,000 years ago, the Maltese islands were indeed much larger, and were connected to [[Sicily]] with a [[land bridge]]. However, there was no mention of Ġebel ġol-Baħar during the studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta 20,000 Years Ago|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/news_on_campus/features/2013/university_of_malta_led_study_finds_maltas_hidden_landscape|website=University of Malta|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Rose, Online Editorial Director for the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], has written that "Chronology appears to be somewhat confused in Zeitlmair's interpretation. According to the web site, he sees links between the submerged "temple" and both Noah's Flood and the rise in sea level following the end of the Ice Age (the period to which, he told Maltamag, he hopes studies will show the Maltese temples date). Furthermore, the presence of deeper sand deposits on the west side of the "ruins," the side toward Gibraltar, than on the east side is taken as an indication that the flooding of the Mediterranean by Atlantic waters (which really did occur) was involved in the inundation of the "temple." The Mediterranean flooding, however, took place some five million years ago. As to the builders of the temples, Zeitlmair defers to Zechariah Sitchin."&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;
