'''''A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms''''' is a painting by the Netherlandish artist [[Pieter Aertsen]] (1508–1575).&lt;ref name="USF"/&gt; It was completed in 1551.&lt;ref name="NCMOA"/&gt; A large painting, it depicts a peasant [[genre art|market scene]], with an abundance of meats&lt;ref name="Eisenman 2013"/&gt; and other foods. In the background, it shows a scene from the biblical theme of the [[flight into Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KjJRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |p=185 |title=The Dark Side of Knowledge: Histories of Ignorance, 1400 to 1800 |author=Cornel Zwierlein |publisher=BRILL |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Virgin Mary]] is seen stopped on the road, giving alms to the poor.&lt;ref name="USF"/&gt; Thus, although the painting seems to be at first sight an ordinary [[still life]] concentrating on foodstuffs, it is rich with [[symbol]]ism; it in fact hides a symbolic religious meaning, and embodies a [[metaphor|visual metaphor]] encouraging spiritual life. Aertsen made a name for himself during the 1550s painting scenes from everyday life in a naturalistic manner.&lt;ref name="WMP-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/aertsen/butchers-stall/|title=Butcher's Stall with the Flight into Egypt|publisher=Webmuseum, Paris|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCMOA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncartmuseum.org/art/detail/a_meat_stall_with_the_holy_family_giving_alms|title=A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms|author=|publisher=[[North Carolina Museum of Art]]|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painter==
[[File:Pieter Aertsen - Market Scene - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|388px|Aertsen's paintings of fruit and vegetable stalls, such as ''Market Scene'' ''(pictured)'', are similar in composition to that of ''A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms''.]]

[[Pieter Aertsen]] was a masterful still-life painter from [[Amsterdam]], who worked for many years in [[Antwerp]]. He was a representative of the 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]] style, more specifically [[Northern Mannerism]], a new era for painting in the [[Netherlands]] and the German countries characterised by precise observation and naturalism that gave the art of painting impulses of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Many Northern artists travelled to Italy to study, where they were influenced by the innovations of the [[Italian Renaissance]] and in turn influenced the Italian Renaissance painters with techniques such as the newly developed technique of [[oil painting]].&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;

Aertsen is regarded as one of the founders of the still life painting.&lt;ref name="WMP-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caitboo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/asset-viewer/the-meat-stall-with-the-flight-into-egypt/XAGzcGkvzNxg5g?hl=en|title=The Meat Stall with the Flight into Egypt – Workshop of Pieter Aertsen|publisher=Google Cultural Institute|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Early Renaissance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/tl/it-ren/early.html|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eyck, Jan van"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/eyck//|title=Eyck, Jan van |publisher=Webmuseum, Paris|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His style was particularly new: he mixed characteristics of the [[still life]] and the [[genre painting]] in his works, which, like ''A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms'', are seen as pioneers in the still life genre that grew out of details of paintings containing [[figure subject]]s. His compositions in the Flemish tradition were remarkably original, like this painting of a meat stall, with a large, life-size still life in the foreground and three smaller scenes appearing through openings in the background.&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;

Since the Protestants [[The Reformation and art|rejected the tradition of Catholic arts]], many of Aertsen's paintings were destroyed by the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], especially his [[altarpiece]]s, some of which were chopped into pieces. Only the parts of the paintings containing the less religious details were spared. Thus, the era of religious paintings declined in the Protestant countries. Aertsen painted ''A Meat Stall'' a few years before he moved to  [[Amsterdam]] from [[Antwerpen]].&lt;ref name="WMP-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caitboo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Early Renaissance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eyck, Jan van"/&gt;

==Painting==
The artwork of ''A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms'' consists of a large painting on panel in [[oil painting|oil]],&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krohn Levy 2015"/&gt; depicting a profusion of [[food]]stuffs in a highly realistic style, while the narrative is hidden in the background, seen through the stall windows and openings. Aertsen's paintings were often made in an "inverted still life" style in which the still-life aspects were in the foreground and the narrative aspects in the background.&lt;ref name="USF"/&gt; The viewer's senses are distracted by the rich display of various [[food]]s&amp;nbsp;– plates in the foreground, [[meat]]s, ham, [[lard]], smoked fish, pigs' legs and head, [[bread]], [[butter]], [[milk]], [[cheese]]&lt;ref name="Eisenman 2013"/&gt; and hanging [[pretzel]]s (in the left corner)&amp;nbsp;– that has been spread out in front of the viewer, and the figure subject is overwhelmed by the still-life composition. The various meats, including [[sausage]]s, [[beef]], [[fish]], [[fowl]] and [[pork]], are arranged on wooden tables, using baskets, pots and plates. A barrel and some wickerwork chairs serve as containers for the food items as well.&lt;ref name="GCI-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/still-life-with-meat-and-the-holy-family/MQF94Yhmzoiz1g|title=Still Life with Meat and the Holy Family, 1551|publisher=[[Google Cultural Institute]]|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms - Placard.jpg|thumb|180px|left|This sign &lt;!-- in the upper right corner --&gt; reads in [[Flemish]]: "behind here are 154 [[Rod (unit)|rods]] of land for sale immediately, either by the rod according to your convenience or all at once".&lt;ref name="Houghton 2001"/&gt;]]

Almost unnoticed at first are glimpses through the stall windows of an imaginary [[landscape]] with a road. Through the smaller window in the middle is a second landscape with a distant view. These small landscapes are hiding a religious narrative: they depict the [[Holy Family]] distributing alms on their journey to Egypt to escape from Herod's harassment. The other people depicted on the road are walking in the direction of the church. Both those people and the Holy family are dressed in contemporary Netherlandish clothing. On the right side, behind a figure drawing water from the well, there is a tavern with [[Genre art|genre figures]] depicting a [[merry company]] eating [[oyster]]s and [[mussel]]s. In front of the tavern hangs a pig carcass that is very similar to Rembrandt's painting of a [[Slaughtered Ox|slaughtered ox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryfoodlab.com/hungry-world/2015/02/die-kunst-des-fleisches|title=The art of the meat|publisher=Contemporary Food Lab|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground around the inn is covered with [[oyster]] shells, which [[Allusion|allude]] to lust. In the tavern there is a scene showing the biblical theme of the [[prodigal son]], and the woman depicted in the tavern may be a prostitute with her customers. The painting is rich with symbolic representation: it conveys hidden messages. The fish, displayed crossed on a pewter plate, are a reference to [[Lent]], when the faithful abstained from eating meat. The contrast between the charity of the poor fugitives giving alms and the richness and abundance of the food conveys a certain [[religious symbolism]] and hidden meaning, linking to the idea of "food for the body" with the idea of "food for the soul", the spiritual "bread of life", appealing to the viewers to turn their attention away from the things of this world. The entire Holy Family is depicted in this part of the painting.&lt;ref name="Eisenman 2013"/&gt; Mary, holding the [[Christ child]] and riding a [[donkey]], led by Joseph, offers bread to a poor family,&lt;ref name="USF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenman 2013"/&gt; sharing what little they have. The young boy and his father are receiving the bread from Mary, with the bread representing the Eucharist. The abundance and richness of the food in the stall is probably a satire on [[gluttony]].&lt;ref name="Eisenman 2013"/&gt; The meat can also be seen as a symbolic representation of, and allusion to, the 'weak flesh' (Matthew 16:41). The slaughtered animals may symbolise the death of a believer, a fairly common [[iconography]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{efn|It was quite common for theologians to see an allusion to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41), which may well have been associated with Aertsen's ''Butcher's Stall'' where&amp;nbsp;– as on his fruit and vegetable stalls&amp;nbsp;– a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.}}&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMP-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibiblio.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/tl/north-ren/|title=The Northern Renaissance (1500–1615)|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GCI-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/a-meat-stall-with-the-holy-family-giving-alms/fgF8j5tB3UFgAg|title=A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551|publisher=Google Cultural Institute|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/food/hd_food.htm |title=Food and Drink in European Painting, 1400–1800|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-meat-stall-with-the-flight-into-egypt/XAGzcGkvzNxg5g|title=The Meat Stall with the Flight into Egypt, 1551 – 1555|publisher=Google Cultural Institute|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caitboo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caitboo.com/?p=801|title=Still Life|publisher=Art Makes you Smart|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/aertsen/meatsell.html|title=

In the upper right-hand part of the painting, a handwritten sign is posted on a wood placard.&lt;ref name="Houghton 2001"/&gt; In [[Flemish]], the variety of the Dutch language spoken in Flanders in northern Belgium, it reads, "behind here are 154 [[Rod (unit)|rods]] of land for sale immediately, either by the rod according to your convenience or all at once".&lt;ref name="Houghton 2001"/&gt; Scholarly discussion about the sign has reached a general consensus that the message "functions as a metaphorical commentary on this scene", conveying a warning about society losing spiritual wealth by placing too great an emphasis upon material gain.&lt;ref name="Houghton 2001"/&gt;

[[File:0024MAN-Antinous.jpg|190px|thumb|Bust of Antinous from [[Patras]], ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]])]]
'''Antinous''' (also ''Antinoüs'' or ''Antinoös''; {{lang-grc|Ἀντίνοος}}; 27 November, c. 111 &amp;ndash; before 30 October 130&lt;ref&gt;The day and month of his birth come from an inscription on a tablet from [[Lanuvium]] dated 136 AD; the year is uncertain, but Antinous must have been about 18 when he drowned, the exact date of which place is itself not clear: certainly a few days before 30 Oct. 130 AD when Hadrian founded the city of Antinoöpolis, possibly on the 22nd (the Nile festival) or more likely the 24th (anniversary of the death of [[Osiris]]). See Lambert, p. 19, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a  [[Bithynia]]n Greek youth and a [[favourite]], or [[Greek love#Ancient Rome|lover]], of the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]].{{sfn|Birley|2000|p=144}} He was [[Apotheosis|deified]] after his death, being worshiped in both the [[Greek East and Latin West]], sometimes as a god (''theos'') and sometimes merely as a hero (''heros'').&lt;ref&gt;Renberg, Gil H.:  ''Hadrian and the Oracles of Antinous (SHA, ''Hadr.'' 14.7); with an appendix on the so-called ''Antinoeion'' at Hadrian’s Villa and Rome’s Monte Pincio Obelisk'', Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 55 (2010) [2011], 159-198; Jones, Christopher P., ''New Heroes in Antiquity:  From Achilles to Antinoos'' (Cambridge, Mass. &amp; London, 2010), 75-83; Bendlin, Andreas: ''Associations, Funerals, Sociality, and Roman Law:  The collegium of Diana and Antinous in Lanuvium (CIL 14.2112) Reconsidered,'' in M. Öhler (ed.), Aposteldekret und antikes Vereinswesen:  Gemeinschaft und ihre Ordnung (WUNT 280; Tübingen, 2011), 207-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Antinous' life, although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis (present day [[Bolu]], Turkey), in the [[Roman province]] of [[Bithynia]]. He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to Italy for a higher education. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the Empire as part of Hadrian's personal retinue. Antinous accompanied Hadrian during his attendance of the annual [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] in Athens, and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in Libya. In October 130, as they were part of a flotilla going along the Nile, Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances. Various suggestions have been put forward for how he died, ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional [[human sacrifice]] or [[suicide]].

Following his death, Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised cult devoted to his worship that spread throughout the Empire. Hadrian founded the city of [[Antinopolis]] close to Antinous's place of death, which became a cultic centre for the worship of [[Osiris|Osiris-Antinous]]. Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antinopolis and [[Athens]], with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian's dreams of pan-Hellenism.

Antinous became associated with homosexuality in Western culture, appearing in the work of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]].

==Biography==
The Classicist [[Caroline Vout]] noted that most of the texts dealing with Antinous's biography only dealt with him briefly and were post-Hadrianic in date, thus commenting that "reconstructing a detailed biography is impossible".{{sfn|Vout|2007|p=54}} The historian Thorsten Opper noted that "Hardly anything is known of Antinous' life, and the fact that our sources get more detailed the later they are does not inspire confidence."{{sfn|Opper|1996|p=170}} Antinous's biographer Royston Lambert echoed this view, commenting that information on him was "tainted always by distance, sometimes by prejudice and by the alarming and bizarre ways in which the principal sources have been transmitted to us."{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=48}}

===Childhood===
[[File:Antinous (Museo del Prado E-60) 01.jpg|thumb|190px|Antinous bust of the [[Prado]] museum, Royal collection, [[Madrid, Spain|Madrid]]]]
It is known that Antinous was born to a Greek family in the city of [[Bolu|Claudiopolis]], which was located in the [[Roman province]] of [[Bithynia]] in what is now north-west Turkey.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=15}} The year of Antinous's birth is not recorded, although it is estimated that it was probably between 110 and 112 AD.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=19}} Early sources record that his birthday was in November, and although the exact date is not known, Lambert asserted that it was probably on 27 November.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=19}} Given the location of his birth and his physical appearance, it is likely that part of his ancestry was not Greek.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=20}}

There are various potential origins for the name "Antinous"; it is possible that he was named after the character of Antinous, who is one of [[Penelope]]'s suitors in [[Homer]]'s epic poem, the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Another possibility is that he was given the male equivalent of [[Antinoë]], a woman who was one of the founding figures of [[Mantineia]], a city which probably had close relations with Bithynia.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=19}} Although many historians from the [[Renaissance]] onward asserted that Antinous had been a slave, only one of around fifty early sources claim this, and it remains unlikely, as it would have proved heavily controversial to deify a former slave in Roman society.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=20&amp;ndash;21}} There is no surviving reliable evidence attesting to Antinous's family background, although Lambert believed it most likely that his family would have been peasant farmers or small business owners, thereby being socially undistinguished yet not from the poorest sectors of society.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}} Lambert also considered it likely that Antinous would have had a basic education as a child, having been taught how to read and write.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=22}}

===Life with Hadrian===
[[File:Marble busts of Hadrian (left, 117-138 CE, probably from Rome) and Antinous (right, 130-138 CE, from Rome). Antinous was Hadrian's lover. He met Hadrian in 120s CE and died in the Nile, Egypt, in 130 CE.

The Emperor Hadrian spent much time during his regime touring his Empire, and arrived in Claudiopolis in June 123, which was probably when he first encountered Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=60}} Given Hadrian's personality, Lambert thought it unlikely that they had become lovers at this point, instead suggesting it probable that Antinous had been selected to be sent to Italy, where he was probably schooled at the imperial paedagogium at the [[Caelian Hill]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} Hadrian meanwhile had continued to tour the Empire, only returning to Italy in September 125, when he settled into his villa at [[Tibur]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=63}} It was at some point over the following three years that Antinous became his personal favourite, for by the time he left for Greece three years later, he brought Antinous with him in his personal retinue.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=63}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The way that Hadrian took the boy on his travels, kept close to him at moments of spiritual, moral or physical exaltation, and, after his death, surrounded himself with his images, shows an obsessive craving for his presence, a mystical-religious need for his companionship."|source=—Royston Lambert, 1984{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=97}}}}

Lambert described Antinous as "the one person who seems to have connected most profoundly with Hadrian" throughout the latter's life.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=30}} Hadrian's marriage to [[Vibia Sabina|Sabina]] was unhappy,{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=39}} and there is no reliable evidence that he ever expressed a sexual attraction for women, in contrast to much reliable early evidence that he was sexually attracted to boys and young men.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=90&amp;ndash;93}} For centuries, [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|sexual relations between a man and a boy had been socially acceptable]] among Greece's leisured and citizen classes, with an older ''erastes'' (aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an ''eromenos'' (aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in their education;{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=78}} and Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although bisexuality was the norm in the upper echelons of Roman society by the early 2nd century.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=81&amp;ndash;83}}

It is known that Hadrian believed Antinous to be intelligent and wise, which might explain part of the attraction.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=63}} Another factor was potentially a shared love of hunting, which was seen as a particularly manly pursuit in Roman culture.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=65}} Although none survive, it is known that Hadrian wrote both an autobiography and erotic poetry about his boy favourites; it is therefore likely that he wrote about Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=48}} Early sources are explicit that the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous was sexual.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=94}} During their relationship, there is no evidence that Antinous ever used his influence over Hadrian for personal or political gain.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=73&amp;ndash;74}}

In March 127, Hadrian &amp;ndash; probably accompanied by Antinous &amp;ndash; traveled through the [[Sabine]] area of Italy, [[Picenum]], and [[Campania]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=71}} From 127 to 129 the Emperor was then afflicted with an illness that doctors were unable to explain.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=71}} In April 128 he laid the foundation stone for a temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome, during a ritual where he may well have been accompanied by Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=71}} From there, Hadrian went on a tour of North Africa, during which he was accompanied by Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=71&amp;ndash;72}} In late 128 Hadrian and Antinous landed in [[Corinth]], proceeding to [[Athens]], where they remained until May 129, accompanied by Sabina, the Caeserii brothers, and Pedanius Fuscus the Younger.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=100&amp;ndash;106}} It was in Athens in September 128 that they attended the annual celebrations of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Great Mysteries of Eleusis]], where Hadrian was initiated into the position of ''epoptes'' in the [[Telesterion]]. It is generally agreed, although not proven, that Antinous was also initiated at that time.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=101&amp;ndash;106}}

[[File:Luk Konstantyna 6DSCF0032.JPG|right|thumb|The [[tondo (art)|tondo]] depicting Hadrian's lion hunt, accompanied by Antinous]]

From there they headed to [[Asia Minor]], settling in [[Antioch]] in June 129, where they were based for a year, visiting [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]], and [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. From there, Hadrian became increasingly critical of Jewish culture, which he feared opposed Romanisation, and so introduced policies banning circumcision and building a Temple of Zeus-Jupiter on the [[Temple Mount|former site]] of the [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]] . From there, they headed to Egypt.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=110&amp;ndash;114}} Arriving in [[Alexandria]] in August 130, there they visited the sarcophagus of [[Alexander the Great]]. Although welcomed with public praise and ceremony, some of Hadrian's appointments and actions angered the city's Hellenic social elite, who began to gossip about his sexual activities, including those with Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=115&amp;ndash;117}}

Soon after, and probably in September 130, Hadrian and Antinous traveled west to [[Roman Libya|Libya]], where they had heard of a Marousian lion causing problems for local people. They hunted down the lion, and although the exact events are unclear, it is apparent that Hadrian saved Antinous' life during their confrontation with it, before the beast itself was killed.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=118&amp;ndash;121}} Hadrian widely publicised the event, casting bronze medallions of it, getting historians to write about it, commissioning [[Pancrates]] to write a poem about it, and having a [[tondo (art)|tondo]] depicting it created which was later placed on the [[Arch of Constantine]]. On this tondo it was clear that Antinous was no longer a youth, having become more muscular and hairy, perceptibly more able to resist his master; and thus it is likely that his relationship with Hadrian was changing as a result.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=118&amp;ndash;121}}

===Death===
[[File:024MAD Antinous.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Antinous (Delphi)]], polychrome [[Parian marble]], made during the reign of [[Hadrian]] (r. 117-138 AD)]]
In late September or early October 130, Hadrian and his entourage, among them Antinous, assembled at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] to set sail upstream as part of a flotilla along the [[River Nile]]. The retinue included officials, the Prefect, army and naval commanders, as well as literary and scholarly figures. Possibly also joining them was [[Lucius Aelius|Lucius Ceionius Commodus]], a young aristocrat whom Antinous might have deemed a rival to Hadrian's affections.{{Sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=121, 126}} On their journey up the Nile, they stopped at [[Hermopolis Magna]], the primary shrine to the god [[Thoth]].{{Sfn|Lambert|1984|p=126}} It was shortly after this, in October 130 &amp;ndash; around the time of the festival of [[Osiris]] &amp;ndash; that Antinous fell into the river and died, probably from drowning.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=127&amp;ndash;128}} Hadrian publicly announced his death, with gossip soon spreading throughout the Empire that Antinous had been intentionally killed.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=128}} The nature of Antinous's death remains a mystery to this day, and it is possible that Hadrian himself never knew; however, various hypotheses have been put forward.{{sfnm|1a1=Lambert|1y=1984|1p=142|2a1=Vout|2y=2007|2p=57}}

One possibility is that he was murdered by a conspiracy at court. However, Lambert asserted that this was unlikely because it lacked any supporting historical evidence, and because Antinous himself seemingly exerted little influence over Hadrian, thus meaning that an assassination served little purpose.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=129}} Another suggestion is that Antinous had died during a voluntary [[castration]] as part of an attempt to retain his youth and thus his sexual appeal to Hadrian. However, this is improbable because Hadrian deemed both castration and [[circumcision]] to be abominations and as Antinous was aged between 18 and 20 at the time of death, any such operation would have been ineffective.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=130}} A third possibility is that the death was accidental, perhaps if Antinous was intoxicated. However, in the surviving evidence Hadrian does not describe the death as being an accident; Lambert thought that this was suspicious.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=134}}

Another possibility is that Antinous represented a voluntary [[human sacrifice]]. Our earliest surviving evidence for this comes from the writings of [[Dio Cassius]], 80 years after the event, although it would later be repeated in many subsequent sources. In the 2nd century Roman Empire, a belief that the death of one could rejuvenate the health of another was widespread, and Hadrian had been ill for many years; in this scenario, Antinous could have sacrificed himself in the belief that Hadrian would have recovered. In this situation, Hadrian might not have revealed the cause of Antinous's death because he did not wish to appear either physically or politically weak. Conversely, opposing this possibility is the fact that Hadrian disliked human sacrifice and had strengthened laws against it in the Empire.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=130&amp;ndash;141}}

Hadrian was devastated by the death of Antinous, and possibly also experiencing remorse.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=143}} In Egypt, the local priesthood immediately [[Apotheosis|deified]] Antinous by identifying him with Osiris due to the manner of his death.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=144&amp;ndash;145}} In keeping with Egyptian custom, Antinous' body was probably embalmed and mummified by priests, a lengthy process which might explain why Hadrian remained in Egypt until spring 131.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=144&amp;ndash;145}} While there, in October 130 Hadrian proclaimed Antinous to be a deity and announced that a city should be built on the site of his death in commemoration of him, to be called [[Antinopolis]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=146, 149}} The deification of human beings was not uncommon in the Classical world, however the public and formal divinisation of humans was reserved for the Emperor and members of the imperial family; thus Hadrian's decision to declare Antinous a god and create a formal cult devoted to him was highly unusual, and he did so without the permission of [[Roman Senate|the Senate]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=146&amp;ndash;147}} Although the cult of Antinous therefore had connections with the [[imperial cult]], it remained separate and distinct.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=177}} Hadrian also identified a star in the sky between the Eagle and the Zodiac to be Antinous,{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=150&amp;ndash;151}} and came to associate the rosy lotus that grew on the banks of the Nile as being the flower of Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=153}}

It is unknown exactly where Antinous' body was buried. It has been argued that either his body or some relics associated with him would have been interred at a shrine in Antinopolis, although this has yet to be identified archaeologically.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=155}} However, a surviving [[obelisk]] contains an inscription strongly suggesting that Antinous' body was interred at Hadrian's country estate, the [[Villa Adriana]] at [[Tibur]] in Italy.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=158&amp;ndash;160}}
[[File:The Antinoeion, Hadrian's Villa (16036504998).jpg|left|thumb|The remains of the Antinoeion at Hadrian's Villa]]

It is unclear whether Hadrian genuinely believed that Antinous had become a god.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=149}} He would have also had political motives for creating the organised cult, for it enshrined political and personal loyalties specifically to him.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=148}} In October 131 he proceeded to [[Athens]], where from 131-32 he founded the [[Panhellenion]], an attempt to foster Greek self-consciousness, erode the feuding endemic to the Greek city-states, and promote the worship of the ancient gods; being Greek himself, the god Antinous helped Hadrian's cause in this, representing a symbol of pan-Hellenic unity.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=148, 163&amp;ndash;164}} In Athens, Hadrian also established a festival to be held in honour of Antinous in October, the [[Antinoeia]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=165}}

Antinous was understood differently by his various worshippers, in part due to regional and cultural variation. In some inscriptions he is identified as a divine hero, in others as a god, and in others as both a divine hero and a god. Conversely, in many Egyptian inscriptions he is described as both a hero and a god, while in others he was seen as a full god, and in Egypt, he was often understood as a [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=178&amp;ndash;179}} Inscriptions indicate that Antinous was seen primarily as a benevolent deity, who could be turned to aid his worshippers.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=181&amp;ndash;182}} He was also seen as a conqueror of death, with his name and image often being included in coffins.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=181}}

===Antinopolis===

The city of Antinopolis was erected on the site of Hir-we. All previous buildings were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of [[Ramses II]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=149}} Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antinopolis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, [[Bes]], to continue to be worshipped in Antinopolis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=150}} He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=199}} The city was designed on a [[gridiron plan|gridiron]] plan that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antinous, as well as a temple devoted to the deity.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=200&amp;ndash;202}}

[[file:SheikhAbadaSettlement2.jpg|right|thumb|The site of Antinopolis in Egypt]]
Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antinous. Known as the [[Antinoeia]], they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=149, 205}}

Antinopolis continued to grow into the Byzantine era, being Christianised with the conversion of the Empire, however it retained an association with magic for centuries to come.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=199&amp;ndash;200, 205&amp;ndash;206}} Over the centuries, stone from the Hadrianic city was removed for the construction of homes and mosques.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=206}} By the 18th century, the ruins of Antinopolis were still visible, being recorded by such European travelers as Jesuit missionary [[Claude Sicard]] in 1715 and [[Edme-François Jomard]] the surveyor circa 1800.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=198}} However, in the 19th century, Antinopolis was almost completely destroyed by local industrial production, as the chalk and limestone was burned for powder while stone was used in the construction of a nearby dam and sugar factory.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=207}}

===The cult's spread===
[[File:Antinoo FitzwilliamMuseumCambridge ARS SUMMUM.JPG|thumb|The [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|"Lansdowne]] Antinous" was found at [[Hadrian's Villa]] in 1769 ([[Fitzwilliam Museum]], Cambridge)]]
Hadrian was keen to disseminate the cult of Antinous throughout the Roman Empire. He focused on its spread within the Greek lands, and in Summer 131 travelled these areas promoting it by presenting Antinous in a syncretised form with the more familiar deity [[Hermes]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=152}} On a visit to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] in 131, he proclaimed the foundation of a temple devoted to Hermes, where the deity was probably venerated as Hermes-Antinous.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=162}} Although Hadrian preferred to associate Antinous with Hermes, he was far more widely syncretised with the god [[Dionysus]] across the Empire.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=180}}
The cult also spread through Egypt, and within a few years of its foundation, altars and temples to the god had been erected in Hermopolis, Alexandria, [[Oxyrhynchus]], [[Tebytnis]], [[Lykopolis]], and [[Luxor]].{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=152}}

The cult of Antinous was never as large as those of well established deities such as [[Zeus]], [[Dionysus]], [[Demeter]], or [[Asclepios]], or even as large as those of cults which were growing in popularity at that time, such as [[Isis]] or [[Serapis]], and was also smaller than the official imperial cult of Hadrian himself.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=184}} However, it was able to spread throughout the Empire, with traces of the cult having been found in at least 70 cities, although its strength was far greater in certain regions than others.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=184}} Although the adoption of the Antinous cult was in some cases done to please Hadrian, the evidence makes it clear that the cult was also genuinely popular among the different societal classes in the Empire.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=190&amp;ndash;191}}
Part of the appeal was that Antinous had once been human himself, and thus was more relatable than many other deities.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=177&amp;ndash;178}} In Egypt, Athens, Macedonia, and Italy, children would be named after the deity.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=192}}
[[File:Antinous Pio-Clementino Inv256 n3.jpg|left|thumb|Antinous ([[Museo Pio-Clementino]])]]
At least 28 temples were constructed for the worship of Antinous throughout the Empire, although most were fairly modest in design; those at Tarsos, Philadelphia, and Lanuvium consisted of a four-column portico. It is likely however that those which Hadrian was directly involved in, such as at Antinopolis, Bithynion, and Mantineria, were often grander, while in the majority of cases, shrines or altars to Antinous would have been erected in or near the pre-existing temples of the imperial cult, or Dionysus or Hermes.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=184&amp;ndash;185}} Worshippers would have given [[votive offerings]] to the deity at these altars; there is evidence that he was given gifts of food and drink in Egypt, with libations and sacrifices probably being common in Greece.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=186}} Priests devoted to Antinous would have overseen this worship, with the names of some of these individuals having survived in inscriptions.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=186}} There is evidence of oracles being present at a number of Antinoan temples.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=186}}

Sculptures of Antinous became widespread, with Hadrian probably having approved a basic model of Antinous' likeness for other sculptors to follow.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=165}}{{sfn|Vermeule|1979|p=95}} These sculptures were produced in large quantities between 130 and 138, with estimates being in the region of around 2000, of which at least 115 survive.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=189&amp;ndash;190}} 44 have been found in Italy, half of which were at Hadrian's Villa Adriana, while 12 have been found in Greece and Asia Minor, and 6 in Egypt.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=188}} Over 31 cities in the Empire, the majority in Greece and Asia Minor, issued coins depicting Antinous, chiefly between the years 134&amp;ndash;35. Many were designed to be used as medallions rather than currency, some of them deliberately made with a hole so that they could be hung from the neck and used as [[talisman]]s.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=189}}{{sfn|Vermeule|1979|p=95}}
Most production of Antinous-based artefacts ceased following the 130s, although such items continued to be used by the cult's followers for several centuries.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=194}} Later survivals of his cult largely rested in the Eastern Roman Empire, where his acceptance into the pantheon of gods was better received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesiscommons.org/8jfp3|title=Antinous: From the Pederastic to the Divine|last=Wong|first=Desmond|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games held in honour of Antinous were held in at least 9 cities, and included both athletic and artistic components.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=187}} The games at Bythynion, Antinopolis, and Mantineia were still active by the early 3rd century, while those at Athens and Eleusis were still operating in 266&amp;ndash;67.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=195}} Rumours spread throughout the Empire that at Antinous' cultic centre in Antinopolis, there were "sacred nights" characterised by drunken revelries, perhaps including sexual orgies.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=186&amp;ndash;187}}

===Condemnation and decline===
The cult of Antinous was criticised by various individuals, both pagan and Christian.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=192&amp;ndash;193}} Critics included followers of other pagan cults, such as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias8A.html 8.9.7 and 8.9.8]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]], and the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], who were all sceptical about the apotheosis of Antinous, as well as the [[Sibylline oracles]], who were critical of Hadrian more generally. The pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] also criticised it for what he perceived as the debauched nature of its Egyptian devotees, arguing that it led people into immoral behaviour, in this way comparing it to Christianity.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=192&amp;ndash;193}} Surviving examples of Christian condemnation of the Antinous cultus come from figures like [[Tertullian]], [[Origen]], [[Jerome]], and [[Epiphanios]]. Viewing the religion as a blasphemous rival to Christianity, they insisted that Antinous had simply been a mortal human and condemned his sexual activities with Hadrian as immoral. Associating his cult with malevolent magic, they argued that Hadrian had imposed his worship through fear.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=193&amp;ndash;194}}

During the struggles between Christians and pagans in Rome during the 4th century, Antinous was championed by members of the latter. As a result of this, the Christian poet [[Prudentius]] denounced his worship in 384, while a set of seven [[contorniate]]s depicting Antinous were issued, based upon the designs of those issued in the 130s.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=196}}
Many sculptures of Antinous were destroyed by Christians, as well as by invading barbarian tribes, although in some instances were then re-erected; the Antinous statue at [[Delphi]] had been toppled and had its forearms broken off, before being re-erected in a chapel elsewhere.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=195&amp;ndash;196}} 
Many of the images of Antinous remained in public places until the official prohibition of pagan religions under the reign of Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] in 391.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=196}}

===Revival===
Some contemporary [[Neo-Pagan]] groups have re-sacralized Antinous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antinopolis.org/|title=Temple of Antinous}}&lt;/ref&gt; His modern cult mainly attracts LGBT polytheists.

== In Roman sculpture ==
Hadrian "turned to [Greek sculptors] to perpetuate the melancholy beauty, diffident manner, and lithe and sensuous frame of his boyfriend Antinous,"{{sfn|Wilson|1998|p=440}} creating in the process what has been described as "the last independent creation of Greco-Roman art".{{sfn|Vout|2007|p=72}} It is traditionally assumed that they were all produced between Antinous' death in 130 and that of Hadrian in 138, on the grounds that no-one else would be interested in commissioning them.{{sfnm|1a1=Vout|1y=2005|1p=83|2a1=Vout|2y=2007|2p=87}} The assumption is that official models were sent out to provincial workshops all over the empire to be copied, with local variations permitted.{{sfn|Vout|2007|pp=77–78}} It has been asserted that many of these sculptures "share distinctive features &amp;ndash; a broad, swelling chest, a head of tousled curls, a downcast
gaze &amp;ndash; that allow them to be instantly recognized".{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=198}}

By 2005, Classicist Caroline Vout could note that more images have been identified of Antinous than of any other figure in classical antiquity with the exceptions of Augustus and Hadrian.{{sfn|Vout|2005|p=82}} She also asserted that the Classical study of these Antinous images was particularly important because of his "rare mix" of "biographical mystery and overwhelming physical presence".{{sfn|Vout|2005|p=82}}

Lambert believed that the sculptures of Antinous "remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world",{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=80}} also describing them as "the final great creation of classical art".{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=209}}

There are also statues in many archaeological museums in Greece including the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the archaeological museums of Patras, [[Chalkis]] and [[Delphi]]. Although these may well be idealised images, they demonstrate what all contemporary writers described as Antinous's extraordinary beauty. Although many of the sculptures are instantly recognizable, some offer significant variation in terms of the suppleness and sensuality of the pose and features versus the rigidity and typical masculinity. In 1998 monumental remains were discovered at [[Hadrian's Villa]] that archaeologists claimed were from the tomb of Antinous, or a temple to him,&lt;ref&gt;Mari, Zaccaria and Sgalambro, Sergio: "The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa: Interpretation and Architectural Reconstruction", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol 111, No 1, Jan. 2007,&lt;/ref&gt; though this has been challenged both because of the inconclusive nature of the archaeological remains and the overlooking of patristic sources (Epiphanius, Clement of Alexandria) indicating that Antinous was buried at his temple in Antinopolis, the Egyptian city founded in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Renberg, pp. 181-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural references ==
Antinous remained a figure of cultural significance for centuries to come; as Vout noted, he was "arguably the most notorious pretty boy from the annals of classical history".{{sfn|Vout|2007|p=52}}
Sculptures of Antinous began to be reproduced from the 16th century; it remains likely that some of these modern examples have subsequently been sold as Classical artefacts and are still viewed as such.{{sfn|Vout|2005|pp=83&amp;ndash;84}}
Antinous has attracted attention from the gay subculture since the 18th century, the most illustrious examples for this being [[Prince Eugène of Savoy]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia.{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=198}}

Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as "a gay icon".{{sfn|Vout|2007|p=53}}
Novelist and independent scholar [[Sarah Waters]] identified Antinous as being "at the forefront of the homosexual imagination" in late 19th-century Europe.{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=194}} In this, Antinous replaced the figure of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=195}} Gay author [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he wrote under the pseudonym of "Numa Numantius".{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=195}} In 1893, homophile newspaper ''The Artist'', began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s.{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=195}}

At the time, Antinous' fame was increased by the work of fiction and writers and scholars, many of whom were not gay or lesbian.{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=196}}

The author [[Oscar Wilde]] referenced Antinous in both "[[The Young King]]" (1891) and "The Sphinx" (1894).{{sfn|Waters|1995|p=195}} In "The Young King", a reference is made to the king kissing a statue of 'the Bithynian slave of Hadrian' in a passage describing the young king's aesthetic sensibilities and his ''"...strange passion for beauty..."''. Images of other classical paragons of male beauty, [[Adonis]] and [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], are also mentioned in the same context. Additionally, in Wilde's ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', the artist Basil Hallward describes the appearance of Dorian Gray as an event as important to his art as "the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture."  Furthermore, in a novel attributed to Oscar Wilde, ''[[Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal]]'', Des Grieux makes a passing reference to Antinous as he describes how he felt during a musical performance.  "...I now began to understand things hitherto so strange, the love the mighty monarch felt for his fair Grecian slave, Antinous, who – like unto Christ – died for his master's sake."&lt;ref&gt;''Teleny, or the Reverse of the Medals'', vol. 1 [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Teleny,_or_The_Reverse_of_the_Medal,_t._I.djvu/22 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Les Miserables]]'', the character [[Enjolras]] is likened to Antinous. "A charming young man who was capable of being a terror. He was angelically good-looking, an untamed Antinous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Misérables|last = Hugo|first = Victor|publisher = Penguin Classics|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0-14-044430-8|location = Penguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England|pages = 556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo also remarks that Enjolras was "seeming not to be aware of the existence on earth of a creature called woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les Misérables|last = Hugo|first = Victor|publisher = Penguin Classics Ltd|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0-14-044430-8|location = Penguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England|pages = 557}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way he can also be linked to an Antinoan ideal of male desire and beauty.

In "Klage Um Antinous", ''Der Neuen Gedichte'', ''Anderer Teil'' (1908) by Rainer Maria Rilke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33864/33864-h/33864-h.htm |title=Der Neuen Gedichte |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian scolds the gods for Antinous's deification. "Lament for Antinoüs", translation by Stephen Cohn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRCJwgmfhzYC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=lament+for+antinous+rilke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E2J6WxF19W&amp;sig=MuRB3hStbXhrlP5hpubMz9d68hU&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=lament%20for%20antinous%20rilke&amp;f=false |title=Neue Gedichte - Rainer Maria Rilke - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote a long poem entitled ''Antinous'', but he only published it in 1918, close to the end of World War I, in a slim volume of English verse. In 1921 he published a new version of this poem in ''English Poems'', a book published by his own publishing house, Olisipo.

In [[Marguerite Yourcenar]]'s ''Mémoires d'Hadrien'' (1951), the love relationship between Antinous and Hadrian is one of the main themes of the book.

A "sexually ambivalent" young man ('Murugan Mailendra') in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962) is likened to Antinous, and his lover Colonel Dipa (an older man) to Hadrian, after the narrator discovers the two are having a secret affair.

The story of Antinous' death was dramatized in the radio play "The Glass Ball Game", Episode Two of the second series of the BBC radio drama ''[[Caesar!]]'', written by [[Mike Walker (radio dramatist)|Mike Walker]], directed by [[Jeremy Mortimer]] and starring [[Jonathan Coy]] as "[[Suetonius]]", [[Jonathan Hyde]] as "[[Hadrian]]" and [[Andrew Garfield]] as "Antinous".  In this story, Suetonius is a witness to the events before and after Antinous's death by suicide, but learns that he himself was used as an instrument to trick Antinous into killing himself willingly to fulfill a pact made by Hadrian with Egyptian priests to give Hadrian more time to live so that [[Marcus Aurelius]] may grow up to become the next Emperor.

Antinous is seen walking with the other gods to war in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novel ''[[American Gods]]''. In ''[[Tipping the Velvet]]'' (novel by [[Sarah Waters]] and its television adaptation), the lesbian protagonist Nan Astley dresses as Antinous for a costume party held by her partner.

On 13 October 2018, in Toronto, the Canadian Opera Company premiered "Hadrian" the second opera by Rufus Wainwright, which tells the tale of the Emperor's grief and his all consuming need to discover the details surrounding Antinous's death.

[[Image:Glutathione-skeletal.svg|thumb|250px|Structure of the antioxidant [[glutathione]].]]

'''Antioxidants''' are [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that inhibit [[Redox|oxidation]]. Oxidation is a [[chemical reaction]] that can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], thereby leading to [[chain reaction]]s that may damage the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of organisms. Antioxidants such as [[thiol]]s or [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions. To balance the [[Oxidation state|oxidative state]], plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]] and [[enzyme]]s (e.g., [[catalase]] and [[superoxide dismutase]]), produced internally, or the [[dietary]] antioxidants vitamin C, and [[vitamin E]].

The term "antioxidant" is mostly used for two entirely different groups of substances: [[industrial chemicals]] that are added to products to prevent oxidation, and naturally occurring compounds that are present in foods and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The former, industrial antioxidants, have diverse uses: acting as [[preservative]]s in food and cosmetics, and being [[redox|oxidation]]-inhibitors in fuels.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|doi=10.1002/14356007.a16_719.pub2|chapter=Automotive Fuels|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2007|vauthors=Dabelstein W, Reglitzky A, Schütze A, Reders K |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2 | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY-YtwEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to diet ===

Although certain levels of antioxidant [[vitamins]] in the diet are required for good health, there is still considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidants are health-promoting in the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake.&lt;ref name="Stanner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenkin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shenkin A | title = The key role of micronutrients | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16376462 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2005.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodside JV, McCall D, McGartland C, Young IS | title = Micronutrients: dietary intake v. supplement use | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–53 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16313697 | doi = 10.1079/PNS2005464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases,&lt;ref name="Stanner"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanner SA, Hughes J, Kelly CN, Buttriss J | title = A review of the epidemiological evidence for the 'antioxidant hypothesis' | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–22 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15153272 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2003543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/?p=ER Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]''. [[World Cancer Research Fund]] (2007). {{ISBN|978-0-9722522-2-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and others declare that the hypothesis is unproven and misguided.&lt;ref name=Hail&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hail N, Cortes M, Drake EN, Spallholz JE | title = Cancer chemoprevention: a radical perspective | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–110 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18454943 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.04.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyphenol]]s, which often have antioxidant properties [[in vitro]], are not necessarily antioxidants [[in vivo]] due to extensive [[metabolism]] following digestion.&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|title=Flavonoids|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis|date=2016|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many polyphenols the [[catechol]] group acts as an [[electron acceptor]] and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26867192|year=2016|vauthors=Csepregi K, Neugart S, Schreiner M, Hideg É|title=Comparative Evaluation of Total Antioxidant Capacities of Plant Polyphenols|journal=Molecules|volume=21|issue=2|pages=208|doi=10.3390/molecules21020208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by [[catechol-O-methyl transferase]], and is therefore no longer able to act as an electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect [[cell-to-cell signaling]], [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] sensitivity, [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[enzyme]] activity or [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C | title = Flavonoids: antioxidants or signalling molecules? | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 838–49 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15019969 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Virgili&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Virgili F, Marino M | title = Regulation of cellular signals from nutritional molecules: a specific role for phytochemicals, beyond antioxidant activity | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1205–16 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18762244 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dietary antioxidants have been investigated for potential effects on [[neurodegenerative disease]]s such as [[Alzheimers|Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinsons|Parkinson's disease]], and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Matteo V, Esposito E | title = Biochemical and therapeutic effects of antioxidants in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | journal = Current Drug Targets.

A [[paradox]] in [[metabolism]] is that, while the vast majority of complex [[life|life on Earth]] requires [[oxygen]] for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davies KJ | title = Oxidative stress: the paradox of aerobic life | journal = Biochemical Society Symposium | volume = 61 | pages = 1–31 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8660387 | doi=10.1042/bss0610001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant [[metabolite]]s and [[enzyme]]s that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as [[DNA]], [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref name="Sies"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sies H | title = Oxidative stress: oxidants and antioxidants | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–5 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9129943 | doi = 10.1113/expphysiol.1997.sp004024 | url = http://ep.physoc.org/content/82/2/291.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vertuani"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vertuani S, Angusti A, Manfredini S | title = The antioxidants and pro-antioxidants network: an overview | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 10 | issue = 14 | pages = 1677–94 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15134565 | doi = 10.2174/1381612043384655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sies" /&gt; However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as [[redox signaling]].

== Examples of bioactive antioxidant compounds ==
Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in lipids ([[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytosol]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from lipid peroxidation.&lt;ref name="Sies" /&gt; These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.&lt;ref name="Vertuani" /&gt; The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in [[Bodily fluid|body fluids]] and tissues, with some such as glutathione or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in [[pathogen]]s and can be [[virulence factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller RA, Britigan BE | title = Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8993856 | pmc = 172912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudière J, Ferrari-Iliou R | title = Intracellular antioxidants: from chemical to biochemical mechanisms | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 37 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 949–62 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10541450 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00090-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sies H | title = Strategies of antioxidant defense | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS | volume = 215 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–9 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 7688300 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18025.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.&lt;ref name="Vertuani" /&gt; The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.&lt;ref name="Vertuani" /&gt;

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] [[transition metal]]s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].&lt;ref name="Pathways Ofoxidativedamage"/&gt; [[Selenium]] and zinc are commonly referred to as ''antioxidant nutrients'', but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants is an area of current research, but vitamin C, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body.&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; However, less data is available for other dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider C | title = Chemistry and biology of vitamin E | journal = Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–30 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15580660 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.200400049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halliwell B | title = Are polyphenols antioxidants or pro-oxidants?

That is, paradoxically, agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional [[pro-oxidant]]s and actually increase oxidative stress. Besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as [[homocysteine]]. Typically, this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. Another example is the postulated role of [[homocysteine]] in atherosclerosis.

Oxidative damage in DNA can cause cancer. Several antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It has been proposed that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khan MA, Tania M, Zhang D, Chen H |title=Antioxidant enzymes and cancer |journal=Chin J Cancer Res |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=87–92 |year=2010 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/4h2277984v0t180k/ |doi=10.1007/s11670-010-0087-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in technology ==

=== Food preservatives ===
Antioxidants are used as [[food additive]]s to help [[preservative|guard against food deterioration]]. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], storing plant materials in [[Anaerobic organism#Metabolism|anaerobic]] conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kader AA, Zagory D, Kerbel EL | title = Modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647417 | doi = 10.1080/10408398909527490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zallen EM, Hitchcock MJ, Goertz GE | title = Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–7 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 1184900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|tertiary butylhydroquinone]] (TBHQ), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iverson F | title = Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–54 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7600543 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3835(95)03787-W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=5 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070304151341/http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robards K, Kerr AF, Patsalides E | title = Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review | journal = The Analyst | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–24 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 3288002 | doi = 10.1039/an9881300213 | bibcode = 1988Ana...113..213R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur]]ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in [[aluminium foil]] or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A | title = Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 13 | pages = 4072–9 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15212450 | doi = 10.1021/jf049806z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent rancidity.

=== Industrial uses ===
[[Image:Antioxidant.png|thumb|right|250px|Substituted [[phenols]] and derivatives of [[p-Phenylenediamine|phenylenediamine]] are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline (petrol).]]
Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3233–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01617a026 |year=1955 |vauthors=Boozer CE, Hammond GS, Hamilton CE, Sen JN |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=77 |issue=12 |title=Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons.1II.

Antioxidant [[polymer stabilizers]] are widely used to prevent the degradation of [[polymer]]s such as rubbers, plastics and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives|url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=27 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211063739/http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id=| archivedate= 11 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers containing [[double bond]]s in their main chains, such as [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]], are especially susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[ozonolysis]]. They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a "crazy paving" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product. Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a [[primary carbon atom]]. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in [[low-density polyethylene]].

Other antioxidants are not obtained from the diet, but instead are made in the body. For example, [[ubiquinol]] (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the [[mevalonate pathway]].&lt;ref name="Turunen" /&gt; Another example is [[glutathione]], which is made from amino acids.

=== Measurement and invalidation of ORAC ===
Measurement of antioxidant content in food is not a straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In [[food science]], the [[oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) was once an industry standard for estimating antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives, mainly from the presence of [[polyphenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao G, Alessio HM, Cutler RG | title = Oxygen-radical absorbance capacity assay for antioxidants | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–11 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8458588 | doi = 10.1016/0891-5849(93)90027-R  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ou B, Hampsch-Woodill M, Prior RL | title = Development and validation of an improved oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 4619–26 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11599998 | doi = 10.1021/jf010586o }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier measurements and ratings by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] were withdrawn in 2012 as biologically irrelevant to human health, referring to an absence of physiological evidence for polyphenols having antioxidant properties ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name=USDAx&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/docs.htm?docid=15866 |title=Withdrawn: Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods, Release 2 (2010) |date=16 May 2012 |website= |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from ''in vitro'' experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or [[biology]].

Alternative ''in vitro'' measurements of antioxidant content in foods &amp;ndash; also based on the presence of polyphenols &amp;ndash; include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior RL, Wu X, Schaich K | title = Standardized methods for the determination of antioxidant capacity and phenolics in foods and dietary supplements | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 4290–302 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15884874 | doi = 10.1021/jf0502698 | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/Policy.pdf | accessdate = 24 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161229203509/https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/Policy.pdf | archive-date = 29 December 2016 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]), [[polyphenol]]s and [[tocopherol]]s. The evolution of [[angiosperm]] plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments&amp;nbsp;– particularly during the [[Jurassic]] period&amp;nbsp;– as chemical defences against [[reactive oxygen species]] that are byproducts of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzie IF | title = Evolution of dietary antioxidants | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–26 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14527634 | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00368-9 | hdl = 10397/34754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the [[fouling]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattill HA | title = Antioxidants | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 16 | pages = 177–92 | year = 1947 | pmid = 20259061 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.16.070147.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = German JB | volume = 459 | pages = 23–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10335367 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-4853-9_3 | isbn = 978-0-306-46051-7 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | title = Impact of Processing on Food Safety | chapter = Food Processing and Lipid Oxidation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of [[Vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[Vitamin E|E]] as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of [[Organism|living organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Jacob RA | title = Three eras of vitamin C discovery | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 25 | pages = 1–16 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8821966 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4613-0325-1_1 | isbn = 978-1-4613-7998-0 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kZdtMAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight JA | title = Free radicals: their history and current status in aging and disease | journal = Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 331–46 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9846200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible [[mechanisms of action]] of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moureu C, Dufraisse C |year=1922 |title=Sur l'autoxydation: Les antioxygènes|journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances et Mémoires de la Société de Biologie |volume=86 |pages=321–322|language=French | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into how [[vitamin E]] prevents the process of [[lipid peroxidation]] led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] [[reactive oxygen species]] before they can damage cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf G | title = The discovery of the antioxidant function of vitamin E: the contribution of Henry A.

'''Artificial Intelligence System''' ('''AIS''') was a [[distributed computing]] project undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with [[artificial consciousness]] and [[artificial general intelligence]]. They claimed to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02# |title=Artificial Intelligence System Video |publisher=OVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving into the developmental phase.

==Science==
The project's initial goal was recreating the largest brain simulation to date, performed by neuroscientist [[Eugene M. Izhikevich]] of The Neurosciences Institute in [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of 27 3-gigahertz processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |title=Computer Model of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|title=why did I do that? |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

On July 12, 2008, AIS announced that the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |title=The distributed brain |publisher=Information-age.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2011-06-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194758/http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of the other applications.

AIS simulated the brain via an [[artificial neural network]], and used [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The project utilized the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In version 1.08 of the software each work unit received by a volunteer simulated 500,000 [[neuron]]s for 100 milliseconds at 5 millisecond time steps (the estimated firing rate of a human neuron).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The application had four primary modules—for creating neurons, simulating neurons, visualizing neurons, and finally, knowledge acquisition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Intention was that the neuronal generator would eventually use [[genetic algorithms]] to generate neurons for simulation. The neuron simulator used mathematical models to simulate those neurons. Initially Hodgkin–Huxley models were used, but more models (perhaps hundreds) were intended to be utilized in the future. The visualization software was to allow the administrators to monitor and control the neuronal simulators. The knowledge acquisition module involved feeding information to the system and training it to build its knowledge base.

The AIS project had successfully simulated over 700 billion neurons by April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"The distributed brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was closed in November 2010 as the BOINC program of the project did not work.

'''William Agnew''' (9 January 1898 – ?) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Pollok F.C.|Pollok]], [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]], [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], [[Arthurlie F.C.|Arthurlie]], and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].

==Playing career==
Agnew played for [[Pollok F.C.|Pollok]], [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]], before moving down to England to sign with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in September 1921.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=4|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Port-Vale-Personalities-Jeff-Kent/dp/0952915200}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit a total of five goals in 31 appearances in the [[1921–22 Port Vale F.C. season|1921–22]] season, and scored his first goal in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] on 29 October, in a 1–0 win at [[South Shields F.C.

'''Breffu''' was an [[Akwamu]] leader of the [[1733 slave insurrection on St. John]] (then known as ''St. Jan'') in [[Danish West Indies]]. She committed suicide with 23 other rebels to evade capture as the rebellion weakened in 1734.

Breffu was enslaved at a plantation owned by Pieter Krøyer, and lived in [[Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands|Coral Bay]].{{sfnp|Norton|2013|p=300}} On 23 November 1733, hearing the signal of a canon fired from Fort Fredericksvaern, Breffu entered the main house and killed both Krøyer and his wife. Taking all gunpowder and ammunition, and accompanied by fellow slave Christian, Breffu then proceeded to the Van Stell family house, where she killed three members of the plantation owner's family.{{sfnp|Norton|2013|p=69}}

'''Charles George Elers Napier''' (22 May 1812 &amp;ndash; 20 December 1847), was a British naval officer.

==Early life==
Born Charles Elers, he was the second son of Lieutenant Edward Elers, RN and his wife Frances Elizabeth, née Younghusband. His uncle was [[George Elers]]. In 1815 his mother, now widowed, married Captain [[Charles John Napier|Charles Napier]], the future admiral, who adopted her children as his own and gave them his name in addition to Elers. Charles Elers Napier entered the Royal Navy at the age of 12, his first ship being [[HMS Ganges (1821)|HMS ''Ganges'']].

==Career==
In 1830 he was assigned, with the rank of mate, to the frigate [[HMS Galatea (1810)|HMS ''Galatea'']], then commanded by his stepfather, remaining in her until she paid off in January 1832. Later that year he passed the examination for Lieutenant and was assigned to the gunnery school in [[HMS Excellent (1787)|HMS ''Excellent'']]. When during Portugal's [[Liberal Wars]] his stepfather was appointed Admiral of the navy of [[Dom Pedro]], he accompanied him as aide-de-camp, with the temporary rank of captain, and distinguished himself by his bravery in the fourth [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)]] in which the navy of [[Dom Miguel]] was defeated. When his stepfather's flagship came alongside the Miguelite [[ship-of-the-line]] ''Rainha'', Elers Napier and one other officer were the first to board her and were then cut off as the ships yawed apart. Before reinforcements could come to their aid they were both severely wounded: Elers Napier had five serious and ten minor injuries, and owing to his head injuries from sabre cuts he was rendered partially deaf for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Elers Napier (1862), Volume I, pp. 203&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt; For his gallantry he was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] by Dom Pedro. After he recovered he was appointed by his father to command of the sloop ''Portuense'', and then to the corvette ''Sibylle'', in which he sailed to [[Madeira]] to demand the surrender of the Miguelite governor. Subsequently, the ship, renamed ''Eliza'' in honour of his mother, was engaged in blockade duties off the Portuguese coast.

After his return to England, Elers Napier served from 1836 to 1837 as a lieutenant in [[HMS Vernon (1832)|HMS ''Vernon'']] in the Mediterranean. When the [[First Anglo-Chinese War]] broke out he was appointed to the command the brig-sloop [[HMS Pelican (1812)|HMS ''Pelican'']] on the China Station. Being superseded in this command he was on shore in China for a period and then became aide-de-camp to Admiral [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Shenstone|Sir William Parker]], taking part with him in the [[Battle of Chinkiang|capture of Chinkiang]] by scaling the walls on 21 July 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Elers Napier (1862), Volume II, p. 185 (citing the obituary in the ''United Service Magazine'', February 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1847, having been made [[Post Captain]], he was appointed to the command of the steam frigate [[HMS Avenger (1845)|HMS Avenger]], joining her at Lisbon, but had been in her only a few weeks when, having left [[Gibraltar]] on course for [[Malta]], she was wrecked at night in foul weather on the Sorelle Rocks off the island of [[Galita]], with the loss of all but eight of her complement. Elers Napier had just given the order to lower the boats when he was washed overboard; his body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilly | first = William Octavius Shakespeare | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Narratives of shipwrecks of the Royal navy between 1793 and 1849 | publisher = John W.

'''Henry Edward Clonard Keating''' (13 December 1871 – 1898) was a [[Nova Scotian]] and celebrated military officer who served [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] on [[Niger River]] in [[Nigeria]] ([[British West Africa]]) when he was killed in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Keating began in the [[Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment]]. From there he requested to be succonded to the [[West African Frontier Force]]. As part of the 1st Battaltion, Lieut. Keating arrived at Lokoja on 2 May 1898.  He made the trek up river approximately 400 miles to Lafagou, reaching his destination on 12 September 1898.  By October, the attrition rate was reported to be 63% of the Europeans, officers and NCOs, dead or invalided home because of the climate and disease.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating had 22 men from which to command a sixty mile district from [[Lafagu, Nigeria]] to [[Rofia]] and [[Illah]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He was stationed in Lafagu and every six weeks had to visit Rofia and Illecon.  He took his first tour of inspection of his own-river posts early in October.  When it came time to return to Lafagu, on October 9, Keating went with 14 of his troops to the island village of Hela, near [[Yelwa]], for additional canoes.  The tribe refused Keatings request. In response, Keating killed the king of the village, expropriated the canoes he needed, and abducted the men required to work them.  The villagers attacked Keating with bow and arrow and spears.  Keating and his men returned fire.  Keating's troops soon ran out of ammunition.  A hand to hand fight ensured in which a number of Keating's party were killed on shore before a remnant of the party was finally able to embark.  Then the men who had been impressed into service overturned the canoes.  The villagers pursued in canoes, throwing spears and shooting arrows at the fleeing patrol. Keating was wounded five times when finally he was killed by a spear to his head.  The rest of the patrol was also killed except for two native soldiers who were severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, British troops arrived at Hela the following week, on 16 October 1898, killed 100 of the villagers and burned their villages and adjacent fields.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==
[[File:HenryHowardClonardKeatingPlaqueHalifaxPublicGardensNovaScotia.JPG|thumbnail|Clonard Keating Plaque, [[Halifax Public Gardens]], [[Nova Scotia]]]]
Keating's body was eventually recovered.and buried in the new British fort at [[Yelwa]], a half mile away from Hela.   At Keating's gravesite, Keating's comrades built a memorial with a brass plaque and a tablet erected. (There is also a tombstone for Keating at Saint James Cemetery in [[Toronto]].)

The incident received significant coverage.  In Halifax, on Arbor Day, 8 May 1899, the teachers and pupils of Morris Street School, Keatings alma-mater, planted a tree in his memory in the [[Halifax Public Gardens]].  [[Lord William Seymour (British Army officer)|General Lord William Seymour]], commanding the British troops, gave an address. An easel was set up in front of the tree bearing pictures of both Queen Victoria and Keating, the whole draped in the Leinsters' colours.&lt;ref&gt;Acadian Recorder, 8 May 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Herald'' headline declared "Planted a Tree for Halifax Hero".&lt;ref&gt;9 May 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1925, a marker was installed at the tree.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 a memorial plaque was unveiled to honour Keating in Saint Luke's (Anglican) Cathedral, Halifax, subsequently lost to fire.  A second plaque was put up in the parish church at [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], Ireland (where the Leinsters' depot was located) to honour Keating and other Leinsters killed in Africa the same year.  At Aldershot, England, Keating's name was included on a tablet to the memory of all the men of the West African Frontier Force who died or were killed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">During the [[Edo period]], [[Japan]] used various punishments against criminals. These can be categorized as follows:

* [[Capital punishment|Death penalty]]
* [[Prison|Incarceration]] and [[Exile]]
* [[Penal labor]]
* [[Confiscation]] of [[property]]
* [[Corporal punishment]]

== Death penalty  ==

Serious crimes such as [[murder]] and [[arson]] were punished by death. The [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] maintained execution grounds for Edo at [[Kozukappara execution grounds|Kozukappara]], [[Suzugamori execution grounds|Suzugamori]], and [[Itabashi execution grounds|Itabashi]]. Kozukappara, also known as Kotsukappara or Kozukahara, is currently located near the southwest exit of Tokyo's [[Minami-Senju Station]]. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 people were executed here. Only part of the site remains, located next to Emmeiji temple, partly buried under the rail tracks and under a more-recent burial ground. Archaeological and morphological research was done by [[Tokyo University]] on the skulls found buried here which confirmed the execution methods. Another notable one was located at Suzugamori in Shinagawa. Both sites are still sparsely commemorated ''in situ'' with memorial plaques and tombstones.

The shogunate executed criminals in various ways:

* [[Boiling to death|Boiling]]
* [[Execution by burning|Burning]]
* [[Crucifixion]] for killing a parent, husband etc.
* [[Decapitation]] by [[Katana|sword]]
* [[Sawing (torture)|Sawing]]
* Waist-cutting (cutting the person in half). The Kanazawa [[Han (Japan)|han]] coupled this with decapitation.

The death penalty often carried collateral punishments. One was parading the criminal around town prior to execution. A similar one was public display of the criminal prior to execution. A third was public display of the severed head.

[[Samurai]] were often sentenced to commit [[seppuku]] in lieu of these forms of punishment. Seppuku is a term of suicide for the samurai.

== Incarceration and exile ==
Depending on the severity of the crime, magistrates could sentence convicts to incarceration in various forms:
* Exile to an [[island]]. Criminals in [[Edo]] were often confined on [[Hachijōjima]] or [[Miyakejima]]. Criminals so punished received [[tattoo]]s.
* [[Imprisonment]]. The government of Edo maintained a jail at Kodenma-chō.

Exclusion from the location of the crime was a penalty for both commoners and samurai.
* Tokoro-barai, banishment to a certain distance, was common for non-samurai.
* Kōfu kinban, assignment to the post of [[Kofu, Yamanashi|K&amp;#333;fu]] in the mountains west of Edo, is an example of rustication of samurai.

== Penal labor ==
For crimes requiring moderate punishment, convicts could be sent to work at labor camps such as the one on Ishikawa-jima in [[Tokyo Bay|Edo Bay]]. More serious acts could result in being sent to work in the [[gold]] [[Mining|mine]] on the island of [[Sado Island|Sado]]. In 1590, Hideyoshi had banned "unfree labor" or [[slavery]]; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor.  For example, the Edo period penal laws prescribed "non-free labor" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common.  The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=hideyoshi+slavery&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9P9o262Fpo&amp;sig=TKN79q0hnoLMEP8UbZk2fdmq00I&amp;hl=en#PPA31,M1  ''Frontier Contact Between Choson Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' p. 31]–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common for female convicts to be sentenced to serve terms working as slaves and prostitutes in walled [[Red Light District]]s, most notably [[Yoshiwara]].

== Confiscation ==
A penalty that targeted [[merchant]]s especially was kesshō, the confiscation of a business.

== Corporal punishment ==
[[Handcuffs|Handcuffing]] allowed the government to punish a criminal while he was under [[house arrest]]. Depending on the severity of the crime, the sentence might last 30, 50, or 100 days.

[[Flagellation]] was a common penalty for crimes such as [[theft]] and [[fight]]ing. [[Amputation]] of the nose or ears replaced flogging as penalty early in the Edo period. The 8th Shōgun of Edo, [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] introduced judicial Flogging Penalty, or ''tataki'', in 1720.  A convicted criminal could be sentenced to a maximum of 100 lashes.  ''[[Samurai]]'' and priests were exempt from flogging, and the penalty was applied only to commoners. The convict was stripped of all outer clothing and struck about the buttocks and back. The flogging penalty was used until 1867, though it fell out of favor from 1747 to 1795 intermittently.  Both men and women could be sentenced to a flogging, though during one segment of the mid-Edo period, women were imprisoned rather than flogged.&lt;ref&gt;Nawa Yumio "Torture and Penalty in Japan"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of flogging penalty===
In 757 A.D., the Chinese-influenced Yoro Ritsuryo (養老律令) legal system was enacted and introduced Five Judicial Penalties (五刑).  Two of the Five Judicial Penalties involved Flogging.  Light Flogging provided for 10 to 50 lashes, while Heavy 
Flogging stipulated 60 to 100 strokes.  However, a slave could be sentenced to up a maximum of 200 lashes.  These flogging penalties only applied to male commoners.  Convicts of the nobility, along with female commoners, might be sentenced to the imposition of handcuffs or a fine.  When a convicted criminal was flogged, half the number of lashes were typically applied to the back, half to the buttocks. At times, if the convict's request to change the lash target was sanctioned then the lashes would be applied only to the back or to the buttocks.  By the [[Sengoku period|Age of Warring States]], flogging had been largely replaced by [[decapitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Im Myung-Su "Torture and Punishment in Edo period"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cylon Centurion.jpg|thumb|A reimagined series Cylon Centurion]]
The '''Cylons''' are a [[Cyborg|cybernetic]] [[civilization]] at war with the [[Twelve Colonies]] of humanity in the ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise, in the original [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978]] and [[Galactica 1980|1980]] series, the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 reimagining]], as well as the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]''. In the 1978 series, Cylon is also the name of the reptilian race who created the robot Cylons.

The nature and origin of the Cylons differ greatly between the two ''Battlestar Galactica'' continuities. However, both series feature [[Cylon Raider]]s, [[Cylon Basestar]]s and Cylon Centurions. The prequel series, ''Caprica'', focuses on the creation of the Cylons, which differs from all the previous ''Battlestar Galactica'' series.

==Original continuity==
{{Main|Cylon (1978)}}

The Cylons of the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978]]/[[Galactica 1980|1980]] series are not the mechanical foils seen throughout the series, but an advanced reptilian race who created the [[robots]] (called "Cylons" within the show) to serve them, maintain their vast empire and to man their military forces in the face of a sudden population drop that eventually led to the Cylons' extinction &amp;mdash; seemingly overnight. This fact is briefly mentioned in the 1978 movie-length premiere of the series (near the end of episode 2 in syndication) when Apollo relates the Cylons' origin to Boxey. In the episode "War of the Gods", during [[Count Iblis]]'s private discourse with [[Count Baltar]], Baltar (further explaining the reptilian Cylons' ultimate, [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] fate as "having allowed themselves to be overcome — [[AI takeover|betrayed and, thus, completely killed off]] — by their own [[technology]]") mentions that he recognizes Iblis's voice, referring to [[Patrick Macnee]]'s voicing of the [[Imperious Leader]] in the opening episode/theatrical movie (Macnee also played Iblis), with Iblis countering that if that was true it must have been [[Sideloading|"transcribed"]] over a thousand yahren (years) ago and programmed into the mechanical body of the Imperious Leader.

The follow-up series ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' had a two-episode arc entitled "[[The Night the Cylons Landed]]" that featured a humanoid Cylon; though, unlike its successors in the post-millennial reimagining, it was not organic, but a complex mechanical construct.

In the original series, the Cylons, an aggressively expanding empire, declared war on Humanity because they had intervened on behalf of a race of beings called the Hasaris, who had been enslaved by the Cylons and who had sought the aid of the Colonials.

==Reimagined continuity==
{{Main|Cylon (reimagining)}}

The Cylons of the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] and 2004 [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] series are fundamentally different from the Cylons of the original [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978]]/[[Galactica 1980|1980]] series. In the new version, the Cylons were created by humans as [[Cyborg|cybernetic]] workers and soldiers. As in the original series, the Cylons destroy almost the entire [[human]] civilization, chasing a few ship-borne survivors into deep space. Unlike the original series, however, the reimagined series includes thirteen Cylon models that are nearly indistinguishable from human beings. Although these human-form Cylons are the focus of the series, alongside the humanoid models there are also Centurions similar to those in the original series. Much of the Cylons' technology is based heavily on [[bioengineering]] and/or [[synthetic biology]] rather than conventional [[robotics]]. Humans often derisively refer to Cylons as "[[toaster]]s", due to the resemblance of the Cylon centurions from the first Human/Cylon war (the design of which is based on that of the centurions from the original series) to "walking chrome toasters", as described by [[Gaius Baltar]] in the miniseries. The humanoid models are referred to as "skin-jobs" (a term originally used in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' for the [[replicant]]s) to differentiate the two variants.

Prior to the massive attack on the Colonies, the Cylon civilization was considered to be a major threat, but one which was contained. The interstellar military technologies of the humans and the Cylons were very comparable in capabilities such as instantaneous hyperspace jump, guided missiles, ship-based fighters, and nuclear weapons. In the premiere episode of the 2003 series, [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] denies visiting reporters access to the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|''Galactica'']] if they carry networked computers, and reminds these reporters of the Cylon origins as networked Artificial Intelligence beings. In all aspects of computing and robotics, the Cylon technologies are far superior to those of humankind. Adama points out that, as long as the Cylons are kept out of the networks, humankind's superior numbers and the size of their industrial base gives them the tactical and strategic advantage. That is lost when [[Gaius Baltar]] allows the humanoid Cylon [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|"Caprica Six"]] access to the Colonial defense mainframe. Her modifications to the defense code propagate throughout the fleet, effectively disarming it, and the massive attacks begin, resulting in the near extinction of humankind.

In contrast to the reason for the original Cylons' genocidal mission, religion is the primary motivation of the Cylon race in the re-imagined series. They consider humans to be [[sin]]ful and flawed creations who, therefore, do not deserve to survive. However, there is notable disagreement among the humanoid Cylon ranks. Cylon Model 1 (played by [[Dean Stockwell]]) was a model that evolved to abandon the religious convictions of the other models. His hyper-rational nature led him to regularly advocate for full-scale genocide of humanity, even after Models 6, 3, 8, and 2 reconsidered the total extermination objective. 

In the reimagined series universe, the term '''Cylon''' stands for '''Cy'''bernetic '''L'''ifef'''o'''rm '''N'''ode.

'''Death anxiety''' is [[anxiety]] caused by thoughts of [[death]]. One source defines death anxiety as a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to [[being|'be']]".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety.

=== Predation or predator death anxiety ===
Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald.Hilgendorf. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950021 Death imagery and death anxiety.] Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential death anxiety ===
Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p10&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="langs"/&gt; Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p11&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p13&lt;/ref&gt; In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"/&gt; Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p14&lt;/ref&gt; These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"/&gt;

== Theories==

===Thanatophobia===

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald&gt;http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===

Developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as "[[ego integrity]]". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{main|Terror management theory}}
[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Emanuele. (2011). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x/abstract Ideology, Fear of Death, and Death Anxiety] 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and adjustment hypotheses===
{{main|Death and adjustment hypotheses}}
[[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] postulated the [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Being, time and Dasein===

[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning management theory===

[[Paul T. P. Wong]]'s work on the meaning management theory&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2008). Meaning-management theory and death acceptance. In A. Tomer, G. T. Eliason, &amp; P. T. P. Wong (Eds.), ''Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes'' (pp. 65-87). New York, NY: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic.&lt;ref name=concepts/&gt; His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Gesser, G., Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Reker, G. T. (1987-88). Death attitudes across the life span. The development and validation of the Death Attitude Profile (DAP). ''Omega, 2'', 113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death (DAP-R). In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed.), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.

===Other theories===

Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p570"&gt;Langs." Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570&lt;/ref&gt; The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. "Psychology" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the ''regret theory'' which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"&gt;Langs. [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/prev.90.4.565.23914?journalCode=prev Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety.] The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p575&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt; The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;  Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;

===Personal meanings of death===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D. Yalom |date=2008 |chapter=Rippling |title=Staring at the sun: overcoming the terror of death |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780787996680 |oclc=155715164 |pages=83–92 |quote=Each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; left on those still alive). If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cicirelli |first=Victor G. |date=November 1998 |title=Personal meanings of death in relation to fear of death |journal=[[Death Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=713–733 |doi=10.1080/074811898201236 |pmid=10346699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiosity's effect===

The thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.

A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = L. | last2 = Wahab | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Ratnasingan | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1080/13674676.2011.652606 | title = Religiosity and fear of death: A three‐nation comparison | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 179 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Wen, Y. (2010). Religiosity and death anxiety. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 6(2), 31-37. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/867401301&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety,&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. The Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 12 (4), 525-535. Retrieved from http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/13591045/v12i0004/525_duafodiyc&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt; There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525–535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;

A study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 12 (4) pg 525-535&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between adult attachment and death anxiety ==
There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexes ==
The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.  Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.&lt;ref name="Harrawood, L. K. 2008"&gt;Harrawood, L. K., White, L. J., &amp; Benshoff, J. J. (2008). Death Anxiety in a National Sample of United States Funeral Directors and Its Relationship with Death Exposure, Age, and Sex. Omega: Journal of Death &amp; Dying, 58(2), 129-146. {{DOI|10.2190/OM.58.2.c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew.Dawson."Death anexiety:State or Trait" Journal od Clinical Psychology.1979.pg158&lt;/ref&gt; Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"&gt;Donald.Charles. "Death Anxiety and Mental Ability" Essence: Issues in the Study of Ageing, Dying and Death. 1979.p85&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"&gt;Langs. "Death Anxiety and the Emotion-processing Mind" Psychoanalytic Psychology .2004.p43&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt; Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt;

==Age ==
It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent.  However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek &amp; Trenner, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skill|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring death anxiety ==

There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"&gt;Tomer.Eliason."Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety" Death Stuides.1996.p353&lt;/ref&gt; Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;
The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;

'''''Deconstructing Harry''''' is a 1997 [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Woody Allen]]. This film tells the story of a successful writer named Harry Block, played by Allen, who draws inspiration from people he knows in real life, and from events that happened to him, sometimes causing these people to become alienated from him as a result.

The central plot features Block driving to a university from which he was once thrown out, in order to receive an honorary degree. Three passengers accompany him on the journey: a prostitute, a friend, and his son, whom he has kidnapped from his ex-wife. However, there are many [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, segments taken from Block's writing, and interactions with his own fictional characters. ''Deconstructing Harry'' received moderately positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
One night, Lucy ([[Judy Davis]]) gets a taxi to the home of author Harry Block ([[Woody Allen]]). She has just read Harry's latest novel. In the novel, the character Leslie ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) is having an affair with her sister's husband Ken ([[Richard Benjamin]]). Lucy is angry because the novel is patently based on her and Harry's own affair; as a result, everyone knows about it. Lucy pulls a gun out of her purse, saying she will kill herself. She then turns the gun on Harry and begins firing. She chases him out onto the roof. Harry insists that he has already been punished: his latest girlfriend Fay ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) has left him for his best friend Larry ([[Billy Crystal]]). To distract Lucy, Harry tells her a story he is currently writing: a semi-autobiographical story of a sex-obsessed young man named Harvey ([[Tobey Maguire]]) who is mistakenly claimed by Death.

In therapy, Harry realizes he has not changed since he was a sex-obsessed youth. Harry discusses the honoring ceremony at his old university, taking place the next day; he is particularly unhappy that he has nobody with whom to share the occasion. After the session, Harry asks his ex-wife Joan ([[Kirstie Alley]]) if he can take their son Hilliard ([[Eric Lloyd]]) to the ceremony. She refuses, stating that Harry is a bad influence on Hilliard. She is also furious at Harry for the novel he wrote. In it, the character Epstein ([[Stanley Tucci]]) marries Helen ([[Demi Moore]]), but the marriage begins to crumble after the birth of their son.

Harry runs into an acquaintance, Richard ([[Bob Balaban]]), who is worried about his health. After accompanying Richard to the hospital, Harry asks him to come to the university ceremony. Richard appears uninterested.  Harry then goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Fay, who reveals that she is now engaged. Harry begs Fay to get back together with him. He asks Fay to accompany him to his ceremony, but it clashes with Fay's wedding, scheduled the following day.

That night, Harry sleeps with a prostitute, Cookie ([[Hazelle Goodman]]). Harry then asks Cookie to accompany him to his ceremony.

In the morning, Richard unexpectedly arrives to join Harry and Cookie on the journey. On a whim, Harry decides to "kidnap" his son Hilliard. Along the way, they stop at a carnival, then at Harry's half-sister Doris's ([[Caroline Aaron]]). Doris, a devoted [[Jew]], is upset by Harry's portrayals of Judaism in his stories, as is her husband ([[Eric Bogosian]]). During the journey, Harry also encounters his fictional creations Ken and Helen, who force him to confront some painful truths about his life. Just before arriving at the university, Richard dies peacefully in the car.

Distressed, Harry literally slides out of focus, becoming blurred like one of his own fictional characters. Cookie helps him restore focus. The university's staffers gush over Harry, asking what he plans to write next. He describes a story about a man (based on himself) who journeys down to Hell to reclaim his true love (based on Fay) from [[the Devil]] (based on Larry - both being played by Billy Crystal).  Harry and the Devil engage in a verbal duel as to who is truly the more evil of the two.  Harry gets as far as arguing that he is a kidnapper before the story is interrupted by the arrival of the police.  Harry is arrested for kidnapping Hilliard, for possessing a gun (it was Lucy's), and for having drugs in the car (belonging to Cookie).

Larry and Fay come from their wedding to bail Harry out of jail. Harry reluctantly gives them his blessings. Back at his apartment, a miserable Harry fantasizes that the university's ceremony is taking place. Harry realizes that he can only function in art, not in life. The film ends with Harry returning to his writing.

==Reception==
''Deconstructing Harry'' garnered 71% approval on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deconstructing_harry/|title=Deconstructing Harry (1997)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 61 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deconstructing-harry|title=Deconstructing Harry Reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
[[Woody Allen]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for ''Deconstructing Harry''. The film was also nominated for a [[Satellite Awards|Golden Satellite Award]] for Best Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical.

==Influences==
The film is a general reworking of his earlier 1980 film ''[[Stardust Memories]]'', which also had an artist go to a ceremony in his honor, while reminiscing over past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize current ones.&lt;ref name="desser"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Jewish Filmmakers|page=105|author1-last=Desser|author1-first=David|author2-last=Friedman|author2-first=Lester D.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=2003|edition=2|isbn=978-0-252-07153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen is  an admirer of several European directors whose primary body of work was completed sometimes decades before his first script, and his films in particular often draw upon the works of [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]].  The rough outline of the plot of ''Deconstructing Harry'', that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university while reflecting upon his life's experiences, essentially mirrors that of Bergman's ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971224/REVIEWS/712240301/1023 |title=Deconstructing Harry :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 1997-12-24|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the film is similar to Fellini's ''[[8½]]'', in that it is about an artist struggling with his current relationships and remembering his old ones, interspersed with dream sequences, as well as his work being based on events from his life.

It is acknowledged by some critics that Allen based the name of Harry Block on Antonius Block ([[Max von Sydow]]), the protagonist from Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''.&lt;ref name="desser"/&gt; Some critics, including [[Roger Ebert]], have suggested that the character of Harry Block is based on real-life author [[Philip Roth]] and not on Allen himself.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">{{For|the American politician|Edward de Veaux Morrell}}
'''Edward H. "Ed" Morrell''' (October 22, 1868 – November 10, 1946) was an accomplice to the [[Christopher Evans (outlaw)|Evans]] and Sontag gang that robbed the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in California's [[San Joaquin Valley]] in the 1890s. According to his memoir, "The 25th Man", the robberies were after revenge for the large railroad corporation's mistreatment of local ranchers of the San Joaquin Valley.  Morrell was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Folsom State Prison]] in 1894. He was eventually transferred to [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] (1899 at the latest), and pardoned in 1908. Five of his years were spent in [[solitary confinement]];&lt;ref&gt;"Five Years in the Solitary Dungeon", by [[Jack Jungmeyer]], ''The San Francisco Sunday Call'', February 14, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; he was known as the Dungeon Man of San Quentin. Author [[Jack London]] championed his pardon; and Morrell became a frequent guest at London's [[Jack London State Historic Park|Beauty Ranch]] in [[Glen Ellen, California]]. London used Morrell as a character in his 1915 novel ''[[The Star Rover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Star Rover]]'' was adapted for the 2005 film [[The Jacket]], thus indirectly preserving Morrell on celluloid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrell had been subjected to severe physical abuse in prison. After his release, he lectured widely on his experiences and advocated [[prison reform]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Ed Morrell's Act Is Too Realistic", ''The San Francisco Call'', June 24, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured with former San Quentin prisoner and author, [[Donald Lowrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Donald. ''My Life Out of Prison'' (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell's lectures included addresses to the California and Pennsylvania legislatures. He advocated the abolition of [[corporal punishment]]. In 1914, he wrote a one-act play, ''The Incorrigible'', based on his experiences (and one of his nicknames). In 1924, he published his memoirs, ''The 25th Man: The Strange Story of Ed. Morrell, the Hero of Jack London's Star Rover''.

Morrell was born in [[Cass Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Thomaston, Pennsylvania]] on October 22, 1868. He came to California in 1891. "In his later years, he was a colorful habitue of [[Gower Gulch]] and a frequenter of [[Hollywood and Vine]], the crony and pet of Hollywood film people." He died, age 78, in [[Los Angeles]] on November 10, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;"Last Railroad-Raiding Bandit, Ed Morrell, Dies," ''Los Angeles Times'', November 12, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl. ''The Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', Edward Morrell entry pp. 169-171, [[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc.]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31119">'''End-of-life care''' (or '''EoLC''') refers to [[health care]], not only of a person in the final hours or days of their lives, but more broadly care of all those with a [[terminal illness|terminal condition]] that has become advanced, progressive, and incurable.

End-of-life care requires a range of decisions, including questions of [[palliative care]], patients' right to self-determination (of treatment, life), medical experimentation, the ethics and efficacy of extraordinary or hazardous medical interventions, and the ethics and efficacy even of continued routine medical interventions. In addition, end-of-life often touches upon [[rationing]] and the allocation of resources in [[hospitals]] and national medical systems. Such decisions are informed both by technical, medical considerations, economic factors as well as [[bioethics]]. In addition, end-of-life treatments are subject to considerations of [[medical ethics|patient autonomy]].  "Ultimately, it is still up to patients and their families to determine when to pursue aggressive treatment or withdraw [[life support]]."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.phillyburbs.com/entertainment/books/cb-east-grad-lauren-jodi-van-scoy-poses-critical-questions/article_fc389c03-865f-563a-b157-ea1cb40f396c.html Naila Francis - Dr. Lauren Jodi Van Scoy Poses Critical Questions About Death in First Book -  PhillyBlurbs.com - The Intelligencer], July 10/11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most advanced countries, medical spending on those in the last twelve months of life makes up roughly 10% of total aggregate medical spending, and spending on those in the last three years of life can account for up to 25%.&lt;ref name="French E, et al. 2017 1211–1217"&gt;{{cite journal | author = French E, et al. | year = 2017| title = End-Of-Life Medical Spending In Last Twelve Months Of Life Is Lower Than Previously Reported | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/36/7/1211.abstract | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 1211–1217 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not a physician would be surprised if a person was dead within a set period of time was somewhat accurate at predicting end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=N|last2=Kupeli|first2=N|last3=Vickerstaff|first3=V|last4=Stone|first4=P|title=How accurate is the 'Surprise Question' at identifying patients at the end of life?

=== Canada ===
In 2012, [[Statistics Canada]]'s ''General Social Survey on Caregiving and care receiving''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Social Survey - Caregiving and Care Receiving (GSS)|url = http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=4502|website = www23.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 13% of Canadians (3.7 million) aged 15 and older reported that at some point in their lives they had provided end-of-life or palliative care to a family member or friend. For those in their 50s and 60s, the percentage was higher, with about 20% reporting having provided palliative care to a family member or friend. Women were also more likely to have provided palliative care over their lifetimes, with 16% of women reporting having done so, compared with 10% of men. These caregivers helped terminally ill family members or friends with personal or medical care, food preparation, managing finances or providing transportation to and from medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2014004-eng.htm|title = Statistics Canada - End of life care, 2012|date = July 9, 2013|accessdate = May 11, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
End of life care has been identified by the [[UK Department of Health]] as an area where quality of care has previously been "very variable," and which has not had a high profile in the NHS and social care.  To address this, a national end of life care programme  was established in 2004 to identify and propagate best practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endoflifecare.nhs.uk/eolc/ NHS National End of Life Care Programme], official website&lt;/ref&gt; and a national strategy document published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endoflifecare.nhs.uk/eolc/files/DH-EoLC_Strategy_promoting_high_quality_Jul2008.pdf End of Life Care Strategy: Promoting high quality care for all adults at the end of life], UK [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7748834.stm Q&amp;A: End of life care], ''[[BBC News]]'', 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Government]] has also published a national strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7572815.stm 'Better' end of life care pledge], ''[[BBC News]]'', 21 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/01091608/0 Living and Dying Well: A national action plan for palliative and end of life care in Scotland], [[Scottish Government]], 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/scots-end-of-life-plan-launched-as-part-of-innovative-palliative-care-strategy/1896014.article Scots end-of-life plan launched as part of innovative palliative care strategy], ''[[Nursing Times]],'' 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 just over half a million people died in England, about 99% of them adults over the age of 18, and almost two-thirds adults over the age of 75. About three-quarters of deaths could be considered "predictable" and followed a period of [[chronic illness]]&lt;ref name="stats_uk"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/99/9905.htm End of life care: 1. The current place and quality of end of life care], [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]], 30 March 2009, paragraphs 1-3.  &lt;br /&gt;See also [http://www.endoflifecare.nhs.uk/eolc/files/DH-EoLC_Strategy_promoting_high_quality_Jul2008.pdf End of life care strategy], UK Department of Health, July 2008, paragraphs 1.1 and 1.7-1.14 (pages 26-27); and [http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/end_of_life_care.aspx End of Life care], UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] [[Comptroller and Auditor General]]'s report, 26 November 2008, paragraphs 2.2-2.5 (page 15)&lt;/ref&gt; – for example [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[stroke]], or [[dementia]].  In all, 58% of deaths occurred in an NHS hospital, 18% at home, 17% in residential care homes (most commonly people over the age of 85), and about 4% in hospices.&lt;ref name="stats_uk" /&gt;  However, a majority of people would prefer to die at home or in a hospice, and according to one survey less than 5% would rather die in hospital.&lt;ref name="stats_uk" /&gt;  A key aim of the strategy therefore is to reduce the needs for dying patients to have to go to hospital and/or to have to stay there; and to improve provision for support and palliative care in the community to make this possible. One study estimated that 40% of the patients who had died in hospital had not had medical needs that required them to be there.&lt;ref name="stats_uk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/end_of_life_care.aspx End of Life care], UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] [[Comptroller and Auditor General]]'s report, 26 November 2008, paragraph 21 (page 7) and [http://www.nao.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docId=fca0c85c-9fd9-4687-a1eb-b133c318655d&amp;version=-1 supporting study]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!--Other aims: patient/carer/family communication &amp; support.  Other aims: Knowledge/Training/Awareness for ''all'' staff.--&gt;

In 2015 and 2010, the UK ranked highest globally in a study of end-of-life care. The 2015 study said "Its ranking is due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the [[National Health Service]], a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue." The studies were carried out by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and commissioned by the [[Lien Foundation]], a Singaporean philanthropic organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=The Economist Intelligence Unit|date=6 October 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=BBC|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=qualityofdeath_lienfoundation&amp;page=noads&amp;rf=0 The Quality of Death: Ranking end-of-life care across the world], [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], July 2010; [http://www.lifebeforedeath.com/qualityofdeath/highlights.shtml Quality of death], [[Lien Foundation]], July 2010; [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-states-tied-for-9th-place-in-economist-intelligence-units-first-ever-global-quality-of-death-index-98412929.html United States Tied for 9th Place in Economist Intelligence Unit's First Ever Global 'Quality of Death' Index], Lien Foundation press release; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10634371 UK comes top on end of life care - report], [[BBC News]], 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-medical care and support ==

=== Family and loved ones ===
Many times, family members are uncertain what they can do when a person is dying.  Many gentle, familiar daily tasks, such as combing hair, putting lotion on delicate skin, and holding hands, are comforting and provide a meaningful method of communicating love to a dying person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/832280964|title=How we die now: Intimacy and the work of dying|last=Erickson|first=Karla A.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|year=|isbn=9781439908242|location=|pages=128–131|oclc=832280964|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members may be suffering emotionally due to the impending death.  Their own [[fear of death]] may affect their behavior.  They may feel guilty about past events in their relationship with the dying person or feel that they have been neglectful.  These common emotions can result in tension, fights between family members over decisions, worsened care, and sometimes (in what medical professionals call the "[[Daughter from California syndrome]]") a long-absent family member arrives while a patient is dying to demand inappropriately aggressive care.

Family members may also be coping with unrelated problems, such as physical or mental illness, emotional and relationship issues, or legal difficulties.  These problems can limit their ability to be involved, civil, helpful, or present.

=== Spiritual care in end of life care ===
[[Pastoral care|Pastoral/spiritual care]] is of particular significance in end of life care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/National-Consensus-Statement-Essential-Elements-forsafe-high-quality-end-of-life-care.pdf|title=National Consensus Statement: Essential Elements for Safe and High-Quality End-of-Life Care.|date=2015|website=Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'In palliative care, responsibility for spiritual care is shared by the whole team, with leadership given by specialist practitioners such as pastoral care workers. The palliative care approach to spiritual care may, however, be transferred to other contexts and to individual practice.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rumbled|first=Bruce|date=2003|title=Caring for the spirit: lessons from working with the dying|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2003/179/6/caring-spirit-lessons-working-dying|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care in the final days and hours of life==

=== Decision making ===
Fragmented, dysfunctional, or grieving families are often unable to make timely decisions that respect the patient's wishes and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-united-family-can-make-all-the-difference-when-someone-is-dying/2016/11/18/d1bdb206-9161-11e6-9c85-ac42097b8cc0_story.html|title=A united family can make all the difference when someone is dying|last=Harrington|first=Samuel|date=18 November 2016|website=Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can result in over-treatment, under-treatment, and other problems.  For example, family members may differ over whether life extension or life quality is the main goal of treatment.

Family members may also be unable to grasp the inevitability of death and the risks and effects of medical and non-medical interventions.  They may demand common treatments, such as antibiotics for pneumonia, or drugs to reduce high blood pressure without wondering whether that person might prefer dying quickly of pneumonia or a heart attack to a long-drawn-out decline in a skilled care facility.&lt;ref name="Pureed"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/832280964|title=How we die now: Intimacy and the work of dying|last=Erickson|first=Karla A.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|year=|isbn=9781439908242|location=|pages=108–112|oclc=832280964|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some treatments, such as pureed foods for a person who has trouble swallowing or IV fluids for a person who is actively dying, seem harmless, but can significantly prolong the process of dying.&lt;ref name="Pureed" /&gt;

=== Signs that death may be near ===

The U.S. Government [[National Cancer Institute]] advises that the presence of some of the following signs may indicate that death is approaching:&lt;ref&gt;NCI Factsheet: [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Support/end-of-life-care End-of-Life Care: Questions and Answers], 30 October 2002.  Some material here has been adapted verbatim from the fact sheet, which is identified as being in the public domain as a creation of federal government employees (NCI Web policies: [http://www.cancer.gov/policies/page6 Copyright and registered trademarks]).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Drowsiness, increased sleep, and/or unresponsiveness (caused by changes in the patient's metabolism).
* Confusion about time, place, and/or identity of loved ones; restlessness; visions of people and places that are not present; pulling at bed linens or clothing (caused in part by changes in the patient's metabolism).
* Decreased socialization and withdrawal (caused by decreased oxygen to the brain, decreased blood flow, and mental preparation for dying).
* Decreased need for food and fluids, and loss of appetite (caused by the body's need to conserve energy and its decreasing ability to use food and fluids properly).
* Loss of bladder or bowel control (caused by the relaxing of muscles in the pelvic area).
* Darkened urine or decreased amount of urine (caused by slowing of kidney function and/or decreased fluid intake).
* Skin becoming cool to the touch, particularly the hands and feet; skin may become bluish in color, especially on the underside of the body (caused by decreased circulation to the extremities).
* Rattling or gurgling sounds while breathing, which may be loud ([[death rattle]]); breathing that is irregular and shallow; decreased number of breaths per minute; breathing that alternates between rapid and slow (caused by congestion from decreased fluid consumption, a buildup of waste products in the body, and/or a decrease in circulation to the organs).
* Turning of the head toward a light source (caused by decreasing vision).
* Increased difficulty controlling pain (caused by progression of the disease).
* Involuntary movements (called [[myoclonus]]), increased [[heart rate]], [[hypertension]] followed by [[hypotension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linda|first1=L Emanuel|last2=Frank D|first2=Ferris|last3=Charles F|first3=von Gunten|title=The Last Hours of Living: Practical Advice for Clinicians|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716463_2|website=Medscape|accessdate=17 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128195129/https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716463_2|archivedate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and loss of [[reflex]]es in the legs and arms are additional signs that the end of life is near.

=== Symptom management ===

The following are some of the most common potential problems that can arise in the last days and hours of a patient's life:&lt;ref&gt;This list is based on the principal heading prompts in the [[Liverpool Care Pathway]] standard documentation template.  A more detailed discussion of common symptoms and potential mitigation options can be found in the U.S. National Cancer Institute's PDQ [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/lasthours/HealthProfessional/page3 Last Days of Life: Symptom management].&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Pain]]&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Nurses Association. "Position Statement: Providing Care at The End of Life," 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:Typically controlled using [[morphine]] or, in the United Kingdom, [[diamorphine]]&lt;ref name="NHS heroin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=NHS|title=Diamorphine (Diamorphine 5mg powder for solution for injection ampoules)|url=http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Palliative%20Care&amp;medicine=Diamorphine|website=NHS|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LCP template"&gt;[http://www.mcpcil.org.uk/liverpool-care-pathway/pdfs/LCP%20HOSPITAL%20VERSION%2011%20%28printable%20version%29.pdf LCP Sample hospital template], Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute, Liverpool. Version 11 - November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[opioids]].
; Agitation
: [[Delirium]], terminal anguish, restlessness (e.g. thrashing, plucking, or twitching).  Typically controlled using [[midazolam]],&lt;ref name="LCP template" /&gt; or other [[benzodiazepines]]. [[Haloperidol]] is commonly used as well.&lt;ref name="Haloperidol in palliative care"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vella-Brincat|first1=J|title=Haloperidol in palliative care|journal=Palliat Med|date=2004|pmid=15198132|volume=18|pages=195–201|doi=10.1191/0269216304pm881oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases symptoms may also sometimes be alleviated by rehydration, which may reduce the effects of some toxic drug metabolites.&lt;ref name="NCI PDQ" /&gt;
; Respiratory tract secretions
: Saliva and other fluids can accumulate in the [[oropharynx]] and [[upper airways]] when patients become too weak to clear their [[throat]]s, leading to a characteristic gurgling or rattle-like sound ("[[death rattle]]").  While apparently not painful for the patient, the association of the diseases symptom with impending death can create fear and uncertainty for those at the bedside.&lt;ref name="NCI PDQ"&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/lasthours/HealthProfessional/page3 NCI PDQ: Last Days of Life: Symptom management], United States [[National Cancer Institute]], Revised 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The secretions may be controlled using drugs such as [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] (hyoscine),&lt;ref name="LCP template" /&gt; [[glycopyrronium]],&lt;ref name="LCP template" /&gt; or [[atropine]].&lt;ref name="NCI PDQ" /&gt;  Rattle may not be controllable if caused by deeper fluid accumulation in the bronchi or the lungs, such as occurs with pneumonia or some tumours.&lt;ref name="NCI PDQ" /&gt;
; [[Nausea]] and vomiting
: Typically controlled using [[haloperidol]],&lt;ref name="Haloperidol in palliative care"/&gt; [[cyclizine]];&lt;ref name="LCP template" /&gt; or other [[anti-emetics]].
; [[Dyspnea]] (breathlessness)
: Typically controlled using [[morphine]] or, in the United Kingdom, [[diamorphine]]&lt;ref name="NHS heroin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LCP template" /&gt;

Typical care plans, such as those based on the [[Liverpool Care Pathway]] for dying patients, pre-authorise staff to address such diseases symptoms as soon as they are needed, without needing to take time to seek further authorisation.  [[Subcutaneous injection]]s are one preferred means of delivery when it has become difficult for patients to swallow or to take pills orally; and if repeated medication is needed, a [[syringe driver]] (called an [[infusion pump]] in the US) is often likely to be used, to deliver a steady low dose of medication.

Another means of medication delivery, available for use when the oral route is compromised, is a specialized [[Macy Catheter|catheter]] designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications via the [[rectal]] route. The catheter was developed to make rectal access more practical and provide a way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the [[distal]] rectum so that health practitioners can leverage the established benefits of rectal [[route of administration|administration]]. Its small flexible [[silicone]] shaft allows the device to be placed safely and remain comfortably in the rectum for repeated administration of medications or liquids. The catheter has a small [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], allowing for small flush volumes to get medication to the rectum. Small volumes of medications (under 15ml) improve comfort by not stimulating the [[defecation]] response of the rectum, and can increase the overall [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] of a given [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|dose]] by decreasing pooling of medication and migration of medication into more [[proximal]] areas of the rectum where absorption can be less effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = De Boer AG, Moolenaar F, de Leede LG, Breimer DD | year = 1982 | title = Rectal drug administration: clinical pharmacokinetic considerations | url = | journal = Clin Pharmacokinetics | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 285–311 | doi=10.2165/00003088-198207040-00002 | pmid=6126289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moolenaar F, Koning B, Huizinga T | year = 1979 | title = Biopharmaceutics of rectal administration of drugs in man.

Other diseases symptoms that may occur, and may be mitigable to some extent, include [[cough]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[fever]], and in some cases [[bleeding]].&lt;ref name="NCI PDQ" /&gt;

== Medical professionals and end-of-life care ==
A study was conducted by Jessica Schmit from the [[University of Florida]] in 2016 about the level of comfort medical residents have with certain end-of-life care. Through this study it was found that residents received an inadequate amount of formal education on comfort-care and end-of-life care.  In Schmit's study it was found that 61.9% of residents reported that their end of life conversations were "mostly unsupervised" or "never supervised", giving them very little guidance about how to do better in the future. Research is also being undertaken with regard to the role of Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) working in palliative and end-of-life care.  Speech-Language Pathologists have been recognised as having an important role among adult &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Chahda, L., Mathisen, B. A., &amp; Carey, L. B. (2017).

Nurses are able to explain in practical terms what is happening to the patient after the doctor has left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmit|first=J|date=2016|title=Perspectives on death and dying: a study of resident comfort with End-of-life care.|url=|journal=BMC Medical Education|volume=16|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses also work to advocate for the patients, as they spend a lot of time with them and typically know a great deal more about the patient's wishes, symptoms, and previous medical history. Nurses, doctors, and hospice workers are critical in helping both the patient and the family move through the death process, as well as the grief that follows after.

'''Epimorphosis''' is defined as the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of a specific part of an organism in a way that involves extensive cell proliferation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/epimorphosis|title=Medical Definition of EPIMORPHOSIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[blastema]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yokoyama H | title = Initiation of limb regeneration: the critical steps for regenerative capacity | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17986260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00973.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epimorphosis can be considered a simple model for [[Developmental biology|development]], though it only occurs in tissues surrounding the site of injury rather than occurring system-wide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors = Kubo T, Arai T | date = September 1996|title=Insect Lectins and Epimorphosis|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tigg1989/8/43/8_43_357/_pdf/-char/en|journal=Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology|publisher=Japanese Society of Carbohydrate Research|volume=8|issue=43|pages=357–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Epimorphosis ==
[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], an evolutionary biologist who also worked with embryology, argued that limb and tissue reformation bore many similarities to embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sunderland ME | title = Regeneration: Thomas Hunt Morgan's window into development | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–61 | date = 2010-05-01 | pmid = 20665231 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the work of German embryologist [[Wilhelm Roux]], who suggested regeneration was two cooperative but distinct pathways instead of one, Morgan named the two parts of the regenerative process epimorphosis and [[morphallaxis]]. Specifically, Morgan wanted epimorphosis to specify the process of entirely new tissues being regrown from an amputation or similar injury, with morphallaxis being coined to describe regeneration that did not use [[cell proliferation]], such as in [[Hydrozoa|hydra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/thomas-hunt-morgans-definition-regeneration-morphallaxis-and-epimorphosis | title = Thomas Hunt Morgan's Definition of Regeneration: Morphallaxis and Epimorphosis | work = The Embryo Project Encyclopedia | access-date = 2018-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epimorphosis in vertebrates==
[[File:Limb bud diagram.jpg|thumb|The [[apical ectodermal ridge]] in embryonic development is very similar to the [[apical ectodermal cap]] in limb regeneration. The [[progress zone]] can be seen near to the [[zone of polarizing activity]], which instructs cells on how to orient the limb.&lt;ref name="Summerbell_1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Summerbell D, Lewis JH, Wolpert L | title = Positional information in chick limb morphogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 492–6 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4621272 | doi = 10.1038/244492a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|left|381x381px]][[File:The elements of experimental embryology (1963) (21260217591).jpg|alt=Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown.|thumb|Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown, from "The elements of experimental embryology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/elementsofexperi00huxl | title = The Elements of Experimental Embryology | last = Huxley | first = Julian | last2 = De Beer | first2 = Gavin | name-list-format = vanc | date=1963| location = New York | publisher = Hafner Pub.

|306x306px]]In [[vertebrate]]s, epimorphosis relies on blastema formation to [[Wound healing|proliferate]] cells into the new tissue. Through studies involving [[zebrafish]] fins, the toetips of mice, and limb regeneration in [[axolotl]]s, researchers at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] found evidence for epimorphosis occurring in a variety of vertebrates, including instances of mammal epimorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal models for the study of human disease | last = Conn | first = P.

Epidermal cells at the wound margins migrate to cover the wound and will become the wound epidermis.&lt;ref name="dev bio text"&gt;{{cite book | first = Scott F. | last = Gilbert | name-list-format = vanc | title = Developmental Biology | edition = Tenth | publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc. | location = Sunderland, MA, USA | year = 2014 | pages = 571–573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No scar tissue forms, as it would in mammals.

An [[apical ectodermal cap (AEC)]] forms on the tip of the stump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Issues in Biological, Biochemical, and Evolutionary Sciences Research | publisher = ScholarlyEditions | year = 2012 | isbn = | location=Atlanta, GA|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the embryonic [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which forms during normal [[limb development]].  The AEC causes the [[apical ectodermal ridge|progress zone]] to re-establish; this means the cells under the AEC [[Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiate]] and become [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]].  The AEC releases [[fibroblast growth factor]]s (FGFs) (including [[FGF4|FGF-4]] and [[FGF8|-8]]) that drive the development of the new limb, essentially resetting the limb back to its embryonic development stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nye|first=Holly L.D.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jo Ann|last3=Chernoff|first3=Ellen A.G.|last4=Stocum|first4=David L.|title=Regeneration of the urodele limb: A review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dvdy.10236|journal=Developmental Dynamics|volume=226|issue=2|pages=280–294|doi=10.1002/dvdy.10236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though some of the limb cells are able to dedifferentiate, they are not able to fully dedifferentiate to the level of [[multipotent]] progenitor cells. During regeneration, only cartilage cells can form new cartilage tissue, only muscle cells can form new muscle tissue, and so on. The dedifferentiated cells still retain their original [[cell fate determination|specification]].&lt;ref name="dev bio text"/&gt;

== Epimorphosis in invertebrates ==

=== ''Periplaneta americana'' ===
The [[American cockroach]] is capable of regenerating limbs that have been damaged or destroyed, such as legs and antennae, as well parts of its compound eye. It does this with [[lectin]]—a protein made for binding proteins—named [[regenectin]], which shares a family with other [[Lipopolysaccharide binding protein|lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding proteins]]. Regenectin carries both a regenerative and a system defense function, and it is produced by the cockroach's [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine system]] to work with muscle reformation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Capitella teleta'' ===
[[Capitella teleta|''C. teleta'']] is a segmented worm found in North America that is capable of regenerating posterior segments after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröbius|first=Andreas C.|last2=Matus|first2=David Q.|last3=Seaver|first3=Elaine C.|date=2008-12-23|title=Genomic Organization and Expression Demonstrate Spatial and Temporal Hox Gene Colinearity in the Lophotrochozoan Capitella sp.

All of the ''Hox'' genes concerned in epimorphosis are present in the abdominal area of the worm, but not in the anterior portion. However, the genes do not, themselves, direct the anterior-posterior patterning of the worm's thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Jong DM, Seaver EC | title = A Stable Thoracic Hox Code and Epimorphosis Characterize Posterior Regeneration in Capitella teleta | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = e0149724 | date = 2016-02-19 | pmid = 26894631 | pmc = 4764619 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0149724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Planaria vitta'' ===
[[Planaria vitta|''P. vitta'']] is a [[flatworm]] of genus ''[[Planaria]]'' that, when needed, can draw upon both morphallaxis and epimorphosis to regrow itself; in ''P. vitta,'' epimorphosis precedes morphallaxis and lasts about ten days. The [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] contracts immediately after the worm is cut at the head, which activates [[totipotent]] regenerative cells, and [[rhabdite]]s gather on the epidermis. Near the time the eye-spots on the worm begin to take form, epimorphosis begins to shift over to morphallaxis, which then finishes regrowth into a complete individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=K.

'''''Hello Again''''' is a 1987 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy film|fantasy-comedy film]] directed and produced by [[Frank Perry]], written by [[Susan Isaacs]] and starring [[Shelley Long]], [[Judith Ivey]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Corbin Bernsen]], [[Sela Ward]], [[Austin Pendleton]], [[Carrie Nye]], Robert Lewis, [[Madeleine Potter]], [[Thor Fields]] and [[Illeana Douglas]]. Hello Again opened at #2 in the Box Office earning $5,712,892 at its opening weekend and made $20,419,446 in its entire run.

==Plot==
[[Long Island]] housewife Lucy Chadman in the midst of a [[tarot]] card reading by her [[occult]] sister, Zelda. Just as Zelda exclaims something is going to happen, Lucy begins to choke to death on a [[South Korea]]n Chicken Ball. The film shows the difficulty of Lucy's loved ones, including Zelda, had in coping with her death. But the grief turns to excitement when Zelda receives a book of [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s called ''The Wisdom of Catagonia''. Within the book Zelda finds a spell that requires perfect [[astronomy|astronomical]] timing—the moon, the earth, and the [[Sirius|dog star]] must form a perfect [[isosceles triangle]]. Zelda performs the spell and Lucy appears.

Lucy begins to reacquaint herself with living and with her family who are shocked to see her alive again, one year later, and soon discovers that she cannot simply pick her life back up where she left off. She returns to find her widower husband has sold their home and married her greedy and double-crossing friend from college.  Her son, meanwhile, has opened his own successful restaurant and married, instead of going to Columbia.

When she returns to the hospital at which she died, the emergency room doctor who tried to revive her begins to fall for her. Zelda confides in the doctor that if Lucy does not find love by the next full moon, she will have to go back to the spirit world. He does not believe Zelda.  Eventually the press finds out that Lucy came back from the dead, and plague her, her family, and the hospital the ER doctor works at.  Her college friend becomes jealous of her media attention and the attention Lucy is getting from Mr. Chadman. She holds a news conference of her own and tells the media Lucy made the whole thing up—claiming that Lucy used [[tetrodotoxin]] as a means to fake her own death. Lucy does not defend herself, as she sees this as an opportunity to rid herself and her friends of the media. Instead, the doctor gets fired, her sister's occult store is vandalized and she is hated by almost everyone, except her family.  She decides to end the debacle once and for all by tricking her college friend into admitting she lied about Lucy faking her death in front of the media at a party the hospital is having. Lucy, the doctor, and her family walk away happily.  As the credits roll we see that both Lucy and Zelda get married and have children with their new loves (Lucy has twins). Lucy's son also becomes a father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4170">'''Helmuth Friedrichs''' (born 22 September 1899 in [[Otterndorf]] – died probably February 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi Party]] official. He was an important figure in the Office of the [[Deputy Führer]] and its successor the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]].

==Early years==
After secondary school Friedrichs enlisted in the [[German Imperial Army]] in 1916, seeing service in the [[First World War]]. Serving on both fronts, he was captured by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in October 1918 and held as a prisoner of war until the end of 1919. Serving with the [[Freikorps]] and the army, he joined with [[Karl Dincklage]], later a [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) leader, in campaigning for the [[German National People's Party]]. He also worked as a miner in [[Westphalia]] and studied at the Mining Academy in [[Clausthal-Zellerfeld]] without graduating.&lt;ref name="Reichstag"&gt;[http://www.reichstag-abgeordnetendatenbank.de/selectmaske.html?pnd=130472263&amp;recherche=ja Helmuth Friedrichs] in the ''Datenbank der Reichstagsabgeordneten''&lt;/ref&gt; He was nicknamed "Long Friedrichs" on account of his height.&lt;ref name="Orlow103"&gt;Dietrich Orlow, ''The History of the Nazi Party 1933-1945 Volume 2'', David &amp; Charles, 1973, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi Party==
He joined the Nazi Party in 1929&lt;ref name="Klee167"&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.'' Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; the SA in turn of the year 1929/1930&lt;ref name="Lilla162"&gt;Joachim Lilla: Statisten in Uniform : Die Mitglieder des Reichstags 1933 - 1945, Düsseldorf 2004, pp.162-163&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Schutzstaffel]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Waldemar Besson: ''Zur Geschichte des nationalsozialistischen Führungsoffiziers.'' In: [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]] München (ed.): ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte'' 9. Jahrgang, Heft 1, 1961, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the rank of [[Gruppenführer]] in the SS in 1944.&lt;ref name="Klee167"/&gt; He also served as a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] for [[Hessen-Nassau]] during the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Reichstag"/&gt;

===Party Chancellery===
Freidrichs was serving as head of organisation in Gau Essen in March 1934 when [[Rudolf Hess]] appointed him to his staff as head of the "party division".&lt;ref name="Orlow103"/&gt; In this role he served as liaison between Hess and [[Martin Bormann]], meeting the former weekly to obtain his general policy ideas before passing these on to Bormann who then developed specific initiative based upon Hess's initial ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Orlow, ''The History of the Nazi Party'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Walkenhorst]] served as his deputy, with both men remaining in office until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Orlow, ''The History of the Nazi Party'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Gerhard Klopfer]] Friedrichs was the highest-ranking bureaucrat behind Bormann in the Chancellery. As a result, he wielded a significant level of influence as the office controlled appointments to various party positions, including those of [[Gauleiter]] and Reich minister, and Bormann often delegated appointments to his two deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Orlow, ''The History of the Nazi Party'', p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Gottlob Berger]] he was also appointed as one of the two Chiefs of Staff of the [[Volkssturm]] upon the foundation of this civil defence force in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Dear, Michael Richard Daniell Foot (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Friedrichs was reported missing from February 1945; on 13 August 1951 he was declared legally dead by the [[Munich]] district court with his date of death officially set as 31 December 1945.&lt;ref name="Lilla162"/&gt;

'''Hysterectomy''' is the surgical removal of the [[uterus]]. It may also involve removal of the cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes and other surrounding structures.

Usually performed by a [[gynaecology|gynecologist]], hysterectomy may be total (removing the body, [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]], and [[cervix]] of the uterus; often called "complete") or partial (removal of the uterine body while leaving the cervix intact; also called "supracervical"). It is the most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure. In 2003, over 600,000 hysterectomies were performed in the United States alone, of which over 90% were performed for benign conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu JM, Wechter ME, Geller EJ, Nguyen TV, Visco AG | title = Hysterectomy rates in the United States, 2003 | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 110 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17978124 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000285997.38553.4b }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rates being highest in the industrialized world has led to the major controversy that hysterectomies are being largely performed for unwarranted and unnecessary reasons.&lt;ref name="Are Hysterectomies Too Common?"&gt;{{cite news | title = Are Hysterectomies Too Common? | work = TIME Magazine | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1644050,00.html?cnn=yes | date = 2006-07-01 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | first=Coco | last=Masters | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of the uterus renders the patient unable to bear children (as does removal of [[ovaries]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) and has surgical risks as well as long-term effects, so the surgery is normally recommended when other treatment options are not available or have failed. It is expected that the frequency of hysterectomies for non-malignant indications will fall as there are good alternatives in many cases.&lt;ref name=Bahamondes_2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bahamondes L, Bahamondes MV, Monteiro I | title = Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system: uses and controversies | journal = Expert Review of Medical Devices | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–445 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18573044 | doi = 10.1586/17434440.5.4.437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oophorectomy]] (removal of ovaries) is frequently done together with hysterectomy to decrease the risk of [[ovarian cancer]]. However, recent studies have shown that prophylactic oophorectomy without an urgent medical indication decreases a woman’s long-term survival rates substantially and has other serious adverse effects.&lt;ref name=Shuster_2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shuster LT, Gostout BS, Grossardt BR, Rocca WA | title = Prophylactic oophorectomy in premenopausal people and long-term health | journal = Menopause International | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 111–116 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18714076 | pmc = 2585770 | doi = 10.1258/mi.2008.008016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUSFive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Urogynecologic Society |date = May 5, 2015 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Urogynecologic Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-urogynecologic-society/ |accessdate = June 1, 2015}}, which cites: *{{cite journal|last1=Blank|first1=SV|title=Prophylactic and risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: recommendations based on risk of ovarian cancer|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 2011|volume=117|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=404; author reply 404|pmid=21252760|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182083189}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is not limited to pre-menopausal women; even women who have already entered menopause were shown to have experienced a decrease in long-term survivability post-oophorectomy.&lt;ref name=Shoupe_2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoupe D, Parker WH, Broder MS, Liu Z, Farquhar C, Berek JS | title = Elective oophorectomy for benign gynecological disorders | journal = Menopause | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl. 1 | pages = 580–585 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17476148 | doi = 10.1097/gme.0b013e31803c56a4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hysterectomy.png|thumb|Hysterectomy]]
Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure that has risks and benefits, and affects a woman's hormonal balance and overall health for the rest of her life. Because of this, hysterectomy is normally recommended as a last resort to remedy certain intractable uterine/reproductive system conditions. Such conditions include, but are not limited to:

Women may also express a desire to undergo an elective hysterectomy for reasons other than the resolution of reproductive system conditions or illnesses. Some of the conditions under which a person may request to have a hysterectomy (or have one requested for her if the woman is incapable of making the request) for non-illness reasons include may be as prophylaxis against certain reproductive system cancers, especially if there is a strong family history of reproductive system cancers (especially [[breast cancer]] in conjunction with [[BRCA mutation|BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation]]), or as part of recovery from such cancers. Some with severe [[developmental disabilities]] have had hysterectomies though this treatment is controversial at best. In the United States, specific cases of sterilization due to developmental disabilities have been found by state-level Supreme Courts to violate the patient's constitutional and common law rights.&lt;ref name="sterilization"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://purple.ndrn.org/ashley/default.htm |title=Growth Attenuation and Sterilization Procedures – "The Ashley Treatment" |author=Washington (state) Protection and Advocacy System |publisher=National Disabilities Rights Network |location=[[Washington, DC]] |accessdate=2011-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727114415/https://purple.ndrn.org/ashley/default.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gynecological malignancies===
Many types of reproductive system cancers are treated surgically. These include [[uterine cancer|uterine]], [[cervical cancer|cervical]], [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]], or [[endometrium]] [[tumors]], as well as [[uterine fibroids]] that do not respond to more conservative treatment options.&lt;ref name="Indications"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/hysterectomy.cfm | title = Hysterectomy Frequently Asked Questions | author = The National Women's Health Information Center | date = 2009-12-15 | publisher = Office of Women's Health, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | location = [[Washington, DC]] | accessdate = 2011-03-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110305161246/http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/hysterectomy.cfm | archivedate = 2011-03-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--===Sex reassignment surgery===
{{Main|Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male}}
Elective Hysterectomies with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are often performed either prior to or as a part of [[sex reassignment surgery]] for [[transmen|trans men]]. Some men choose to have this operation along with [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]] in the early stages of their gender transition to avoid complications from heavy testosterone use while still having female-hormone-producing organs in place (e.g., [[uterine cancer]] and hormonally induced [[coronary artery disease]]) or to remove as many sources of female sex hormones as possible in order to better "pass" during the [[real life experience]] portion of their transition. Others prefer to wait until they have full "[[Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male|bottom surgery]]" (removal of female sexual organs and construction of male-appearing external anatomy) to avoid undergoing multiple separate operations.{{Medical citation needed|date=June 2017}}--&gt;

===Risks and adverse effects===
In 1995, the short-term mortality (within 40 days of surgery) was reported at 0.38 cases per 1000 when performed for benign causes. Risks for surgical complications were presence of fibroids, younger age (vascular pelvis with higher bleeding risk and larger uterus), dysfunctional uterine bleeding and parity.&lt;ref name=McPherson_2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McPherson K, Metcalfe MA, Herbert A, Maresh M, Casbard A, Hargreaves J, Bridgman S, Clarke A | title = Severe complications of hysterectomy: the VALUE study | journal = BJOG | volume = 111 | issue = 7 | pages = 688–694 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15198759 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00174.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortality rate is several times higher when performed in patients who are pregnant, have cancer or other complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wingo PA, Huezo CM, Rubin GL, Ory HW, Peterson HB | title = The mortality risk associated with hysterectomy | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 152 | issue = 7 Pt 1 | pages = 803–808 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4025434 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9378(85)80067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term effect on all case mortality is relatively small. Women under the age of 45 years have a significantly increased long-term mortality that is believed to be caused by the hormonal side effects of hysterectomy and prophylactic oophorectomy.&lt;ref name="Shuster_2008"/&gt;

Approximately 35% of women after hysterectomy undergo another related surgery within 2 years.

Ureteral injury is not uncommon and occurs in 0.2 per 1,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomy and 1.3 per 1,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomy.&lt;ref name="Burks2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burks FN, Santucci RA | title = Management of iatrogenic ureteral injury | journal = Ther Adv Urol | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 115–24 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24883109 | pmc = 4003841 | doi = 10.1177/1756287214526767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury usually occurs in the distal ureter close to the [[infundibulopelvic ligament]] or as a ureter crosses below the uterine artery, often from blind clamping and ligature placement to control hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|440933|Ureteral Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
Hospital stay is 3 to 5 days or more for the abdominal procedure and between 1 and 2 days (but possibly longer) for vaginal or laparoscopically assisted vaginal procedures.&lt;ref name="what to expect"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/details/what-you-can-expect/rec-20178867 What you can expect], [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended oophorectomy and premature ovarian failure===
Removal of one or both ovaries is performed in a substantial number of hysterectomies that were intended to be ovary sparing.&lt;ref name=Laughlin_2000 /&gt;

The average onset age of [[menopause]] after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is 3.7 years earlier than average.&lt;ref name=Farquhar_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farquhar CM, Sadler L, Harvey SA, Stewart AW | title = The association of hysterectomy and menopause: a prospective cohort study | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 7 | pages = 956–62 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15957999 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00696.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested to be due to the disruption of blood supply to the ovaries after a hysterectomy or due to missing endocrine feedback of the uterus. The function of the remaining ovaries is significantly affected in about 40% of women, some of them even require hormone replacement treatment. Surprisingly, a similar and only slightly weaker effect has been observed for [[endometrial ablation]] which is often considered as an alternative to hysterectomy.

A substantial number of women develop benign ovarian cysts after a hysterectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petri Nahás EA, Pontes A, Nahas-Neto J, Borges VT, Dias R, Traiman P | title = Effect of total abdominal hysterectomy on ovarian blood supply in women of reproductive age | journal = Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–174 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15661947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on sexual life and pelvic pain===
After hysterectomy for benign indications the majority of women report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain. A smaller share of women report worsening of sexual life and other problems. The picture is significantly different for hysterectomy performed for malignant reasons; the procedure is often more radical with substantial side effects.&lt;ref name=Maas_2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maas CP, Weijenborg PT, ter Kuile MM | title = The effect of hysterectomy on sexual functioning | journal = Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 14 | pages = 83–113 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15287159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Komisaruk_2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Komisaruk BR, Frangos E, Whipple B | title = Hysterectomy Improves Sexual Response?

===Premature menopause and its effects===
Estrogen levels fall sharply when the ovaries are removed, removing the protective effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. This condition is often referred to as "surgical menopause", although it is substantially different from a naturally occurring menopausal state; the former is a sudden hormonal shock to the body that causes rapid onset of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, while the latter is a gradually occurring decrease of hormonal levels over a period of years with uterus intact and ovaries able to produce hormones even after the cessation of menstrual periods.

One study showed that risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease is substantially increased for women who had hysterectomy at age 50 or younger. No association was found for women undergoing the procedure after age 50. The risk is higher when ovaries are removed but still noticeable even when ovaries are preserved.&lt;ref name=Ingelson_2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ingelsson E, Lundholm C, Johansson AL, Altman D | title = Hysterectomy and risk of cardiovascular disease: A population-based cohort study | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 745–50 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21186237 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehq477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other studies have found that [[osteoporosis]] (decrease in bone density) and increased risk of bone [[fractures]] are associated with hysterectomies.&lt;ref name=Kelsey_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelsey JL, Prill MM, Keegan TH, Quesenberry CP, Sidney S | title = Risk factors for pelvis fracture in older persons | journal = Am.

Hysterectomies have also been linked with higher rates of heart disease and weakened bones. Those who have undergone a hysterectomy with both ovaries removed typically have reduced [[testosterone]] levels as compared to those left intact.&lt;ref name=Laughlin_2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laughlin GA, Barrett-Connor E, Kritz-Silverstein D, von Mühlen D | title = Hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and endogenous sex hormone levels in older women: the Rancho Bernardo Study | journal = J.

Oophorectomy before the age of 45 is associated with a fivefold mortality from neurologic and mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rivera CM, Grossardt BR, Rhodes DJ, Rocca WA | title = Increased Mortality for Neurological and Mental Diseases following Early Bilateral Oophorectomy | journal = Neuroepidemiology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–40 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19365140 | pmc = 2697609 | doi = 10.1159/000211951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urinary incontinence and vaginal prolapse===
Urinary incontinence and [[vaginal prolapse]] are well known adverse effects that develop with high frequency a very long time after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery.&lt;ref name="Brown_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown JS, Sawaya G, Thom DH, Grady D | title = Hysterectomy and urinary incontinence: a systematic review | journal = The Lancet | volume = 356 | issue = 9229 | pages = 535–539 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10950229 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02577-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress incontinence following hysterectomy.&lt;ref name=Altman_2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altman D, Granath F, Cnattingius S, Falconer C | title = Hysterectomy and risk of stress-urinary-incontinence surgery: nationwide cohort study | journal = The Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9597 | pages = 1494–1499 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17964350 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61635-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McPherson_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McPherson K, Herbert A, Judge A, Clarke A, Bridgman S, Maresh M, Overton C | title = Self-reported bladder function five years post-hysterectomy | journal = Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16183583 | doi = 10.1080/01443610500235170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk for vaginal prolapse depends on factors such as number of vaginal deliveries, the difficulty of those deliveries, and the type of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lukanovic A, Drazic K | title = Risk factors for vaginal prolapse after hysterectomy | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics: The Official Organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–30 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20362288 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.01.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall incidence is approximately doubled after hysterectomy.&lt;ref name=Altman_2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altman D, Falconer C, Cnattingius S, Granath F | title = Pelvic organ prolapse surgery following hysterectomy on benign indications | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 198 | issue = 5 | pages = 572.e1–572.e6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18355787 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2008.01.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adhesion formation and bowel obstruction===
The formation of postoperative [[adhesions]] is a particular risk after hysterectomy because of the extent of dissection involved as well as the fact the hysterectomy wound is in the most gravity-dependent part of the pelvis into which a loop of bowel may easily fall.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wiseman DM | title = Disorders of adhesions or adhesion-related disorder: monolithic entities or part of something bigger—CAPPS? | journal = Semin.

===Wound infection===
[[Wound infection]] occurs in approximately 3% of cases of abdominal hysterectomy. The risk is increased by obesity, diabetes, immunodeficiency disorder, use of systemic corticosteroids, smoking, wound hematoma, and preexisting infection such as chorioamnionitis and [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].&lt;ref name="Duff2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duff|first1=Patrick|title=Diagnosis and Management of Postoperative Infection|journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine|year=2009|issn=1756-2228|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10032|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Diagnosis%20and%20Management%20of%20Postoperative%20Infection/item/32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such wound infections mainly take the form of either [[incisional abscess]] or wound [[cellulitis]]. Typically, both confer [[erythema]], but only an incisional abscess confers purulent drainage. The recommended treatment of an incisional abscess after hysterectomy is by [[incision and drainage]], and then coverage by a thin layer of [[gauze]] followed by sterile [[Dressing (medical)|dressing]]. The dressing should be changed and the wound irrigated with normal saline at least twice each day. In addition, it is recommended to administer an antibiotic active against staphylococci and streptococci, preferably [[vancomycin]] when there is a risk of [[MRSA]].&lt;ref name="Duff2009"/&gt; The wound can be allowed to close by [[secondary intention]]. Alternatively, if the infection is cleared and healthy granulation tissue is evident at the base of the wound, the edges of the incision may be reapproximated, such as by using [[butterfly stitches]], [[Surgical staple|staples]] or [[suture (surgery)|sutures]].&lt;ref name="Duff2009"/&gt;  Sexual intercourse remains possible after hysterectomy. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | name-list-format = vanc | title = Williams gynecology, 2nd edition | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical |page=65 |location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0071716727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|1020–1348}}

===Other rare problems===
Hysterectomy may cause an increased risk of the relatively rare [[renal cell carcinoma]]. The increased risk is particularly pronounced for young women; the risk was lower after vaginally performed hysterectomies.&lt;ref name=Altman_2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altman D, Yin L, Johansson A, Lundholm C, Grönberg H | title = Risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma After Hysterectomy | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 170 | issue = 22 | pages = 2011–2016 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21149759 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormonal effects or injury of the ureter were considered as possible explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gago-Dominguez M, Castelao JE, Yuan JM, Ross RK, Yu MC | title = Increased risk of renal cell carcinoma subsequent to hysterectomy | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 999–1003 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10566555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zucchetto A, Talamini R, Dal Maso L, Negri E, Polesel J, Ramazzotti V, Montella M, Canzonieri V, Serraino D, La Vecchia C, Franceschi S | title = Reproductive, menstrual, and other hormone-related factors and risk of renal cell cancer | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 123 | issue = 9 | pages = 2213–2216 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18711701 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.23750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the renal cell carcinoma may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed [[hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer]] syndrome.

Removal of the uterus without removing the ovaries can produce a situation that on rare occasions can result in [[ectopic pregnancy]] due to an undetected fertilization that had yet to descend into the uterus before surgery.  Two cases have been identified and profiled in an issue of the ''Blackwell Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology''; over 20 other cases have been discussed in additional medical literature.&lt;ref name=bjo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cocks | first1 = P.

===Heavy bleeding===
[[IUD with progestogen|Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices]] are highly effective at controlling [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] (DUB) or [[menorrhagia]] and should be considered before any surgery.&lt;ref name=Milsom_2007&gt;{{cite journal | author = Milsom I | title = The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as an alternative to hysterectomy in peri-menopausal women | journal = Contraception | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = S152–S154 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17531608 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2007.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menorrhagia (heavy or abnormal menstrual bleeding) may also be treated with the less invasive [[endometrial ablation]] which is an outpatient procedure in which the lining of the uterus is destroyed with heat, mechanically or by radio frequency ablation. Endometrial ablation greatly reduces or entirely eliminates monthly bleeding in ninety percent of patients with DUB. It is not effective for patients with very thick uterine lining or uterine fibroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pesmen |first=Curt | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 27, 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/27/healthmag.surgery/index.html |title=5 operations you don't want to get – and what to do instead |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uterine fibroids===
{{further|uterine fibroids}}

[[IUD with progestogen|Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices]] are highly effective in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically very moderate because the [[levonorgestrel]] (a [[progestin]]) is released in low concentration locally. There is now substantial evidence that Levongestrel-IUDs provide good symptomatic relief for women with fibroids.&lt;ref name=Zapata_2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zapata LB, Whiteman MK, Tepper NK, Jamieson DJ, Marchbanks PA, Curtis KM | title = Intrauterine device use among women with uterine fibroids: a systematic review☆ | journal = Contraception | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–55 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20682142 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2010.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uterine fibroids may be removed and the uterus reconstructed in a procedure called  "[[myomectomy]]."  A myomectomy may be performed through an open incision, laparoscopically or through the vagina (hysterescopy).&lt;ref&gt;Parker, William H. and Parker, Rachel L. (2002)  [http://www.gynsecondopinion.com#why "A Gynecologist's Second Opinion: The Questions &amp; Answers You Need to Take Charge of Your Health,"] Plume; Rev ed., 89–92, 105–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Uterine artery embolization]]'' (UAE) is a minimally invasive procedure for treatment of [[uterine fibroid]]s. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or [[polyvinyl alcohol]] (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block the flow of blood through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta JK, Sinha A, Lumsden MA, Hickey M | title = Uterine artery embolization for symptomatic uterine fibroids | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 12 | pages = CD005073 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25541260 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005073.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uterine fibroids can be removed with a non-invasive procedure called [[Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound]] (MRgFUS).

===Prolapse===
Prolapse may also be corrected surgically without removal of the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick R. Jelovsek, [http://www.wdxcyber.com/nurine08.htm#why "Having Prolapse, Cystocele and Rectocele Fixed Without Hysterectomy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Scheme hysterectomy-en.svg|thumb|Schematic drawing of types of hysterectomy]]

Hysterectomy, in the literal sense of the word, means merely removal of the uterus. However other organs such as ovaries, fallopian tubes and the cervix are very frequently removed as part of the surgery.

* '''Radical hysterectomy''': complete removal of the uterus, cervix, upper vagina, and [[parametrium]]. Indicated for cancer. Lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are also usually removed in this situation, such as in ''{{visible anchor|[[Wertheim's hysterectomy]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O62-Wertheimshysterectomy.html encyclopedia.com &gt; Wertheim's hysterectomy] Citing: "Wertheim's hysterectomy." A Dictionary of Nursing. 2008. Encyclopedia.com. (October 13, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Total hysterectomy''': complete removal of the uterus and cervix, with or without [[oophorectomy]].
* '''Subtotal hysterectomy''': removal of the uterus, leaving the cervix in situ.

Subtotal (supracervical) hysterectomy was originally proposed with the expectation that it may improve sexual functioning after hysterectomy, it has been postulated that removing the cervix causes excessive neurologic and anatomic disruption, thus leading to vaginal shortening, [[vaginal vault prolapse]], and vaginal cuff granulations. These theoretical advantages were not confirmed in practice, but other advantages over total hysterectomy emerged. The principal disadvantage is that risk of cervical cancer is not eliminated and women may continue cyclical bleeding (although substantially less than before the surgery).
These issues were addressed in a systematic review of total versus supracervical hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions, which reported the following findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lethaby A, Mukhopadhyay A, Naik R | title = Total versus subtotal hysterectomy for benign gynaecological conditions | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = CD004993 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22513925 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004993.pub3 | editor1-last = Lethaby | editor1-first = Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* There was no difference in the rates of incontinence, constipation, measures of sexual function or alleviation of pre-surgery symptoms.
* Length of surgery and amount of blood lost during surgery were significantly reduced during supracervical hysterectomy compared to total hysterectomy, but there was no difference in post-operative transfusion rates.
* Febrile morbidity was less likely and ongoing cyclic vaginal bleeding one year after surgery was more likely after supracervical hysterectomy.
* There was no difference in the rates of other complications, recovery from surgery, or readmission rates.

In the short-term, randomized trials have shown that cervical preservation or removal does not affect the rate of subsequent pelvic organ prolapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thakar R, Ayers S, Clarkson P, Stanton S, Manyonda I | title = Outcomes after Total versus Subtotal abdominal hysterectomy | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 347 | issue = 17 | pages = 1318–25 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12397189 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa013336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supracervical hysterectomy does not eliminate the possibility of having [[cervical cancer]] since the cervix itself is left intact and may be contraindicated in women with increased risk of this cancer; regular [[pap smear]]s to check for [[cervical dysplasia]] or [[cancer]] are still needed.&lt;ref name="AAFPfive"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians |author1-link=American Academy of Family Physicians |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher=[[American Academy of Family Physicians]] |journal=Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |date=April 2012 |url=http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624075453/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whenpaptest"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1 = Consumer Reports |author2 = American Academy of Family Physicians |author1-link = Consumer Reports |author2-link = American Academy of Family Physicians|date = May 2012 |title = Pap tests: When you need them—and when you don't |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |journal = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]|url = http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ChoosingWiselyPapTestsAAFP.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Hysterectomy can be performed in different ways. The oldest known technique is vaginal hysterectomy. The first planned hysterectomy was performed by Konrad Langenbeck - Surgeon General of the Hannovarian army, although there are records of vaginal hysterectomy for prolapse going back as far as 50BC.

The first abdominal hysterectomy recorded was by Ephraim McDowell. He performed the procedure in 1809 for a mother of five for a large ovarian mass on her kitchen table.&lt;ref&gt;www.oxfordwomenshealth.co.nz/blog/hysterectomy-then-and-now&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern medicine today, laparoscopic vaginal (With additional instruments passing through ports in small abdominal incisions, close or in the navel) and total laparoscopic techniques have been developed.

===Abdominal hysterectomy===
Most hysterectomies in the United States are done via [[laparotomy]] (abdominal incision, not to be confused with [[laparoscopy]]). A [[Pfannenstiel incision|transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision]] is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the [[pubic bone]], as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower [[pelvis]] as possible, similar to the incision made for a [[caesarean section]]. This technique allows [[physician]]s the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the [[abdominal wall]]. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques, it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy; meanwhile, the vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.&lt;ref name=Thomas_2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas B, Magos A | title = Subtotal hysterectomy and myomectomy – Vaginally | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–152 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21185235 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2010.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seth_2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheth SS, Paghdiwalla KP, Hajari AR | title = Vaginal route: A gynaecological route for much more than hysterectomy | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–132 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21349773 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2010.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaginal hysterectomy===
Vaginal hysterectomy is performed entirely through the vaginal canal and has clear advantages over abdominal surgery such as fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and shorter healing time. Abdominal hysterectomy, the most common method, is used in cases such as after caesarean delivery, when the indication is cancer, when complications are expected, or surgical exploration is required.

===Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy===
With the development of laparoscopic techniques in the 1970s and 1980s, the "laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy" (LAVH) has gained great popularity among [[gynecologists]] because compared with the abdominal procedure it is less invasive and the post-operative recovery is much faster. It also allows better exploration and slightly more complicated surgeries than the vaginal procedure. LAVH begins with [[laparoscopy]] and is completed such that the final removal of the uterus (with or without removing the ovaries) is via the vaginal canal. Thus, LAVH is also a total hysterectomy; the cervix is removed with the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foundationforwomenscancer.org/types-of-gynecologic-cancers/uterine/surgery/|title=Surgery - Foundation for Women's Cancer|work=Foundation for Women's Cancer|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cervix is removed along with the uterus, the upper portion of the vagina is sutured together and called the [[vaginal cuff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cronin B, Sung VW, Matteson KA | title = Vaginal cuff dehiscence: risk factors and management | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 206 | issue = 4 | pages = 284–8 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21974989 | pmc = 3319233 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2011.08.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laparoscopic-assisted supracervical hysterectomy===
The "laparoscopic-assisted supracervical hysterectomy" (LASH) was later developed to remove the uterus without removing the cervix using a [[morcellator]] which cuts the uterus into small pieces that can be removed from the abdominal cavity via the laparoscopic ports.

===Total laparoscopic hysterectomy===
Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) was developed in the early 90s by Prabhat K. Ahluwalia in Upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ahluwalia PK | title = Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy | journal = The Journal of the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists | volume = 3 | issue = 4, Supplement | pages = S1–2 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 9074073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TLH is performed solely through the laparoscopes in the abdomen, starting at the top of the uterus, typically with a uterine manipulator. The entire uterus is disconnected from its attachments using long thin instruments through the "ports". Then all tissue to be removed is passed through the small abdominal incisions.

===Other techniques===
Supracervical (subtotal) laparoscopic hysterectomy (LSH) is performed similar to the total laparoscopic surgery but the uterus is amputated between the cervix and fundus.

Dual-port laparoscopy is a form of laparoscopic surgery using two 5&amp;nbsp;mm midline incisions: the uterus is detached through the two ports and removed through the vagina.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lii SJ, Becker SF, Danilyants NE, MacKoul PJ | title = A Novel Approach to Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Using Only Two 5mm Ports: Initial Clinical Experience | journal = Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = S87 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jmig.2010.08.381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moawad G, Robinson JK | title = Dual Port Hysterectomy: A Novel Technique and Initial Experience | journal = Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = S86 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jmig.2012.08.620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Robotic hysterectomy" is a variant of laparoscopic surgery using special remotely controlled instruments that allow the surgeon finer control as well as three-dimensional magnified vision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007339.htm Medline Plus: Robotic surgery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of techniques===
Patient characteristics such as the reason for needing a hysterectomy, uterine size, descent of the uterus, presence of diseased tissues surrounding the uterus, previous surgery in the pelvic region, obesity, history of pregnancy, the possibility of [[endometriosis]], or the need for an [[oophorectomy]], will influence a surgeon’s surgical approach when performing a hysterectomy.&lt;ref name=Aarts2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aarts JW, Nieboer TE, Johnson N, Tavender E, Garry R, Mol BW, Kluivers KB | title = Surgical approach to hysterectomy for benign gynaecological disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD003677 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26264829 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003677.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laparoscopic surgery offers certain advantages when vaginal surgery is not possible but also has the disadvantage of significantly longer time required for the surgery.&lt;ref name="Aarts2015" /&gt;

In one 2004 study conducted in the UK comparing abdominal (laparotomic) and laparoscopic techniques, laparoscopic surgery was found to cause longer operation time and a higher rate of major complications while offering much quicker healing.&lt;ref name="Garry_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garry R, Fountain J, Mason S, Hawe J, Napp V, Abbott J, Clayton R, Phillips G, Whittaker M, Lilford R, Bridgman S, Brown J | title = The eVALuate study: two parallel randomised trials, one comparing laparoscopic with abdominal hysterectomy, the other comparing laparoscopic with vaginal hysterectomy | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 328 | issue = 7432 | pages = 129–0 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14711749 | pmc = 314503 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.37984.623889.F6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study conducted in 2014, laparoscopy was found to be "a safe alternative to laparotomy" in patients receiving total hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. Researchers concluded the procedure "offers markedly improved perioperative outcomes with a lower reoperation rate and fewer postoperative complications when the standard of care shifts from open surgery to laparoscopy in a university hospital".&lt;ref name="Boosz_2014 Jul 10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boosz A, Haeberle L, Renner SP, Thiel FC, Mehlhorn G, Beckmann MW, Mueller A | title = Comparison of reoperation rates, perioperative outcomes in women with endometrial cancer when the standard of care shifts from open surgery to laparoscopy | journal = Arch Gynecol Obstet | year = 2014 | pmid = 25009071 | doi = 10.1007/s00404-014-3347-9 | volume=290 | issue=6 | pages=1215–1220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal hysterectomy is the only available option that is feasible without total anaesthesia or in outpatient settings (although doing it without anesthesia is recommended only in exceptional cases).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The abdominal technique is very often applied in difficult circumstances or when complications are expected. Given these circumstances the complication rate and time required for surgery compares very favorably with other techniques, however time required for healing is much longer.&lt;ref name=Aarts2015 /&gt;

Hysterectomy by abdominal laparotomy is correlated with much higher incidence of intestinal adhesions than other techniques.&lt;ref name="Barmparas_2010" /&gt;

Time required for completion of surgery in the eVAL trial is reported as follows:&lt;ref name=Garry_2004 /&gt;

* abdominal 55.2 minutes average, range 19–155
* vaginal 46.6 minutes average, range 14–168
* laparoscopic (all variants) 82.5 minutes average, range 10–325 (combined data from both trial arms)

Robotic assisted surgery is presently used in several countries for hysterectomies. Additional research is required to determine the benefits and risks involved, compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery.&lt;ref name=Liu2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Lawrie TA, Lu D, Song H, Wang L, Shi G | title = Robot-assisted surgery in gynaecology | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD011422 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25493418 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 Cochrane review found that robotic assisted surgery may have a similar complication rate when compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that although the surgery make take longer, robotic assisted surgery may result in shorter hospital stays.&lt;ref name=Liu2014 /&gt; More research is necessary to determine if robotic assisted hysterectomies are beneficial for people with cancer.&lt;ref name=Liu2014 /&gt;

==Incidence==

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the ''number'' of hysterectomies between 2008 and 2009 was almost 47,000. The national rate for the same timeline was 338 per 100,000 population, down from 484 per 100,000 in 1997. The reasons for hysterectomies differed depending on whether the woman was living in an urban or rural location. Urban women opted for hysterectomies due to [[uterine fibroids]] and rural women had hysterectomies mostly for [[menstrual disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/05/27/hysterectomy-canada.html|title=Hysterectomy rates falling: report|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2010-05-28|date=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the [[National Center for Health Statistics]], of the 617,000 hysterectomies performed in 2004, 73% also involved the surgical removal of the ovaries. In the United States, 1 in 3 women can be expected to have a hysterectomy by age 60.&lt;ref name="Hysterectomy FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hysterectomy |work=National Women’s Health Information Center |url=http://4women.gov/faq/hysterectomy.htm |date=2006-07-01 |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040225072225/http://4women.gov/faq/hysterectomy.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently an estimated 22 million women in the United States who have undergone this procedure.

According to the same source, hysterectomy is the second most common major surgery among women in the United States (the first is cesaerean section). In the 1980s and 1990s, this statistic was the source of concern among some consumer rights groups and puzzlement among the medical community,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/20/science/rate-of-hysterectomies-puzzles-experts.html 1988 article by the New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; and brought about informed choice advocacy groups like [[Hysterectomy Educational Resources and Services (HERS) Foundation]], founded by [[Nora W. Coffey]] in 1982.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, 1 in 5 women is likely to have a hysterectomy by the age of 60, and ovaries are removed in about 20% of hysterectomies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Hysterectomy and HRT | url = https://books.google.com/?id=v-ENVtKsRhUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=hysterectomy+incidence | page = 3 | first1 = Gautam | last1 = Khastgir | first2 = John | last2 = Studd | name-list-format = vanc | isbn=978-1-85317-408-7 | year=1998 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The number of hysterectomies in [[Germany]] has been constant for many years. In 2006, 149,456 hysterectomies were performed. Additionally, Of these, 126,743 (84.8%) successfully benefitted the patient without incident. Women between the ages of 40 and 49 accounted for 50 percent of hysterectomies, and those between the ages of 50 and 59 accounted for 20 percent.&lt;ref name="ApUm01062008"&gt;{{cite book | first = Christine | last = Wolfrum | name-list-format = vanc  | chapter = Vorschnelle Schnitte | title = Apotheken Umschau | date = 1 June 2008 | publisher = [[Wort &amp; Bild Verlag]] | location =  Baierbrunn | title-link = Apotheken Umschau }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the number of hysterectomies decreased to 138,164.&lt;ref name="pmid20539807"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Müller A, Thiel FC, Renner SP, Winkler M, Häberle L, Beckmann MW | title = Hysterectomy-a comparison of approaches | journal = Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 353–9 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20539807 | pmc = 2883234 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2010.0353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the technique of laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted hysterectomies has been raised into the foreground.&lt;ref name="pmid16754157"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettler L, Ahmed-Ebbiary N, Schollmeyer T | title = Laparoscopic hysterectomy: challenges and limitations | journal = Minimally Invasive Therapy &amp; Allied Technologies | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–59 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16754157 | doi = 10.1080/13645700510034010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JägerSauer2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jäger C, Sauer G, Kreienberg R | title = Die laparoskopisch assistierte vaginale Hysterektomie – Sinn oder Unsinn?|journal=Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | year = 2007 | pages = 628–632 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-965243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the number of hysterectomies from the 1980s to the 1990s decreased by 38 percent. In 1988, there were 173 such surgeries per 100,000 women, and by 1998 this number had been reduced to 107. The proportion of abdominal supracervical hysterectomies in the same time period grew from 7.5 to 41 percent.

In [[biology]] and [[botany]], '''indeterminate growth''' is growth that is not terminated in contrast to '''determinate growth''' that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces [[flower]]s and [[fruit]] until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to [[tomato]] varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies.

==Inflorescences==
In reference to an [[inflorescence]] (a shoot specialised for bearing flowers, and bearing no leaves other than [[bract]]s), an indeterminate type (such as a [[raceme]]) is one in which the first flowers to develop and open are from the buds at the base, followed progressively by buds nearer to the growing tip. The growth of the shoot is not impeded by the opening of the early flowers or development of fruits and its appearance is of growing, producing, and maturing flowers and fruit indefinitely. In practice the continued growth of the terminal end necessarily peters out sooner or later, though without producing any definite terminal flower, and in some species it may stop growing before any of the buds have opened. 

Not all plants produce indeterminate inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates the development of new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a '''determinate'' inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|terminal flower]] blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side buds develop lower down. One type of example is [[Dianthus]] another type is exemplified by [[Allium]] and yet others by [[Daucus]].

==Animals==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In zoology, indeterminate growth refers to the condition where animals grow rapidly when young, and continue to grow after reaching adulthood although at a slower pace.&lt;ref name="pmid11675785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West GB, Brown JH, Enquist BJ | title = A general model for ontogenetic growth | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6856 | pages = 628–31 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11675785 | doi = 10.1038/35098076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and many molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Optimal allocation of resources explains interspecific life-history patterns in animals with indeterminate growth | author=Jan Kozłowski | journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B | year=1996 | volume=263 | pages=559–566 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also refers to the pattern of hair growth sometimes seen in humans and a few domestic breeds, where hair continues to grow in length until it is cut.

==Mushrooms==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}

Some mushrooms&amp;nbsp;– notably ''[[Cantharellus californicus]]''&amp;nbsp;– also exhibit indeterminate growth.&lt;ref name=BAMS&gt;{{citation |last=Viess |first=Debbie |url=http://www.bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/chanterelle.html |title=Cantharellus californicus: California's Giant, Oak-Loving Golden Chanterelle |publisher=Bay Area Mycological Society |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John James "Jack" Quinn''' (28 September 1874 – 11 December 1918) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

==Football career==
Quinn was a member of the Geelong squad which played in the VFL's [[1897 VFL season|inaugural season in 1897]] and was one of the 20 Geelong players that debuted in the opening round fixture against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmesby|first1=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781920910785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFLTables&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/J/Jack_Quinn0_gm.html|title=Jack Quinn – Games Played|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A forward, Quinn kicked three goals in Geelong's 81-point win over [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] at [[Junction Oval]] in round seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9179470 |title=Geelong at their Best. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=23 June 1897 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article139743459 |title=Jubilee Games. |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |location=Melbourne |date=26 June 1897 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |page=22 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geelong's winning score 16.18 (114) set a [[List of VFL/AFL records|league record]] which lasted until the [[1899 VFL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1897/091518970622.html|title=St Kilda v Geelong – Tue, 22-Jun-1897 3:00 PM – Match Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1899/111518990513.html|title=Melbourne v St Kilda – Sat, 13-May-1899 3:00 PM – Match Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed just one game in the home and away season, which Geelong finished on [[List of Australian Football League minor premiers|top of the ladder]].&lt;ref name=AFLTables/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFL&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovett, Michael|title=AFL 2004 – The Official Statistical History Of The AFL| publisher=AFL Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-9580300-5-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[1897 VFL finals series]] which was to be decided through the [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format, Geelong were second, with the club's six-point loss to eventual premiers Essendon in week one of the finals proving the difference.&lt;ref name=AFL/&gt; Quinn played in all three finals, for a total of 16 games for the year.&lt;ref name=AFLTables/&gt; He kicked 14 goals, a tally bettered by only two teammate, [[Eddy James]] and [[Charles Coles (footballer)|Charlie Coles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/1897.html|title=1897 Stats – Player Lists|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season he appeared in the opening five rounds and didn't play any further senior football for Geelong.&lt;ref name=AFLTables/&gt;

Quinn, who worked as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]], got married in 1910 to Elizabeth "Lizzie" Evans, a resident of [[Abbotsford, Victoria|Abbotsford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article176545835 |title=Mr. J.

'''Jerry Brien''' (born in [[Sydney, Australia]]) was a [[rugby league]] footballer and coach. He played for the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]], [[St. George Dragons]] and for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team]]. He also coached the [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury-Bankstown]] club.

==Career==
In 1925, Brien was chosen to play for [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] although he was only playing for the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Magpies]] reserve grade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Brien|url=http://www.yesterdayshero.com.au/PlayerProfile.aspx?fname=PlayerProfile.aspx&amp;QStr=1263|accessdate=21 September 2010| publisher=''yesterday's hero''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had played just a handful of first grade games since his debut in 1923.

Brien represented NSW again in 1928, and was selected to represent [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in the second test against England, but an injury suffered playing for Wests stopped him from making his international debut.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Whiticker|first1=Alan|last2=Hudson|first2=Glen|title=The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players|year=2007|publisher=''Gary Allen Pty Ltd''|location=[[Wetherill Park, New South Wales]]|isbn=978-1-877082-93-1|pages=53-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 6 seasons with the Magpies, Brien joined the [[St. George Dragons]] for 4 games in 1929.

After his retirement as a player,  Brien began coaching, including stints with South Grafton in 1932 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''|title=Football Rugby League|author=|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16853608?searchTerm=jerry+brien|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=6 April 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; Cowra in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''|title=Rugby League|author=|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16971299?searchTerm=jerry+brien|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=15 April 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Brien returned to coach the Magpies for the eight games of the shortened season. In 1939, he took over as coach at [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] for a season, and returned to be at the helm when they won their second premiership in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Brien|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/coaches/Jerry_Brien/summary.html|accessdate=21 September 2010| publisher=''Rugby League Project''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1947, Brien was NSW coach and one of their selectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''|title=State League Team Goes North To-day|author=Tom Goodman|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18035770?searchTerm=jerry+brien|accessdate=22 September 2010|date=18 July 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he became an Australian selector,&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt; but was dropped as a NSW selector in March 1951, making him inelegible to fill the national role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Sydney Morning Herald''|title=League Drops State Selector|author=|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18203716|accessdate=21 September 2010|date=13 March 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Brinsley Sheridan''' (January 22, 1870 – April 14, 1930) was an Irish American [[sportswriter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Sheridan&amp;GSfn=John&amp;GSmn=B&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdy=1930&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=12842355&amp;df=all&amp; Find-a-Grave.com – John B. Sheridan page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[County Meath, Ireland]], Sheridan was the son of Richard and Rosetta (née O'Reilly) Sheridan. He came to the [[United States]] when he was 18 years old.&lt;ref name=BF.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/showthread.php?57538-Meet-The-Sports-Writers/page2 |title=Baseball Fever – A Tribute to John B. Sheridan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheridan was an accomplished sports journalist in [[St. Louis]] newspapers from 1888 through 1929, while his column for ''[[Sporting News]]'' "Back of Home Plate", published between 1917 and 1929, earned him national respect as a [[baseball]] writer. In addition, he wrote with authority about [[American football]], [[boxing]] and [[golf]], among other sports.&lt;ref name=BF.com/&gt;

By 1921 he was named chairman of the Missouri Committee on Public Utility Information. While on committee, he ''[[Whistleblower|blew the whistle]]'' on some dishonest and illegal activities in the department, and decided to submit his resignation. Shortly thereafter he suffered a nervous breakdown because of the affair and underwent medical care in sanitarium, but he never recovered at all.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Sheridan Obituary at ''Sporting News'', April 24, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheridan died in 1930 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], at the age of 59. He was found hanging in his room at [[Alexians#Present situation|Alexian Brothers Hospital]] by a bathrobe cord.&lt;ref name=BF.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeadballera.com/suicides.html The Deadball Era – Suicides List]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixteen years later, Sheridan became one of 12 writers who were honored by the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] on a [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946#The Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]] in its [[Honor Rolls of Baseball#Writers|Class of 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, Fred; Ritter, Lawrence. 1977.

'''''Kitten Sanctuary''''' is the first [[iOS]] game of British indie developer [[Clockwork Pixels]], and was released on March 27, 2012.

==Critical reception==
The game has a [[Metacritic]] score of 85% based on 4 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/kitten-sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

SlideToPlay wrote "Not every game needs to be about guns or swords, and Kitten Sanctuary is a great alternative to the violence that computer games are often associated with. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slidetoplay.com/review/kitten-sanctuary-review/&lt;/ref&gt; [[TouchArcade]] wrote "Kitten Sanctuary is a very sweet game, but beyond that it's well-crafted, and the attention to detail shows. "&lt;ref&gt;http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/09/kitten-sanctuary-review/&lt;/ref&gt; AppSpy said "While this is definitely aimed at younger players and lovers of all things kitten, the match three is fun and you definitely get your share of virtual pets. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appspy.com/review/5387/kitten-sanctuary-review&lt;/ref&gt; 148Apps said "Kitten Sanctuary doesn't reinvent the cheese wheel here (sorry), but the game successfully blends classic genres in an unexpected way that kept me playing far longer than I anticipated. It's a solid pick-up for casual gamers and cat ladies alike. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.148apps.com/reviews/kitten-sanctuary-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Friedrich Gödel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɜːr|d|əl}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|Gödel}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈkʊɐ̯t ˈɡøːdl̩|lang|Kurt gödel.ogg}}; April 28, 1906&amp;nbsp;– January 14, 1978) was an Austrian, and later American, [[logician]], [[mathematician]], and [[philosopher]]. Considered along with [[Aristotle]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref name="Stanford&amp;Son"&gt;For instance, in their ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/ Principia Mathematica]'' (''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred North Whitehead]],&lt;ref name="Stanford&amp;Son"/&gt; and [[David Hilbert]] were analyzing the use of logic and [[set theory]] to understand the [[foundations of mathematics]] pioneered by [[Georg Cantor]].

Gödel published his two [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent [[recursive set|recursive]] [[axiomatic system]] powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the [[natural number]]s (for example [[Peano arithmetic]]), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the [[axioms]]. To prove this theorem, Gödel developed a technique now known as [[Gödel numbering]], which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.

He also showed that neither the [[axiom of choice]] nor the [[continuum hypothesis]] can be disproved from the accepted [[axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]], assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to [[proof theory]] by clarifying the connections between [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]], and [[modal logic]].

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
Gödel was born April 28, 1906, in Brünn, [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]) into the [[Germans|ethnic German]] family of Rudolf Gödel (1874-1929), the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne Gödel (née Handschuh, 1879-1966).&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Gödel would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his birth the city had a [[German language|German-speaking]] majority which included his parents.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt Gödel were often active in Brünn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Gödel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the "Brünner Männergesangverein".&lt;ref&gt;Procházka 2008, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gödel automatically became a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of [[World War I]]. According to his classmate Klepetař, like many residents of the predominantly German [[Sudetenland|Sudetenländer]], "Gödel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to become an [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian]] citizen at age 23{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. When [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in 1938, Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After [[World War II]], at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.

In his family, young Kurt was known as ''Herr Warum'' ("Mr. Why") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from [[rheumatic fever]]; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Gödel suffered from "frequent episodes of poor health," which would continue for his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|last=Kim|first=Alan|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gödel attended the ''Evangelische Volksschule'', a Lutheran school in Brünn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the ''Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium'' from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for [[Vienna]] to go to medical school at the [[University of Vienna]]. During his teens, Kurt studied [[Gabelsberger shorthand]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'' and criticisms of [[Isaac Newton]], and the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]].

===Studying in Vienna===
At the age of 18, Gödel joined his brother in Vienna and entered the University of Vienna. By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially intending to study [[theoretical physics]], he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of [[mathematical realism]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science|Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft]]'', and participated in the [[Vienna Circle]] with [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Gödel then studied [[number theory]], but when he took part in a seminar run by [[Moritz Schlick]] which studied [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', he became interested in [[mathematical logic]]. According to Gödel, mathematical logic was "a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, J. (2011) ''[[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood]],'' London, Fourth Estate, p181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attending a lecture by [[David Hilbert]] in [[Bologna]] on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set Gödel's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] published ''Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik'' (''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''), an introduction to [[first-order logic]] in which the problem of completeness was posed: ''Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?''

This became the topic that Gödel chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral [[dissertation]] under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established the completeness of the [[first-order predicate calculus]] ([[Gödel's completeness theorem]]). He was awarded his doctorate in 1930. His thesis, along with some additional work, was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.

==Career==

===Incompleteness Theorem===
{{quote|Kurt Gödel's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental – indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with Gödel's achievement.|[[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Halmos | first = P.R. | title = The Legend of von Neumann | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 80 | number = 4 = April 1973 | pages = 382–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1931 and while still in Vienna, Gödel published his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] in ''Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der "Principia Mathematica" und verwandter Systeme'' (called in English "[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems|On Formally Undecidable Propositions of "''Principia Mathematica''" and Related Systems]]"). In that article, he proved for any [[Recursion theory|computable]] [[axiomatic system]] that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the [[natural numbers]] (e.g., the [[Peano axioms]] or [[ZFC|Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice]]), that:
# If a (logical or axiomatic formal) [[formal system|system]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]], it cannot be [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].
# The consistency of [[axiom]]s cannot be proved within their own [[Axiomatic system|system]].
These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of [[Frege]] and culminating in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and [[philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|Hilbert's formalism]], to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics.

In hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. Gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false.
Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.
That is, for any [[computably enumerable]] set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.
To make this precise, however, Gödel needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as [[Gödel number]]ing.

In his two-page paper ''Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül'' (1932) Gödel refuted the finite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]]. In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as [[intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett intermediate logic]] (or [[t-norm fuzzy logic|Gödel fuzzy logic]]).

===Mid-1930s: further work and U.S. visits===
Gödel earned his [[habilitation]] at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians.
In June 1936, [[Moritz Schlick]], whose seminar had aroused Gödel's interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, [[Johann Nelböck]].  This triggered "a severe nervous crisis" in Gödel.&lt;ref name=Casti2001&gt;{{Cite book

}}. From p.&amp;nbsp;80, which quotes Rudolf Gödel, Kurt's brother and a medical doctor. The words "a severe nervous crisis", and the judgement that the Schlick assassination was its trigger, are from the Rudolf Gödel quote. Rudolf knew Kurt well in those years.&lt;/ref&gt;
He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Gödel first traveled to the U.S., where he met [[Albert Einstein]], who became a good friend.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]'' (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;518&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. During this year, Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and [[Computable function|recursive functions]] to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using [[Gödel numbering]].

In 1934 Gödel gave a series of lectures at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, entitled ''On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems''. [[Stephen Kleene]], who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published.

Gödel visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him, and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the [[axiom of choice]] and of the [[continuum hypothesis]]; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.

He married Adele Nimbursky (née Porkert, 1899–1981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938.
Their relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was.

Subsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing ''Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gödel|first=Kurt|date=November 9, 1938|title=The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=24|issue=12|pages=556–557|issn=0027-8424|pmc=1077160|pmid=16577857}}&lt;/ref&gt; a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the [[constructible universe]], a model of [[set theory]] in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) and the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]]. [[Paul Cohen]] later constructed a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.

Godel spent the spring of 1939 at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.nd.edu/assets/13975/logicatndweb.pdf|title=Kurt Gödel at Notre Dame|last=Dawson|first=John W. Jr|date=|website=|page=4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=the Mathematics department at the University of Notre Dame was host ... for a single semester in the spring of 1939 [to] Kurt Gödel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princeton, Einstein, U.S. citizenship===
After the [[Anschluss]] on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of [[Nazi Germany]].
Germany abolished the title ''[[Privatdozent]]'', so Gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down.

His predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939.
Before the year was up, Gödel and his wife left Vienna for [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the Gödels took the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the US by train to Princeton. There Gödel accepted a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS), which he had previously visited during 1933-34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/scholars/godel IAC biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] was also living at Princeton during this time. Gödel and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist [[Oskar Morgenstern]] recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his "own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gödel and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in [[Blue Hill, Maine]], at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. Gödel was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using ''Heft'' 15 [volume 15] of Gödel's still-unpublished ''Arbeitshefte'' [working notebooks], [[John W. Dawson Jr.]] conjectures that Gödel discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. Gödel's close friend [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] supports this conjecture, noting that Gödel's Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem.

On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied Gödel to his [[U.S. citizenship]] exam, where they acted as witnesses. Gödel had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the [[U.S. Constitution]] that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be [[Phillip Forman]], who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel if he thought a dictatorship like the [[Nazi regime]] could happen in the U.S. Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gödel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 179–180. The story of Gödel's citizenship hearing is repeated in many versions. Dawson's account is the most carefully researched, but was written before the rediscovery of Morgenstern's written account. Most other accounts appear to be based on Dawson, hearsay or speculation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robert.accettura.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Morgenstern_onGoedelcitizenship.pdf |title=History of the Naturalization of Kurt Gödel |date=September 13, 1971 |format=PDF |author=Oskar Morgenstern |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226210511/https://robert.accettura.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Morgenstern_onGoedelcitizenship.pdf |archivedate=December 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gödel became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.ias.edu/people/godel|title = Kurt Gödel – Institute for Advanced Study|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his many years at the Institute, Gödel's interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving [[closed timelike curve]]s, to [[Einstein's field equations]] in [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, K., "An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations of Gravitation," ''[[Rev. Mod. Phys.]]'' '''21''', 447, published July 1, 1949 [http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.447].&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Albert-Einstein-Kurt-Goedel;art304,2454513 Das Genie &amp;amp; der Wahnsinn], ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', January 13, 2008 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; His "rotating universes" would allow [[time travel]] to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the [[Gödel metric]] (an exact solution of the [[Einstein field equation]]).

He studied and admired the works of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz's works to be suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Dawson, Jr. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gA8SucCU1AYC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=godel+leibniz&amp;lr= Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Gödel.] A K Peters, Ltd., 2005. P. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent he studied [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]. In the early 1970s, Gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz's version of [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s [[ontological argument|ontological proof]] of God's existence. This is now known as [[Gödel's ontological proof]].

==Awards and honours==
Gödel was awarded (with [[Julian Schwinger]]) the first [[Albert Einstein Award]] in 1951, and was also awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.jsp?recip_id=138|title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1968|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1968]].&lt;ref name=frs/&gt; He was a Plenary Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gödel, Kurt|chapter=Rotating universes in general relativity theory|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., August 30–September 6, 1950|volume=vol. 1|pages=175–181|year=1950|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1950.1/Main/icm1950.1.0175.0181.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gödel Prize]], an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science, is named after him.

==Later life and death==
Later in his life, Gödel suffered periods of [[mental disorder|mental instability]] and illness. He had an [[persecutory delusion|obsessive fear of being poisoned]]; he would eat only food that his wife, Adele, prepared for him. Late in 1977, she was hospitalized for six months and could no longer prepare her husband's food. In her absence, he refused to eat, eventually starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7038/full/435019a.html|title=Gödel's universe|author=Davis, Martin|work=Nature|date=May 4, 2005|volume=435|doi=10.1038/435019a|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He weighed {{convert|65|lbs|kg|order=flip}} when he died. His death certificate reported that he died of "malnutrition and [[inanition]] caused by personality disturbance" in [[Princeton Hospital]] on January 14, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Personal life==

===Religious views===
Gödel was a convinced [[theist]], in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A to Z of Mathematicians|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816053384|author=Tucker McElroy|page=118|quote=Gödel had a happy childhood, and was called "Mr. Why" by his family, due to his numerous questions. He was baptized as a Lutheran, and re-mained a theist (a believer in a personal God) throughout his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the notion that God was personal.

He believed firmly in an afterlife, stating: "Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today's science and received wisdom haven't any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology." It is "possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning" that it "is entirely consistent with known facts."  "If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife]."&lt;ref&gt;Hao Wang, "A Logical Journey: From Gödel to Philosophy", 1996, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is ''[[Theism|theistic]]'', not [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] rather than [[Spinoza]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;6, who cites Wang 1987. The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in Gödel's papers. Gödel filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. "Theistic" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not Gödel's. The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads "Baptist Lutheran" where Wang 1996 has "baptized Lutheran". Wang 1987 has "rel. cong.", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to "religious congregation".&lt;/ref&gt;  Describing religion(s) in general, Gödel said: "Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not".&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996 p.&amp;nbsp;316&lt;/ref&gt; According to his wife Adele, "Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning",&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; while of Islam, he said, "I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded".&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;148, 4.4.3. It is one of Gödel's observations, made between
16 November and 7 December 1975, which Wang found hard to classify under the main topics considered elsewhere in the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Kurt Gödel Society]], founded in 1987, was named in his honor. It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic, philosophy, and the [[history of mathematics]].  The [[University of Vienna]] hosts the Kurt Gödel Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The [[Association for Symbolic Logic]] has invited an annual Kurt Gödel lecturer each year since 1990.

Five volumes of Gödel's collected works have been published. The first two include Gödel's publications; the third includes unpublished manuscripts from Gödel's ''Nachlass'', and the final two include correspondence.

A biography of Gödel was published by [[John W. Dawson, Jr|John Dawson]] in 2005: ''Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Gödel'' ([[A. K. Peters]], Wellesley, MA, {{isbn|1-56881-256-6}}). Gödel was also one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 [[BBC]] documentary entitled ''Dangerous Knowledge'' by [[David Malone (independent filmmaker)|David Malone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC  |date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] wrote a popular book in 1979 called ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' to celebrate the work and ideas of Gödel, along with those of artist [[M. C. Escher]] and composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The book partly explores the ramifications of the fact that Gödel's incompleteness theorem can be applied to any [[Turing-complete]] computational system, which may include the [[human brain]].

'''Laura Serrano Garcia''' (born October 20, 1967 in [[Mexico City]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] boxer.

Serrano began boxing at the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] in [[Mexico City]], where she was studying to become a lawyer. She wanted to lose weight and stay in shape. She applied for a professional boxer's license in Mexico. After a short appearance in two episodes of the ''[[Volver a empezar (television)|Volver a empezar]]'' soap opera, she went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and on a [[pay per view]] card she challenged [[Christy Martin (boxer)|Christy Martin]] for the world title . It was her first fight as a professional and resulted in a [[tie (draw)|draw]].

Serrano's next fight was against world champion [[Deirdre Gogarty]]. She won by a knockout in seven rounds, in what was the first all [[women's boxing]] undercard held at the [[Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_ErHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=laura+serrano+boxer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hEK0IhuHyK&amp;sig=9DirZML7hf6by_SgvIrizzBqh2w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx18_0nPrTAhXjCMAKHTCnAVIQ6AEISzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=laura+serrano+boxer&amp;f=false|title=A History of Women's Boxing|first=Malissa|last=Smith|date=5 June 2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|accessdate=18 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano was supposed to box on the [[Julio César Chávez]]-[[Miguel Ángel González (boxer)|Miguel Ángel González]] [[Pay Per View]] event's undercard in [[Mexico City]], until an ordinance from 1947 was found, forbidding women from boxing events in Mexico. Thanks in part to Serrano's subsequent legal battle, the ordinance was dropped.

Serrano suffered a foot injury{{When|date=August 2010}} for which she underwent surgery, but in 1999 she came back and won a decision in her comeback bout. She then, on 2 September 1999, [details from her BoxRec page] met and defeated the world champion [[Tracy Byrd (boxer)|Tracy Byrd]] to become Mexico's first woman world boxing champion.

She defended her title against [[Cinthya Prouder]] (won in a unanimous decision after round 6), [[Alicia Ashley]] (won in a unanimous decision after round 8), [[Gina Greenwald]] (knockout in round 1) and [[Kelsey Jeffries]] (knockout in round 3), followed. The Jeffries fight resulted in Jeffries' first defeat.

On August 12, 2008, Serrano challenged [[Melissa Del Valle]] for the Junior Lightweight title. Once again, this world title attempt resulted in a draw ([[tie (draw)|tie]]).

Serrano has won her last two world title defenses, both decisions, one in ten rounds in Las Vegas and another one, a six-round win in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

== Personal ==
As of 2005, she was engaged to be married to a Puerto Rican. Serrano is also a lawyer.

During 2015, she was inducted as the first Hispanic in the [[International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwbhf.com/news042315serrano.htm|title=2015 IWBHF Inductee:  Laura Serrano|website=www.iwbhf.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marjorie Claire Stinson''' (July 5, 1895 – April 15, 1975) was an American aviator.

She trained at the [[Wright Flying School]], and earned her [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] license in 1914, becoming the ninth person to do so. Stinson became an exhibition pilot, and later was the first female airmail pilot in the United States, flying from [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] to [[San Antonio, Texas]] in 1915. Along with her sister [[Katherine Stinson|Katherine]], she taught at the Stinson School of Flying established by her mother. After it closed, Marjorie returned to exhibition flying and worked at the [[Department of the Navy]], retiring in 1945. She died at Rogers Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1975. Stinson was a charter member of the [[Ninety-Nines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crane|first1=Pamela|title=Marjorie Stinson comes home|journal=The 99 News|date=July 9, 1975|volume=2|issue=9|page=7|url=http://www.ninety-nines.org/pdf/newsmagazine/197507.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marjorie Stinson Is Dead at 79|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE4D6123AE034BC4E52DFB266838E669EDE|work=New York Times|subscription=yes|date=April 16, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Following in the footsteps of her sister, [[Katherine Stinson|Katherine]], Marjorie Stinson learned to fly in June 1914 at the Wright School in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. After being unsuccessful in starting an airmail route in Texas, she joined the family flight school, where she was an instructor like her sister. In 1915 she was the only woman admitted into the US Aviation Reserve Corps. In 1916 the [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Royal Canadian Flying Corps]] began sending their cadets to the Stinson School for their training, where she was referred to as "The Flying Schoolmarm" and her students as "The Texas Escadrille"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women in Aviation and Space History - Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|url = https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/women-in-aviation/StinsonM.cfm|website = airandspace.si.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stunt Show Pilot ===
From 1917 to 1928 Marjorie was a very successful stunt show pilot performing at events like:
* July 3, 1915, Marjorie made two flights in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], [[Louisiana]], one at 10:30 and one at 4:30
* August 29, 1914, Marjorie and her sister Katherine carried the yellow "votes for Women" banner in their [[Wright biplane|Wright Biplane]] at the suffrage field day in [[Chicago]], they abandoned their exhibition tour to take part in the suffragette field and thus raise $50,000 for six [[suffragette]] "campaign states" 
* June 23, 1919, a Campaign for $10,000,000 for a Victory Memorial Building in Washington, Marjorie flew across Washington to help advertise their campaign
* April 21, &lt;!-- what year? --&gt; Marjorie flew a small Curtis Plane between [[Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling|Bolling Field]] and Potomac park in Washington and upon landing sold $3000 worth of bonds for Victory Liberty Loans

== Legacy ==  
=== Death === 
When Marjorie died in 1976 on July 26 she was cremated and her ashes spread across the Stinson Airfield.  

=== Stinson Airfield ===

The [[Salafist Front]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] organization which is part of the now banned [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-led [[Anti-Coup Alliance]], had initially planned for the uprising earlier in November. The protests' main goal was to establish the "[[Sharia|Islamic identity]]" in Egypt, which they claim to have been hijacked by "secular conspiracies".&lt;ref name="DNE Nov. 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/11/01/salafi-front-vows-stage-islamic-revolution/ | title=Salafi Front vows to stage an ‘Islamic revolution’ | publisher=Daily News Egypt | date=1 November 2014 | accessdate=28 November 2014 | author=Youssef, Adham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security response ==
On November 25, Egypt's [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|interior minister]], [[Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa|Mohamed Ibrahim]], vowed to use lethal force against any attempts to assault public facilities. He said that his forces would use "all means" necessary to fight "terrorist factions".&lt;ref name="Yahoo Nov. 25"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-minister-warns-lethal-force-ahead-protest-140926998.html | title=Egypt minister warns of lethal force ahead protest | publisher=Yahoo News | work=Associated Press | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=28 November 2014 | author=Michael, Maggie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Ibrahim held a meeting with heads of different police departments and security directors of [[Greater Cairo]] to discuss plans to counter any anticipated acts of violence. The meeting also included other government departments such as communications, information technology and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/11/26/special-forces-explosive-experts-deployed-28-november-interior-ministry/ | title=Special forces, explosive experts to be deployed 28 November: Interior ministry | publisher=Daily News Egypt | date=26 November 2014 | accessdate=28 November 2014 | author=Youssef, Adham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security officials have been mainly worried that the supposed protests would be used as a cover by the insurgent group [[Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis]], which recently pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], to carry out bombings and attacks on this day.&lt;ref name="Yahoo Nov. 25"/&gt;

== Windham Hill years ==

In 1985, Aaberg signed a recording contract with [[Windham Hill Records]] and released the highly acclaimed solo album ''High Plains'' that showcased his eclectic musical background.

'''''Pokémon Channel''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Channel ~Together with Pikachu!~'''''|ポケモンチャンネル ～ピカチュウといっしょ！～|Pokemon Channeru ~Pikachū to Issho!~}}, is a 2003 [[video game]] in the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' series]] for the [[GameCube]], developed by [[Ambrella]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and distributed by [[Nintendo]]. The player's goal is to help [[Professor Oak]] refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a [[Pikachu]]. The game contains elements of the [[adventure video game|adventure]], [[digital pet]], and [[simulation video game|simulation]] genres. The player can explore full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environments, have Pikachu converse with other Pokémon, and collect various items.

The game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the [[Nintendo 64]] title ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'' and to promote the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in [[Sapporo]], [[Hokkaido]], Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.

==Gameplay==
''Pokémon Channel'' is difficult to categorize into a genre,&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sales2"/&gt; as it incorporates elements of [[adventure game|adventure]],&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; [[simulation video game|simulation]],&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and [[digital pet]] games.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The graphics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]],&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; the perspective is [[first-person (video games)|first-person]],&lt;ref name="allgame"/&gt; and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The game centers on watching television programs with a [[Pikachu]], a mouse-like [[Pokémon]].&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; The player, who lives in a house, can [[channel-surf]] freely among the various channels of a television network created by the Pokémon professor, [[Professor Oak]], as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot e3"/&gt; Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

While several channels are available, only a few are essential to the completion of the game. The player saves the game by reporting on recent accomplishments to Oak at ''Prof. Oak Report'', watches episodes of an [[anime]] series at ''[[Pichu]] Bros.'', and listens to plot-advancing news coverage from a [[Psyduck]] at ''Pokémon News Flash'' (PNF). On a channel called ''Shop 'n Squirtle'', the player uses the game's currency, "Poké", to purchase bus passes to travel among the game's locations, as well as non-essential items like Pokémon dolls, new television sets in various styles, and other decorations, all delivered by a Delibird (a bird-like Pokémon that carries various items in its satchel).&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo|quote='''Alert:''' Delibird came to make a delivery!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraneous channels include the [[trivia]]-based [[game show]] ''Quiz [[Wobbuffet]]'',&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; where the player earns Poké,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo|quote='''Wobbuffet:''' Correct! You've won [Poké symbol]50!}}&lt;/ref&gt; the art exhibition program ''[[Smeargle]]'s Art Study'', where Smeargle gives opinions on art that can be created in a [[paint by number|paint-by-numbers]] style in the player's house,&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot e3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokymon-channel-e3-2003-preshow-report/1100-6027644/|publisher=GameSpot|date=May 13, 2003|title=Pokémon Channel E3 2003 Preshow Report|accessdate=January 28, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325192456/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokymon-channel-e3-2003-preshow-report/1100-6027644/|archivedate = March 25, 2014|deadurl = no|first = Justin|last = Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the exercise program ''[[Smoochum]] Shape-Up''.&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt;

The main collectibles available in ''Pokémon Channel'' are [[collectible card game|trading cards]] that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic and play the respective Pokémon's cries.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks,&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; or by ordering from ''Shop 'n Squirtle''.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; There is a virtual [[Pokémon Mini]] console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: ''[[Snorlax]]'s Lunch Time'' (exclusive to ''Pokémon Channel'')&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/04/pokemon-mini|publisher=IGN|last=Harris|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist)|date=September 4, 2001|title=Pokemon Mini: Nintendo reveals details on its next Pokemon gimmick: an update to the Pocket Pikachu.|accessdate=January 29, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223164928/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/04/pokemon-mini|archivedate = February 23, 2014|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games are simple and mainly based on [[rhythm game|rhythm]].&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

==Plot==
[[Image:PokemonChannelQuizWobbuffet.JPG|thumb|left|Pikachu watches a game show, ''Quiz Wobbuffet'']]
The game opens with a group of [[Magnemite]]—magnet-like Pokémon with levitation abilities—delivering a television to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a [[beta tester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' You've been chosen as our first test audience. But, first things first. May I have your name?|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has them watch an episode of an anime called ''Pichu Bros.'' and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' Oh? What was that cry?|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian [[Treecko]] and the avian [[Torchic]]. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second beta tester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' [Player's name]! When you're filing your reports, could you let us know what it was like watching television with this Pikachu?|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing a few tasks, the player returns to Oak's channel, and the Professor remarks that Pikachu has behaved remarkably well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' I was a bit worried that Pikachu might get into some mischief, but I see there's no cause for concern.|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overexcited Pikachu uses its Thunderbolt attack on the television and destroys it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Pikachu used Thunderbolt!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfazed, Oak has the Magnemite deliver a "retro" television while the player and Pikachu wait for a replacement of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' Hmm... For the time being, we'll send you a replacement TV.|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Obtained the Retro TV!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the replacement arrives the next morning, the Professor remarks that the player's viewership has brought life to the network and helped spawn new shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' Now, several new programs have finally gone on the air. It's all thanks to your reports, [player's name].|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player then finds a bus stop and visits Viridian Forest, a location that first appeared in [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Take the bus to Viridian Forest?|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third day opens with Pikachu asleep in the cupboard and Oak expressing pleasure at the Pokémon's growing attachment to the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Pikachu isn't here?|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Oak:''' That Pikachu has obviously taken a big liking to you, too.

Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Take the bus to Mt.

Thanks to your reports, [player's name], the Smeargle Paint System has been upgraded!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of the fifth day, the ''Pokémon News Flash'' reports on a breaking news story:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Subtitles:''' Program Disc Goes Missing!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of ''Pichu Bros.'' was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite on their way to the show's broadcasting studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Blaziken:''' Deliver this to the broadcast center.|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Magnemite:''' I'll deliver it with care!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Magnemite:''' The Program Disc fell...|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining a lamp from a friendly [[Duskull]] in the front lawn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Channel|developer=Ambrella|quote='''Alert:''' Received the Duskull Lamp as thanks!|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; the player takes a bus back to Mt.

==Development and release==
[[File:Nintendo E-Reader.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Pokémon Channel'' was created in part to promote the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] (pictured) and included three cards for it.]]
''Pokémon Channel'' was developed by [[Nintendo]] subsidiary [[Ambrella]] and published by Nintendo and [[The Pokémon Company]]. It was created both to serve as a [[spiritual successor]] to ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]''—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the [[Nintendo e-Reader]] peripheral device.

The game uses the visual effect of applying pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded shows on the television. [[IGN]] writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Channel Playtest|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/18/pokemon-channel-playtest|publisher=IGN|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|date=July 18, 2003|accessdate=January 25, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223063827/http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/18/pokemon-channel-playtest|deadurl = no|archivedate = February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also unusual for the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video game series]], the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] and sound like their names.&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt;

''Pokémon Channel'' has scores of 51% and 55% on the review aggregators [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]], respectively, both indicating a mixed or average reception.&lt;ref name="gr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metacritic"/&gt; Reviewers felt that the game would only suit existing ''Pokémon'' fans and young children: staff at [[1UP.com]] summarized that "the various diversions here are cute, slickly produced, and entertaining, assuming you really, really dig Pokémon", and that even fans would be bored if over the age of five.&lt;ref name="1up"/&gt; Justin Leeper of ''[[Game Informer]]'' claimed that fans would enjoy it but "everyone else will be turned off, pun intended".&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; Author Tokyo Drifter of ''[[GamePro]]'' guessed that the game had been "tailored for die-hard fans" and would please no one else.&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; IGN's Mary Jane Irwin stated that its intuitive interface, copious instructions, and "mindless entertainment" would keep young players entertained.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''Nintendo Power''{{'}}s review called the game "hours of fun for ''Pokémon'' fans."&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;

Reviewers complained about the game's low level of interactivity due to most of the gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu. Summarizing the gameplay in general as "weak", [[GameSpot]]'s Ricardo Torres argued that the game's promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by "the gimmick of having to 'virtually' watch television programs" and the long stretches of time this entails.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Leeper claimed that Pikachu "will be content much longer than you will" and decried the channels' non-interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few.&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; Darryl Vassar of [[GameSpy]] went even further and claimed that there was "no gameplay". He gave the game only one star out of five as a result, despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices "decent".&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for ''Pokémon'' fan enjoyment, and gave the game a 3.0 on a five-point scale.&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall, with the exception of ''Pichu Bros'', which she called "the only worthwhile programming".&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

The game's 3D graphics received lukewarm opinions. Torres called them "decent but unspectacular" and "bland". His praise focused on the animations of the Pokémon with "distinct animations that suit their personalities", especially that of Pikachu.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Irwin echoed these opinions.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Vassar stated that the Pokémon animations were better than those in the then-upcoming GameCube title ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and found the environments passable, if boring and overly limited.&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; Tokyo Drifter found the environments "bright and colorful" while wholeheartedly praising the smooth and "adorable" Pokémon animations.&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt;

The sound and music were negatively received. Torres focused on their repetitiveness, stating that some of the music within the programs was catchy but "it starts to grate after some of the mandatory repeated viewings you'll have to endure", and that the paucity of sound effects "puts the weight of the audio burden on the Pokémon voices, which, while accurate, are naturally repetitive".&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Irwin and Vassar gave special focus to the repetitiveness of the voices.&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; Tokyo Drifter gave little opinion on the voices but found the lack of voice acting for Oak to be disappointing.&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt;

Critics praised the large number of collectible items and Pokémon in the game. Torres noted the game's many items to collect and Pokémon for Pikachu to meet, and praised the game's increased [[replay value]] as a result.&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; Tokyo Drifter thought similarly, calling the collecting aspects "a prominent part of the gaming experience".&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; Irwin found the collecting aspects a nice way to pass time and called the incorporation of the virtual Pokémon Mini "a nice diversion".&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

Taking clues from spongy toddler toys that can absorb water and inflate to bigger sizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=American Chemical Society|title=Spongy Material Helps Repair the Spine|date=2016-03-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOF73Z7qe4E|accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists at [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Clinical Research Centre, Rochester, Minnesota, United States]] have developed biodegradable polymer grafts that, when surgically placed in damaged vertebrae, intended to grow such that it is just the right size and shape to fix the spinal column.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/15/researchers-develop-a-polymer-sponge-to-repair-broken-backs/|title=Researchers develop a polymer sponge to repair broken backs|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For obvious reasons, any problem with the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of a [[vertebrate]] is often considered a potential disability which can limit a person's ability to manoeuvre their way around their surroundings, cause a lot of [[pain]] and be responsible for [[mental distress]]. This has been researched upon by Lichun Lu and Xifeng Liu, scientists from Mayo Clinic’s college of medicine, who have developed a novel spinal graft that, once [[Surgery|surgically]] placed in the body, will grow to be just the right size and shape to fix the spinal column. They presented their work at the 251st National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the non-profit organization American Chemical Society (ACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetechnews.com/2016/03/16/scientists-developed-a-polymer-sponge-to-repair-the-spine/|title=Scientists Developed a Polymer Sponge to Repair the Spine|website=TheTechNews|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problem ==
Current treatments for spinal tumours have been considered way too expensive and invasive. When cancer [[Metastasis|metastasizes]] it predominantly tends to settle in the spinal column. A different approach to replacing harmed vertebrae has been investigated. Polymer sponge researchers were reported to being about to present their work in March 2016 to a meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2016/march/bone.html|title=Spongy material helps repair the spine (video)|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution ==
Doctors can cut out the infected bone tissue (or flat-out replace it as they did in the Sydney case) but that leaves large gaps in the spine. Normally, doctors would either have to open the chest cavity and access the spine from far side (which entails a lengthy recovery and high probability of complications) or they'd make a small incision in the neck/back and inject expandable titanium rods into the bone gap (which is super expensive because titanium). This new technique combines the easy access and short recovery of the titanium rod method with the low cost of the open chest operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/15/researchers-develop-a-polymer-sponge-to-repair-broken-backs/|title=Researchers develop a polymer sponge to repair broken backs|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Sponge (material)|sponges]] for the treatment of such problems has long been suggested for obvious reasons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Procedure ==
Doctors simply cut a small hole in the patient's neck/back and inject a [[Polymer|hydrogel polymer]] into the bone gap much the same way they would a titanium rod. This polymer absorbs fluids from within the wound and grows to fill the gap. Doctors control how far the polymer expands in any specific direction by first inserting a "cage"—basically a pre-expanded shell that the polymer fills in as it spreads. Think of it as the wooden frame that keeps a freshly-poured concrete sidewalk in place until it hardens. Once the [[polymer]] fills in the cage, which takes 5 to 10 minutes on average, it will set and harden into a viable prosthetic. From there, surrounding bone tissue grows into and through the polymer, reinforcing and cementing it in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/15/researchers-develop-a-polymer-sponge-to-repair-broken-backs/|title=Researchers develop a polymer sponge to repair broken backs|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The sponge-like polymer, [[Polycaprolactone|polycaprolactone (PCL)]] shows promise as a medical material that can be used to fill gaps in human bones and serve as a scaffold to promote new bone growth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Injuries, birth defects (such as [[cleft lip and palate]]s), or the removal of tumors in the case of [[Bone Cancer|bone cancer]] can create gaps in bone that are too large to heal naturally. The gaps may dramatically alter a person's phenotypic appearance when they occur in the head, face, or jaw.

== Transplant rejection ==
While there might be a strong possibility that a transplant is [[Transplant rejection|rejected]], various complications may be averted by the use of techniques like [[bone marrow transplantation]], [[blood transfusion]], [[T cell|T lymphocyte]] modification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Peter|last2=Afzali|first2=Behdad|last3=Lombardi|first3=Giovanna|last4=Lechler|first4=Robert I.|date=2009-08-01|title=The T helper 17-regulatory T cell axis in transplant rejection and tolerance|journal=Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume=14|issue=4|pages=326–331|doi=10.1097/MOT.0b013e32832ce88e|issn=1531-7013|pmid=19448538}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the similar techniques.

The scope of polymer sponge in this field is still in its infancy and researchers in the field of biotechnological applications for making the concept available to humans and animals may require more attentive financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2125910|title=IOVS {{!}} Efficacy and Safety of Biodegradable Collagen-Glycosaminoglycan Polymer as a Material for Scleral Buckling|website=iovs.arvojournals.org|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giuseppe Bazzani - The Ecstasy of St Therese - WGA01527.jpg|thumb|275px|The Ecstasy of [[Saint Teresa of Avila|Saint Teresa]] by [[Giuseppe Bazzani]]]]

'''Religious ecstasy''' is a type of [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by greatly reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, frequently accompanied by visions and emotional (and sometimes physical) [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]].

Although the experience is usually brief in time,&lt;ref&gt;Marghanita Laski, ''Ecstasy. A Study of Some Secular and Religious Experiences''. The Cresset Press, London, 1961. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime.

In [[Sufism]], the term is referred to as ''[[wajad]]'' and the experience is referred to as either ''[[jazbah]] (jadbah o jedbah for Maghreb)'' or ''majzoobiyat''.

==Context==

[[File:Baeza - Convento de la Encarnacion 08.jpg|thumb|The religious ecstasy of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]] of the [[Carmelite Order]]]]
The adjective "religious" means that the experience occurs in connection with religious activities or is interpreted in context of a religion. Journalist [[Marghanita Laski]] writes in her study "Ecstasy in Religious and Secular Experiences", first published in 1961:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Epithets are very often applied to mystical experiences including ecstasies without, apparently, any clear idea about the distinctions that are being made. Thus we find experiences given such names as nature, religious, aesthetic, neo-platonic, ecc. experiences, where in some cases the name seems to derive from trigger, sometimes from the overbelief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Ancient===

[[Yoga]] provides techniques to attain an ecstasy state called [[samādhi]]. According to practitioners, there are various stages of ecstasy, the highest being [[Nirvikalpa]] Samadhi. [[Bhakti Yoga]] especially, places emphasis on ecstasy as being one of the fruits of its practice.

In [[Buddhism]], especially in the [[Pali Canon]], there are eight states of [[Jhana in Theravada|trance]] also called absorption. The first four states are Rupa or, materially-oriented. The next four are Arupa or non-material. These eight states are preliminary trances which lead up to final saturation. In [[Visuddhimagga]], great effort and years of sustained [[meditation]] are practiced to reach the first absorption, and that not all individuals are able to accomplish it at all.

In the [[Dionysian Mysteries]] of [[ancient Greece]], initiates used intoxicants, [[ecstatic dance]] and music to remove inhibitions and social constraints.

===Modern===

Modern meditator experiences in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], as well as other Theravadan traditions, demonstrates that this effort and rarity is necessary only to become completely immersed in the absorptions and experience no other sensations. It is possible to experience the absorptions in a less intense state with much less practice.

In the [[monotheism|monotheistic tradition]], ecstasy is usually associated with [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] and [[Henosis|oneness]] with [[God]]. However, such experiences can also be personal mystical experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them. Some [[Charismatic movement|charismatic Christians]] practice ecstatic states (such as "being [[slain in the Spirit]]") and interpret these as given by the [[Holy Spirit]]. The firewalkers of [[Greece]] dance themselves into a state of ecstasy at the annual [[Anastenaria]], when they believe themselves under the influence of [[Constantine the Great|Saint Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;Xygalatas, Dimitris, "Firewalking and the Brain: The Physiology of High-Arousal Rituals", in: Joseph Bulbulia, Richard Sosis, Erica Harris, Russell Genet, Cheryl Genet, and Karen Wyman (eds.)

Historically, large groups of individuals have experienced religious ecstasies during periods of [[Great Awakening|Christian revivals]], to the point of causing controversy as to the origin and nature of these experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Chauncy, Charles. ''Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New England''. 1743&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Jonathan |title=Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival in New England and the Way it Ought to be Acknowledged and Promoted |url=https://archive.org/details/somethought00edwa |location= |publisher= |year=1742 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to claims that all emotional expressions of religious ecstasy were attacks on order and theological soundness from the Devil, Jonathan Edwards published his influential ''Treatise on Religious Affections''.  Here, he argues, religious ecstasy could come from oneself, the Devil, or God, and it was only by observing the fruit, or changes in inner thought and behaviour, that one could determine if the religious ecstasy had come from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Treatise on Religious Affections |id=WPs8AAAAcAAJ |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Pentecostal]], [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] and [[Baptism of the Holy Spirit|spirit-filled]] Christianity, numerous examples of religious ecstasy have transpired, similar to historic revivals.  These occurrences however, have changed significantly since the time of the [[Toronto Blessing]] phenomena and several other North American so-called revivals and outpourings from the mid 1990s.  From that time, religious ecstasy in these movements has been characterized by increasingly unusual behaviors that are understood by adherents to be the anointing of the holy spirit and evidence of God 'doing a new work'.  One of the most controversial and strange examples is that of spiritual birthing &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm&lt;/ref&gt; - a practice during which women, and at times even men, claim to be having actual contractions of the womb while they moan and retch as though experiencing childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionintlm.com/articles_view.asp?columnid=5958&amp;articleid=66581&lt;/ref&gt;  It is said to be a prophetic action bringing spiritual blessings from God into the world.  Many believe spiritual birthing to be highly demonic in nature and more occult-like than Christian.  Religious ecstasy in these Christian movements has also been witnessed in the form of squealing, shrieking, an inability to stand or sit, uttering apocalyptic prophecies, holy laughter, crying and barking.  Some people have made dramatic claims of sighting 'gold dust', 'angel feathers', 'holy clouds', or the spontaneous appearance of precious gem stones during ecstatic worship events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/demoniac-false-preacher-todd-bentley-says-angel-feathers-manifesting-at-revival-meetings/&lt;/ref&gt; Others have claimed to have received spontaneous gold tooth fillings.  The Range Christian Fellowship in the conservative Australian city of Toowoomba demonstrates such displays of religious ecstasy on an almost weekly basis.&lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;{{cite web |date=28 November 2010|publisher=Range Christian Fellowship |title=Messy Church|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYz4paPQJmg|via=Youtube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to all of the above, worshippers there also use textile banners and during moments of religious ecstasy believe these banners carry special powers of 'anointing' as a result of divinely inspired artwork.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worshipbanners.com.au/docs/an-introduction-to-banners-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Pompeo Batoni - The Ecstasy of St Catherine of Siena - WGA01501.jpg|thumb|250px|The Ecstasy of St. [[Catherine of Siena]] by [[Pompeo Batoni]]]]

In [[hagiography]] (writings about Christian [[saint]]s) many instances are recorded in which saints are granted ecstasies. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05277a.htm Ecstasy]&lt;/ref&gt; religious ecstasy (called "supernatural ecstasy") includes two elements: one, interior and invisible, in which the mind rivets its attention on a religious subject, and another, corporeal and visible, in which the activity of the senses is suspended, reducing the effect of external sensations upon the subject and rendering him or her resistant to awakening. The witnesses of a [[Marian apparition]] often describe experiencing these elements of ecstasy.

Modern [[Witchcraft]] traditions may define themselves as "ecstatic traditions", and focus on reaching ecstatic states in their rituals. The [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Tradition]] and the [[Feri Tradition]] are two modern ecstatic Witchcraft examples.&lt;ref&gt;M. Macha Nightmare, [http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usca&amp;c=trads&amp;id=3212 "Reclaiming Tradition Witchcraft"], Witchvox, 2001.

Retrieved on 2008-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As described by the Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]], God-intoxicated souls known in Sufism as [[Mast (Sufism)|mast]]s experience a unique type of spiritual ecstasy: "[M]asts are desperately in love with God – or consumed by their love for God. Masts do not suffer from what may be called a disease. They are in a state of mental disorder because their minds are overcome by such intense spiritual energies that are far too much for them, forcing them to lose contact with the world, shed normal human habits and customs, and civilized society and live in a state of spiritual splendor but physical squalor. They are overcome by an agonizing love for God and are drowned in their ecstasy. Only the divine love embodied in a Perfect Master can reach them."&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, the Biography of the Avatar of the Age, [[Meher Baba]]'', Volume Six, Manifestation, Inc., 1986, p. 2035&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riverworld''' is a [[fictional planet]] and the setting for a series of [[science fiction]] [[book]]s written by [[Philip José Farmer]]. Riverworld is an artificial "[[Super-Earth]]" environment where all humans (and pre-humans) are reconstructed. The books explore  interactions of individuals from many different cultures and time periods. Its underlying theme is quasi-religious. The motivations of alien intelligences operating under ultra-ethical motives are explored.

==Works==
The five novels in the series are as follows:

* ''[[Gods of Riverworld]]'' (1983; later published as ''The Gods of Riverworld'')
* ''[[River of Eternity]]'' (1983) - an earlier version of Riverworld

There are also several Riverworld short stories.  The first of these appeared in Farmer's anthology:
* ''Riverworld and Other Stories'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?30345|title=Bibliography: Riverworld and Other Stories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a Farmer anthology with one Riverworld story titled "Riverworld")
* A Riverworld short story not involving the series' main characters but depicting the unhappy afterlife of a completely human [[Jesus Christ]] was included  in "Down in the Black Gang" (1971)

In the early 1990s, it was decided to turn Riverworld into a [[shared universe]] anthology series, with numerous authors being invited to participate. Only two volumes were released:
* ''Tales of Riverworld'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?33941|title=Bibliography: Tales of Riverworld|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (includes one story written by Farmer: "Crossing the Dark River". A second story, "A Hole In Hell", was written by Farmer under the [http://www.xs4all.nl/~rnuninga/PJFp.htm pseudonym Dane Helstrom])
* ''Quest to Riverworld'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?30217|title=Bibliography: Quest to Riverworld|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (includes two stories written by Farmer: "Up the Bright River" and "Coda".)

==Story==

===Overview===
Set millennia in the future, the Riverworld is an [[Super-Earth]]-like [[planet]], [[terraformed]] to consist solely of a single long [[river|river-valley]] that snakes across its entire surface. The river's source is a small North Polar sea, from which it follows a course tightly zig-zagging across one hemisphere before flowing into another, along an equally labyrinthine path, to the same sea. The river has an average depth of 1.5 miles, and its width ranges from 6.8 miles (11 kilometers) to 24.8 miles (40 kilometers). It is shallow near the shore but plunges to enormous depths towards the channel. The banks are generally smooth and gentle, expanding into wide plains on either side, then assuming jagged hills before an impenetrable [[mountain range]]. The valley averages 9 miles in width, but includes narrows and occasional widenings into lakes with islands. From source to mouth, the river is 20 million miles long (Books I, II, &amp; III state the river is 10 million miles long). There are no seasons, and daily variations are metronomic. The only animal life consists of fish and soil worms. The vegetation is lush and of great variety, including trees, flowering vines, several kinds of fast-growing bamboo, and a resilient mat of grass which covers the plains. The Riverworld has no visible moon, but a great number of stellar objects in the sky, including gas sheets and stars close enough to show a visible disk.

The story of Riverworld begins when 36,006,009,637 humans, varying from the first ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' until the early 21st century, are simultaneously [[resurrection|resurrected]] along the river.  Of these, 20% are from the 20th century, due to the high population thereof. Originally the cut-off year was given as 1983 (still a speculative date when the novels were first published); but this later was [[retcon|modified]] to 2008. Purportedly, the cut-off indicated the point at which most of the human race had been purposefully annihilated by [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with aliens visiting Earth. The protagonists later find this a creative fiction, produced by the masterminds of the resurrection.

In each area are initially three groups of people: a large group from one time period and place, a smaller group from another time and place, and a very small group of people from random times and places (most of the 20th- and 21st-century humans are part of this last group).

===Resurrectees===
Most of the resurrected awaken in a body equivalent to that of their 25-year-old selves, in perfect health and free of any previous genetic or acquired defects. All heart disease, tooth decay, and blindness are gone, and all amputated limbs are restored; whereas certain neurological impulses (for instance, curiosity or chemical addiction) remain intact. These bodies do not age, after a physical 25 years, and can regenerate nearly any non-fatal injury, including dismemberments and blindings. The new bodies are completely free of infection and seem resistant to it (albeit in the absence of hostile bacteria or viruses on the Riverworld). Initially hairless, the bodies grow cephalic hair and pubic hair at a normal rate. Men do not have [[foreskins]] or grow [[facial hair]]; whereas women have intact [[hymen]]s. It is impossible to conceive children on Riverworld.

Anyone who died at an age younger than 25 assumes a body equivalent to that lesser age, which then ages at a normal rate before stopping at 25. No one who was less than five years old at death is resurrected on the Riverworld (it is eventually revealed that children under the age of five were resurrected on another planet, Gardenworld). Should an individual die, they are resurrected elsewhere along the banks of the river. Some people even use this process to travel, though there is a limit to the number of resurrections available to each person.

Because all the languages of mankind are represented in Riverworld, [[Esperanto]] spreads as a common tongue.

One of the themes of the series is the way historical characters change as a result of this cosmopolitan setting.  The first book of the Riverworld series, ''[[To Your Scattered Bodies Go]]'', portrays a tormented, drug-addicted [[Hermann Göring]] who ends up as a missionary of the Church of the Second Chance, a peaceful religion. Apparently left to their own devices, the people recreate their Earthly societies.

====Grails====
The resurrected awaken with nearly-indestructible containers tied to their wrists, commonly called "grails", which produce food, drink, pieces of cloth, and luxury items, such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana (and lighters for same), hair care utensils, makeup, and a hallucinogenic chewing gum, known as "dreamgum". To operate, grails must be placed onto large, mushroom-shaped "grailstones", found at intervals along the riverbanks, which produce an electrical discharge three times per day (corresponding to the times of breakfast, lunch and dinner). As agriculture is absent and impossible on the Riverworld, the grails are vital to an individual's survival, and cannot be opened except by its owner. Nevertheless, "grail slavery" is not uncommon, in which a person is held captive and the contents of his or her grail, retrieved by the owner, are taken by force by the captor. The slaver will usually provide the slave with enough food to keep him alive, as once a person dies their grail becomes useless.

Of special value are "free grails", originally found atop each of the grailstones as a demonstration of their relationship. Free grails can be opened by any individual, and as such, are valued for an extra ration of goods at each interval. Throughout the series, several main characters lose their original grails and must seek free grails to survive.

====Natural resources and travel====
Though the grails provide for all needs and the climate is hospitable, further attempts to affect the environment are frustrated by the near-complete lack of metals and ores on the planet. The only building materials available are bamboo, wood, and human or fish bones and hides. Pockets of flint (eventually depleted) provide material for tools. With technology limited to the [[paleolithic]] level, the surrounding mountains are impassable.

Travel along the river is hindered by division of the Riverworld into thousands of empires, monarchies, republics, and other social systems, each only a few kilometers long and housing 90 people per square kilometer. Because the distribution of populations along the river seems random, the character of these nations can vary wildly within a very short span; whereby one can enter dangerously unknown and potentially hostile territory in less than a day's journey.

===Purpose===
The reason of the existence of Riverworld is initially a complete mystery. In Farmer's books a number of historical figures - including [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]], [[Alice Liddell|Alice Hargreaves]], [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]], [[King John of England]], [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Jack London]], [[Lothar von Richthofen]], and [[Hermann Göring]] - interact with fictional characters to discover the Riverworld's purpose. Another character, [[Peter Jairus Frigate]], bears a striking resemblance to Farmer himself, and shares his initials.  There are two versions of the character: one who appears early in the sequence, the third overall character to be introduced, and another, the "real" version, who concludes that the first was his brother who died as a baby, resurrected and used as a spy by the creators of the Riverworld.

The story gradually reveals that the Riverworld was created as a moral test for humanity. In the Riverworld universe [[sapience]] is the result of an artificially created soul, known as a ''wathan'', created by a generator developed and distributed among various worlds by an unknown ancient alien race. Wathan generators create wathans which attach themselves to sufficiently advanced [[chordates]]. Wathans are indestructible but become detached from the body upon physical death and wander the universe without purpose.

The first race to create wathans were [[Cultural behavior|adept tool users]], but lacked individual sapience. [[Self-aware]]ness increased their capabilities by an order of magnitude, and as the creators of wathan technology, they were able to "catch" wathans released by their own deaths, resurrecting themselves until individual resurrections became impossible. As this happened only to the wisest and most ethically advanced wathans, the people supposed a process of "passing on", comparable to the Indian religious concept of [[Moksha]]. With this in mind, they traveled the universe, placing wathan generators on worlds that could host wathans, thereby creating other sentient species. Once they created a species they determined they could trust, they tasked them with creating more sapient species after the whole of their own species had "passed on". This cycle occurred several times until the creation of humanity.

Humanity's creators are a race of aliens known, among their human allies, as "the Ethicals", who brought Wathan technology to Earth, installing both a generator to produce Wathans and a collector to catch and store Wathans—and the human personas and memories accumulated by them—for later retrieval. The only Ethical seen in the stories is Monat Graatut, who poses as an ally and friend of Richard Francis Burton. The reason given for the collector was that humans were both extraordinarily civilized (capable of "passing on" within a single lifetime, as did [[Gautama Buddha]]), and extraordinarily barbaric (capable of [[genocide]], [[slavery]] etc.), and therefore might or might not be trusted with Wathan technology; an ambiguity meant for resolution by the Riverworld. Children who died before age five are resurrected on a "Gardenworld": a physical paradise where the children were raised as Ethicals, who later created the Riverworld in hope of stimulating moral contemplation. The repetitive physical environment was to encourage a concern with inward rather than outward circumstances, while the poverty of natural resources was to prevent the development of a higher technology, and the food provided by the grails, the presence of abundant water and potential shelter, and the resurrections were to obviate economy. Alcohol, marijuana, and the LSD-like dreamgum were provided for recreational purposes and to assist contemplation.

====Peter Jairus Frigate====
Peter Jairus Frigate is a fictionalized version of the science fiction author [[Philip José Farmer]], which appeared in his Riverworld series of novels. Confusingly, it is only starting in the third volume ''[[The Dark Design]]'' that the true Peter Jairus Frigate appears – the one in the earlier volumes was in fact an [[impostor]]. Note that in Farmer's other major series of books, ''[[World of Tiers]]'', a major character also has the same initials as the author: [[World_of_Tiers#Paul_Janus_Finnegan.2FKickaha|Paul Janus Finnegan]] who usually goes by the nickname ''Kickaha''. This character is also a fictionalized (or one imagines an idealized) version of the author.

==In popular culture==
Since the publication of the original books, several authors have been licensed to use the ''Riverworld'' setting for their own stories - see "Works" towards the top of this page.

A licensed guidebook outlining the setting for use in the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game]], ''[[GURPS Riverworld]]'' was released by [[Steve Jackson Games]]. Copies of this guidebook were provided to the authors of the stories published in ''Tales of Riverworld'' and ''Quest To Riverworld'', as this book summarizes the chronology, characters, geography and technical details of the Riverworld universe.

A television series loosely based on the ''Riverworld'' saga went into production for the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi channel]] in 2001 but only the feature-length pilot episode [[Riverworld (2003 film)|''Riverworld'']] was completed. It was first aired in 2003. It used elements from ''To Your Scattered Bodies Go'' and ''The Fabulous Riverboat'', though it replaced the books' hero, Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]], with an American astronaut and [[King John of England]] with [[Nero]] as the villain. At one point, the pilot was available online through the [[Joost]] software worldwide except in the United States and Canada. It can be found on the [[Alliance Atlantis]] Sci-Fi channel and is available on Amazon Prime.

In 2010, a 4-hour TV movie, [[Riverworld (2010 Film)|''Riverworld'']] was produced and released by [[Syfy]] (formerly The Sci-fi Channel)&lt;ref&gt;[http://scifiwire.com/2009/06/how-the-riverworld-movie.php Sci-Fi Wire: How the Riverworld movie event will meander from the books]&lt;/ref&gt; in the US and by Studio Universal elsewhere, written by [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]]. The protagonist is Matt Ellman, an American war reporter, played by [[Tahmoh Penikett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1419950/|title=Riverworld (TV Movie 2010)|author=OldSamVimes|date=18 April 2010|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main villain is Richard Francis Burton, who ironically was one of the prime heroes in the novels.

A PC computer game version of ''[[Riverworld (video game)|Riverworld]]'' was released in October 1998 by Cryo Interactive. The soundtrack was by Stéphane Picq and published as a CD by [http://www.shooting-star.com Shooting Star Music].

==Fan fiction==
Some stories written by fans and taking place in the ''Riverworld'' universe have been published through the official Philip José Farmer Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjfarmer.com/CONTRIBUTIONS-fiction.html Fan Fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly studies==
Antoine Ruiz, from Université d'Avignon (France) wrote a master's degree memoir entitled ''Redemption in Philip José Farmer's Riverworld'' in 1995. This work is available online on the [http://www.pjfarmer.com/fan/ruiz.htm Official PJ Farmer Home Page].

[[Image:Robostrider faceoff2.jpg|195px|thumb|right|Robostrider faces its biological counterpart]]

'''Robostrider''' is a self-propelled robot which uses similar mechanisms to real [[water strider]]s in order to glide along the surface of the water.  It was developed at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="hu2003"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature01793|author=David L. Hu and John W. M, Bush |  title=The hydrodynamics of water strider locomotion| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| year=2003| volume=424| pages=663&amp;ndash;666| postscript=.| pmid=12904790| issue=6949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant '''Stubby''' (1916 – March 16, 1926) was a [[dog]] who is the official mascot of the [[102nd Infantry Regiment (United States)]] and was assigned to the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th (Yankee) Division]] in [[World War I]]. He served for 18 months and participated in seventeen battles on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He saved his regiment from surprise [[mustard gas]] attacks, found and comforted the wounded, and once caught a German soldier by the seat of his pants, holding him there until American soldiers found him.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His actions were well-documented in contemporary American newspapers.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=519 |work=History wired |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |title=Stubby, World War I Canine Hero 1921 |accessdate=July 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117131914/http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=519 |archivedate=November 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/05/dogs_of_war_sergeant_stubby_the_u_s_army_s_original_and_still_most_highly.html |title=Sergeant Stubby: America’s original dog of war fought bravely on the Western Front—then helped the nation forget the Great War’s terrible human toll |first1=Gillian |last1=Kane |first2=Lisa, Illustrator |last2=Larson-Walker |date=May 7, 2014 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] |accessdate=July 13, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713085216/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/05/dogs_of_war_sergeant_stubby_the_u_s_army_s_original_and_still_most_highly.html |archivedate=July 13, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} Reprinted in {{cite news |title=The story of Sergeant Stubby, WWI's most decorated dog |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us/the-story-of-sergeant-stubby-wwi-s-most-decorated-dog-1.285051 |first1=Gillian |last1=Kane |newspaper=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars &amp; Stripes]] |date=May 24, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701113942/http://www.stripes.com/news/us/the-story-of-sergeant-stubby-wwi-s-most-decorated-dog-1.285051 |archivedate=July 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1351&amp;q=257958 |publisher=Connecticut Military History |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 1926 – July 16, 2003 |title=Stubby's Obituary: Stubby of A.E.F.

Stubby is the subject of a [[Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero|2018 animated film]].

==Early life==
Stubby was described in contemporaneous news items as a [[Bull Terrier]] or [[Boston Terrier]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1921-07-09/ed-1/seq-18/#date1=1836&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Boston+STUBBY&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=stubby+boston&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1ID=15%201 |title=Evening Public Ledger.

The dog hung around as the men drilled and one soldier, Corporal Robert Conroy, developed a fondness for him.&lt;ref name="Kane"/&gt; When it came time for the outfit to ship out, Conroy hid Stubby on board the troop ship. As they were getting off the ship in France, he hid Stubby under his overcoat without detection.&lt;ref name=Bausum /&gt; Upon discovery by Conroy's commanding officer, Stubby saluted him as he had been trained to in camp, and the commanding officer allowed the dog to stay on board.&lt;ref name="smithson1"/&gt;

==Military service==
[[File:Sergeant Stubby 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sergeant Stubby wearing his coat and medals]]

Stubby served with the 102nd Infantry Regiment in the [[trenches]] in [[France]] for 8 months and participated in four offensives and 17 battles. He entered combat on February 5, 1918, at [[Chemin des Dames]], north of [[Soissons]], and was under constant fire, day and night for over a month. In April 1918, during a raid to take Seicheprey, Stubby was wounded in the foreleg by the retreating Germans throwing [[hand grenades]]. He was sent to the rear for convalescence, and as he had done on the front was able to improve morale. When he recovered from his wounds, Stubby returned to the trenches. He ultimately had two wound stripes.&lt;ref name="Kane"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humane&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1019&amp;dat=19211028&amp;id=4PEyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eQ4GAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1227,553446 |title=Dog Hero Again Honored |newspaper=Roundup Record-Tribune &amp; Winnett Times |date=October 28, 1921 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first year of battle Stubby was injured by mustard gas. After he recovered, he returned with a specially designed gas mask to protect him.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lux, Anna. "Janesville author breathes new life into Stubby the war dog". ''The Janesville Gazette'' (WI). 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he learned to warn his unit of [[poison gas]] attacks, located wounded soldiers in [[no man's land]], and—since he could hear the whine of incoming artillery shells before humans—became very adept at letting his unit know when to duck for cover. He was solely responsible for capturing a German spy in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Argonne]], leading to the commander of the 102 Infantry to nominate Stubby for the rank of sergeant.&lt;ref name="smithson1"/&gt; However, whether Stubby was actually promoted or even an official member of the Army has been disputed.&lt;ref name=Bausum&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bausum |first1=Ann |first2=David E., Foreword |last2=Sharpe |title=Sergeant Stubby: How a Stray Dog and His Best Friend Helped Win World War I and Stole the Heart of a Nation|date=2014|location=Washington, D.C |type=Print |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1426213106|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the retaking of [[Château-Thierry]] by the US, the women of the town made Stubby a chamois coat on which were pinned his many medals. He also helped free a French town from the Germans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} He was later injured in the chest and leg by a grenade. At the end of the war, Robert Conroy smuggled Stubby home.&lt;ref name="smithson1"/&gt;

==After the war==

After returning home, Stubby became a celebrity and marched in, and normally led, many parades across the country. He met Presidents [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], and [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref name="smithson1"/&gt; In 1921 General [[John J. Pershing]] presented a gold medal from the [[The Humane Society of the United States|Humane Education Society]] to Stubby, which was the subject of a famous photograph.&lt;ref name="Kane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humane/&gt;&lt;ref name=MilitaryDog /&gt; Starting in 1921, he attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]] with Conroy, and became the [[Georgetown Hoyas]]' [[Jack the Bulldog|team mascot]].&lt;ref name=MilitaryDog&gt;{{cite web |first1=Major General Thaddeus |last1=Martin |url=http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1351&amp;q=257892 |title=Stubby the Military Dog |date=April 12, 2011 |publisher=Connecticut Military department |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181830/http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1351&amp;q=257892 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would be given the [[American football|football]] at [[halftime]] and would nudge the ball around the field to the amusement of the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.governorsfootguard.com/stubby/ |title=A Connecticut Hero: Sgt.

Stubby died in his sleep in 1926.&lt;ref name="Kane"/&gt; After his death, he was preserved with his skin mounted on a plaster cast. Conroy presented Stubby to the Smithsonian in 1956.

==Legacy==

Stubby received an [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' following his death in 1926. The obituary was half a page, which was much longer than the obituaries of many notable people of the time.&lt;ref name=MilitaryDog/&gt;

Stubby was the subject of a portrait by "Capitol artist" Charles Ayer Whipple.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He was featured in the ''Brave Beasts'' exhibit at the [[Legermuseum]] in [[Delft]], [[The Netherlands]] July 18, 2008 – April 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.armymuseum.nl/legermuseum.en/legermuseum.en/i000466.html |title= Brave Beasts |work= Legermuseum |date= July 18, 2008 |accessdate= December 21, 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091209223652/http://www.armymuseum.nl/legermuseum.en/legermuseum.en/i000466.html |archivedate= December 9, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a ceremony held on [[Armistice Day]] in 2006, a brick was placed in the Walk of Honor at the [[Liberty Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to commemorate Sergeant Stubby.&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=83485 |title=Stubby |date=November 11, 2006 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stubby was the subject of at least four books.&lt;ref name=Bausum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stubby the War Dog: The True Story of World War I's Bravest Dog |type=Hardcover/audio |date=May 13, 2014 |first1=Ann |last1=Bausum |pages=80 |publisher=National Geographic Children's Books |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=1426314868 &lt;!--|ISBN=978-1426314865 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stubby, Brave Soldier Dog |work=Famous Animal Stories |type=Hardcover |first1=Richard |last1=Glendinning |first2=Sally |last2=Glendinning |first3=Richard |last3=Amundsen |page=48 |location=Champaign, Illinois |publisher=Garrard Pub.

The descendants of Robert Conroy (Stubby's inseparable companion) dedicated a life-size bronze statue of Stubby named "Stubby Salutes", by Susan Bahary, in the Connecticut Trees of Honor Memorial at Veteran's Memorial Park in Middletown, Connecticut in May 2018.  The statue pays tribute to fallen Connecticut veterans. Both Stubby and Robert Conroy were from Connecticut.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Shock''' is the state of not enough [[blood flow]] to the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s of the body as a result of problems with the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Initial symptoms may include weakness, [[fast heart rate]], [[fast breathing]], sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst.&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt; This may be followed by confusion, [[unconsciousness]], or [[cardiac arrest]] as complications worsen.&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172&gt;{{cite book |title=International Trauma Life Support for Emergency Care Providers |date=2018 |publisher=Pearson Education Limited |isbn=978-1292-17084-8 |pages=172–173 |edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: [[Hypovolemia#Stages of hypovolemic shock|low volume]], [[Cardiogenic shock|cardiogenic]], [[Obstructive shock|obstructive]], and [[distributive shock]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Low volume shock may be from bleeding, vomiting, or [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt; Cardiogenic shock may be due to a [[heart attack]] or [[cardiac contusion]].&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt; Obstructive shock may be due to [[cardiac tamponade]] or a [[tension pneumothorax]].&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt; Distributed shock may be due to [[sepsis]], [[spinal cord injury]], or certain [[overdose]]s.&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt;

&lt;!-- Diagnosis --&gt;
The diagnosis is generally based on a combination of symptoms, [[physical examination]], and laboratory tests.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; A decreased [[pulse pressure]] ([[systolic blood pressure]] minus [[diastolic blood pressure]]) or a fast heart rate raises concerns.&lt;ref name=ITLSPg172/&gt; The heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure, known as the shock index (SI), of greater than 0.8 supports the diagnosis more than [[low blood pressure]] or a [[fast heart rate]] in isolation.&lt;ref name=Olaussen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olaussen A, Blackburn T, Mitra B, Fitzgerald M | title=Review article: shock index for prediction of critical bleeding post-trauma: a systematic review | journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia | year=2014 | volume=26 | issue=3| pages=223–8 | pmid=24712642 | doi=10.1111/1742-6723.12232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-0-7216-0240-0 |pages=278–288  |chapter=Chapter 24: Circulatory Shock and Physiology of Its Treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology--&gt;
Treatment of shock is based on the likely underlying cause.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; An open [[airway]] and sufficient [[breathing]] should be established.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Any ongoing bleeding should be stopped, which may require surgery or [[embolization]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; [[Intravenous fluid]], such as [[Ringer's lactate]] or [[packed red blood cells]], is often given.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Efforts to maintain a normal [[body temperature]] are also important.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; [[Vasopressors]] may be useful in certain cases.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Shock is both common and has a high risk of death.&lt;ref name=Tab2010/&gt; In the United States about 1.2 million people present to the emergency room each year with shock and their risk of death is between 20 and 50%.&lt;ref name=Tab2010&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tabas |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Reynolds |first2=Teri |title=High Risk Emergencies, An Issue of Emergency Medicine Clinics - E-Book |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-1455700257 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ac_XI7P3CKwC&amp;pg=PA58 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The presentation of shock is variable with some people having only minimal symptoms such as confusion and weakness.&lt;ref name=Tint10&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=165–172|isbn=978-0-07-148480-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the general signs for all types of shock are [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], decreased urine output, and confusion, these may not always be present.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; While a fast heart rate is common, those on [[Beta blocker|β-blockers]], those who are athletic and in 30% of cases of those with shock due to intra abdominal bleeding may have a normal or slow heart rate.&lt;ref name=Tint10,2&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=174–175 |isbn=978-0-07-148480-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific subtypes of shock may have additional symptoms.

===Low volume===
{{main|Hypovolemia}}
{{Class of Hemorrhage}}
[[Hypovolemia]] is a direct loss of effective circulating blood volume leading to:
*A rapid, weak, thready pulse due to decreased blood flow combined with tachycardia
*Cool, clammy skin due to [[vasoconstriction]] and stimulation of vasoconstriction
*Rapid and shallow breathing due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and acidosis
*[[Hypothermia]] due to decreased perfusion and evaporation of sweat
*Thirst and dry mouth, due to fluid depletion
*Cold and mottled skin ([[Livedo reticularis]]), especially extremities, due to insufficient perfusion of the skin

The severity of hemorrhagic shock can be graded on a 1–4 scale on the physical signs. This approximates to the effective loss of blood volume.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The ''shock index'' (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) is a stronger predictor of the impact of blood loss than heart rate and blood pressure alone.&lt;ref name=Olaussen/&gt; This relationship has not been well established in pregnancy-related bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacagnella RC, Souza JP, Durocher J, Perel P, Blum J, Winikoff B, Gülmezoglu AM | title=A systematic review of the relationship between blood loss and clinical signs | journal=PLoS ONE | year=2013 | volume=8 | issue=3| pages=e57594 | pmid=23483915 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057594 | pmc=3590203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiogenic===
Symptoms of [[cardiogenic shock]] include:
*Distended [[jugular vein]]s due to increased [[jugular venous pressure]]
*Weak or absent pulse
*[[Heart arrhythmia|Abnormal heart rhythms]], often a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]]
*[[Pulsus paradoxus]] in case of [[Cardiac tamponade|tamponade]]
*Reduced blood pressure

===Obstructive===
[[Obstructive shock]] includes [[cardiac tamponade]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and [[tension pneumothorax]].

===Distributive===
{{SIRS}}
[[Distributive shock]] includes [[Sepsis|infectious]], [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic]], [[endocrine]] (e.g., [[adrenal insufficiency]]), [[salicylate toxicity]], and [[Neurogenic shock|neurogenic]] causes. The [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|SIRS]] features typically occur in early septic shock.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;

====Septic shock====
*Systemic [[leukocyte]] adhesion to endothelial cells&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
*Reduced contractility of the heart&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
*Activation of the coagulation pathways, resulting in [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
*Increased levels of [[neutrophils]]&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
Main manifestations are produced due to massive release of [[histamine]] which causes intense dilation of the blood vessels. People with septic shock will also likely be positive for the SIRS criteria. The most generally accepted treatment for these patients is early recognition of symptoms, and early administration of broad spectrum and organism specific antibiotics.&lt;ref name=survsep&gt;{{cite web|title=Surviving Sepsis Campaign Responds to ProCESS Trial|url=http://www.survivingsepsis.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/SSC-Responds-Process-Trial.pdf|website=Surviving Sepsis Campaign|publisher=Survivingsepsis.org|accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Shock is a common end point of many medical conditions.&lt;ref name=EMB05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Adam|title=Shock: A Common Pathway For Life-Threatening Pediatric Illnesses And Injuries|journal=Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice|date=Oct 2005|volume=2|issue=10|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&amp;topic_id=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=168 |isbn=978-0-07-148480-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few additional classifications are occasionally used including: endocrinologic shock.&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt;

===Low volume===
[[Hypovolemic shock]] is the most common type of shock and is caused by insufficient circulating [[blood volume|volume]].&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;  Its primary cause is [[haemorrhage]] (internal or external), or loss of fluid from the [[Circulatory system|circulation]]. [[Vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] are the most common cause in children.&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt; Other causes include burns, environmental exposure, and excess urine loss due to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] and [[diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt;

===Cardiogenic===
[[Cardiogenic shock]] is caused by the failure of the heart to pump effectively.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; This can be due to damage to the heart muscle, most often from a large [[myocardial infarction]]. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include [[cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s, [[cardiomyopathy]]/[[myocarditis]], [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF), [[Myocardial contusion|contusio cordis]], or [[valvular heart disease]] problems.&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt;

===Obstructive===
[[Obstructive shock]] is due to obstruction of blood flow outside of the heart.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Several conditions can result in this form of shock.
*[[Cardiac tamponade]]&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt; in which fluid in the pericardium prevents inflow of blood into the heart (venous return). [[Constrictive pericarditis]], in which the [[pericardium]] shrinks and hardens, is similar in presentation.
*[[Tension pneumothorax]]&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt; Through increased intrathoracic pressure, bloodflow to the heart is prevented (venous return).
*[[Pulmonary embolism]] is the result of a thromboembolic incident in the blood vessels of the [[lung]]s and hinders the return of blood to the heart.
*[[Aortic stenosis]] hinders circulation by obstructing the [[ventricular outflow tract]]
*[[Hypertrophic sub-aortic stenosis]] is overly thick ventricular muscle dynamically occludes the [[ventricular outflow tract]].

===Distributive===
[[Distributive shock]] is due to impaired utilization of oxygen and thus production of energy by the cell.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Examples of this form of shock are:
*[[Septic shock]] is the most common cause of distributive shock.&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt; Caused by an overwhelming systemic infection resulting in [[vasodilation]] leading to hypotension. Septic shock can be caused by [[Gram negative]] bacteria such as (among others) ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', Proteus species, ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' which have an [[endotoxin]] on their surface which produces adverse biochemical, immunological and occasionally neurological effects which are harmful to the body, and other [[Gram-positive]] cocci, such as [[pneumococci]] and [[streptococci]], and certain fungi as well as Gram-positive bacterial toxins. Septic shock also includes some elements of cardiogenic shock. In 1992, the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference Committee defined septic shock: ". . .sepsis-induced hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;&amp;nbsp;90&amp;nbsp;mmHg or a reduction of 40&amp;nbsp;mmHg from baseline) despite adequate fluid resuscitation along with the presence of perfusion abnormalities that may include, but are not limited to, lactic acidosis, oliguria, or an acute alteration in mental status. Patients who are receiving inotropic or vasopressor agents may have a normalized blood pressure at the time that perfusion abnormalities are identified."
*[[Anaphylactic shock]] is caused by a severe [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]] to an [[allergen]], [[antigen]], [[drug]] or foreign protein causing the release of [[histamine]] which causes widespread vasodilation, leading to hypotension and increased capillary permeability.
*High spinal injuries may cause [[neurogenic shock]].&lt;ref name=Trauma07/&gt; The classic symptoms include [[bradycardia|a slow heartrate]] due to loss of cardiac [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic tone]] and warm skin due to dilation of the peripheral blood vessels.&lt;ref name=Trauma07/&gt; (This term can be confused with [[spinal shock]] which is a recoverable loss of function of the [[spinal cord]] after injury and does not refer to the haemodynamic instability per se.)

===Endocrine===
Based on [[endocrine]] disturbances such as:
*[[Hypothyroidism]] (can be considered a form of [[cardiogenic shock]]) in people who are critically ill patients, reduces [[cardiac output]] and can lead to [[hypotension]] and respiratory insufficiency.
*[[Hyperthyroidism|Thyrotoxicosis]] ([[cardiogenic shock]]) may induce a reversible cardiomyopathy.
*Acute [[adrenal insufficiency]] ([[distributive shock]]) is frequently the result of discontinuing [[corticosteroid]] treatment without tapering the dosage. However, surgery and intercurrent disease in patients on corticosteroid therapy without adjusting the dosage to accommodate for increased requirements may also result in this condition.
*Relative adrenal insufficiency ([[distributive shock]]) in critically ill patients where present [[cortisol|hormone levels]] are insufficient to meet the higher demands

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Shock-cell2.svg|500px|thumb|Effects of inadequate perfusion on cell function.]]

There are four stages of shock. As it is a complex and continuous condition there is no sudden transition from one stage to the next.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D.J.|year=2004|title=Shock|location=In: Alexander, M.F., Fawcett, J.N., Runciman, P.J. ''Nursing Practice. Hospital and Home. The Adult.''(2nd edition)|publisher=Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a cellular level, shock is the process of oxygen demand becoming greater than oxygen supply.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;

One of the key dangers of shock is that it progresses by a [[positive feedback]] mechanism. Poor blood supply leads to cellular damage, which results in an inflammatory response to increase blood flow to the affected area. This is normally very useful to match up blood supply level with tissue demand for nutrients. However, if enough tissue causes this, it will deprive vital nutrients from other parts of the body. Additionally, the ability of the circulatory system to meet this increase in demand causes saturation, and this is a major result, of which other parts of the body begin to respond in a similar way; thus, exacerbating the problem. Due to this chain of events, immediate treatment of shock is critical for survival.&lt;ref name=Guyton/&gt;

===Initial===
During this stage, the state of hypoperfusion causes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Due to the lack of oxygen, the cells perform [[lactic acid fermentation]]. Since oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, is not abundant, this slows down entry of [[pyruvate]] into the [[Citric acid cycle|Krebs cycle]], resulting in its accumulation. Accumulating pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase and hence lactate accumulates (causing [[lactic acidosis]]).

===Compensatory===
This stage is characterised by the body employing physiological mechanisms, including neural, hormonal and bio-chemical mechanisms in an attempt to reverse the condition.  As a result of the [[acidosis]], the person will begin to [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] in order to rid the body of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indirectly acts to acidify the blood and by removing it the body is attempting to raise the pH of the blood.  The [[baroreceptors]] in the [[artery|arteries]] detect the resulting [[hypotension]], and cause the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Norepinephrine causes predominately [[vasoconstriction]] with a mild increase in [[heart rate]], whereas [[epinephrine]] predominately causes an increase in [[heart rate]] with a small effect on the [[Blood vessel|vascular]] tone; the combined effect results in an increase in [[blood pressure]]. The [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin–angiotensin axis]] is activated, and [[arginine vasopressin]] ([[Anti-diuretic hormone]]; ADH) is released to conserve fluid via the kidneys.  These hormones cause the vasoconstriction of the [[kidneys]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and other organs to divert blood to the heart, [[lungs]] and [[brain]].  The lack of blood to the [[renal]] system causes the characteristic low [[urine]] production. However the effects of the renin–angiotensin axis take time and are of little importance to the immediate [[homeostatic]] mediation of shock.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Progressive===
Should the cause of the crisis not be successfully treated, the shock will proceed to the progressive stage and the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail.  Due to the decreased perfusion of the cells, [[sodium]] ions build up within while [[potassium]] ions leak out. As anaerobic metabolism continues, increasing the body's metabolic acidosis, the arteriolar smooth muscle and precapillary [[sphincters]] relax such that blood remains in the [[capillaries]].&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 102–103 {{ISBN|978-1-4160-2973-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this, the hydrostatic pressure will increase and, combined with [[histamine]] release, this will lead to leakage of fluid and [[protein]] into the surrounding tissues.  As this fluid is lost, the blood concentration and [[viscosity]] increase, causing sludging of the micro-circulation. The prolonged vasoconstriction will also cause the vital organs to be compromised due to reduced perfusion.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  If the bowel becomes sufficiently [[ischemic]], bacteria may enter the blood stream, resulting in the increased complication of [[septic shock|endotoxic shock]].&lt;ref name=Guyton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

===Refractory===
At this stage, the vital organs have failed and the shock can no longer be reversed. [[Brain damage]] and cell death are occurring, and death will occur imminently.  One of the primary reasons that shock is irreversible at this point is that much cellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] has been degraded into [[adenosine]] in the absence of oxygen as an electron receptor in the mitochondrial matrix.  Adenosine easily perfuses out of cellular membranes into extracellular fluid, furthering capillary [[vasodilation]], and then is transformed into [[uric acid]].  Because cells can only produce adenosine at a rate of about 2% of the cell's total need per hour, even restoring oxygen is futile at this point because there is no adenosine to [[phosphorylate]] into ATP.&lt;ref name=Guyton/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The first change seen in shock is an increased [[cardiac output]] followed by a decrease in [[mixed venous oxygen saturation]] (SmvO2) as measured in the [[pulmonary artery]] via a [[pulmonary artery catheter]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; --&gt; [[Central venous oxygen saturation]] (ScvO2) as measured via a central line correlates well with SmvO2 and are easier to acquire.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; --&gt; If shock progresses [[anaerobic metabolism]] will begin to occur with an increased blood [[lactic acid]] as the result.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; --&gt; While many laboratory tests are typically performed there is no test that either makes or excludes the diagnosis.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; --&gt; A [[chest X-ray]] or emergency department ultrasound may be useful to determine volume state.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tint10,2/&gt;

==Management==
The best evidence exists for the treatment of [[septic shock]] in adults and as the pathophysiology appears similar in children and other types of shock treatment this has been extrapolated to these areas.&lt;ref name=EMB05/&gt; Management may include securing the airway via [[intubation]] if necessary to decrease the work of breathing and for guarding against respiratory arrest.  Oxygen supplementation, intravenous fluids, [[Passive leg raising test|passive leg raising]] (not [[Trendelenburg position]]) should be started and blood transfusions added if blood loss is severe.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; It is important to keep the person warm as well as adequately manage pain and anxiety as these can increase oxygen consumption.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;

===Fluids===
Aggressive intravenous fluids are recommended in most types of shock (e.g. 1–2 liter [[normal saline]] bolus over 10 minutes or 20&amp;nbsp;ml/kg in a child) which is usually instituted as the person is being further evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |location= |year=2008 |pages=58 |isbn=978-1-880696-31-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which intravenous fluid is superior, [[colloids]] or [[Crystalloid fluid|crystalloids]], remains undetermined.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Thus as crystalloids are less expensive they are recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perel|first=Pablo|last2=Roberts|first2=Ian|last3=Ker|first3=Katharine|date=2013-02-28|title=Colloids versus crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=2|pages=CD000567|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000567.pub6|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23450531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073665|date = November 2018}} If the person remains in shock after initial resuscitation [[packed red blood cells]] should be administered to keep the [[hemoglobin]] greater than 100&amp;nbsp;g/l.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;

For those with haemorrhagic shock the current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries allowing mild [[hypotension]] to persist (known as [[permissive hypotension]]).&lt;ref name=Rosen2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition|last=Marx|first=J|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-323-05472-0|page=2467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets include a [[mean arterial pressure]] of 60&amp;nbsp;mmHg, a [[systolic blood pressure]] of 70–90&amp;nbsp;mmHg,&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;&lt;ref name=EMB11/&gt; or until their adequate mentation and peripheral pulses.&lt;ref name=EMB11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherkas|first=David|title=Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock: Advances In Fluid Management|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|date=Nov 2011|volume=13|issue=11|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/store.php?paction=showProduct&amp;catid=8&amp;pid=244|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118152838/http://www.ebmedicine.net/store.php?paction=showProduct&amp;catid=8&amp;pid=244|archivedate=2012-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypertonic fluid]] may also be an option in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=MC|last2=Liao|first2=TY|last3=Lee|first3=EM|last4=Chen|first4=YS|last5=Hsu|first5=WT|last6=Lee|first6=MG|last7=Tsou|first7=PY|last8=Chen|first8=SC|last9=Lee|first9=CC|title=Administration of Hypertonic Solutions for Hemorrhagic Shock: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Clinical Trials.|journal=Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia|date=November 2017|volume=125|issue=5|pages=1549–1557|doi=10.1213/ANE.0000000000002451|pmid=28930937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
[[Vasopressors]] may be used if blood pressure does not improve with fluids.

===Treatment goals===
The goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of greater than 0.5&amp;nbsp;ml/kg/h, a [[central venous pressure]] of 8–12&amp;nbsp;mmHg and a [[mean arterial pressure]] of 65–95&amp;nbsp;mmHg. In trauma the goal is to stop the bleeding which in many cases requires surgical interventions.

Haemorrhagic shock occurs in about 1–2% of trauma cases.&lt;ref name=EMB11/&gt; Up to one-third of people admitted to the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) are in circulatory shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finfer|first1=Simon R.|last2=Vincent|first2=Jean-Louis|last3=Vincent|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=De Backer|first4=Daniel|title=Circulatory Shock|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=31 October 2013|volume=369|issue=18|pages=1726–1734|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1208943|pmid=24171518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, cardiogenic shock accounts for approximately 20%, hypovolemic about 20%, and septic shock about 60% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cecconi|first=Maurizio|last2=Backer|first2=Daniel De|last3=Antonelli|first3=Massimo|last4=Beale|first4=Richard|last5=Bakker|first5=Jan|last6=Hofer|first6=Christoph|last7=Jaeschke|first7=Roman|last8=Mebazaa|first8=Alexandre|last9=Pinsky|first9=Michael R.|date=2014-12-01|title=Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of shock depends on the underlying cause and the nature and extent of concurrent problems. Hypovolemic, anaphylactic and neurogenic shock are readily treatable and respond well to medical therapy. [[Septic shock]] however, is a grave condition with a mortality rate between 30% and 50%. The prognosis of [[cardiogenic shock]] is even worse with a mortality rate between 70% and 90%.&lt;ref name="IrwinRippe"&gt;{{cite book |last= Irwin |first= Richard S. |author2= Rippe, James M. |title= Intensive Care Medicine |url= http://www.lww.com/product/?0-7817-3548-3 |publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia &amp; London |date= January 2003 |isbn= 978-0-7817-3548-3 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051107202505/http://www.lww.com/product/?0-7817-3548-3 |archivedate= 2005-11-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1972 Hinshaw and Cox suggested the classification system for shock which is still used today.&lt;ref name="IrwinRippe"/&gt;

A '''spirit guide''', in western [[spiritualism]], is an entity that remains as a disincarnate [[spirit]] to act as a guide or protector to a living [[incarnation|incarnated]] human being.

== Description ==

According to  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] doctrine, spirit guides are not always of human descent. Some spirit guides live as energy, in the cosmic realm, or as light beings, which are very high level spirit guides. Some spirit guides are persons who have lived many former lifetimes, paid their [[karma|karmic]] debts, and advanced beyond a need to reincarnate. Many devotees believe that spirit guides are chosen on "the other side" by human beings who are about to incarnate and wish assistance.

Some early modern Spiritualists did not favor the idea of spirit guides. Spiritualist author and medium E.W. Wallis, writing in ''A Guide to Mediumship and Psychic Unfoldment'', expressed an opinion that the notion of spirit guides is disempowering and disrespectful to both spirits and living people. He does not deny that seeking people may be helped by spirits here and there, but decries the idea that said spirits are appointed or assigned to do nothing but help the living. He advises would-be mediums to steer clear of the notion that they are being "guided" unless they have demonstrable proof that such is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, E.W. and M.H., ''A Guide to Mediumship and Psychic Unfoldment.'' Originally published 1901. Reprint edition by Health Research 1996, p. 162-3, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Firsthand accounts ==
[[Theresa Caputo]], The Long Island Medium, simply calls her guide "Spirit", describing it as an entity that she has been able to sense since she was four years old.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Ryan (June 26, 2012). [http://articles.courant.com/2012-06-26/entertainment/hc-theresa-caputo-0627-20120626_1_spiritual-medium-cameras-gift "Theresa Caputo Says Life As 'Long Island Medium' Is 'Bananas'"]. ''[[Hartford Courant]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spiritualism (religious movement)|American Spiritualists]] of the 19th and 20th centuries often described their guides as resembling [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. One popular spirit guide of this type, encountered by many Anglo-American Spiritualists, was named White Hawk. Among African-American Spiritualists, especially those in churches that were founded by or influenced by Mother [[Leafy Anderson]], the Native American guide was named [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], and was presumed to be the spirit of the [[Sauk people|Sac]] tribe warrior of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Jason (November 1, 1995). ''The Spirit of Blackhawk: A Mystery of Africans and Indians''. [[University Press of Mississippi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SuccessTech Academy shooting''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on October 10, 2007, at the [[SuccessTech Academy|SuccessTech]] alternative high school in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. Fourteen-year-old freshman Asa H. Coon shot two students and two teachers before committing [[suicide]] on the fourth floor of the building.

On Wednesday, October 10, 2007, Asa H. Coon entered the five-story school building shortly before 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST, armed with two handguns (a [[.22 long rifle|.22-caliber]] [[revolver]] and a [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] [[revolver]]),&lt;ref name="clevelandfourshot" /&gt;&lt;ref name='NYTimes 2007-10-11'&gt;{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Maag |author2=[[Ian Urbina]]  |authorlink= | title=Student, 14, Shoots 4 and Kills Himself in Cleveland School | date=2007-10-10 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/us/11cleveland.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-25 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Some sources may state that both the guns were only .22-calibers although more recent sources state that they are both .22 and .38-calibers --&gt; and a box of additional rounds of ammunition for each pistol; three [[Knife#Folding blade features|folding knive]]s were also in Coon's possession, which were all stocked together in a [[duffel bag]].&lt;ref name='MSNBC 2007-10-10'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Police: Suspended boy shoots 4 at Ohio school | date=2007-10-10 | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21224357/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-25 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing a [[Marilyn Manson]] concert shirt, black jeans, and black-painted fingernails,&lt;ref name="5 Hospitalized After 14-Year-Old Goes on Shooting Rampage at Cleveland High School"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/10/11/5-hospitalized-after-14-year-old-goes-on-shooting-rampage-at-cleveland-high/ "5 Hospitalized After 14-Year-Old Goes on Shooting Rampage at Cleveland High School"]&lt;/ref&gt; Coon walked to the fourth floor of the building and entered the men's washroom where he loaded two revolvers.&lt;ref name="plaindealershothimself" /&gt;

'''Swine influenza''' is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine [[influenza]] [[virus]]es. '''Swine influenza virus''' ('''SIV''') or '''swine-origin influenza virus''' ('''S-OIV''') is any strain of the [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza family of viruses]] that is [[endemism|endemic]] in [[pig]]s.&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121407.htm|title=Swine influenza|journal=The Merck Veterinary Manual|year=2008|accessdate=April 30, 2009|isbn=1-4421-6742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the known SIV strains include [[Influenzavirus C|influenza C]] and the subtypes of  [[Influenza A Virus|influenza A]] known as [[H1N1]], [[H1N2]], H2N1, [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]], and [[H2N3]].

The Swine flu was initially seen in humans in Mexico in 2009, where the strain of the particular virus was a mixture from 3 types of strains.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=Adrian J.|last2=Armstrong|first2=John S.|last3=Downie|first3=Jean C.|date=2009-01-01|title=From where did the 2009 'swine-origin' influenza A virus (H1N1) emerge?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207|journal=Virology Journal|volume=6|pages=207|doi=10.1186/1743-422X-6-207|issn=1743-422X|pmc=2787513|pmid=19930669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the genes are very similar to the H1N2 influenza virus that was found in pigs around 2000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to [[human flu]], often resulting only in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.

Around the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general, namely [[chills]], [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, [[fatigue (medical)|weakness]], shortness of breath, and [[malaise|general discomfort]].

In August 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] declared the swine flu [[pandemic]] officially over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swine Flu - National Health Portal of India|url=https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/swine-flu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases of swine flu have been reported in [[India]], with over [[2015 Indian swine flu outbreak|31,156 positive test cases and 1,841 deaths]] up to March 2015.&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/swine-flu-toll-inches-towards-1900-no-of-cases-crosses-31000/article7011912.ece/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150320080119/http://m.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/swine-flu-toll-inches-towards-1900-no-of-cases-crosses-31000/article7011912.ece/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 20, 2015|title=Swine flu toll inches towards 1,900|author=PTI|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

In swine, an influenza infection produces [[fever]], [[lethargy]], [[sneezing]], [[coughing]], [[Dyspnea|difficulty breathing]] and decreased appetite.&lt;ref name="Kothalawala"/&gt; In some cases the infection can cause [[miscarriage]]. Although mortality is usually low (around 1–4%),&lt;ref name="Merck" /&gt; the virus can produce [[weight loss]] and [[Growth failure|poor growth]], causing economic loss to farmers.&lt;ref name="Kothalawala" /&gt; Infected pigs can lose up to 12&amp;nbsp;pounds of body weight over a three- to four-week period.&lt;ref name="Kothalawala" /&gt; Swine have receptors to which both avian and mammalian influenza viruses are able to bind to, which leads to the virus being able to evolve and mutate into different forms.&lt;ref name="Thacker S19–S24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thacker|first=Eileen|last2=Janke|first2=Bruce|date=2008-02-15|title=Swine Influenza Virus: Zoonotic Potential and Vaccination Strategies for the Control of Avian and Swine Influenzas|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/197/Supplement_1/S19|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=197|issue=Supplement 1|pages=S19–S24|doi=10.1086/524988|issn=0022-1899|pmid=18269323}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenza A is responsible for infecting swine, and was first identified in the summer of 1918.&lt;ref name="Thacker S19–S24"/&gt; Pigs have often been seen as "mixing vessels", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans.&lt;ref name="Thacker S19–S24"/&gt;

===Humans===

Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible ([[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In all, 50 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths.&lt;ref name="pmid17366454"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Myers KP, Olsen CW, Gray GC |title=Cases of Swine Influenza in Humans: A Review of the Literature|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=44|issue=8|pages=1084–8|date=April 2007|pmid=17366454|pmc=1973337|doi=10.1086/512813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had [[leukemia]], one had [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and two were known to be previously healthy. One of these had unknown whereabouts. &lt;ref name="pmid17366454"/&gt; Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, and will probably never be reported or diagnosed.&lt;ref name="pmid17366454"/&gt;
[[File:Video xo.ogv|thumb|In this video, Dr. Joe Bresee, with CDC's Influenza Division, describes the symptoms of swine flu and warning signs to look for that indicate the need for urgent medical attention. &lt;br /&gt; See also: See this video with subtitles on YouTube &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wK1127fHQ4|title=Symptoms of H1N1 (Swine Flu)|publisher=YouTube|date=2009-04-28|accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), in humans the symptoms of the 2009 "swine flu" H1N1 virus are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general. Symptoms include [[fever]]; [[cough]], [[sore throat]], watery eyes, body aches, shortness of breath, [[headache]], weight loss, [[chills]], sneezing, runny nose, coughing, dizziness, abdominal pain, lack of appetite and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. The 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] as well. The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but from person to person through airborne droplets.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, a [[differential diagnosis]] of ''probable'' swine flu requires not only symptoms, but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person's recent and past medical history. For example, during the [[2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States]], the CDC advised physicians to "consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with [[acute febrile respiratory illness]] who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu, or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset."&lt;ref name=CDCguideHD&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC Health Update: Swine Influenza A (H1N1) Update: New Interim Recommendations and Guidance for Health Directors about Strategic National Stockpile Materiel|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Health Alert Network|date=April 27, 2009|url=https://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/HAN/042609.htm|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis of ''confirmed'' swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample (a simple nose and throat swab).&lt;ref name=CDCguideHD/&gt;

The most common cause of death is [[respiratory failure]]. Other causes of death are [[pneumonia]] (leading to [[sepsis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31889365/ns/health-swine_flu/|title=Study: Swine flu resembles feared 1918 flu|publisher=MSNBC|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; high fever (leading to neurological problems), [[dehydration]] (from excessive vomiting and [[diarrhea]]), [[electrolyte imbalance]] and [[Renal failure|kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=kidney&gt;{{cite news|title=Swine flu can damage kidneys, doctors find|publisher=Reuters|date=April 14, 2010|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN14118931|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalities are more likely in young children and the elderly.

==Virology==

===Transmission===

====Between pigs====

The influenza [[virion]] is 
roughly spherical. It is an enveloped virus; the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Inserted into the lipid membrane are "spikes", which are proteins—actually glycoproteins, because they consist of protein linked to sugars—known as HA ([[hemagglutinin]]) and NA ([[neuraminidase]]). These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus (A/H1N1, for example).  The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus; antibodies (proteins made to combat infection) against these spikes may protect against infection. The NA protein is the target of the antiviral drugs [[Relenza]] and [[Tamiflu]]. Also embedded in the lipid membrane is the [[M2 proton channel|M2 protein]], which is the target of the [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[adamantane]]s [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]].

==Prevention==
Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention in pigs, prevention of transmission to humans, and prevention of its spread among humans.

===Swine===
Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I09|AA03}}). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient.

Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the [[evolution]] of the [[virus]] has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/swine_flu_virus_endemic/|publisher=National Hog Farmer|title=Swine flu virus turns endemic|date=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |publisher=Novartis |work=Custom Vaccines |title=Swine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430094251/http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Present [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.&lt;ref name="pmid17366454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gramer MR, Lee JH, Choi YK, Goyal SM, Joo HS |title=Serologic and genetic characterization of North American H3N2 swine influenza A viruses|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=71|issue=3|pages=201–6|date=July 2007|pmid=17695595|pmc=1899866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be [[quarantine]]d.&lt;ref name=cfsph/&gt; After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

===Humans===
;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission
[[File:AntigenicShift HiRes vector.svg|thumb]] Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the [[antigenic shift]]s can occur that create new influenza strains.

The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face [[surgical mask|mask]]s when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC |title=Preventing Zoonotic Influenza Virus Infection|journal=Emerging Infect.

[[File:Airport Thermographic Camera.jpg|thumb|Thermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece – thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of the virus H1N1 (swine influenza).]]
Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard [[Influenza#Infection control|infection control]], which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol-based hand sanitizers]], especially after being out in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htm|title=CDC – Influenza (Flu) &amp;#124; Swine Influenza (Flu) Investigation|publisher=Cdc.gov|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterandhealth.org/newsletter/new/winter_2005/chlorine_bleach.html|title=Chlorine Bleach: Helping to Manage the Flu Risk|publisher=Water Quality &amp; Health Council|date=April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts agree hand-washing can help prevent viral infections, including ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu.&lt;ref name="2009 H1N1 Swine Flu and You" /&gt; Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth. [[Hand sanitizer|Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers]] work well to destroy viruses and bacteria.

[[Social distancing]], another tactic, is staying away from other people who might be infected, and can include avoiding large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community. [[Public health]] and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions, depending on the severity of the outbreak.

====Vaccination====
{{Main article|2009 flu pandemic vaccine}}
[[Vaccine]]s are available for different kinds of swine flu. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009.&lt;ref name="Vaccine approval news release"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm182399.htm|title=FDA Approves Vaccines for 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus|publisher=FDA|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by the [[National Institutes of Health]] show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_89221.html |title=NIH studies  on Swine flu vaccine |publisher=NIH |accessdate=2009-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013095327/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_89221.html |archivedate=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines.  These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans &lt;ref&gt;Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. "Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009-H1N1 And Seasonal Influenza." American Journal of Public Health 101.7 (2011)  1252–1255. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be due to several factors.  Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans.  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective.  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee study]].  Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor’s offices.  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.

===Surveillance===
Although there is no  formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs,&lt;ref name="MMWR5815a5"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm|title=Swine influenza A (H1N1) infection in two children --- Southern California, March—April 2009|date=22 April 2009|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]]|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=58 (Dispatch)|issue=1–3|author1= Ginsberg M, Hopkins J|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/animals-worlds-best-and-cheapest-biosensors|title=Animals: The world's best (and cheapest) biosensors|author=Laura H.

==Treatment==

===Swine===
As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required.&lt;ref name=cfsph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/influenza.pdf|title=Influenza Factsheet|publisher=Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm, or to other farms.&lt;ref name=Kothalawala/&gt; Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to treat this disease, which although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial [[pneumonia]] and other [[secondary infection]]s in influenza-weakened herds.&lt;ref name="cfsph"/&gt;

In Europe the avian-like H1N1 and the human-like H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine, of which avian-like H1N1 is the most frequent. Since 2009 another subtype, pdmH1N1(2009), emerged globally and also in European pig population. The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds. 
In the EU region whole-virus vaccines are available which are inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies. Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N1(2009). In vaccinated sows multiplication of viruses and virus shedding are significantly reduced. 

===Humans===
If a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends the use of [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) or [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/faq/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/antiviral_swine.htm|title=Antiviral Drugs and Swine Influenza|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s to make available [[Relenza]] and [[Tamiflu]] [[antiviral drug]]s to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they are currently unapproved. The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs, including by  volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm149571.htm|title=''FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of Influenza Medicines, Diagnostic Test in Response to Swine Flu Outbreak in Humans.''

==History==
Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], when pigs became ill at the same time as humans.&lt;ref name=Knobler&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Knobler S, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon S |title=The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005)|chapter=1: The Story of Influenza|page=75|chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309095042&amp;page=75|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930.&lt;ref name="pmid12034486" /&gt; For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, [[H3N2]] strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by [[reassortment]] from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and [[H3N2]] produced [[H1N2]]. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of [[H4N6]] crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm.&lt;ref name="pmid12034486"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olsen CW|title=The emergence of novel swine influenza viruses in North America|journal=Virus Research|volume=85|issue=2|pages=199–210|date=May 2002|pmid=12034486|doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(02)00027-8|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168170202000278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H1N1 form of swine flu is one of the descendants of the strain that caused the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref name=NYT76&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/05/archives/soft-evidence-and-hard-sell-in-the-next-few-months-the-government.html?sq=Swine+Flu+epidemic&amp;scp=9&amp;st=p|title=Soft evidence and hard sell|publisher=New York Times|date=5 September 1976|first=Philip M.|last=Boffey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pandemic/&gt; As well as persisting in pigs, the descendants of the 1918 virus have also circulated in humans through the 20th century, contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza.&lt;ref name=Pandemic/&gt; However, direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN26488473|title=U.S. pork groups urge hog farmers to reduce flu risk|agency=Reuters|date=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned.&lt;ref name=Heinen2003&gt;{{cite journal|title=Swine influenza: a zoonosis|url=http://www.vetscite.org/publish/articles/000041/print.html|year=2003|author=Heinen, P.|journal=Veterinary Sciences Tomorrow|pages=1–11|accessdate=2009-05-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506211413/http://www.vetscite.org/publish/articles/000041/print.html|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a [[zoonosis]] in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British [[meat industry]] about £65 million every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1136/vr.135.9.199|vauthors=Kay RM, Done SH, Paton DJ |title=Effect of sequential porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza on the growth and performance of finishing pigs|journal=Vet.

===1918 pandemic===
The [[1918 flu pandemic]] in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs;&lt;ref name=Pandemic&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Taubenberger JK, Morens DM  |journal=Emerg Infect Dis  |year=2006  |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no01/05-0979.htm  |pmid=16494711  |title=1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics  |volume=12  |issue=1  |pages=15–22  |doi=10.3201/eid1201.050979  |pmc=3291398  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kCUlGdKu?url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-0979.htm  |archivedate=2009-10-01  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; this may reflect a [[zoonosis]] either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans.&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt; For instance, swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people.&lt;ref name=Knobler/&gt; Although a recent [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal,&lt;ref name="pmid18353690"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vana G, Westover KM |title=Origin of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus: a comparative genomic analysis|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=47|issue=3|pages=1100–10|date=June 2008|pmid=18353690|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Antonovics J, Hood ME, Baker CH |title=Molecular virology: was the 1918 flu avian in origin?|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7088|pages=E9; discussion E9–10|date=April 2006|pmid=16641950|doi=10.1038/nature04824}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;million people were killed worldwide.&lt;ref name=Pandemic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Patterson KD, Pyle GF |title=The geography and mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=65|issue=1|pages=4–21|year=1991|pmid=2021692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976 U.S. outbreak===
{{Main article|1976 swine flu outbreak}}
On February 5, 1976, a United States army recruit at [[Fort Dix]] said he felt tired and weak. He died the next day, and four of his fellow soldiers were later hospitalized. Two weeks after his death, health officials announced the cause of death was a new strain of swine flu. The strain, a variant of H1N1, is known as &lt;!-- start --&gt;A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1)&lt;!-- end --&gt;. It was detected only from January 19 to February 9 and did not spread beyond Fort Dix.&lt;ref name="Gaydos+2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gaydos JC, Top FH, Hodder RA, Russell PK |title=Swine influenza a outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=12|issue=1|pages=23–8|date=January 2006|pmid=16494712|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-0965.htm|doi=10.3201/eid1201.050965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Ford receives a swine flu inoculation - NARA - 7064718.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President Ford receives a swine flu vaccination]]
This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: [[H3N2|A/Victoria/75 (H3N2)]], which spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March.&lt;ref name="Gaydos+2006"/&gt; Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic, and urged President [[Gerald Ford]] that every person in the U.S. be vaccinated for the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harold M.|last=Schmeck|title=Ford Urges Flu Campaign To Inoculate Entire U.S.|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A17FD3C5A167493C7AB1788D85F428785F9|work=The New York Times|publisher=|date=March 25, 1976|access-date=2017-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521094624/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A17FD3C5A167493C7AB1788D85F428785F9|archive-date=2013-05-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vaccination]] program was plagued by delays and public relations problems.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Neustadt and Harvey V. Fineberg. (1978). [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12660 The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease]. ''National Academies Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1976, immunizations began, and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections. This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations, despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause. According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, however, by the time the truth was known—that the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccine—it was too late. "The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu—now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations." This became a strong setback to the program.&lt;ref name=DiJusto&gt;[http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/ "The Last Great Swine Flu Epidemic"], ''Salon.com'', April 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS), a paralyzing [[neuromuscular]] disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. Although whether a link exists is still not clear, this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines. As a result, Di Justo writes, "the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people." In total, 48,161,019 Americans, or just over 22% of the population, had been immunized by the time the [[National Influenza Immunization Program]] was effectively halted on December 16, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Retailliau HF, Curtis AC, Storr G, Caesar G, Eddins DL, Hattwick MA |title=Illness after influenza vaccination reported through a nationwide surveillance system, 1976–1977|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=111|issue=3|pages=270–8|date=March 1980|pmid=7361749|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7361749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1988, a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others.

Her husband recovered from his symptoms.

[[Influenza-like illness]] (ILI) was reportedly widespread among the pigs exhibited at the fair. Of the 25 swine exhibitors aged 9 to 19 at the fair, 19 tested positive for antibodies to SIV, but no serious illnesses were seen. The virus was able to spread between people, since one to three health care personnel who had cared for the pregnant woman developed mild, influenza-like illnesses, and antibody tests suggested they had been infected with swine flu, but there was no community outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/key_facts.htm|title=Key Facts About Swine Flu (CDC)|publisher=Cdc.gov|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1845913"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wells DL|title=Swine influenza virus infections.

In 1998, swine flu was found in pigs in four U.S. states. Within a year, it had spread through pig populations across the United States. Scientists found this virus had originated in pigs as a recombinant form of flu strains from birds and humans. This outbreak confirmed that pigs can serve as a crucible where novel influenza viruses emerge as a result of the reassortment of genes from different strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stephanie Desmon |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/bal-swine-flu-strain0428,0,3165467.story |title=Expert: Swine flu virus more complex than typically seen |journal=Baltimore Sun |date=April 28, 2009 |format= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/answers/how-often-should-you-take-dayquil-is-it-every-4-162105.html|title=Dayquil is used to cure the Cold and flu|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.drugs.com|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merck" /&gt; Genetic components of these 1998 triple-hybrid stains would later form six out of the eight viral gene segments in the 2009 flu outbreak.&lt;ref name="hsus.org"&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/swine_flu_virus_origin_1998_042909.html CDC Confirms Ties to Virus First Discovered in U.S. Pig Factories] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823002635/http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/swine_flu_virus_origin_1998_042909.html |date=August 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsus.org2"&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/pubs/swine_flu.html Video Segments 3,4,5 in Flu Factories: Tracing the Origins of the Swine Flu Pandemic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013055312/http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/pubs/swine_flu.html |date=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="video.hsus.org3"&gt;[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6d7c34894aab86190765da51973379a3438f294b Swine Flu Kept Stable Humans Untouched For 80 Years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726160744/http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6d7c34894aab86190765da51973379a3438f294b |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="video.hsus.org"&gt;[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6f816594cf08612a30048e72b5058afe4aeed401 Triple Hybrid Mutant Pig-Bird-Human Crossbreed Virus ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016105151/http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=6f816594cf08612a30048e72b5058afe4aeed401 |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="North Carolina, 1998 Ground Zero"&gt;[http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=a89aa9c8dee6d32ec3dd828fe295222733cc1837 North Carolina, 1998 Ground Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016105215/http://video.hsus.org/index.jsp?fr_story=a89aa9c8dee6d32ec3dd828fe295222733cc1837 |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 Philippine outbreak===
On August 20, 2007, Department of Agriculture officers investigated the outbreak of swine flu in [[Nueva Ecija]] and central [[Luzon]], Philippines. The mortality rate is less than 10% for swine flu, unless there are complications like [[hog cholera]]. On July 27, 2007, the Philippine National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) raised a hog cholera "red alert" warning over [[Metro Manila]] and five regions of Luzon after the disease spread to backyard pig farms in [[Bulacan]] and [[Pampanga]], even if these tested negative for the swine flu virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/56805/DA-probes-reported-swine-flu-outbreak-in-N-Ecija|title=DA probes reported swine flu 'outbreak' in N.

===2009 Northern Ireland outbreak===
Since November 2009, 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The majority of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12149164|title=New mothers urged to get swine flu vaccine|publisher=BBC News|date=2011-01-10|accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 and 2017 India outbreaks===
Swine flu outbreaks were reported in India in late 2014 and early 2015. As of March 19, 2015 the disease has affected 31,151 people and claimed over 1,841 lives.&lt;ref name="THE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/swine-flu-claims-over-1-700-lives-746814|title=Swine Flu Claims Over 1,700 Lives|date=15 March 2015|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of reported cases and deaths due to the disease occurred in the western part of India including states like [[Delhi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Gujarat]].
Researchers of MIT have claimed that the swine flu has mutated in India to a more virulent version with changes in Hemagglutinin protein. This has however been disputed by Indian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluroko.com/2015/03/indian-swine-flu-mutated.html|title=Flu Roko: Has Indian swine flu changed to be more dangerous?|work=fluroko.com|accessdate=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110095447/http://www.fluroko.com/2015/03/indian-swine-flu-mutated.html|archive-date=10 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Nepal outbreak===
Swine flu outbreaks were reported in Nepal in the spring of 2015. As of April 21, 2015 the disease has claimed 26 lives in the most severely affected district, [[Jajarkot]] in Northwest Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepalaawaj.com/2015/04/37952.html|title=One more dies of swine flu in Jajarkot|date=21 April 2015|work=nepalaawaj.com|accessdate=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130234331/http://nepalaawaj.com/2015/04/37952.html|archive-date=2016-01-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases were also detected in the districts of [[Kathmandu]], [[Morang]], [[Kaski District|Kaski]], and [[Chitwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonepal.net/english/6516/|title=Lab Test on three samples from Jajarkot confirms swine flu|date=15 April 2015|work=infonepal.com|accessdate=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212204204/http://www.infonepal.net/english/6516/|archive-date=12 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 22 April 2015 the Nepal Ministry of Health reported that  2,498 people had been treated in Jajarkot, of whom 552 were believed to have swine flu, and acknowledged that the government's response had been inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/health/swine-flu-outbreak-kills-24-in-nepal/54927|title=Swine flu outbreak kills 24 in Nepal|date=22 April 2015|work=aa.com.tr|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jajarkot outbreak had just been declared an emergency when the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] struck on 25 April 2015, diverting all medical and emergency resources to quake-related rescue and recovery.

===2016 Pakistan outbreak===
Seven cases of swine flu were reported in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]], mainly in the city of [[Multan]], in January 2017. Cases of swine flu were also reported in Lahore and [[Faisalabad]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/316827-Swine-flu-spreads-across-Punjab-3-more-patients-i|title=Swine flu spreads across Punjab, 3 more patients identified in Multan - Pakistan - Dunya News|work=dunyanews.tv|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 Maldives outbreak===
As of 16 March 2017, over a hundred confirmed cases of swine flu and at least six deaths were reported in the Maldivian capital of [[Male']] and some other islands. Makeshift flu clinics were opened in Male'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maldivesindependent.com/society/makeshift-flu-clinics-swamped-as-h1n1-cases-rise-to-82-129541|title=Makeshift flu clinics swamped as H1N1 cases rise to 82 - Maldives - Maldives Independent|work=maldivesindependent.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools, universities and colleges in the capital were closed, prison visitations suspended, several events cancelled, and all non-essential travel to other islands outside the capital was advised against by the HPA. An influenza vaccination program focussed on pregnant women was initiated soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maldivesindependent.com/society/woman-dies-in-second-h1n1-fatality-as-cases-rise-above-100-129577|title=Woman dies in second H1N1 fatality as cases rise above 100 - Maldives - Maldives Independent|work=maldivesindependent.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official visit by the Saudi King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] to the Maldives during his Asian tour was also cancelled last minute amidst fears over the outbreak of swine flu.

===H1N1 virus pandemic history===
A study conducted in 2008, and published in the journal ''Nature'', has managed to establish the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin (S-OIV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/full/nature08182.html|title=Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic : Article|journal=Nature|accessdate=2011-08-17|volume=459|doi=10.1038/nature08182|pages=1122–1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} swine flu. However, genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of 4 influenza viruses forming a novel strain–
North American Swine (30.6%)- PIG ORIGIN FLU
North American Avian (34.4%)– BIRD ORIGIN FLU
Human influenza strain (17.5%)
Euroasian swine (17.5%)- PIG ORIGIN FLU.
QUADRUPLE GENETIC RE-ASSORTMENT  - coinfection with influenza viruses from diverse animal species.
Due to coinfection, the viruses are able to interact, mutate, and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity.

New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now.

The mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.

The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain.
Finally, the last step in S-OIV history was in 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain. This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain, which caused the 2009 pandemic.

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu, which is the highest alert level.&lt;ref name="Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010"&gt;Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A. Relman. The Domestic and International Impacts of the 2009-H1N1 Influenza a Pandemic: Global Challenges, Global Solutions : Workshop Summary. Washington, D.C.: National Academies, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This alert level means that the swine flu had spread worldwide and there were cases of people with the virus in most countries.  The pandemic level identifies the spread of the disease or virus and not necessarily the severity of the disease.

Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high human-to-human transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel.&lt;ref name="Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010"/&gt;

In 2015 the instances of swine flu substantially increased to five year highs with over 10,000 cases reported and 660 deaths in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/swine-flu-deaths-soar-past-660/article6909436.ece|title=Swine flu deaths soar past 660|publisher=the hindu|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The states reporting the highest number of cases and deaths are Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, and  Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Economic Times|location=New Delhi|date=2015-02-13 |title=2015 swine flu toll at 485, more than two-fold jump over 2014 |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/2015-swine-flu-toll-at-485-more-than-two-fold-jump-over-2014/articleshow/46235497.cms|accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The circulating strain of influenza being the same, unmutant strain that caused global pandemic in 2009 (A H1N1 pdm 09), the sudden spurt of the cases in the beginning of 2015 left the Indian government unexplained but concerned. Government instructed the affected states to investigate into the epidemiological reasons of such spurt in the states, and had detailed the advisory guidelines to all states. The guidelines are mainly for (a) description of A H1N1 for prompt identification, detection, and distinction from the symptoms of other similar infection such as common flu(cold) (b) categorization of screening of influenza A H1N1 cases, (c) clinical management protocol of Pandemic influenza A H1N1, (d) providing home care, (e) collection of human sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ministry Of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, through the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Government of India (GoI) had placed a tender to procure 8 kits of Assay sets, 37 kits of one step RT-PCR kit, and 36 kits of viral RNA extraction kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{ National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Government of India (GoI).

In 2010, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce named him Government Leader of the Year and, in 2011, [[Thomas B. Fordham Institute|The Fordham Institute]] named him Education Reform Idol.

==State superintendent==
Bennett was narrowly elected Indiana State Superintendent in 2008, succeeding retiring four-term incumbent Suellen Reed. He was defeated for re-election in an upset in his bid for a second term. He made education reform a key platform of his tenure.

During Bennett's term, student achievement improved on several key academic indicators. Scores on the state's [[Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress-Plus|ISTEP]]+ exam, Advanced Placement pass percentages and graduate rates reached new highs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/overview.aspx|title=IDOE: Compass|publisher=Compass.doe.in.gov|date=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticized Bennett and his wife in 2011 because of her involvement with a charter school oversight program at [[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian University]]. The state awarded a contract to Marian to establish a "Turnaround Leadership Academy" to train transformational school leaders. Officials noted the contract was awarded through a competitive request for proposals process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.icpe2011.com/uploads/Bennett_s_Education_Ties_Feb_7_2011.pdf|title=Bennett's education ties|journal=The Journal Gazette|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marian.edu/pages/news.aspx?newsid=475&amp;ddlNewsCat=&amp;ddlNews=All+News&amp;webPartId=g_70d2bd8c_c888_422b_9aee_8dc43321075b |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214200352/http://www.marian.edu/pages/news.aspx?newsid=475&amp;ddlNewsCat=&amp;ddlNews=All+News&amp;webPartId=g_70d2bd8c_c888_422b_9aee_8dc43321075b |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite receiving nearly hundred thousand dollars&lt;ref&gt;http://campaignfinance.in.gov/PublicSite/SearchPages/CommitteeDetail.aspx?OrgID=5608&lt;/ref&gt; in out-of-state campaign money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/indiana/2012/09/17/bennett-campaign-nets-175k-in-less-than-three-weeks/|author=Kyle Stokes|title=Bennett Campaign Nets $175K In Less Than Three Weeks &amp;#124; StateImpact Indiana |publisher=[[NPR]]|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett ended up losing the 2012 superintendent race to [[Glenda Ritz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/indiana/tag/glenda-ritz/|title=State Superintendent Glenda Ritz: Longtime Educator, First-Time Politician|publisher=NPR|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some controversy arose after the election because the current president of [[Purdue University]], [[Mitch Daniels]], claimed that teachers used illegal tactics to defeat Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20121130/NEWS05/121130014/Gov-Mitch-Daniels-claims-teachers-used-illegal-tactics-defeat-GOP-state-education-chief-Tony-Bennett|author=Maureen Groppe|title=Gov.

=== Controversy ===
In November 2018, it was reported that Bennett, who directed policies in 2011 that eventually led to a state takeover of the [[Gary Community School Corporation]] in 2017, has an ownership stake in the company selected by the GOP-controlled legislature to manage the takeover with a potential to earn $11.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-tony-bennett-mgt-board-st-1128-story.html|title=Former state school chief Bennett aligned with Gary schools manager|last=Carlson|first=Carole|date=27 November 2018|work=Post Tribune|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/news/education/emergency-manager-firm-running-gary-schools-can-earn-million-in/article_e8798224-06ad-5a8f-a05d-0115068b0d49.html|title=Emergency manager firm running Gary schools can earn $11.4 million in next three years|last=Carden|first=Dan|date=15 October 2017|work=Times of Northwest Indiana|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering the conflict of interest in Bennett's ownership in the management company, state and local lawmakers immediately called for a repudiation of the state's contract with his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-eddie-melton-duab-st-1130-story.html|title=State senator calls for ouster of Gary schools emergency manager|last=Carlson|first=Carole|date=25 November 2018|work=Post Tribune|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Florida education commissioner==
On December 12, 2012, the [[Florida Board of Education]] unanimously selected Bennett as the state's new education commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/former-indiana-superintendent-is-floridas-new-education-commissioner/1265783|title=Former Indiana superintendent is Florida's new education commissioner|author=Jeffrey S. Solochek|author2=Marlene Sokol|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2013, Bennett announced his resignation due to the scandal surrounding [[Christel House Academy]], citing if he stayed on as commissioner it would "be a distraction to the children of Florida."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida education commissioner resigns over grade scandal|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/08/01/207981620/floridas-education-chief-resigns-over-grading-scandal|author=John O'Connor|publisher=NPR|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the fall of 2012, Bennett, as Indiana superintendent of schools, changed the "A–F" school rating system so that Christel House Academy, a [[charter school]] run by a Republican donor, would receive a top A rating. Emails suggested a focus on just the one school. Bennett's email quoted him as saying, "We have NO chance of advancing accountability during the session with this problem in front of us." Subsequent emails showed his staff working to get the charter school up to an A rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom LoBianco|date=July 30, 2013|title=GOP donor's school grade changed|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/text/2021497775.html|newspaper=[[Seattle Times]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett defended the rating change, saying the prior rating system disadvantaged Christel House because the school instructed students from kindergarten through 10th grade. Bennett said the same rating changes applied to other schools spanning nontraditional grade ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kathleen McGrory|date=July 29, 2013|title=Emails show Florida education chief changed Indiana grading formula to benefit donor's school|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/emails-show-florida-education-chief-changed-indiana-grading-formula-to/2133801|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett was investigated for misuse of public resources in the lead up to his 2012 election loss to Glenda Ritz. In July 2014, the State Ethics Commission accepted Bennett's offer to settle the ethics charges by paying a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Claire McInerny|date=July 10, 2014|title=State Ethics Commission Accepts Bennett's Settlement|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2014/07/10/state-ethics-commission-accepts-bennetts-settlement/|website=StateImpact Indiana|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly, the commission admonished Bennett for minor ethics violations, but internal documents obtained from the inspector general's office listed more than 100 potential violations of federal wire fraud law by Bennett or his employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom LoBianco|date=December 2, 2014|title=Tony Bennett probe called for prosecution|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2014/12/02/ap-exclusive-bennett-probe-called-prosecution/19793119/|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Marion County prosecutors had reviewed the inspector general's internal documents, and declined to pursue charges against Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jill Disis|date=May 15, 2015|title=Former state schools Superintendent Tony Bennett won't face criminal charges|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/15/former-schools-superintendent-tony-bennett-face-criminal-charges/27390391/|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett was born in [[Clark County, Indiana]], is once divorced, is currently married to Tina and lives in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. He has four children, including a set of triplets, and three grandchildren.

}}'''''Underneath the Lintel''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Glen Berger]] that premièred in 2001. The sole character—the Librarian—embarks on a quest to find out who anonymously returned a library book that is 113 years overdue. A clue scribbled in the margin of the book and an unclaimed dry-cleaning ticket then take him on a mysterious adventure that spans the globe and the ages.

==Plot synopsis==
The play begins with the Librarian appearing on stage, which is sparsely furnished with a whiteboard and marker pens, a magnetic bulletin board, and a table. The Librarian carries with him a battered suitcase. He informs the audience that he is giving a lecture for only one day about a discovery he has made.

The Librarian then opens his suitcase and begins to show the audience what he calls his "scraps": pieces of evidence each marked with numbered tags that provide evidence of a person whose identity is gradually revealed over the course of the play.

He starts with a copy of a [[Baedeker]] travel guide that was anonymously returned 113 years overdue to the library in the small Dutch town where he used to work. Tracking down the loan records of the book, he finds that the book was borrowed by one "A." who provided a post office box as his address. Inside the book, he finds a 73-year-old dry-cleaning ticket for an unclaimed piece of clothing in a London laundry shop. Intrigued, he takes leave from work to visit London. He finds that the laundry shop is still in business and, using the ticket, redeems a pair of trousers that has not been cleaned because of its poor condition.

Eventually, the audience learns that the person to whom all of the Librarian's items relate may be [[Ahasuerus]] the [[Wandering Jew]], a [[Mythology|mythical]] figure from medieval [[Christian mythology|Christian folklore]].

'''Violence in sports''' usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a [[sports|sports game]], often in relation to contact sports such as [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], [[rugby football]], [[lacrosse]], [[association football]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], and [[water polo]] and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.

==Causes==
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are "mock battles" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salamone |first1=Frank A. |title=Society, Culture, Leisure and Play |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=9780761816256 |pages=273–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence by athletes==
Through a "civilizing process", many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"/&gt;
 
Athletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.

In boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in [[ice hockey]] and [[Australian Football League]] matches.

===Ritual violence===
High school, college, and even professional sports teams often include [[initiation]] ceremonies (known as [[hazing]] in the USA) as a [[rite of passage]]. A 1999 study by [[Alfred University]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/.|title=Alfred University : News : NCAA Sports Survey|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.

==Fan violence==

Violence may also be related to nationalism or as an outlet for underlying social tensions. It is often [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]-related.

Violence by supporters of sports teams dates back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots. Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The [[Nika riots]] of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.

In periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans – the [[Astor Place Riot]] in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.

The actions of English [[association football|football]] [[football hooliganism|hooligans]] and [[football firm|firms]] in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the recent [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] tournament, [[England national football team|England]] were publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Alan Rothenberg]] (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:

{{cquote|There were three countries in the world whose presence would have created logistical and security problems, so we're very pleased they won't be coming: Iraq, Iran and England.}}

===Notable examples of fan violence===

* In 532, the rivalry between supporters of the ''Blue'' and ''Green'' [[chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|chariot-racing]] teams in [[Constantinople]] led to 30,000 deaths in the [[Nika riots]].
* The first meeting in the [[Holy War (Utah vs. BYU)|American football rivalry]] between [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University]] and the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] took place in April 1896, when BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy. The two schools disagree to this day as to whether this game was official, but it mattered greatly to the spectators—at the end of the game, the two sets of fans fought one another.
* In the second edition of the [[Tour de France]] in [[1904 Tour de France|1904]], as the riders climbed the [[Col de la République]] in the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], supporters of regional favorite [[Antoine Faure]] physically attacked several of his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Woodland, Les (2007), ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey Press, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=2981&amp;Section=Route |title=Tour 1904 : mort de son succès| work=Vélo 101, le site officiel du vélo |publisher=Velo101.com |date=October 30, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2012|language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repercussions of this incident continue to this day—the Tour did not return to Loire until [[1950 Tour de France|1950]], and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Yellow Jersey Companion to the Tour de France|last= Woodland|first= Les| publisher=Yellow Jersey Press| year=2003 | isbn=0-224-063189|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 11 times since then, its appearances in the [[1903 Tour de France|1903]] and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|title=Col de la République was eerste berg in Tour de France|author=Van den Bogaart, Ronnie|language=Dutch|date=November 10, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2012|publisher=Sportgeschiedenis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226001610/http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|archive-date=February 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1972, [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] pummeled [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] 30–3 in their annual [[Civil War (college football game)|"Civil War"]] football rivalry game, held this season at Oregon State's [[Parker Stadium]]. After the game, jubilant Oregon fans rushed the field and tore down the south goal post. They then turned to do the same to the north goal post, but were met by Oregon State fans who had come on the field, resulting in a major brawl.&lt;ref name=TO112208&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindbeaversbeat/2008/11/civil_war_5_moments_that_fanne.html |title=Civil War: 5 moments that fanned the flames of the rivalry |first=Seth |last=Prince |work=The Oregonian |date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1975 Tour de France|1975]], cyclist [[Eddy Merckx]] was viciously punched by a spectator as he climbed the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] in the Tour de France. Merckx, who had won the Tour de France five times previously and at the time was in the leader's yellow jersey, finished the stage barely able to breathe, and went on to finish the tour in second place overall.
* The [[Scottish Cup 1979–80|1980 Scottish Cup Final]] between bitter [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] was marred by an on-pitch riot between rival fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daEMvQsWys8|title=Celtic 1 Rangers 0 1980 Scottish 'riot' Cup Final|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the banning of alcohol from Scottish football and rugby matches.
* After [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[Alan Minter]] in three rounds to win boxing's world middleweight title at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1980, many of Minter's supporters began to throw beer cans, bottles and other objects into the ring. Both Hagler and Minter, along with their respective handlers, had to be escorted out by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]].
* On August 12, 1984, during a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] that degenerated into a [[beanball]] war:&lt;ref name="Beanball war"&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball Hall of Shame |last=Nash |first=Bruce |author2=Zullo, Allan  |year=1989 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-671-68766-3 |pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtX4CreRGNEC&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=braves+padres+beanball+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nrJVzVYn9V&amp;sig=aYSg6y7nXtxQmR6Ip82h12bv0GI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CDq2TKy4GsSBlAfMrpnvBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** At least five fans were dragged from the field at [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] in handcuffs after participating in a bench-clearing brawl.
** One of the fans was charged with assault for throwing a full beer mug at the Padres' [[Kurt Bevacqua]], hitting him in the head, as he was returning to the dugout.
** The game ended with police riot squads on top of both dugouts in an obvious attempt to keep fans away from the players.
* At the end of [[1984 Major League Baseball season|the same season]], violence erupted outside of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in Detroit after the [[Detroit Tigers]] defeated the Padres in the [[World Series]]. A well known photo from the riot shows a Tigers fan holding a World Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car.
* [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] – 39 people died when a wall collapsed under pressure of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] supporters fleeing from 'football [[football hooliganism|hooligans]]' supporting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] during the [[1985 European Cup Final]].
* [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]] – a 1990 football match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] was abandoned after ten minutes with thousands of fans fighting each other and the police. One of the Zagreb players, [[Zvonimir Boban]], was seen to kick a policeman, and after an hour long riot, the stadium was set on fire. Dinamo fans saw the riot as the beginning of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montague|first=James|title=Five games that changed the world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/01/05/iraq.asia.six.games/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, a mentally ill tennis fan stabbed [[Monica Seles]] during a changeover at a tennis match in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175121/I-ballooned-size-8-18-I-stabbed-fan-says-tennis-ace-Monica-Seles.html|title='I ballooned from size 8 to 18 after I was stabbed by a fan,' says tennis ace Monica Seles|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, [[Vancouver Canucks]] fans [[1994 Stanley Cup riot|rioted]] in the streets of [[Vancouver]] after their team lost in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup finals]].
* During the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombian]] football (soccer) player [[Andrés Escobar]] accidentally scored an [[own goal]] in a match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], a match which Colombia lost 2–1.  On his return to [[Colombia]], Escobar was confronted outside a bar in [[Medellín]] by a gunman who shot the player six times, killing him.  The gunman reportedly shouted "''¡Gol!''" ("Goal!") for each bullet fired.
* Rioting Indian fans at the Eden Gardens stadium in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] forced the end of the semi-final match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]]. Fans started rioting when the home team, seemingly on the way to victory, underwent a dramatic batting collapse. [[Match referee]] [[Clive Lloyd]] brought the teams off the ground for their safety, then attempted to restart the match. When the fans remained throwing projectiles and damaging stadium facilities, the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka (who went on to win the World Cup).
* In 1996 during a night [[Australian Football League]] match at [[Waverley Park]] in [[Melbourne]] between [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a [[pitch invasion]] occurred when the lights went out during the third quarter. Initially, a serious car crash into power lines in the nearby area was reported to have caused the [[Power outage|blackout]], although it was later confirmed to be a major electrical fault. In the midst of the chaos, fans rioted and stormed the ground, some lighting bonfires in the centre square, and removing two of the behind posts. The incidents were filmed on [[Network Seven]], and the remaining quarter and a half was played three nights later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~brad/96/round10.htm Round 10 1996, Essendon vs. St Kilda], Bomber Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, [[Denver Broncos]] fans rioted in the streets of [[Denver]] after their team won [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Near-riots happened when the team won the Super Bowl again the following year and after the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] wins in 1996 and 2001.
* A similar incident occurred in [[Oakland, California]] in 2003 when fans rioted and destroyed property after the [[Oakland Raiders]] lost to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].
* In July 2000, 13 people were trampled to death in a riot at a [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifying match in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe after [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] took a 2–0 lead over [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]].
* In June 2000, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] fans stormed the streets of Los Angeles after the Lakers victory over the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] [[NBA Finals]]. Fans briefly celebrated by starting [[bonfire]]s, but it soon turned into a riot, with fans dancing and stomping on parked cars, and even turning a news van over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/798383.stm |work=BBC News | title=Riots after Lakers win NBA title | date=June 20, 2000 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2001 during an Australian Football League match between [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at [[Visy Park|Optus Oval]], Geelong's Darren Milburn executed a very late and illegal [[Bump (football)|bump]] on Carlton's [[Steven Silvagni]], collecting Silvagni's head with his hip, knocking Silvagni unconscious and leaving him having to be carried from the field by trainers. Milburn then proceeded to clap towards the crowd after being substituted, further igniting the situation; Carlton fans threatened Milburn, attempted to enter the interchange box to assault him, and attempted to attack Milburn's police escort in the car park after the match.&lt;ref&gt;Atwell, Glen. [http://www.sporttalk.com.au/afl-milburn-knocks-out-silvagni-2001/ AFL: Stephen Silvagni knocked out by Darren Milburn], SportTalk.com.au, May 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Milburn was suspended for three matches for the incident.
* In May 2004 after an [[Australian Football League]] Friday Night Football match between [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and St Kilda at [[AAMI Stadium]] which St Kilda won by 32 points, field umpires were booed and abused by Adelaide fans, and a drink bottle was thrown which hit a 12-year-old St Kilda fan. One fan was ejected and banned for one year from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/crows-fan-faces-ban/story-e6frecj3-1225698262430 Crows fan facing one year ban after young Saints fan injured]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2004 in the [[AFL Cairns|Cairns Australian Football League]] Grand Final between the North Cairns Tigers and the Port Douglas Crocs at [[Cazaly's Stadium]], a wild and violent 15&amp;nbsp;minute bench-clearing brawl erupted after Tigers players charged at the Crocs pre-match huddle at the end of the national anthem, and escalated when fans and team officials became involved. One fan was arrested and another five were ejected, while three Crocs players and a Crocs runner were left unconscious and having to be carried from the arena on stretchers. After a lengthy AFL investigation, the instigator, North Cairns Tigers coach and former VFL/AFL player Jason Love, was suspended for eight years, and the 22 North Cairns players were suspended for a total of 400 matches (suspensions ranging from 10 matches to five years) on a string of charges in relation to starting the brawl; the Tigers were forced to forfeit their first match of 2005 as a result of these suspensions. AFL Cairns declared the Grand Final a "no result" and withheld the 2004 premiership.&lt;ref name="ABC_AU_554742"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-20/probe-launched-into-cairns-afl-brawl/554742 |title=Probe launched into Cairns AFL brawl |date=September 20, 2004 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1203277.htm|title=PM – AFL yet to decide fate of brawling players|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/AFL/Eightyear-ban-for-exSwan/2005/02/23/1109046993483.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eight-year ban for ex-Swan | date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2004, fans of the Boston Red Sox rioted just outside Fenway Park after the Red Sox won the [[2004 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] over the New York Yankees. Police used "pepper guns" in some cases and an Emerson College student, [[Victoria Snelgrove]], was killed by a pepper filled paintball-like projectile which hit her in the eye.
* On November 19, 2004, near the end of an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]], a [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|brawl]] erupted between Pacers players and Pistons supporters.
* On April 12, 2005, the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarterfinal between [[local derby|intracity rivals]] [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]] was abandoned after Inter fans threw missiles and flares on to the pitch at the [[San Siro]] stadium, with A.C. Milan goalkeeper [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] hit by a flare.
* In May 2006 during an [[Australian Football League]] match between [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a North Melbourne fan had a provocative confrontation with coach [[Dean Laidley]], to which Laidley responded with a verbal barrage, inviting the fan to the club rooms to see how badly the players were feeling due to their consistently poor on-field performance. The incident was captured on Australian national television. The fan committed suicide by throwing himself in the path of an oncoming train the next morning.
* On June 6, 2010, the final game of the [[Greek Basket League]] finals between ancient rivals [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] (PAO), also respectively known as the "Reds" and "Greens" from their club colors, degenerated into what one commentator called a "night of shame" for [[Basketball in Greece|Greek basketball]].&lt;ref name="Night of shame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |title=On "Night of Shame", Panathinaikos Takes 8th Consecutive Greek Title in Riot Conditions |work=BallinEurope.com |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629090042/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panathinaikos entered the game, held at Olympiacos' home of [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], with a 2–1 lead in the best-of-5 series. The homestanding Reds fans were reportedly incensed at what they considered to be biased officiating in the Greens' favor in Game 3. The violence began even before tipoff, with police forced to use tear gas on rioting Reds fans; the game started 40 minutes late.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |title=Olympiakos fans force Game 4 to be suspended |work=SportinGreece.com |date=June 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054552/http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, with PAO leading 50–42, the game was halted for about an hour after Olympiacos fans threw various incendiaries at the PAO bench, with one smoke bomb exploding next to the bench.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; By the time the teams resumed play, all but about 2,000 fans had left.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; Then, with little over a minute left in the game and PAO ahead 76–69, many of the remaining Reds fans began throwing objects on the court, leading the officials to suspend play and forfeit the game to PAO, giving the Greens the title.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; The new champions had to be escorted off the floor by riot police.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; The league organizer, [[Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association|HEBA]], fined Olympiacos €111,000 and required them to play their first nine home games of the [[2010–11 Greek Basket League|2010–11 season]] behind closed doors and without live TV coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |title=Brutal Week for Greek Basketball Capped With 80–72 Loss to Spain |work=BallinEurope.com |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629072426/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Riot aftermath Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Damaged vehicle in the aftermath of the 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]]
* The [[2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]] immediately followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team to the Boston Bruins in the deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in June of that year.
* Later in the same month, major violence broke out involving supporters of historic Argentine football club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] during and after their promotion/relegation playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]]. The first leg on June 22 [[Estadio Gigante de Alberdi|in Córdoba]] was delayed for 20 minutes after River Plate hooligans tore through a fence and stormed the field to verbally and physically attack River players. The second leg, on June 26 at [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|El Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, had what was reported to be the largest security presence for any match in the country's history, with over 2,200 police called in. However, it was not enough to keep River hooligans, angered at what became the club's first relegation from the top flight in their history, from rushing the field. Violence quickly spread, with fires set in the stadium, pitched battles between hooligans and police, and looting in nearby areas. At least 35 police and 55 civilians were reported to have been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6706438/river-plate-relegated-argentine-2nd-division-first-time-club-history |title=Chaos erupts after River Plate relegated |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 21, 2011, a [[2011–12 KNVB Cup#Fourth round|fourth round]] match in the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup]] between [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] at Ajax's home of [[Amsterdam Arena]] was marred by a violent fan incident. In the 36th minute, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran on the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind at AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was [[Misconduct (association football)#Sending-off offences (red card)|sent off]] for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety [[Behind closed doors (football)|behind closed doors]] on January 19, 2012. Ajax was also fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan—who was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban—from entering the pitch, and given a suspended one-match spectator ban (not including the replay). Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had given the fan a 30-year stadium ban and a lifetime ban from the club and its season ticket list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7395584/ajax-az-alkmaar-cup-match-replayed-full |title=Ajax vs. Alkmaar to start from scratch |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=December 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American football===
* In a [[National Football League]] game on November 1, 1970, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] led the [[Oakland Raiders]] 17–14, and a long run for a first-down run by quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet as he lay on the ground, provoking Chiefs’ receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, Taylor and Davidson were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor's unwise retaliation against Davidson's foul play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619085937/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Chiefs–Raiders rivalry]].

===Association football===
* April 2, 2005: [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] teammates [[Lee Bowyer]] and [[Kieron Dyer]] were sent off after fighting one another near the end of the team's 3–0 loss to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Several Newcastle players and a Villa player separated the two before either was seriously hurt, but Bowyer's shirt was ripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4404473.stm |title=Dyer &amp; Bowyer in amazing punch-up |work=BBC Sport |date=April 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
* In 1994 Swans recruit [[Dermott Brereton]] was suspended for 7 weeks for standing on [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] player [[Rayden Tallis]]' head during a practice match; he was suspended for another 7 matches later in the season for elbowing [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] captain Tony Free and breaking his jaw. When Brereton transferred to Collingwood at the end of 1994 the AFL decided that his 7-week suspension was no longer applicable as it was applied to the club (Sydney) and not to the player (Brereton). [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] forward [[Tony Lockett]] was suspended for 8 matches during the season for elbowing Sydney's Peter Caven and breaking his nose.&lt;ref name="Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996"&gt;Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perhaps the most violent match in AFL history took place on June 5, 2004 Round 11, at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] between Hawthorn and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. The final score was Hawthorn 12.8 (80) to Essendon 24.10 (154). During halftime, Brereton, by now Hawthorn club director, allegedly told Hawks players to draw a "line in the sand" and take a physical stand against the Bombers.&lt;ref name="dermie-ref"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Hinds|title=Heavier blows to come for Hawks, Bombers|date=June 7, 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/06/1086460175315.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, a number of on-field incidents led to several fights around the ground, culminating in a five-minute bench-clearing brawl.

===Baseball===
[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bench-clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] because of [[Coco Crisp]] getting hit by a pitch by [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].]]
* The first contest in what would become [[Utah–BYU rivalry|one of the most intense rivalries]] in U.S. college sports, an 1895 baseball game between Brigham Young Academy, now [[BYU Cougars|Brigham Young University]], and the [[Utah Utes|University of Utah]], ended in a scoreless tie, immediately followed by a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=1 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This was far from the last violent incident in the baseball version of the Utah–BYU rivalry:
** In one 1966 game, a Utah batter intentionally hit BYU's catcher with his bat.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html?pg=2 |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=2 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In another game in the mid-1980s, a number of BYU players were heckling Utah's pitcher. The pitcher went into his stretch, and then turned and fired a fastball into the BYU dugout, leading to a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
** Yet another game in the same era saw a Utah player get a base hit with two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game. The lead runner could have scored the winning run uncontested—but he instead went out of his way to run over BYU's catcher, who was standing on the first-base side of home plate (the opposite side from a runner heading for home). The runner was called out and ejected, and BYU went on to win in extra innings.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
* On August 12, 1984, a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] turned into what writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo later called "one of the worst [[beanball]] wars of modern times", starting with Braves pitcher [[Pascual Pérez (baseball)|Pascual Pérez]] [[hit by pitch|hitting]] [[Alan Wiggins]] with the game's first pitch, followed by four attempts by Padres pitchers to hit Pérez in retaliation, and ending in Braves reliever [[Donnie Moore]] hitting [[Graig Nettles]]. The chaos led to four bench-clearing incidents, one of which lasted at least 10&amp;nbsp;minutes; ejections of both managers and 12 players and coaches; multiple suspensions of individuals involved in the fracas; and fan involvement (see above).&lt;ref name="Beanball war"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |work=Page 2 |first=Jeff |last=Merron |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===

* In a 1972 [[college basketball]] game, [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State University]] were leading the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]] 50–44 with 36&amp;nbsp;seconds left to play in the game. Ohio State's [[Luke Witte]] was fouled hard going to the basket by Minnesota's Corky Taylor, who punched the dazed Witte in the face and kneed him in the groin. Gopher reserve [[Ron Behagen]] then stomped on Witte's neck and head. Witte was not the only victim of violence, as a larger brawl broke out, with two other Gophers, [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] and future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famer]] [[Dave Winfield]], attacking other Ohio State players. Witte was taken off the court on a stretcher and booed by Minnesota fans. He was the most seriously injured among three Buckeyes players taken to hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.10000takes.com/hall_of_shame/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game on December 9, 1977, [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] was already fighting with [[Kevin Kunnert]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] when [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] of the Rockets came running toward them. Seeing a man in an opponent uniform rushing at him, Washington instinctively turned and punched Tomjanovich in the face, resulting in a near-fatal season-ending injury to Tomjanovich. The NBA suspended Washington for 60 days (26 games) and fined him $10,000.  A civil jury awarded Tomjanovich $3.2 million.  This incident is the subject of the book ''The Punch'' by [[John Feinstein]].
* On November 19, 2004, the infamous [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] took place in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. It ranks among the worst episodes of sports violence in [[Sports in the United States|American sports]] history.
* On August 19, 2010, the final game of the [[Acropolis International Tournament 2010|Acropolis International Tournament]] between [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] and [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]] in Athens ended in a bench-clearing brawl with 2:40 left and Greece leading 74–73. The melee started when Greece's [[Antonis Fotsis]] moved threateningly toward Serbia's [[Miloš Teodosić]] after a hard foul. Teodosic responded by punching Fotsis in the face while [[Nenad Krstić]] also tried to grab the Greek player. Greece's 360&amp;nbsp;lb center [[Sofoklis Schortsanitis]] joined the fight attacking multiple Serbian players and spreading havoc. Krstic punched Schortsanitis several times in his back. When he started pursuing the retreating Krstić, the Serbian player responded by throwing a chair at him. The chair missed Schortsanitis but hit his teammate [[Ioannis Bourousis]] in the head, drawing blood. Players from both teams fought in the tunnel leading from the arena before being separated, and a few fans joined the fight but were quickly taken from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/08/19/friendly-acropolis-tourney-ends-bench-clearing-brawl-forces-abandonment-greece/ |title=Friendly Acropolis tourney ends when bench-clearing brawl forces abandonment of Greece-Serbia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krstić was arrested by Greek police, but was released the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5478923 |title=Police release Nenad Krstic after melee |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] responded by suspending two players from each team for part of the subsequent [[2010 FIBA World Championship|FIBA World Championship]].

* Later that year, on October 12, an exhibition match between the [[China national basketball team|China]] and [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] national teams in [[Xuchang]] was marred by rough play from both sides before escalating into open exchanges of kicks and punches, followed by a bench-clearing brawl. After the teams were separated, China players attacked the Brazilians as they were heading to the locker room. Brazil refused to return to the court or to play the fourth and final match in their scheduled series. The Chinese national federation issued an official apology to Brazil the following day. This was the latest in a series of incidents involving the China team that had already resulted in tens of thousands of US$ in fines from both FIBA and [[FIBA Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=5680189 |title=China apologizes for brawl with Brazil |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, China head coach [[Bob Donewald, Jr.]] was suspended for China's next three FIBA matches; three China players drew suspensions of one or two games; and the three match officials were suspended from FIBA matches for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/presRele/p/newsid/45415/presReleArti.html |title=PR N° 34 – China sanctioned for mass brawl in Brazil friendly |publisher=FIBA |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 18, 2011, another Chinese team, the [[Bayi Rockets]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]], was involved in a major scuffle with the touring [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University men's team]]. After three quarters of highly physical play from both sides, the game turned ugly with the teams tied at 64 with 9:32 remaining in the final quarter. At that point, both benches emptied and the teams began fighting one another. One Georgetown player had a chair thrown at him by an unidentified individual, with reports differing on whether he was hit. Another Georgetown player who had been struck during the brawl picked up a chair in apparent self-defense. As the brawl progressed, some fans joined in the action, with one wielding a stanchion. Hoyas coach [[John Thompson III]] pulled his team from the court; the team had to dodge water bottles and other objects thrown by fans, and one Georgetown fan was reportedly knocked to the ground by a thrown bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/6873726/georgetown-hoyas-chinese-professional-team-game-ends-brawl |title=Georgetown, Chinese pro team brawl |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN |date=August 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/fight-ends-georgetown-basketball-exhibition-in-china/2011/08/18/gIQAs1zeNJ_story.html |title=Georgetown basketball exhibition in China ends in brawl |first=Gene |last=Wang |work=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 2, 2018, [[Philippines–Australia basketball brawl |a bench-clearing brawl]] broke out between the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] men's national teams during a [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)#Group B|qualifier]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]]. With Australia leading by over 30 points with just over 4:00 left in the third quarter, play was halted for a foul. Australia's [[Daniel Kickert]] then swung his elbow at an [[Roger Pogoy|unsuspecting Philippines player]], immediately leading to both benches clearing and a melee spreading from the bench to one of the baskets. When order was restored and game officials reviewed video of the incident, a total of 13 players were ejected—four from Australia (including Kickert) and nine from the Philippines. This left the hosts with only three players to resume the game; after two of the remaining Philippines players fouled out, leaving that team with only one player, the officials called the game, with Australia winning 89–53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/23974221/milwaukee-bucks-center-thon-maker-brawl-fiba-qualifying-game |title=Bucks center Thon Maker in middle of brawl during FIBA qualifying game |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fight between [[Shawn Thornton]] and [[Wade Brookbank]]. Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition with a long history.]]
Violence has been a part of [[ice hockey]] since at least the early 1900s. According to the book ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.&lt;ref name="PeopleHistory"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history involving many levels of amateur and professional play and including some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, some administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as some players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntyre|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrie Examiner|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[St. Louis Blues]] on September 21, 1969, Bruins defenseman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|title=Legends of Hockey -- NHL Player Search -- Player -- Wayne Maki|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture and brain damage, forcing him to miss the entirety of the [[1969–70 NHL season]], with Maki emerging uninjured. As a result of the fight, Green played for the remaining nine years of his professional career with a pioneering variety of [[hockey helmet]] in both the NHL and WHA.
* April 20, 1984 – A bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoffs matchup between the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]], after many smaller-scale battles had occurred throughout the game. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 10 players were ejected. This game prompted referee [[Bruce Hood (ice hockey)|Bruce Hood]] to retire from the NHL once the playoffs ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lemieux|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly referred to as the ''[[Good Friday Massacre]]''.
* On January 4, 1987, the final game of the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], involving [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] and the Soviet Union, saw intense physical (and often dirty) play by both sides, culminating in [[Punch-up in Piešťany|a bench-clearing brawl]] that lasted over 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Event organizers, in a futile attempt to stop the fighting, turned the arena lights off. Eventually, the game was declared null and void, and both teams were ejected from the competition, costing the Canadians a medal. Virtually all of the players on the Canadian team got suspended for 18 months, while the Soviet Union players were permanently banned from international competition, and the coaching staffs of both teams were fired. The match referee, widely blamed for losing control of the game, never worked another international match.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{Harvnb|CBC|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 9, 2001 – A game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the British [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".  When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-29 |publisher=BBC | date=February 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 2007-12-24 |publisher = CBC | date=February 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1171302.stm |title=League punishes teams over brawl |date=February 15, 2001 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 5, 2004 – A Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90&amp;nbsp;minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maaddi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 9, 2010 – In a [[Kontinental Hockey League]] game between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]], a bench-clearing brawl broke out in the 4th minute of the first period, and a bench- and penalty-box-clearing brawl broke out 39&amp;nbsp;seconds later, forcing officials to abandon the game as there were only four players left.

[[File:Vladislav Petković Dis.jpg|thumb|Vladislav Petković Dis.]]
'''Vladislav Petković Dis''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Владислав Петковић Дис}}; born '''Vladislav Petković'''; 12 March 1880 – 16 May/29 May 1917) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[poet]], part of the [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionism]] movement in [[Europe]]an [[poetry]], known as ''Moderna/Symbolism'' in Serbia. He was born in 1880 in Zablaće, near [[Čačak]] in [[Serbia]] and died in 1917 on a boat on the [[Ionian Sea]] after being hit by a torpedo.

==Biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Vladislav Petković was born in Zablaće, a village near [[Čačak]], in the Principality of Serbia. He made his way to Čačak, graduating from the Gymnasium and Teacher's College in 1902. He was appointed temporary teacher at [[Prlita]], a village near the town of [[Zaječar]]. He did not like teaching, and his small output of poetry brought him little income. In 1903, he moved to [[Belgrade]], and became prominent in the literary life there, when his poems appeared in ''Idila'', a literary magazine.Vladislav Petković chose his appellation "Dis" as a repetition of the middle syllable of his first name, but also as the name of the Roman god of the underworld. He was a frequent evening visitor to the Belgrade's [[kafana|''kafanas'']] in [[Skadarlija]] and elsewhere where he would drink and compose new verse at the same time.

He obtained an appointment as a customs official with the municipal government, giving him a good income and leisure time to write. He was named co-editor, with [[Sima Pandurović]], of ''Literary Weekend'' (Književna nedelja). Both Petković-Dis and Pandurović were considered the ''[[enfants terribles]]'' of their literary world (both being under the influence of [[Charles Baudelaire]] and other French Symbolists, like Šantić, Dučić, Rakić, Ćorović, and even Skerlić before he abandoned the movement). After the demise of the magazine, he married Hristina-Tinka, with whom he had two children, Gordana and Mutimir.

He wrote ''Spomenik'' (Monument) in anticipation of [[World War I]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''And it still seems that,&lt;br&gt;as my soul dreams on,&lt;br&gt;the monument lives on,&lt;br&gt;ready for eternity,&lt;br&gt;reborn into new traditions,&lt;br&gt;tempering young ambitions&lt;br&gt;to erect the next monument.''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]] he was conscripted by the military as a journalist. He was the war correspondent covering battles of the [[Serbian Army]] in the [[First Balkan War]] (1912), [[Second Balkan War]] (1913), and [[World War I]] that followed. In 1915 he joined the Serbian army in their [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|retreat]] to [[Corfu]].

From Corfu Petković-Dis was sent to [[France]] to recuperate and write about the entire tragedy. In 1917, on his way back, on either 16 May or 29 May (varying sources), he became a civilian war casualty after boarding an Italian ship, destined for Corfu. It was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine in the [[Ionian Sea]]. He is said to have predicted his unfortunate destiny, for one of his most famous collections of poems is called ''Drowned Souls'', earning him the reputation of a [[Poète maudit|cursed poet]]. He was 37 years old.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Poetry==
His nickname '''Dis''' was derived from the three letters in the middle of his first name "Vla-DIS-lav". He introduced irrational and subconscious images into Serbian [[lyric poetry]]. Some of his most famous poems are ''Možda spava'' (''She May Be Sleeping'') and ''Spomenik'' (''Monument'').

In ''Spomenik'', Petković Dis dreamed of a monument:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''It has a long life,&lt;br&gt;Today it descends into new legends,&lt;br&gt;To prepare our descendents for the next monument.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Petković Dis was writing in 1913, just after Serbia wrested [[Kosovo]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and installed an obelisk on the site of the famous [[Battle of Kosovo|medieval battle]] when Kosovo was severed from Serbia by the Ottomans. Dis's poetry was not well received at the beginning by [[Jovan Skerlić]], one of the most distinguished Serbian literary critics of that time, who did not care for the poems' morbid and sinister tone.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
