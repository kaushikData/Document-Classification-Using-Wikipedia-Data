'''Aaiha''' (or '''Aiha''')  ({{lang-ar|عيحا}})   is a [[village]], [[plain]], [[lake]], and temporary [[wetland]] situated in the [[Rashaya District]] and south of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverlebanon.com/en/map/mapsl_p7.php Discover Lebanon - Map of Aaiha]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlebanon.org/en/pages/hab/wetlands.html Wild Lebanon - Wetlands, Lakes and Rivers]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in an intermontane basin near [[Mount Hermon]] and the [[Syrian]] border, approximately halfway between [[Rashaya]] and [[Kfar Qouq]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Robinson|author2=Eli Smith|title=Biblical researches in Palestine, Mount Sinai and Arabia Petraea: A journal of travels in the year 1838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA433|accessdate=10 April 2011|year=1856|publisher=J.

The village sits c. {{convert|3750|ft|m}} above sea level and the small population is predominantly [[Druze]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishdruze.org.uk/popups/detailed_druzes.html British Druze Society - Druze communities in the Middle East] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911063025/http://www.britishdruze.org.uk/popups/detailed_druzes.html |date=11 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[wheat]]s ''[[Triticum boeoticum]]'' and ''T. urartu'' grow in this area, also used for farming [[goats]].&lt;ref name="HallCannell1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Elmit Hall|author2=Glen H.

==Aaiha plain, Aaiha lake and Aaiha intermittent lake==

The village is situated on a ridge next to '''Aaiha plain''', an [[intermittent lake]] that forms a near perfect circular shape, approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} in [[diameter]] and enclosed by [[mountains]] and the ridge on the west.&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fadi Georges Comair|title=Water management and hydrodiplomacy of river basins: Litani, Hasbani-Wazzani, Orontes, Nahr El Kebir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vlDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=2009|publisher=Notre Dame University - Louaize|isbn=978-9953-457-74-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plain is completely level with no particularly visible outlet for water, which occasionally floods the basin to a depth of several feet to form a lake. The creation of the lake is assisted by [[fountain]]s that well up through a large [[chasm]] in the northwest and a smaller [[fissure]] in the southeast. It has also been noted that when the waters subside, they drain down these fissures. Investigative [[potholers]] have claimed a permanent stream flows underneath these fissures.

==The Chaff of Phiala==
The smaller southeastern fissure was investigated and found to be {{convert|15|ft|m}} in diameter, {{convert|8|ft|m}} to {{convert|10|ft|m}} deep with no sign of water at the bottom. Robinson did not record any investigation of the larger one to the northwest of the plain, which was not flooded at the time, during the [[summer]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt; The villagers suggest the underground stream leads to and is the original source and ''fountain'' of the [[Hasbani]] river, the most northern source of the [[Jordan]] river. This is notably similar to that described in the tale of ''"The Chaff of Phiala"'' in ''[[The Jewish War]]'' by [[Flavius Josephus]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt;  Josephus tells a geographically inaccurate tale of a [[cavern]] in an ancient place called '''Phiala''' or '''Phiale''' (modern [[Birkat Ram]]), discovered to be the initial source of the Jordan by [[Philip the Tetrarch]] of [[Trachonitis]].&lt;ref name="Wilson2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Francis Wilson|title=Caesarea Philippi: Banias, the lost city of Pan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pkPt0uD708C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-440-5|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He threw [[chaff]] into Phiala and found it was carried by the waters to ''Panium'' (modern [[Banias]]), previously thought to be the origin of the Jordan river.&lt;ref name="JosephusWhiston1810"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Flavius Josephus|author2=William Whiston|title=The genuine works of Flavius Josephus: containing five books of the Antiquities of the Jews : to which are prefixed three dissertations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WM4vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=10 April 2011|year=1810|publisher=Printed for Evert Duyckinck, John Tiebout, and M. &amp; W. Ward|pages=306–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus writes:
{{cquote|Now Panium is thought to be the fountain of the Jordan, but in reality it is carried thither after an occult manner from the place called ''Phiala'' : This place lies as you go up to Trachonitis, and is an hundred and twenty furlongs from Caesarea, and is not far out of the road on the right hand ; and indeed it hath its name of Phiala (vial or bowl) very justly, from the roundness of its circumference, as being round like a wheel; its water continues always up to its edges, without either sinking or running over. And as this origin of the Jordan was formerly not known, it was discovered so to be when Philip was Tetrarch of Trachonitis ; for he had chaff thrown into Phiala, and it was found at Panium where the ancients thought the fountain head of the river was, whither it had been therefore carried (by the waters).&lt;ref name="JosephusWhiston1810"/&gt;}}

Edward Robinson commented that this story would appear still current in respect to this chasm and underground stream leading to the Hasbani.&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt;  Some [[neolithic]] [[flint]]s have been recovered in this area, in the hills {{convert|3|km|mi}} north of Rashaya.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=436–442|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/182.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman temple==

[[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] and [[Eli Smith]] visited in 1852 and noted a massive [[Roman temple]] had once been located near the village that has been grouped by George Taylor amongst the [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXchNqgyNdkC|accessdate=16 November 2012|year=1967|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson suggested the temple was bigger than [[Nebi Safa]] and spoke of it having been constructed of stones that were ''"tolerably large, well hewn, but not bevelled"''. Fragments of [[architrave]], mouldings and blocks from the temple had been re-used by the villagers making their homes and farmsteads and had been left lying all over the fields, covered in [[rubbish]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonSmith1856"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(BeirutLebanon)2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Université Saint-Joseph (Beirut|author2=Lebanon)|title=Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6lhAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Impr. catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Charles Warren]] also later visited and documented the area as part of an [[archaeological survey]] in 1869. He noted a long [[wall]] leading off into the east away from the village and temple. He also noted some [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] and rock-cut features and took a copy of an [[Ancient Greek]] inscription from one of the blocks.&lt;ref name="WarrenConder1889"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Charles Warren|author2=Claude Reignier Conder|title=The survey of western Palestine: Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQGBSDTCuJ0C|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=1889|publisher=The Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was completed in 92 [[AD]] but only the western part remained when visited, located on the top of a hill overlooking the plain.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The variety of local religious life in the Near East in the Hellenistic and Roman periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was constructed of blue [[limestone]] with an entrance opening facing east and a sideways bearing of  78°30'. The base of the temples was described as [[Attic]] and was positioned on top of an {{convert|18|in|m}} [[Socle (architecture)|socle]]. There were four courses of stones layered above a {{convert|5.7|ft|m}} high, [[cornice]]d [[stylobate]], measuring {{convert|18|in|m}}, {{convert|2.2|ft|m}}, {{convert|2.3|ft|m}} and {{convert|2.2|ft|m}}. Houses and a [[stable]] were built over the temple. Robinson also found a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[frieze]] and judged the style of many of the blocks to be Corinthian in appearance. A stone with a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] inscription was found built into the western wall. The structure measures {{convert|37.6|ft|m}} wide by at least {{convert|47.15|ft|m}} long with an entrance to vaults underneath. A column found nearby measured {{convert|3.2|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Fund1869"&gt;{{cite book|author=Palestine Exploration Fund|title=Quarterly statement - Palestine Exploration Fund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=1869|publisher=Published at the Fund's Office.|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==

The [[white-eyed pochard]] was noted at the Aaiha lake (then called the [[Rashaya]] lake) by Nevins in 1955, but not in 1956 as the lake had reverted to being a plain that year. The duck is thought to have been driven off by frequent shooting. Nevins also noted the [[Eurasian teal]] as a resident in the [[winter]], when the lake was present and the waters hadn't drained down the chasm to the [[Hasbani]].&lt;ref name="Publication"&gt;{{cite book|title=Publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LLVAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 October 2012|year=1957|publisher=The Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ādurbād-ī Mahrspandān''' ("Ādurbād, son of Mahrspand") was a [[Zoroastrian]] high priest in the reign of the [[Sassanian]] king [[Shapur II]] (309–379 AD).&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/adurbad-i-mahrspandan A. Tafażżolī, "ĀDURBĀD Ī MAHRSPANDĀN" in Encyclopaedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
In the Middle Persian [[Bundahishn]], Adurbad's lineage is traced back to the legendary Dūrsarw, the son of [[Manuchihr]]. In [[Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', he also mentioned as the descendant of Dwsr.

According to [[Zoroastrian]] traditions, a proof of the validity of his line of religious traditions was that he underwent the ordeal of molten bronize. That is metal was poured on his chest and he emerged as unscathed. According to Iranica, "In keeping with his religious zeal, Ādurbād was a force in the enactment and implementing of decrees against non-Zoroastrians; the established church is described as having then fallen on evil days, plagued by doubt and infidelity.".

==Works==
Various andarz texts (collection of wise counsels) are attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; The [[Denkard]] ascribes admonitions to Adurbad; and an Arabic version of these admonitions occur in the work of [[Miskawayh|Ebn Meskaway's]] {{transl|ar|''al-Ḥekmat al-ḵāleda''}}. Two groups of his counsels occur in extant [[Middle Persian]] text. The first group of counsels contain his addresses to his and is in part translated by [[Miskawayh|Ebn Maskawayah]] in [[Arabic]]. The second group comprises his supposed deathbed utterances. A collection of questions addressed to him by a disciple and his responses are found in the Pahalvi [[Revayats|Rivayat]]. A translation of some of the Middle Persian counsels exist in the book: [[R. C. Zaehner]], The Teachings of the Magi, London, 1956.

==Some Counsels==
*Do not tell a lie to anyone.
*Do not take an oath on either what is true or what is false.
*Do not consciously wager on anything at all.
*Do not seduce other men's wives, for that is a grievous sin for thy soul.
*My son, think upon virtue and do not turn your thoughts to sin, for man does not live eternally and the things of the spirit are the more greatly to be desired.
*Be single-minded among rulers and friends.
*Do not be violent or ill-considered in your speech, for the man who is violent or ill-considered in his speech is like a fire that falls upon a forest and burns up all birds and fish and creeping things.
*If you would not be abused by others, do not abuse anyone
*Renew your friendship with old friends, for an old friend is like old wine which becomes better and more fit for the consumption of princes the older it is.
*Keep your hands from stealing, your feet from treading the path of undutifulness, and your mind from unlawful desires (varan), for whoso practices virtue obtains his reward, and whoso commits sin receives his
*Whoso digs a pit for his enemies will fall into it himself.
*Do not deliver yourself up as a slave to any man.
*Do not mock at anyone.
*Listen to all that you hear and do not repeat it at random.
*Hold a wise man whose position is exalted in high esteem, ask his opinion and listen to it.
*Cherish a wise and modest woman and ask her in marriage.
*Be of good repute so that you may live at ease.
*Do not destroy your own soul for the sake of anger or vengeance
*Honour your father and mother, listen to them and obey them, for so long as a man's father and mother live, he is like a lion in the jungle which has no fear of anyone at all; but he who has neither father nor mother is like a widowed woman who is despoiled by men and can do nothing about it and whom all men despise.
*Do good and keep your doors open to any who may come from far or near, for he who does not do good and does not keep his doors open, will find the door of Heaven and of Paradise closed.
*Do not be unduly glad when good fortune attends you, and do not be unduly downcast when misfortune befalls you.

'''Arnold Genekowitsch Fruchtenbaum''' (born September 26, 1943) is a leading expert in Messianic Theology and the founder and director of Ariel Ministries, an organization which prioritizes the [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews |evangelization of Jews]] in an effort to bring them to the view that [[Jesus]] is the Jewish [[Messiah]]. He lectures and travels widely.

==Biography==
Fruchtenbaum was born on September 26, 1943 in [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]] to Henry (a photographer) and Adele (Suppes) Fruchtenbaum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us &gt; Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum |publisher=The Messiah in the Temple |url=http://www.themessiahinthetemple.com/arnold-fruchtenbaum-en.html |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fruchtenbaum's ancestors were leaders in an ultra-Orthodox [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] group in Poland. His grandfather was known to have the whole Old Testament memorized in Hebrew by age 18 and had been the one to call the final edict on the debate ruling the consumption of tomatoes as kosher for their community in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/finding-messiah-a-hasidic-jew-a-missionarys-daughter-and-a-bit-of-calvinistic-luck-107840/|title=Finding Messiah: A Hasidic Jew, a Missionary's Daughter, and a Bit of Calvinistic 'Luck'|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Fruchtenbaum was born, his [[Jews|Jewish]] father was released from a communist prison in Siberia where he was falsely accused of being a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] Spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ariel.org/about/dr-fruchtenbaum|title=About Dr. Fruchtenbaum|website=www.ariel.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the family returned to Poland and lived in the Jewish ghetto where Fruchtenbaum had his first encounter with the name of Jesus during an encounter with a mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/finding-messiah-a-hasidic-jew-a-missionarys-daughter-and-a-bit-of-calvinistic-luck-107840/|title=Finding Messiah: A Hasidic Jew, a Missionary's Daughter, and a Bit of Calvinistic 'Luck'|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, by means of the Israeli underground who bribed border guards, the family escaped to Czechoslovakia. But then a year later, after the communists seized power in Czechoslovakia, the family posed as Greeks and escaped from behind the [[Iron Curtain (countermeasure)|Iron Curtain]] to [[West Germany]]. There, the Fruchtenbaums were kept in [[British Displaced Persons' Camps]] where Henry Fruchtenbaum taught his son the traditions of [[Orthodox Judaism]] and where their family came in contact with a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister and his daughter who visited the camp to bring food and clothing. This minister would eventually connect Fruchtenbaum and his mother with the [[Chosen People Ministries|American Board of Missions to the Jews]] (ABMJ; today, [[Chosen People Ministries]]) in New York and greatly influence Fruchtenbaum becoming a [[Messianic Jewish theology|Messianic Jew]]. Fruchtenbaum and the family then moved to New York in 1951 where they lived in a Jewish section of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellis|first=Mark |title=Finding Messiah: A Hasidic Jew, a Missionary's Daughter, and a Bit of Calvinistic 'Luck'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/finding-messiah-a-hasidic-jew-a-missionarys-daughter-and-a-bit-of-calvinistic-luck-107840/ |accessdate=9 October 2015 |work=[[Christian Post]] |date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, Fruchtenbaum came to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah]] after attending Hebrew-Christian meetings with [[Chosen People Ministries]]. But his father opposed Fruchtenbaum's faith and forbade him to read the Bible, attend meetings, or otherwise meet with Messianic Jews. The family moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ariel.org/about/dr-fruchtenbaum|title=About Dr. Fruchtenbaum|website=www.ariel.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 after being forced to leave the family home because of his faith, Fruchtenbaum began his college education at [[Shelton College]] in [[New Jersey]] until 1965. He then transferred to [[Cedarville College]] in [[Ohio]] where he graduated with a BA degree in [[Hebrew language |Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] in 1966. He then moved to Israel where he studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew in his graduate studies at the [[American Institute of Holy Land Studies]] and the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faculty |publisher=Pasche Institute |url=http://www.pascheinstitute.org/faculty.html |accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he witnessed the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. 

Later that year, Fruchtenbaum returned to the U.S. and entered [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] to continue his studies in Hebrew and the Old Testament. He also began working as a minister with [[Chosen People Ministries]] in Dallas, Texas until 1971. On June 29, 1968, Fruchtenbaum married Mary Ann Morrow, a graduate of [[Gordon College (Massachusetts)|Gordon College]] in Massachusetts. Three years later (1971), he graduated with a Master of Theology degree from Dallas Theological Seminary. He and his wife then moved to Jerusalem, Israel and settled in Jerusalem to work with a local church and train young Israeli Jewish believers for Christian service. Because of their work, however, religious authorities in Jerusalem pressured the Fruchtenbaums to leave after working at the [[Messianic Assembly]] for three years in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ariel.org/about/dr-fruchtenbaum|title=About Dr. Fruchtenbaum|website=www.ariel.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the two years following, Fruchtenbaum served as a minister and as editor of "The Chosen People," a monthly publication with [[Chosen People Ministries]] in New Jersey and the same publication that the Lutheran minister shared with him in West Germany. Then in 1976 he joined the staff of [[The Christian Jew Foundation]] in San Antonio, Texas as associate director for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ariel.org/ariel-fruchtenbaum.htm Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum, Founder and Director, Ariel Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruchtenbaum originally was of the view that Jewish converts should attempt to integrate with local Gentile congregations, but later came to regard separate Jewish congregations as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America |editor1-first=Eugene V |editor1-last=Gallagher |editor2-first=W Michael |editor2-last=Ashcraft |contribution=Messianic Judaism |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Messianic Jewish congregations, Dr. Fruchtenbaum has written, the leader should not have the title 'Rabbi'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stern |first=David H |year=1992 |title=Jewish New Testament Commentary |place=Clarksville, MD |publisher=Jewish New Testament Publications |page=68 |ISBN=965-359-008-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time he struggled with the issue of discipleship and perceived a need for biblical and theological training for Jewish Messianic believers. This was discussed with other leaders and this turned into the ideas for [[Ariel (name)|Ariel]] Ministries. In late 1977, Ariel Ministries, based in San Antonio, Texas, was established with the mission to "evangelize and disciple our Jewish brethren."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ariel.org/home|title=Intensive Bible Teaching from a Messianic Jewish Perspective {{!}} Ariel Ministries|website=www.ariel.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruchtenbaum is the founding director of Ariel Ministries and continues in this role and as a speaker at conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ariel.org/ariel-fruchtenbaum.htm Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum, Founder and Director, Ariel Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

He travels internationally throughout Europe, Israel and the United States. This has given him a broad knowledge of the messianic movement. He completed his doctoral dissertation, ''Israelology: The Missing Link in Systematic Theology'' at New York University in 1989.&lt;ref name=HJiC&gt;{{cite web|title=How Jewish is Christianity |type=book page |publisher=Zondervan |url=http://www.zondervan.com/how-jewish-is-christianity |accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruchtenbaum has published a number of books and recorded many biblical studies.

==Ariel Ministries==
Fruchtenbaum is the founder and director of Ariel Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dr. Fruchtenbaum |url=https://www.ariel.org/about/dr-fruchtenbaum |website=Ariel Ministries |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariel Ministries was created on December 1, 1977, in San Antonio, Texas to evangelize and disciple Jewish Christians while emphasizing the importance of Bible doctrine and theology. Their name, "Ariel," means "Lion of God" in reference to Messiah Yeshua as the Lion of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ariel.org/about/ariel-ministries-history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariel Ministries has branches in Australia, Canada, Germany, Hungary, India, Israel, New Zealand, and the United States and partners with Gafen International and Messiah Comes.

==Theology==
Fruchtenbaum is a [[Messianic Jewish theology|Messianic Jew]] who believes that the [[bible]] is inspired by the Word of [[God in Christianity|God]] and is inerrant and is the authority in all things related to faith and practices and all of which it speaks. He believes in the full deity of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

His theology is largely traditional [[Dispensationalism|dispensational]] with some variation only in detail. The [[Eschatology|eschatological]] viewpoint retains a role for Israel and Jewish believers in his view of future theology.&lt;ref name="AFDisp"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Munayer |editor1-first= Salim J. |editor2-last=Loden |editor2-first= Lisa |title= The Land Cries Out: Theology of the Land in the Israeli-Palestinian Context |location= Eugene, OR |publisher=Cascade Books |date=2011 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nf1MAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |page= 98 |isbn= 978-1-6109-7335-9 | accessdate= 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=Dispensationalism holds that God is faithful to keep His promises to the Jewish people... Dispensationalism makes the most sense biblically because it takes the Bible literally unless the text indicates otherwise, and that is a safe position to be in.

}}

Fruchtenbaum continues to teach based on what some call a "[[Midrash|Midrashic]] Hermeneutic", his particular focus is on the Judaic background of the Gospels.&lt;ref name= CMMidHerm&gt;{{cite web| first = Chuck | last = Missler |title= Midrash Hermeneutics |work= K house |url= http://www.khouse.org/articles/2001/341/ |access-date= 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Table_Emeraude_Chrysogonus.jpg|thumb|Chrysogonus Polydorus's Latin version of the ''Emerald Tablet'' text, containing the phrase.]]

'''"As above, so below"''' is an [[aphorism]] associated with [[Sacred geometry]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Baphomet]], and the [[The Magician (Tarot card)|Tarot]].

The phrase derives from a passage in the ''[[Emerald Tablet]]'' (variously attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] or Pseudo-[[Apollonius of Tyana]]). The 16th-century scholar [[Chrysogonus Polydorus]] provides the following version translated from the original Arabic into Latin:

{{quote|Quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius. Et quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius, ad perpetranda miracula rei unius.}}

In Hermeticism, the phrase can be taken to indicate that earthly matters reflect the operation of the [[astral plane]], particularly "by other means than mundane chains of cause and effect, such as [[Synchronicity|Jungian synchronicities]] or correspondences."&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Amir. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DI9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 Rethinking Philosophers' Responsibility]''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a secular context, the phrase can refer to the idea that [[macrocosm and microcosm|the microcosm reflects the macrocosm]] – for example, that individual or domestic ills can result from larger societal ills.

''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'', intended as a "version of the [[New Testament]] in a contemporary idiom",&lt;ref name="bible-researcher"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the New Testament, from The Message |url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/themessage.html |accessdate = 2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the maxim in its translation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] from [[Matthew 6:10]]. (The prayer's phrase is traditionally rendered "on earth, as it is in heaven".)

{{poemquote|Our Father in heaven,
Reveal who you are.
Set the world right;
Do what's best – '''as above, so below'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A7-13&amp;version=MSG;KJV |title=''The Message'', Matthew 6:7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Auguste Dreyfus''' (28 June 1827 – 25 May 1897) was a French [[businessman]] who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in [[guano]].{{efn|The cold [[Humboldt Current]] runs north along the coast of Peru and is rich in fish. It provides food for a huge population of seabirds. The climate is warm and dry, and bird droppings accumulate to great depth, particularly on the [[Chincha Islands]]. The guano deposits had great value as fertilizer and played a central role in the Peruvian economy for most of the 19th century.{{sfn|Hollett|2008|p=24}} }} Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe.
With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income.

The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art.

==Early years==
[[File:Wissemourg7.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Wissembourg]], where Dreyfus was born]]
Auguste Dreyfus was born into a Jewish family in [[Wissembourg]], Bas-Rhin, on 28 June 1827.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
He was the tenth of twelve children of the merchant Edward Dreyfus (1788–1866) and his wife Sara Marx (1791–1865). 
He was the youngest of their seven boys.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}

On 29 August 1852 Auguste's brothers Prospere, Jérome and Isidore started Dreyfus Frères &amp; Cie.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
This was a small company in Paris trading in fabrics and other commodities.
Auguste Dreyfus joined the company in 1856.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
By 1859 Auguste Dreyfus, now residing in Peru, had become a minority partner.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste began trading in guano, and quickly became wealthy through careful attention to the fluctuations in the global demand for the commodity.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}

Prospere and Jérôme retired from the business in 1864 and Isidore in 1866.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}
Leon Dreyfus, who had moved to Peru and made influential connections, 
became a partner on 19 January 1866 and remained associated with Auguste until 1869.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste became respected in business circles on both sides of the Atlantic for his skill and the profitability of his enterprises.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}

===Dreyfus contract===
The government of [[Peru]] had been exploiting their guano reserves on a consignment system, in which the state paid contractors to extract, transport and sell it on a cost-plus basis. This  encouraged corruption and inefficiency. Contractors were motivated to overstate costs and sell at low prices in order to drive up volumes. By 1868 Peru had large and growing debts. In response to growing public criticism, the government chose a new approach. {{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=53}}
On 5 July 1869 the government cancelled all consignment arrangements and granted Dreyfus Frères the exclusive right to sell up to two million tons of guano in Europe.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus was to pay 50 ''soles''{{efn|In the 1860s a Peruvian ''sole'' was worth almost a dollar.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=198}} 50 soles was ₤7.6.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} }} per ton for the guano, a considerably higher price than the government had been receiving up to then.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

Auguste Dreyfus was backed by the [[Société Générale]] of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Bethell|2008|p=551}}
Dreyfus arranged for a partnership in which shares were issued with a nominal value of 60 million francs.  
Société Générale and the international trading house Leiden, Premsel &amp; Cie. both took 22.5 million francs while Dreyfus took 15 million.
Each of the major partners in turn distributed shares to subordinate partners.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
A private addendum to the contract stipulated that Dreyfus's choice of banker would handle Peruvian financial affairs in London.
He chose [[J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co.]], a bank of the City of London.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
Schroders would handle the bond issues of 1870 to 1872.

[[File:Nicolás de Piérola Presidente.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Nicolás de Piérola]], the finance minister who arranged the Dreyfus contract and subsequent loans]]
The royalty payments were to start in the early 1870s as the other contracts expired.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
In the meantime, Dreyfus would advance the government 2.4 million soles per year and 700,000 soles monthly for the first twenty months.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The contract also included clauses through which his company would assume government debts to former guano contractors and foreign bondholders, 
charging the government 5% interest on this debt until it was paid off.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The total debt was 21 million soles. The agreement was ratified on 17 August 1869.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
The Minister of Finance, who arranged the deal, was [[Nicolás de Piérola]].{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

The former contractors did not have popular support but fought the contract, which had not been open to competition.
In November 1869 the Supreme Court said the contract should be cancelled since it had stripped Peruvian citizens of their rights.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156}}
The government rejected this ruling, saying it was for the legislature to decide.
In November 1870 the Chamber of Deputies approved the contract by 63 votes to 33, 
and the Senate ratified the decision soon after.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156-157}}

===Government loans===

The income provided by the Dreyfus contract was absorbed in payments to an expanding civil service and armed forces.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57}}
Rather than reduce debts or invest in urgently needed schools or irrigation projects, Pierola used the income from the contract as collateral for additional loans, 
which President [[José Balta]] used for an ambitious plan promoted by [[Henry Meiggs]] to build railways in the mountainous [[Andes]] country.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Dreyfus arranged to float these loans in Europe, one in 1870 for ₤12 million of 6% bonds sold at 82.5% of face value, 
and a second in 1872 of 5% bonds sold at 77.5% of face value.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57-58}}
Peru had hoped to sell almost ₤37 million of the 1872 bonds, but investors were concerned about the country's ability to serve its soaring debts, and there were rumors that the guano supplies were running out.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus and his associates bought most of the ₤22 million that was issued, paying just ₤13 million.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}
By 1872 almost all of the government's guano revenue was going to debt interest payments, and the deficit was running at 50%.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=58}}

[[File:Mpardol.png|thumb|240px|[[Manuel Pardo]], President of Peru (1872–1876), who inherited the debt crisis]]
The public saw no return from the railway projects, and in May 1872 elected [[Manuel Pardo]] as President, a popular former mayor of Lima. An attempted coup d'état before Pardo took power did not succeed.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Pardo inherited a financial crisis. The best-quality and most accessible gauno had already been extracted, so prices were falling and costs rising.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=19}}
Pardo reduced the size of the army by three-quarters and canceled two orders for battleships from Britain, 
but continued the railway construction program.{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=437}}
He allowed Dreyfus to continue with the last bond issue, which proved a failure. Only ₤8.3 million was raised, one quarter of what had been hoped.
The money mainly went to paying Dreyfus and refinancing debts.{{sfn|Cushman|2013|p=68}}

Dreyfus now began suffering from the declining quality of the remaining [[guano]] and from competition with artificial [[fertilizer]] manfuctured in Germany. In November 1873 Dreyfus announced that he no longer had enough income to service Peru's [[foreign debt]]. The government responded by withdrawing Dreyfus's permit to ship guano, and stated that bondholders of the two loans had first claim on Peruvian guano, ahead of Dreyfus.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}} 
The government threatened to sue Dreyfus in Europe if he failed to meet his payments on the loans. An agreement was reaching in April 1874 under which Dreyfus could export another 850,000 tons of guano, the remainder of the 2 million tons agreed in the contract, and Dreyfus would continue to service the foreign debt until 1 July 1875. Dreyfus would also advance cash to the government based on the gross value of the guano extracted.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}

===Later operations===

On 1 January 1876 the Peruvian government defaulted on payments on its foreign debt.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34-35}}
Peru reserved 100,000 tons of gauno as security for the payments they had missed.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}} 
In March 1876 a new contract for guano sales was agreed with the Peruvian Guano Company, formed by the London merchant bank [[Raphaels Bank|Raphael &amp; Sons]], and the Peruvians Carlos Gonzales Candamo and Arturo Heeren.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=169}}
On 31 March Peru concluded a contract with the Société Générale of Paris for the sale of guano.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}}
Manuel Pardo's presidency ended among growing economic problems compounded by civil unrest and a brewing crisis with Chile. He was succeeded by General [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]], to whom he had lent his support.{{sfn|Masterson|1991|p=67}}
One of Prado's first acts was to travel to London, where on 7 June 1876 he signed an agreement by which Peru sold 1,900,000 tons of guano to Raphael's consortium.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}

The Dreyfus contract expired on 31 October 1876, leaving Dreyfus Brothers with about half a million tons of unsold guano.
It was expected to take until mid-1878 to clear this inventory.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}
The competing Peruvian Guano Company was handicapped by terms that favored Peru, and until 1879 was not allowed to sell at competitive prices. 
Dreyfus had large stocks of higher-quality guano, and continued to dominate the global market.
The Peruvian Guano Company's bondholders tried to sue Dreyfus for a share of his guano revenue, but did not succeed.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}}

In February 1879 the [[War of the Pacific]] broke out between Chile and Bolivia with Peru. One of the causes was the 1875 nationalization by Peru of nitrate production facilities in [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá province]], many of them owned by Chilean companies.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}} Chile quickly seized control of the main ports through which guano was exported and also Tarapacá, a key source of guano as well as of nitrates.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}} By late 1879 the Peruvian government still owed Dreyfus £4 million, secured by the country's remaining reserves of guano.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=146}}
In December 1879 President Prado left Peru and was replaced by Nicolás de Piérola. In January Piérola and Dreyfus agreed on a new contract under which the government recognized a debt to Dreyfus of 21 million soles, or ₤4 million, to be recovered by Dreyfus through further sales of guano. Dreyfus was to export only to markets that were not being served by the Peruvian Guano Company. The British protested against the agreement, but were not supported by the French.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=210}}

On 30 June 1880 a new agreement was made between Peru and Dreyfus to consolidate its debt. Peru would give up control of its railways for twenty five years and pay Dreyfus £3,214,388. About the same time, the Chilean government agreed to give the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company the right to export guano from the occupied territories.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=216}}
Chile occupied Lima in January 1881, effectively deciding the war, although a guerrilla struggle continued.{{sfn|Castillo-Feliú|2000|p=52}}
On 9 February 1882 a new agreement was made with Chile in which that country would sell one million tons of guano from Tarapacá to the highest bidder, with half the profit going to creditors of Peru whose claims were secured by the guano, including Dreyfus. Chile probably made this concession to avoid intervention by the creditor governments.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=219}}
The [[Treaty of Ancón]], signed on 20 October 1883, ended the war. Chile acquired Tarapacá permanently.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}}

[[File:Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau by Nadar.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]], who defended Dreyfus and was named as the executor of his will]]
In the years that followed Dreyfus, the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company and other creditors, sometimes backed by the French or British governments, 
made conflicting claims against Chile and Peru with limited success.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=220ff}}
Dreyfus chose Waldeck-Rousseau, a prominent Republican who had been Minister of the Interior in 1884, as his advocate in his case against the Société Générale, formerly his partner.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=511}}{{sfn|Mayeur|2003|p=224}}

==Personal life==

===Family and friends===

Dreyfus converted to Catholicism shortly before his marriage in Lima with the Peruvian Sofia Bergman on 15 August 1862.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}
His wife's brothers, Charles and Frederick Bergman, won a contract in August 1869 to build and run dock facilities in the port of [[Callao]], which they sold to the Société Générale in 1874. Sofia Bergman died in Lima in 1871.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=164}}
Dreyfus married his second wife in Lima on 8 January 1873.
Luisa González Orbegoso (1847–1924), Marquise de Villahermosa, was granddaughter of Marshal [[Luis José de Orbegoso]], one of the first presidents of the Republic of Peru.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}}

Two sons and two daughters were born of Dreyfus's second marriage. Louis Dreyfus (1874–1965), was successively authorized by decree of 12 August 1885 to call himself Dreyfus-Gonzalez de Andia, then in 1925 by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], to assume – contrary to the Spanish noble usage – the title of his mother, who died a year before, and finally, by decree of 26 July 1935, to remove Dreyfus from his name.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
Louis married Félicie de Talleyrand-Périgord, daughter of Archambaud de Talleyrand-Périgord and Marie de Gontaut-Biron.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
[[Édouard Dreyfus Gonzalez]] (1876–1941) was a lawyer and Count of Premio Real. He wrote songs under the name Jean Dora.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
He married Anne-Hélène de Talleyrand-Périgord, sister of Félicie.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Emilie Dreyfus married the viscount, banker and politician [[Hervé de Lyrot]].{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Her sister married René de Lyrot.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}

Dreyfus was described in 1886 as having great vigor and agility, despite being somewhat overweight.
He was a good friend of the President of France, [[Jules Grévy]].{{sfn|Tavernier|1886|p=300}} 
Grévy supported Dreyfus in his claims against Peru.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=204}}
Despite his conversion, Dreyfus was a target of anti-Semites such as [[Édouard Drumont]] in his 1888 polemic ''La France juive'' (Jewish France).{{sfn|Read|2012|p=33-35}}
His children would also suffer from anti-semitism.{{sfn|Wieviorka|2009|p=35}}

Dreyfus died in Paris on 25 May 1897.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}

===Art collector===
[[File:Jouars-Pontchartrain Château.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Château de Pontchartrain]], which Dreyfus purchased in 1888]]
In November 1874 Dreyfus bought an imposing neo-classical hotel at 3 Rue Ruysdael.
There he accumulated an extraordinary art collection, which he inventoried in detail in 1887.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=152}}
Dreyfus showed objects in the Peru pavilion at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] in Paris, including furniture encrusted with pearls and objects of art. He also sent three mummies from Peru to the Paris Anthropological society in 1878.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
In June 1888 Dreyfus bought the domain of the [[Château de Pontchartrain]] from Count [[Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck]].{{sfn|Rounding|2004|p=282}}
In 1891 the architect [[Émile Boeswillwald]] was given the task of restoring the chateau.{{sfn|Paris et Ile-de-France 1979|p=263}}

In June 1889 Dreyfus sold 116 items from his collection, realizing 861,000 francs.{{sfn|Appletons' Annual Cyclopedia 1890|p=320}}
In June 1896 the Dreyfus-Gonzalez collection was sold at public auction in Paris, and included among other valuables four candelabra called "the sirens and garlands of leaves" (c. 1783–1784) attributed to the great bronze sculptor [[François Remond]] and coming from a series of six that were part of the furniture of the Parisian hotel of the second Duke of Praslin (1735–1791), which were acquired by the Duke of Hamilton. They were sold to Dreyfus in 1882.{{sfn|La Gazette de l'Hotel Drouot|p=62-63}}

[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;The emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Christianity and Theosophy''', for more than a hundred years, have had a "complex and sometimes troubled" relationship.{{sfn|Ellwood}} The [[Christianity|Christian]] faith was always the native religion of the great majority of Western [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], but many came to Theosophy through a process of examination or even opposition to Christianity. According to professor [[Robert S. Ellwood]], "the whole matter has been a divisive issue within Theosophy."{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{refn|group=note|Gregory Tillett, a religious studies scholar, claimed in his dissertation, "The relationship of Theosophy to Christianity was never straightforward."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=991}}}}

== Beliefs ==
=== God ===
According to the Theosophical spiritual [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Teachers]],{{refn|group=note|[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]] wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} neither their philosophy nor themselves believe in a [[God in Christianity|God]], "least of all in one whose pronoun necessitates a capital H."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=52|Дружинин|2012|2p=42}}

A [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox cleric]] and theologian Dimitry Drujinin cited the Theosophical Master [[Kuthumi]]:{{quote|"We know there is in our [solar] system no such thing as God, either personal or impersonal. [[Para Brahman|Parabrahm]] is not a God, but absolute immutable law... The word 'God' was invented to designate the unknown cause of those effects which man has either admired or dreaded without understanding them."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=52|Дружинин|2012|2pp=42, 45}}}}

A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote that Theosophist [[Annie Besant]] believed:{{quote|"God is a composite photograph of the innumerable [[gods]] who are the personifications of the forces of nature... It is all summed up in the phrase: Religions are branches from a common trunk—human ignorance."{{sfnm|Besant|1902|1p=8|Kuhn|1992|2p=145}}}}

In addition the Master Kuthumi said,{{quote|"In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}{{refn|group=note|It is nonsense, when theologian Martin proclaims that Theosophy "equates [[God the Father]] with the pagan gods Buddha (?!) and [[Vishnu]]."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=295}}}}}} An American Methodist theologian [[Henry C. Sheldon]] wrote that, according to [[Helena Blavatsky]], Theosophists reject "the idea of a personal, or an extra-cosmic and anthropomorphic God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=61|Sheldon|1916|2p=47}} Concerning this, Drujinin stated that Theosophy in its basis "rejects and hates the name of God."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=48}} An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," cited her article in which she wrote that the Bible is not the "word of God" but contains at best the "words of fallible men and imperfect teachers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960a|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}}

In ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' Helena Blavatsky stated that "an ''extra''-cosmic god is fatal to philosophy, an ''intra''-cosmic Deity — ''i.e.'' [[Spirit]] and matter inseparable from each other — is a philosophical necessity. Separate them and that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask of emotionalism."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=41}}{{sfn|Ellwood}} Professor Santucci wrote that she has defined the Supreme in the Proem to ''The Secret Doctrine'' as an "Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable '''[[Para Brahman|Principle]]''' on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=14|Kuhn|1992|2p=199|Santucci|2012|3pp=234–235}} John Driscoll, a theologian and author of ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]],'' wrote in 1912 that Theosophy denies a [[personal god]], and this "nullifies its claim to be a spiritualistic philosophy."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=628}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky was refusing to accept God as the personality.{{sfn|Кураев|2002}}}} Blavatsky proclaimed that the Theosophists believe "in the Deity as the '''All''', the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing ''It,'' or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is ''blasphemy''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967a|1p=91|Movement|1951|2p=72}}

Professor Mary Bednarowski wrote that Theosophists "see the [[Absolute (philosophy)|One]] as the cause of the universe," but not as its creator. When asked who it is that created the universe, Blavatsky responded that, "No one creates it. Science would call the process evolution; the pre-Christian philosophers and the Orientalists call it emanation; we, [[Occult]]ists and Theosophists, see in it only the universal and eternal ''reality'' casting a reflection of ''itself'' on the infinite Spatial depths."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=84|Bednarowski|1989|2p=36}} A Russian Christian philosopher [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote that in the Theosophical books "the name of God is not mentioned."{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|Theologian Drujinin wrote that Berdyaev noted, "In the contemporary Theosophy it is difficult to find a teaching about God."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=41}}}} Other Christian philosopher from Russia [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] stated that Blavatskian Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious," but also "anti-scientific" and "antiphilosophic."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=397}}{{refn|group=note|According to professor [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff]], Blavatskian Theosophy is "an example of [[Comparative Religion]] on occultist premises, developed with the express intention of undermining established Christianity."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1998|p=443}}}}

=== Jesus ===
{{See also|The Esoteric Character of the Gospels#Historical Jesus}}
An American theologian [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] wrote that Theosophy "ignores completely the true nature, person, and work of the [[Lord Jesus Christ]]."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=296}} According to Blavatsky, Jesus was the grand "philosopher and moral reformer."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=150|Purucker|1998|2p=1}} She considered Jesus as "The Great Teacher," an [[Avatar]] with healing and demon-exorcising abilities. An American author Joseph H. Tyson stated, "She did not view him as The Second Person of the [[Blessed Trinity]], but a [[Brahmin|Brahman]] Perfect [[Master Jesus|Master]]" with [[clairvoyance]], [[siddhi|supernatural powers]], and "fakir-like unconcern for the morrow."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=553|Tyson|2006|2p=213}} In Blavatsky's opinion, "Jesus, the Christ-God, is a myth concocted two centuries after the real Hebrew Jesus died."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=544|Сенкевич|2012|2p=298}} According to Theosophy, term "Christ" means the personal divinity "indwelling" each individual human.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=3}} An author of the journal of Christian theology ''[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]]'' James Skeen, defending Christianity, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Theosophy sees Jesus Christ in a [[Docetism|docetic]] way. The Christ Spirit used the body of a holy man named Jesus to heal, work occult wonders, and teach the inherent divinity of all men, within the overall plan of evolution. Christianity sees Jesus Christ as the God-man—The Son of God and the Son of Man. It is called the [[hypostatic union]] of Deity and humanness."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{refn|group=note|According to Berdyaev, Theosophy separates Jesus from Christ and so "denies Christ the God-man."{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=180}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In December 1887 Blavatsky printed in ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' an open letter to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the Lord Primate of England. This editorial letter gave proof to show that "in almost every point the doctrines of the churches and the practices of Christians are ''in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus.''"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960b|1p=270|Movement|1951|2p=131|Крэнстон|1999|3p=408}} She always opposed those who understood Jesus' teaching literally.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1960a|p=208}}{{refn|group=note|Professor Williams wrote that one should not understand literally the words of Jesus, "I am [[Via et veritas et vita|the Way, the Truth, and the Life]]." ([[John 14]].6) He speaks here, not as a historical character, but as "the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|divine light]], the light presumably known to all the wise sages of every age."{{sfn|Williams|2001}}}} Her represent of Jesus as an equal of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] "grated on Christian nerves."{{sfn|Tyson|2006|p=210}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote that Mahachohan, the great [[mahatma|Adept]], wrote that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|seventh principle]] of man is being named some as Christ, others as Buddha.{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|1919|p=7}}}} Martin proclaimed that the [[resurrection of Jesus Christ]] "and, for that matter, the resurrection of all mankind leave no room for the Theosophical dogma of concurrent [[reincarnation]]s."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=295}} [[Alexander Men]], a Russian Orthodox priest and theologian, stated that the "theosophical pseudo-Christology" became the fulfillment of Christ's prophecy of false messiahs and false prophets who will come to seduce the world. Also Men noted the "anti-Church and anti-Christian nature" of Theosophy.{{sfn|Мень|2002}}

=== Prayer ===
Drujinin wrote that to the question, "Do you believe in [[prayer]], and do you ever pray?" Blavatsky answered: "We do not. We ''act,'' instead of ''talking.'' &lt;...&gt; The visible universe depends for its existence and phenomena on its mutually acting forms and their laws, not on prayer or prayers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=66|Дружинин|2012|2p=122}} Negating the personality of God, Blavatsky "rules out the propriety of prayer, except in the sense of an internal command."{{sfn|Sheldon|1916|p=49}} She said, "We call our 'Father in heaven' that deific essence of which we are cognizant within us."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1889|p=67}} According to Bednarowski, in Blavatsky's opinion, prayer kills "self-reliance" and "refutes the Theosophical understanding of divine immanence." She stated, "We try to replace fruitless and useless prayer by meritorious and good-producing action."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=70|Bednarowski|1989|2p=66}}

A Russian religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] said that such "Theosophical surrogates" as concentration, [[meditation]], and [[intuition]] can not replace prayer, thus, "''Where there is no prayer there is no religion.''"{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=25}} Berdyaev wrote that the experience of "prayerful communication" with God, revealed to man by the Christian church, is not recognized by the Theosophical teaching. Prayer in Theosophy is only "one of the others forms of meditation."{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=185}} To prove Blavatsky's anti-Christianity, [[Andrey Kuraev]], a protodeacon of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and professor of theology, quoted ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nor, as just remarked, that a prayer is a petition. It is a mystery rather; an occult process by which finite and conditioned thoughts and desires, unable to be assimilated by the absolute spirit which is unconditioned, are translated into spiritual wills and the will... We refuse to pray to ''created'' finite beings―''i. e.,'' gods, [[saint]]s, [[angel]]s, etc., because we regard it as [[idolatry]]. We cannot pray to the [[Absolute (philosophy)|'''Absolute''']] for reasons explained before... [Christians] show Satanic pride in their belief that the Absolute or the Infinite, even if there was such a thing as the possibility of any relation between the unconditioned and the conditioned―will stoop to listen to every foolish or egotistical prayer."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1pp=68–71|Кураев|2000|2p=105}}{{refn|group=note|In Kuraev's opinion, Blavatsky was relating "critically-aggressively" to the church tradition.{{sfn|Кураев|2002}} Nevertheless, professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] claimed: "The Theosophical attitude toward religion can easily be oversimplified and misunderstood. Blavatsky and other classic Theosophical writers vehemently attacked whole colleges of theologians. Yet they also affirmed that a core of truth lies in all religions."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014a|p=159}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kuraev wrote that Blavatsky's "hypothesis" that God can not hear the prayers of people, and people "can not meet" with God, contradicts the most important thing in Christianity. Thus, she spreaded out her "failure" on all people.{{sfn|Кураев|2000|p=107}}

=== Сondition after death ===
Bednarowski wrote that Blavatsky objected to the Christian interpretations afterlife "because they are described as eternal." She stated that, "nothing is eternal and unchangeable."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=112|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} She said, "We believe in no hell or paradise as localities; in no objective hell-fires and worms that never die, nor in any Jerusalems with streets paved with sapphires and diamonds."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=138|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} [[René Guénon]] wrote that on the Theosophical "heaven" the condition of man  is such:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As to the ordinary mortal, his bliss in it is complete. It is an absolute oblivion of all that gave it pain or sorrow in the past incarnation, and even oblivion of the fact that such things as pain or sorrow exist at all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=148|Guénon|2004|2p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Concerning this matter, Drujinin stated that the Christian truths of the post-mortem existence of man are "incomparably superior the delusional fantasies of the founders of Theosophy."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=112}}

=== Karma and reincarnation ===
According to ''The Catholic Encyclopedia,'' the main Theosophical teachings are [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Karma is the law of ethical causation. {{quote|In the past incarnation the ego had acquired certain faculties, set in motion certain causes. The effect of these causes and of causes set in motion in previous incarnations and not yet exhausted are its karma and determine the conditions into which the ego is reborn.{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=628}}}}

Reincarnation is directly related to karma. James Skeen stated that the Theosophical teaching about karma and "its relation to forgiveness and faith" contradicts the Bible definitions of these important concepts.{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} ''Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs'' argues that the laws of karma and reincarnation "are really a doctrine of self salvation." And consequently there is no need for "Jesus Christ's substitutionary death for our sins," when the person, who offends, pays himself.{{sfn|Strohmer|1996}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Mahatma|Master]] [[Kuthumi]] wrote, "Though we may not say with the Christians, 'return good for evil' — we repeat with [[Confucius]] — 'return good for good; for evil — ''justice''.'"{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 85}}}}{{refn|group=note|Berdyaev stated that "Christianity is a religion of love, and not a religion of justice," therefore, for a true Christian, the law of karma is abolished.{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=185}} Opposed to the Christian doctrines of [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemption]] and punishment, Theosophy offers no remission for evil except "through myriads of reincarnations."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=287}} Theosophy offers no "living redeemer, no freedom from the power of sin."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=296}}}}

Blavatsky and other Theosophists believed that karma, the "unerring law of Retribution," is a system of penalty "as stern as that of the most rigid [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], only far more philosophical and consistent with absolute justice."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=140|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} Ellwood wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "Karma is an Absolute and Eternal law in the World of manifestation." Karma is the "impersonal force" which brings retribution for thoughts, words, and deeds of men without "destroy intellectual and individual liberty" in order to demonstrate that men must live with the consequences of their choices.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=305|Ellwood|2014a|2p=153}} A religious studies scholar Jeffrey D. Lavoie noted that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the [[soul]] "must purify itself through [[reincarnation|cyclic transmigrations]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=280|Lavoie|2012|2p=186}} Ellwood has quoted in ''The Secret Doctrine:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then, is the law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the same spiritual individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities. The latter are like the various costumes and characters played by the same actor."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=306|Ellwood|2014a|2p=153}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Drujinin stated that the concept of reincarnation fundamentally contradicts the most important [[dogma]]s of [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Moreover, he stated that there are good reasons to believe that the concept of reincarnation, bringed in Theosophy, was entered "by the inspiring it dark spiritual forces" for the preparation of an appearance of [[Antichrist]].{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=106, 107}} He wrote that the Theosophical doctrine of reincarnation denies the tragedy of death and glorifies it as a positive moment of the cosmic evolution. Depreciating "death, this doctrine thereby devalues life and reconciles man with any suffering and injustice."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=103}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, a Russian Christian philosopher [[Nikolay Lossky]] believed that "doctrine of reincarnation" is not contradicting Christian teaching.{{sfnm|Лосский|1992|1p=133|Aliaiev, Kutsepal|2018|2p=159}}}}

{{See also|Coulomb Affair}}
In September 1884 the Rev. George Patterson, a principal of [[Madras Christian College]], wrote about Blavatsky's occult [[paranormal|phenomena]]: "What if these signs and wonders are proofs of something very different?... Instead of a message from [[mahatma|beings of supernal wisdom and power]], we shall have only the private thoughts of a clever but not over scrupulous woman."{{sfn|Patterson|1884|p=200}}{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=132}} The anti-Theosophical publications in ''The Madras Christian College Magazine'' in September 1884 were made by the time of arrival of [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], an expert of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], aimed at studying the phenomena of Blavatsky.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=25}} The Committee of SPR, after analyzing and discussing Hodgson's research, came with reference to Blavatsky herself to the following conclusion published in December 1885: "For our own part, we regard her neither as the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar adventuress; we think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting impostors in history."{{sfnm|Hodgson|1885b|1p=207|Дружинин|2012|2p=25}} According to the Rev. George Patterson, "It is to these phenomena, and to the openly expressed antagonism of Theosophy to Christianity, that the rapid spread of the new cult in India is to be ascribed, and not to any system of positive doctrine."{{sfn|Patterson|1891}}{{refn|group=note|Washington wrote that Patterson, "Blavatsky's bitter enemy", hated Theosophy for its anti-Christian and anti-European orientation.{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=82}}}}

=== Spirit communication ===
{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Mediums and mediumship}}
Theologian Kuraev wrote that Theosophists' feature is [[spirit possession]]. If the usual scientific or philosophical book appears as a result of systematic and consistent reflections of its author, then the theosophical treatises are written as a "dictation of capricious spirits." A person-medium does not have power over the text that is "communicated" to him, he is not fully competent in its planning and word processing.{{sfn|Кураев|2000|p=39}}{{refn|group=note|In [[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich's]] opinion, ''The Secret Doctrine'' was created under dictation of the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] by the method of [[automatic writing]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=427}}}} In Drujinin's opinion, Theosophy preaches "reckless" communication with spirits. And the spirits who presented themselves as "teachers-mahatmas" can expel the disciple in general from his body. In confirmation, he quoted [[Ignatius Bryanchaninov]]: "The desire to see spirits, curiosity to learn something from them is a sign of the greatest folly and complete ignorance of the moral and active traditions of the Orthodox Church."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=144}} Theologian Martin noted that the Bible prohibits to practice a communication with spirits.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=263}} Nevertheless, in 1860 at Zadonsk, [[:ru:Исидор (Никольский)|Isidore]], the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, seeing the manifestations of Blavatsky's [[mediumship]], said: "Let not your heart be troubled by the gift you are possessed of, nor let it become a source of misery to you hereafter."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=108|Крэнстон|1999|2p=99}} According to Blavatsky, mediumship is the contrast of [[adept]]ship, because the medium is the "passive instrument of foreign influences, [while] the adept actively controls himself and all inferior potencies."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=588|Сенкевич|2012|2p=300}}

=== Demonization ===
Mersene Sloan, an editor and Bible teacher, called the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|theosophical initiation]] a process of "disguised" demonization, a "gross perversion" of the Christian regeneration.{{sfn|Sloan|1922|pp=135, 138}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The pupil [of Theosophy] becomes an Adept. This is one of many theosophic statements proving the end of the cult's endeavors to be the incarnation of demons in human beings. Of course, it is denied that the masters are demons, but the doctrines and practices of the cult prove them to be such, and such only. Some know it by actual contact with them... It is not, then, a matter of developing latent powers in man that Theosophy seeks, but the subjection of man to the invading powers of demons."{{sfn|Sloan|1922|pp=133–134}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drujinin argued that Theosophy seeks to "control the world" with the help of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Every Theosophist wants to achieve supernatural powers that "will elevated him above other people." The natural continuation of the absence of faith in the "true God" is that the Theosophist, who is a magic practitioner, "considers himself a god."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=120–121}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], an Indian philosopher, wrote that supernatural powers are "by-products" of the higher life and "obstacles to [[samadhi]]" of the [[yogi]]. Only "through the disregard" of these powers, he can gain the [[Moksha|liberation]].{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=367}}}} Drujinin summed up: "Exploring Theosophy, we came to the conclusion that such a muddled, contradictory and fantasy doctrine could had been created only by the mentally ill men!"{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=132}}

=== Satanism ===
The ministers of the Christian churches had related to the Theosophical Society as the "brood of the Evil one."{{sfn|Murphet|1975|p=216}} In 1879 Blavatsky wrote that the Christian Church called the Theosophists "infidel emissaries of [[Satan]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967b|1p=98|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Drujinin proclaimed, "The founders of Theosophy were actively fulfilling the task of their patron—[[Satan|Prince of Darkness]]."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=53}} The same way, Skeen declared that Blavatsky's teachings are of "[[Satanism|Satanic]] character."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}}} In theologian Kuraev's opinion, the Theosophists declared that there is no other God at all except [[Lucifer]]: "It is 'Satan who is the god of our planet and ''the only'' god,' and this without any allusive metaphor to its wickedness and depravity. For he is one with the [[Logos]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=234|Кураев|2000|2p=174}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to professor Julia Shabanova, an Ukrainian philosopher, in ''The Secret Doctrine,'' the interpretation of the definitions of ''Satan, Lucifer'' is fundamentally different from Christian declarations.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016}}}}

Ellwood has quoted in ''The Secret Doctrine:''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Satan represents metaphysically simply the ''reverse or the polar opposite'' of everything in nature. He is the 'adversary,' allegorically, the 'murderer,' and the great Enemy of ''all,'' because there is nothing in the whole Universe that has not two sides—the reverses of the same medal. But in that case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be called Satan with as much propriety as the Devil, since they are the ''adversaries'' of darkness, badness and ugliness.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=389|Ellwood|2014a|2p=161}}{{refn|group=note|"Satan of the [[exoteric]] Jewish and Christian books is a mere figment of the monkish theological imagination."{{sfn|Purucker|1999|loc=Satan}}}}{{refn|group=note|Doctor Kuhn wrote that Blavatsky used ancient lore to prove that in their esoteric meaning all the "old legends" of the Evil Ones and the Powers of Darkness refer to no "essentially evil" beings but to the Divine Wisdom of the Sons of Light who had have the principle of intelligence.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=212}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Confrontations ==
Drujinin noted that Blavatsky "personally took part in the armed struggle against the Roman Catholic Church."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=105}} In 1866 she was accompanying [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] on his expeditions. In 1867 she with the Italian volunteers "fought at [[Viterbo]] and then at [[Mentana]]" against French-[[Pope|Papal]] troops.

In 1880, [[Henry Olcott]] took it upon himself to restore true Sri Lankan Buddhism and "to counter the efforts of Christian missionaries on the island."{{refn|group=note|In 1880 Blavatsky and Olcott converted to Buddhism officially. (See here: [[Buddhism and Theosophy#The Founders of the Theosophical Society]].)}} In order to accomplish this aim, he adopted some of the methods of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries.{{sfn|PDB|2013}}{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=127}} An American scholar of religion [[Stephen Prothero]] stated that in Ceylon Olcott was performing "the part of the anti-Christian missionary."

Theologian Kuraev wrote that Blavatsky allegedly declared that the goal of the Theosophists "is not to restore Hinduism, but to sweep Christianity from the surface of the earth."{{sfnm|Кураев|2000|1p=26|Guénon|2004|2p=3}}{{refn|group=note|In her book ''[[Isis Unveiled]],'' Blavatsky compared "the results of [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and Christianity to the detriment of the latter."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=122}}}} Sylvia Cranston wrote that in Britain, the [[Church of England]] tried to ban the sale of ''Lucifer.''{{sfn|Крэнстон|1999|p=408}}{{refn|group=note|For the Christian churches, ''Lucifer'' was a "synonymous with Satan."{{sfn|Murphet|1975|p=213}}}} Rejecting the Christian accusations that the Theosophical Society is a "pioneer of the [[Antichrist]] and brood of the Evil one," Blavatsky wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury that it is "the practical helper, perchance the saviour, of Christianity."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960b|1p=283|Murphet|1975|2p=216}}{{sfn|Cranston|1993|loc=Ch. 6/6}}{{refn|group=note|This was after the publication of [[Hodgson Report]].

On December 2, 1994 the [[Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]] accepted the interdict ''On the Pseudo-christian Sects, Neopaganism, and Occultism,'' in which Blavatskian Theosophy was defined as an anti-Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Interdict}}{{sfn|Кураев|2002}} Thus, the Russian Theosophists who counted himself the Orthodox Christians were [[anathema|excommunicated]].{{sfn|Максимович|2001}} [[Franz Hartmann]], a prominent Theosophist, wrote on clerics as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every attack made upon the erroneous opinions and the selfishness of the church autocrats is misrepresented by the latter as an attack upon religion; not upon ''their'' religious views, but as an attack upon religion itself. Their church is their God, and the interests of the church are their religion; it is all the God and the religion they know; they can form no conception of a God without priestcraft, nor of a religion without church benefits."{{sfn|Hartmann|1909|p=150}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Modern Christian Theosophy ==
{{distinguish|Theosophy (Boehmian)}} 
In Ellwood's opinion, in addition to the Blavatsky-Olcott line in Theosophy, there was another, quasi-theosophical, attitude to Christianity. In addition to the anti-clerical line in Theosophy, "Christian/Catholic Theosophy" of [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]] and [[Edward Maitland|Maitland]] arose. In 1882 they published a book ''The Perfect Way, or the Finding of Christ,''{{sfn|Kingsford|1919}} which made a great impression on Besant. This book says on the liberation of spirit from matter, a [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] prefigured, after the mystery drama of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and Death of Christ, in His [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].{{sfn|Ellwood}}

In her book ''Esoteric Christianity'' Besant continued the Theosophical interpretation of Christianity.{{refn|group=note|Berdyaev wrote that in this book by Besant you can find a number of truths peculiar to the mystical understanding of Christianity, and that, compared to others, this book is less anti-Christian.{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=181}}}} In his article{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Skeen analyzed her book in detail: according to her, a "healthy religion must contain a secret element attainable only by the spiritual elite."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=2}} To prove that this secret element passed from Jesus to the Apostles, she cites [[Second Timothy]] 2:2. The verse reads: "The things that thou have heard from me ('teacher to pupil') among many witnesses, the same commit thou ('in a secret manner') to faithful men who shall be able to teach ('also in a secret teacher to pupil manner') others also."{{sfn|Besant|1902|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Besant named this esoteric knowledge the Greater Mysteries. The Lesser Mysteries meant the partial uncovering of the deep truths that must first be assimilated before entry into the Greater Mysteries. And Greater Mysteries can only be passed on "'from mouth to ear' as a pupil becomes qualified."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=ix}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} In Besant's opinion, a return to the esoteric Christianity of the early ages is "the only way to save Christianity's importance."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=40}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to Berdyaev, modern "theosophical sects" discredited the "glorious word Theosophia" and forced to forget about the existence of the "genuine Christian Theosophy."{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=175}} He wrote, "We ought to be re-united with the traditions of the theosophy and anthroposophy of [[Jakob Böhme|J.Boehme]], in truth with a Christian theosophy and anthroposophy. And moreover, even more deeply ought we to be re-united with the traditions of the esoteric, hidden Christianity."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}}}

According to Besant, the Christ is "more than the man Jesus."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=123}} She has three views of Christ: "the historical Christ, the mythic Christ, and the mystic Christ."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Skeen has quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Round this glorious Figure gathered the myths which united Him to the long array of His predecessors, the myths telling in allegory the story of all such lives, as they symbolise the work of the [[Logos]] in the Kosmos and the higher evolution of the individual human soul."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=140}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{refn|group=note|[[Henry C. Sheldon|Henry Sheldon]], professor of theology, wrote that Besant, praising Jesus in ardent words, "makes him a debtor to Eastern wisdom, of which he is assumed to have been a devoted student for many years."{{sfnm|Besant|1902|1p=129|Sheldon|1916|2p=36}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophical Christianity ==
In the post-Blavatsky works of Theosophists, the "earlier trenchant anticlericalism" is visibly lacking, and the attitude to Christianity is almost entirely positive. In particular, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Leadbeater]] demonstrated a new regard for "Catholic-type doctrine and worship, understood esoterically and theosophically." They also viewed Christ, "together with the church's seasons, festivals, and sacraments, as not only symbols of spiritual truth but also as means of transmitting transcendent energies." Large group of Theosophists entered the [[Liberal Catholic Church]], though some have been Anglicans and Roman Catholics.{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{refn|group=note|February 13, 1916 is regarded as "the foundation date" of the Church.{{sfn|Hooker}} "The first public services of the Church in Australia were held in Penzance Chambers in Sydney in April, 1917."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=610}}}} Ian Hooker, former Presiding Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Liberal Catholic Church arose from the sense of loss of many English theosophists whose new affiliation left them unwelcome in the churches where they had been worshiping, and from the endeavor of these people to find a place of Christian worship, along with freedom of interpretation, in the English branch of the European [[Old Catholic Church]]."{{sfn|Hooker}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The founding bishops of the Liberal Catholic Church were Theosophists [[J. I. Wedgwood]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] who were "actively involved" in the work of the Theosophical Society (Adyar). The doctrine of this Church offered an interpretation of Christianity in which "judgment and salvation after only one life," were substituted by liberation from the necessity for rebirth after many; and in which eschewal of the aftermath of sin "via the redemptive sacrifice of Christ," was substituted by the just and pedagogical receiving of results of whatever has been making in earlier incarnations under the "Law of Karma."{{sfn|Hooker}} The meaning of the rites of the Liberal Catholic Church was expounded in Leadbeater's book ''The Science of the Sacraments.''{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007}} The author's idea was to save the basic forms of traditional Christianity, but to put "new wine into its old wineskins." The "new wine" was the new nature of the Ancient Wisdom transmitted by the modern Theosophy. According to Ellwood, the Christian rite, "especially when well enacted and well supported by constructive thoughts on the part of all worshipers, creates thought-forms that are vessels and channels of the divine powers evoke by those exalted ideas."{{sfn|Ellwood|2000}}{{refn|group=note|In a book [[Thought-Forms (book)|''Thought-Forms'']]{{sfn|TForms|1901}} its authors have provided illustrated descriptions of the "subtle energies" that surround men. The subtle energies "activated and directed by Christian worship" surely correlate with the thought-forms.{{sfn|Ellwood|2014b|p=88}}}}

== Basis of mutual understanding ==
[[Stephan Hoeller]], a Regionary Bishop of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], noted that the including the nineteenth-century polemics materials in the modern Christianity-Theosophy dialogue "is not useful."{{sfn|Hoeller|2001}} David Bland, a member of the Theosophical Society since 1970, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the workshop recently [November 5–7, 2000] held to explore a greater interface between the Theosophical Society and the Christian tradition, it was recognized that some Christian faith tenets can indeed inhibit dialogue and create what may appear as in surmountable barriers to open exploration. As the participants in that workshop, members of the Society from various Christian backgrounds, worked through these issues, we identified our dilemma. Each of us recognized that dogmas, if accepted at face value, will continue to be a chasm, but we also realized that there are principles that can bridge that chasm. If one accepts the imperative of love, the interpretations that would divide can be placed to the side, and an atmosphere of love and understanding created."{{sfn|Bland}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Professor Ellwood, a religious studies scholar and Liberal Catholic priest, proclaimed that Christianity could be rebuilted to be consonant "with the deepest insights of Theosophy, and moreover become for some people a vehicle for the transmission of those insights and the powers latent in them."{{sfn|Ellwood|2000}} In his book ''The Cross and the Grail: Esoteric Christianity for the 21st Century'' Ellwood wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox liturgy]], a [[Catholicity|Catholic form]] of service, suggests the desire to make physically visible what is transpiring on the [[astral plane|astral]] and [[mental plane]]s by intentionally creating sacramental thought-forms that channel divine energy from the heart of God. The actual correspondence may not always be exact, since no human craft or art could completely reproduce the worlds of the inner planes; but the feeling of color, richness, and unity-in-diversity is there. In Eastern Orthodoxy, the often-concealed altar behind the ''[[iconostasis]],'' a screen covered with icons and pictures of saints, is like the innermost eternal realm of [[pneuma]], spirit, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]], the God within. This power seems to radiate through the saints with their luminous eyes as though they were beings in the heaven of the mental plane, or [[Devachan]]. As the service progresses with its mystical and unforgettable music, its richly-robed clergy moving with the slowness of ancient ritual, and its billowing clouds of incense, a dome of silvery-blue light that merges upward into gold is formed above the congregation, like the onion-shaped domes atop many Orthodox churches. The structure is so exalted that it barely touches the earth, and not all present are able to perceive it directly."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014b|p=94}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Daughters of Mary, Mother of Our Savior''' are a congregation of [[religious sisters]] founded in 1984 by [[Clarence Kelly|Father Clarence Kelly]]. The [[motherhouse]] and [[novitiate]] are located in [[Round Top, New York]], in the Catskill Mountains, with additional houses in [[Melville, New York]], and [[White Bear Lake, Minnesota]], where they operate schools and are involved in various forms of charity work. The congregation is currently lead by [[Superior General|Mother General]] Mary Bosco, and is associated with the [[sedevacantist]] [[Society of Saint Pius V]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abqjournal.com/79877/gallery-owner-didnt-cheat-nuns.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1984, shortly after he was expelled from the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] and founded the Society of Saint Pius V, Father Clarence Kelly (now Bishop Kelly) founded the Congregation of the Daughters of Mary, Mother of Our Savior.  Fourteen acres of property in the [[Catskill Mountains]] were designated to serve as the grounds for a novitiate and motherhouse. The novitiate opened its doors in the summer of 1984, and was named after [[St. Joseph]] in the likeness of [[St. Teresa of Avila]], who named her first foundation of the reformed [[Carmelites]] after St. Joseph. 

The congregation began with three [[novices]] and seven [[postulants]], but throughout the years has grown steadily. As of 2016, there were sixty-eight members in the community.

The convent in Melville, New York, was established on August 16, 1987. The sisters there teach at Saint Pius V School and assist with the needs of the parish. There are currently fifteen sisters assigned to this convent.

{{As of|2018|May}}, St. Joseph’s Convent in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, is the organization's newest foundation. In August 2003, five sisters moved into the convent attached to St. Anne’s Church and Academy to serve there as schoolteachers.

==Apostolate &amp; Works==
{{cquote|text=From the beginning of our inception, our first work as the Daughters of Mary is reparation to the Sacred Heart. The general purpose of religious life is common to all religious congregations, and that is the glory of God and the sanctification of the individual. The special purpose is the particular work done by the congregation. For a Daughter of Mary, the special purpose is to live every day with the particular intention of returning gratitude to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Sisters consecrate their lives and their work to the Sacred Heart. Every day we make a Holy Hour of reparation to the Sacred Heart in the presence of the Most Blessed Sacrament. On Thursday nights this hour is made between eleven o’clock and midnight. The principal intention of the Holy Hour is to seek to comfort Our Lord, Who during His Agony in the Garden felt so keenly the indifference of men. No matter how pressing are the duties of the Sisters, the Holy Hour is never set aside. It is our most important work. Every work done by the Daughters of Mary is done for the purpose of comforting the Sacred Heart of Jesus. To make a return of love to Our Lord, to make reparation for the ingratitude of men is the intention behind every deed and the very meaning of the life of a Daughter of Mary.|author=Daughters of Mary |source=[http://www.daughtersofmary.net/about-us/ About Us]}}

Though contemplation is fundamental to the religious life, few of the Daughters remain exclusively cloistered; most venture out into the community to provide services and maintain the self-sufficiency of the congregation. Many sisters teach and are secretaries at affiliated schools, some cook and take care of the houses where others teach, while still others visit and offer prayer to the residents of local nursing homes. At the Motherhouse, there are sisters who sew [[Religious habit|habits]], make [[vestments]], [[Sacramental bread|hosts]], and [[rosaries]], do book-binding and other necessary office work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daughtersofmary.net/faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Daughters of Mary v. LaSalle''==
In August 2008, the Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior and St Joseph’s Chapel said that art dealer Mark Zaplin, and Mark LaSalle, a New York State art appraiser, colluded to defraud them of $1.7 million they believe could have been obtained from selling ''Notre Dame des Anges'', an 1889 artwork by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] that depicts [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] standing in the clouds with the [[Christ Child]] surrounded by angels.&lt;ref name="Antiques2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.antiquesandthearts.com/catholic-sisters-lose-in-fraud-claim  |title=Catholic Sisters Lose In Fraud Claim |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2012 |website= |publisher=Antiques and the Arts Weekly |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Notredameanges W-A Bouguereau.png|thumb|right|''Notre Dame des Anges'' by William-Adolphe Bouguereau, 1889.]]
In the complaint filed in the [[New York Supreme Court]] that year, the Daughters, represented by New York City attorney Bruce Goldstone, said that LaSalle and Zaplin "intentionally, deliberately, wantedly, maliciously [and] with evil motive … perpetrated fraud" against the congregation.&lt;ref name="Antiques2012" /&gt;

In May, 2006, LaSalle sent a proposed purchase agreement to congregation founder Bishop Clarence Kelly. The $450,000 check was also sent to Bishop Kelly around this time. In response, Bishop Kelly explained that he had consulted an attorney and proposed several revisions to the terms of the agreement without adjusting the purchase price. The Daughters consulted a parishioner, Mr. Erdelyi, and independently researched the value of Bougureau paintings on the internet prior to the sale. LaSalle forwarded a revised agreement on June 20, 2006, which included Bishop Kelly's revision that a transfer would not occur until the $450,000 check was deposited. Bishop Kelly deposited the check in early August, 2006.&lt;ref name="Justia2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2011/2011-51737.html|title=Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior v. LaSalle|last=|first=|date=September 16, 2011|website=Justia|publisher=Albany County Supreme Court|access-date=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his deposition, Zaplin said that he spent an additional $45,000 to apply a lining to the back of the painting and for a frame. After arranging to have the painting displayed at the [[Dallas Museum of Fine Arts]] (although the painting remained in New York), Zaplin sold the painting in 2007 for $2.15 million through a Texas art dealer. After expenses, the net profit was distributed as follows: $150,000 to Paul Dumont, a third-party defendant, with LaSalle and Zaplin each receiving $750,000. Zaplin said that the distribution was only determined after the Texas sale.&lt;ref name="Justia2011" /&gt;

Goldstone said that LaSalle’s "lowball" appraisal, in concert with Zaplin’s “straw purchase,” constituted negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, express or implied warranty, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, deceptive business practices and violation of the penal law regarding stealing property. The requested wages for those causes of action, amounted to $1.75 million, plus $50 million in punitive damages.&lt;ref name="Antiques2012" /&gt;

The case went to jury trial in December 2011. Before Justice Michael C. Lynch of the [[New York Supreme Court|Albany County Supreme Court]] on January 6, 2012, closing arguments were presented to the jury after a brief hiatus during the New Year’s holiday. The case went to the jury on Monday, January 9, and by Monday afternoon the verdict came back that the two men on trial for "scamming" the Daughters of Mary, Mark Zaplin and Mark LaSalle, were found not guilty.&lt;ref name="Antiques2012" /&gt;

In [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]] and other countries of [[West Africa]], a '''fetish priest''' is a person who serves as a mediator between the spirit and the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zup7mk4bX00C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Fetish+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VJvmVJqfIOPd7gbOxYHgDg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Fetish%20priest&amp;f=false |title=Traditional Cures for Modern Conflicts: African Conflict "medicine" - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5L4An9lC3hwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Fetish+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VJvmVJqfIOPd7gbOxYHgDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Fetish%20priest&amp;f=false |title=Spellbound: Inside West Africa's Witch Camps - Karen Palmer - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=43NfZ1T5mPsC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Fetish+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SJnmVMPRGYTkUu-kAw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Fetish%20priest&amp;f=false |title=Ghana - Patricia Levy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetish priests usually live and worship their gods in enclosed places, called a fetish shrine. The fetish shrine is a simple mud hut with some kind of enclosure or fence around it. The priest or priestess (in the case of a female) performs rituals to consult and seek the favor from his gods in the shrine.  The rituals are performed with money, liquor, animals, and in some places, human sex slaves called [[Ritual servitude|trokosi]], fiashidi, or woryokwe.  The priest is usually chosen through "spiritual nomination of the shrine" through divination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3_lVjByR6r4C&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=Fetish+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SJnmVMPRGYTkUu-kAw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fetish%20priest&amp;f=false |title=Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide - Philip Briggs - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DRc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Fetish+priest&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SJnmVMPRGYTkUu-kAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Fetish%20priest&amp;f=false |title=A Historical Geography of Ghana - Kwamina B.

'''''Headley et al. v. Church of Scientology International et al.''''' was a court case filed in 2009 by [[Blown for Good|Claire and Marc Headley]] against the [[Church of Scientology International]] alleging that the organization had violated laws against [[human trafficking]] and violated their [[human rights]] during their time of employment in the [[Sea Org]]. The Federal District Court decided that [[ministerial exemption]] protected the Church of Scientology from litigation and dismissed the case.  The Headleys appealed. In 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the lower court's dismissal; it did not address the Constitutional issues of the trafficking and abuse claims (as had the lower court), but found the Headleys had produced little evidence for their claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/363459/9th-circ-junks-ex-scientologists-forced-labor-claims|title=9th Circ.

==History==
In 2009, Marc and Claire Headley sued the Church under the federal [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]]. In response, Church lawyers argued that the First Amendment prohibited the courts from considering "a forced labor claim premised upon&amp;nbsp;... social and psychological factors", because they concern "the beliefs, the religious upbringing, the religious training, the religious practices, the religious lifestyle restraints of a religious order."&lt;ref name="FBI2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/fbi-scientology-investigation-gets-a-fresh-witness-but-hits-a-legal/1270193|title=FBI Scientology investigation gets a fresh witness, but hits a legal roadblock|last1=Childs|first1=Joe|last2=Tobin|first2=Thomas C.|work=The Tampa Bay Times|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling==
The Church acknowledged that the rules under which the Headleys lived included a ban on having children, censored mail, monitored phone calls, needing permission to have Internet access and being disciplined through manual labor. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a ruling given in July 2012 that Marc Headley had been made to clean human excrement by hand from an aeration pond on the compound with no protective equipment, while Claire Headley was banned from the dining hall for up to eight months in 2002. She lost {{convert|30|lb|kg}} as a result of subsisting on protein bars and water. In addition, she had two abortions to comply with the [[Sea Org]]'s no-children policy. The Headleys also experienced physical violence from Scientology executives and saw others being treated violently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/breaking-news-headlines/20120724-church-of-scientology-two-former-ministers-lawsuit-loses-on-appeal.ece|title=CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY: Two former ministers' lawsuit loses on appeal|last=De Atley|first=Richard K.|work=Riverside Press-Enterprise|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726182628/http://www.pe.com/local-news/breaking-news-headlines/20120724-church-of-scientology-two-former-ministers-lawsuit-loses-on-appeal.ece|archivedate=July 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court found that the church enjoyed the protection of the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment, and that the "ministerial exemptions" in employment law prevented the government from interfering in the treatment of its ministers. The judge ruled that the First Amendment disallowed the courts from "examining church operations rooted in religious scripture". Bringing the Church to account for how it disciplined its members was "precisely the type of entanglement that the religion clauses prohibit."

Headley took the case to the US Court of Appeals, but the 9th Circuit agreed with the judgment of the lower court.  The Court cited evidence that showed Headleys were fully informed of the requirements of the Sea Org, had multiple opportunities to leave and did not, and had no problem leaving when they did.  The Court suggested that other claims might have withstood appellate review, had the Headleys brought them, such as assault, battery or "any of a number of other theories that might have better fit the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/marc-claire-headley-lawsuit_n_1700633.html Marc And Claire Headley Lose Forced Labor Lawsuit Against Church Of Scientology].&lt;/ref&gt;

As author of the Court's opinion, Judge [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain|Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain]] wrote:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "The act bars an employer from obtaining another's labor 'by means of' force, physical restraint, serious harm, threats or an improper scheme ... That text is a problem for the Headleys because the record contains little evidence that the defendants obtained the Headleys' labor 'by means of' serious harm, threats or other improper methods."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Court took note that the Headleys lived off base and had many opportunities to leave, but stayed of their own will.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Comment ==
Tampa lawyer Greg W. Kehoe, a 25-year Justice Department veteran, stated, "Here is a court saying, albeit in a civil situation&amp;nbsp;... that there is nothing improper with this type of conduct and no ill motive can be imbued to the church."

An FBI investigation of similar complaints against the Church was dropped around the same time as the lower court ruling in the Headley case, possibly because of it.&lt;ref name="FBI2" /&gt;  Former U.S. federal prosecutor Michael Seigel said of the ruling, "It's very straightforward. It's sweeping. And (it) doesn't seem to leave much room for hope of success on a criminal prosecution."&lt;ref name="FBI2" /&gt;

'''Helena Petrovna Blavatsky''' ({{lang-ru|Еле́на Петро́вна Блава́тская}}, ''Yelena Petrovna Blavatskaya''; {{OldStyleDate|12 August|1831|31 July}}{{spnd}}8 May 1891) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[occultist]], philosopher, and author who co-founded the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1875. She gained an international following as the leading theoretician of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] religion that the society promoted.

Born into an aristocratic Russian-German family in [[Dnipro|Yekaterinoslav]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Blavatsky traveled widely around the [[Russian Empire]] as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in Western esotericism during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1849 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India, claiming that during this period she encountered a group of spiritual adepts, the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]", who sent her to [[Shigatse]], [[Tibet]], where they trained her to develop a deeper understanding of the synthesis of religion, philosophy and science. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period in Europe. By the early 1870s, Blavatsky was involved in the [[Spiritualist]] movement; although defending the genuine existence of Spiritualist phenomena, she argued against the mainstream Spiritualist idea that the entities contacted were the spirits of the dead. Relocating to the United States in 1873, she befriended [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and rose to public attention as a spirit medium, attention that included public accusations of fraudulence.

In [[New York City]], Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society with Olcott and [[William Quan Judge]] in 1875. In 1877 she published ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', a book outlining her Theosophical world-view. Associating it closely with the esoteric doctrines of [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], Blavatsky described Theosophy as "the synthesis of science, religion and philosophy", proclaiming that it was reviving an "Ancient Wisdom" which underlay all the world's religions. In 1880 she and Olcott moved to India, where the Society was allied to the [[Arya Samaj]], a [[Hindu reform movement]]. That same year, while in [[Ceylon]] she and Olcott became, supposedly, the first people from the United States to formally convert to Buddhism. Although opposed by the British administration, Theosophy spread rapidly in India but experienced internal problems after [[Coulomb Affair|Blavatsky was accused]] of producing fraudulent paranormal phenomena. Amid ailing health, in 1885 she returned to Europe, there establishing the [[Blavatsky Lodge]] in [[London]]. Here she published ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a commentary on what she claimed were ancient Tibetan manuscripts, as well as two further books, ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' and ''[[The Voice of the Silence]]''. She died of [[influenza]].

Blavatsky was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan and plagiarist by critics. Her Theosophical doctrines influenced the spread of Hindu and Buddhist ideas in the West as well as the development of Western esoteric currents like [[Ariosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], and the [[New Age Movement]].

==Early life==

Developing a reliable account of Blavatsky's life has proved difficult for biographers because in later life she deliberately provided contradictory accounts and falsifications about her own past.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=xii–xiii}} Further, very few of her own writings authored prior to 1873 survive, meaning that biographers must rely heavily on these unreliable later accounts.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=23}} The accounts of her early life provided by her family members have also been considered dubious by biographers.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=xvi}}

===Childhood: 1831–49===

====Birth and family background====

[[File:Ekaterinoslav XIXth century.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of Yekaterinoslav—Blavatsky's birthplace—as it appeared in the early 19th century]]

Blavatsky was born as Helena Petrovna von Hahn in the Ukrainian town of [[Yekaterinoslav]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=8|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=2|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=5}} Her birth date was 12 August 1831, although according to the [[Julian calendar]] used in 19th-century Russia it was 31 July.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=8–9|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=5|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=34}} Immediately after her birth, she was [[Baptism|baptized]] into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=21|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=9}} At the time, Yekaterinoslav was undergoing a [[cholera]] epidemic, and her mother contracted the disease shortly after childbirth; despite the expectations of their doctor, both mother and child survived the epidemic.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=20–21|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=5|3a1=Сенкевич|3y=2010|3p=34}}

Blavatsky's family was aristocratic.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuhn|1y=1992|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Сенкевич|3y=2010|3p=17}} Her mother was Helena Andreyevna von Hahn (Russian: Елена Андреевна Ган, 1814–1842; née Fadeyeva), a self-educated 17-year-old who herself was the daughter of [[Princess Helene Dolgoruki|Princess Yelena Pavlovna Dolgorukaya]], a similarly self-educated aristocrat.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=2–3|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2pp=16–17|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=7–8}} Blavatsky's father was [[Peter Hahn|Pyotr Alexeyevich von Hahn]] (Russian: Пётр Алексеевич Ган, 1798–1873), a descendant of the German [[von Hahn]] aristocratic family, who served as a captain in the Russian Royal Horse Artillery, and would later rise to the rank of colonel.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=18–19|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=5–6|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=6|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=19}} Pyotr had not been present at his daughter's birth, having been in Poland fighting to suppress the [[November Uprising]] against Russian rule, and first saw her when she was six months old.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=20, 21|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=6|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=43}} As well as her Russian and German ancestry, Blavatsky could also claim French heritage, for a great-great grandfather had been a [[Huguenot|French Huguenot]] nobleman who had fled to Russia to escape persecution, there serving in the court of [[Catherine the Great]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=3–4|2a1=Сенкевич|2y=2010|2p=17}}

As a result of Pyotr's career, the family frequently moved to different parts of the Empire, accompanied by their servants,{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=9}} a mobile childhood that may have influenced Blavatsky's largely nomadic lifestyle in later life.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=10}} A year after Pyotr's arrival in Yekaterinoslav, the family relocated to the nearby army town of [[Romankovo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=21|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=10}} When Blavatsky was two years old, her younger brother, Sasha, died in another army town when no medical help could be found.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=23|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=11|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=10}} In 1835, mother and daughter moved to [[Odessa]], where Blavatsky's maternal grandfather Andrei Fadeyev, a civil administrator for the imperial authorities, had recently been posted. It was in this city that Blavatsky's sister [[Vera Zhelikhovsky|Vera Petrovna]] was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=26|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=11|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=10}}

====St. Petersburg, Poltava, and Saratov====

After a return to rural Ukraine, Pyotr was posted to [[Saint Petersburg]], where the family moved in 1836. Blavatsky's mother liked the city, there establishing her own literary career, penning novels under the pseudonym of "Zenaida R-va" and translating the works of the English novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] for Russian publication.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=27–28, 31|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=12–13|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=8, 10–11|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=46, 48}} When Pyotr returned to Ukraine circa 1837, she remained in the city.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=11}} After Fadeyev was assigned to become a trustee for the [[Kalmyk people]] of Central Asia, Blavatsky and her mother accompanied him to [[Astrakhan]], where they befriended a Kalmyk leader, Tumen.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=29–31|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=13–14|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=11–12|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4pp=50, 56–57}} The Kalmyks were practitioners of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and it was here that Blavatsky gained her first experience with the religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=13–14|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=11–12|3a1=Сенкевич|3y=2010|3p=50, 56–57}}

[[File:H.Hahn and H.Blavatsky.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of Blavatsky and her mother, titled "Two Helens (Helena Hahn and Helena Blavatsky)" 1844–1845]]

In 1838, Blavatsky's mother moved with her daughters to be with her husband at [[Poltava]], where she taught Blavatsky how to play the piano and organised for her to take dance lessons.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=31–32|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=15|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=12}} As a result of her poor health, Blavatsky's mother returned to Odessa, where Blavatsky learned English from a British governess.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=32|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=16–17|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=12|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=52}} They next moved to [[Saratov]], where a brother, Leonid, was born in June 1840.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=18|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=13|3a1=Сенкевич|3y=2010|3p=50}} The family proceeded to Poland and then back to Odessa, where Blavatsky's mother died of [[tuberculosis]] in June 1842, aged 28.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=34|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=23|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=13|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=54}}

The three surviving children were sent to live with their maternal grandparents in Saratov, where their grandfather Andrei had been appointed Governor of [[Saratov Governorate]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=35|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=25|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=13|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=56}} The historian [[Richard Davenport-Hines]] described the young Blavatsky as "a petted, wayward, invalid child" who was a "beguiling story-teller".{{sfn|Davenport-Hines|2011}} Accounts provided by relatives reveal that she socialized largely with lower-class children and that she enjoyed playing pranks and reading.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=14}} She was educated in French, art, and music, all subjects designed to enable her to find a husband.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=15}} With her grandparents she holidayed in Tumen's Kalmyk summer camp, where she learned horse riding and some [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lachman|1y=2012|1p=16|2a1=Сенкевич|2y=2010|2p=59}}

She later claimed that in Saratov she discovered the personal library of her maternal great-grandfather, Prince Pavel Vasilevich Dolgorukov (d. 1838); it contained a variety of books on esoteric subjects, encouraging her burgeoning interest in it.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=48|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=31, 35|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=2|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=19|5a1=Сенкевич|5y=2010|5p=116}} Dolgorukov had been initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the late 1770s and had belonged to the [[Rite of Strict Observance]]; there were rumors that he had met both [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] and the [[Count of St. Germain]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=2–3}} She also later stated that at this time of life she began to experience visions in which she encountered a "Mysterious Indian" man, and that in later life she would meet this man in the flesh.{{sfnm|1a1=Lachman|1y=2012|1p=17|2a1=Сенкевич|2y=2010|2p=78}} Many biographers have considered this to be the first appearance of the "Masters" in her life story.{{sfnm|1a1=Lachman|1y=2012|1p=17|2a1=Сенкевич|2y=2010|2p=79}}

According to some of her later accounts, in 1844–45 Blavatsky was taken by her father to England, where she visited London and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=43–44|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=43|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=18}} According to this story, in London she received piano lessons from the [[Bohemia]]n composer [[Ignaz Moscheles]], and performed with [[Clara Schumann]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=18}} However, some Blavatsky biographers believe that this visit to Britain never took place, particularly as no mention of it is made in her sister's memoirs.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=18}} After a year spent living with her aunt, Yekaterina Andreyevna Witte,{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=45–46|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=26}} she moved to [[Tiflis]], Georgia, where grandfather Andrei had been appointed director of state lands in [[Transcaucasia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=46–47|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=33|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=26}} Blavatsky claimed that here she established a friendship with Alexander Vladimirovich Golitsyn, a Russian Freemason and member of the [[Golitsyn family]] who encouraged her interest in esoteric matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=51–52|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=35|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=3|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=27–29|5a1=Сенкевич|5y=2010|5p=102}} She would also claim that at this period she had further paranormal experiences, [[astral projection|astral traveling]] and again encountering her "mysterious Indian" in visions.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=27}}

===World travels: 1849–69===

[[File:Picture of H.P.Blavatsky.jpg|thumb|right|Blavatsky's drawing of a boat scene, produced in England in 1851{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=46}}]]

Aged 17, she agreed to marry Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky, a man in his forties who worked as Vice Governor of [[Erivan Governorate|Erivan Province]]. Her reasons for doing so were unclear, although she later claimed that she was attracted by his belief in magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=52–54|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=35–36|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=30|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=3|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=29–30|6a1=Сенкевич|6y=2010|6p=124}} Although she tried to back out shortly before the wedding ceremony, the marriage took place on 7 July 1849.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=55|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=36|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=32|4a1=Сенкевич|4y=2010|4p=126}} Moving with him to the [[Sardar Palace]], she made repeated unsuccessful attempts to escape and return to her family in Tiflis, to which he eventually relented.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=56–57|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=36–37|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=32}} The family sent her, accompanied by a servant and maid, to Odessa to meet her father, who planned to return to Saint Petersburg with her. The escorts accompanied her to [[Poti]] and then [[Kerch]], intending to continue with her to Odessa. Blavatsky claimed that, fleeing her escorts and bribing the captain of the ship that had taken her to Kerch, she reached [[Constantinople]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=61–62|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=37–38|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=31|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=33}} This marked the start of nine years spent traveling the world, possibly financed by her father.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=33–34}}

She did not keep a diary at the time, and was not accompanied by relatives who could verify her activities.{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=42}} Thus, historian of esotericism [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] noted that public knowledge of these travels rests upon "her own largely uncorroborated accounts", which are marred by being "occasionally conflicting in their chronology".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=3}} For religious studies scholar Bruce F. Campbell, there was "no reliable account" for the next 25 years of her life.{{sfn|Capmbell|1980|p=4}} According to biographer Peter Washington, at this point "myth and reality begin to merge seamlessly in Blavatsky's biography".{{sfn|Washington|1993|pp=30–31}}

She later claimed that in Constantinople she developed a friendship with a Hungarian opera singer named Agardi Metrovitch, whom she first encountered when saving him from being murdered.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=70–71|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=36–37|3a1=Сенкевич|3y=2010|3p=141}} It was also in Constantinople that she met the Countess Sofia Kiselyova, who she would accompany on a tour of Egypt, Greece, and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=34}} In [[Cairo]], she met the American art student Albert Rawson, who later wrote extensively about the Middle East,{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=64|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=43|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3pp=3–4|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=38–40}} and together they allegedly visited a Coptic magician, Paulos Metamon.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=4|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=41–42}} In 1851, she proceeded to [[Paris]], where she encountered the [[animal magnetism|Mesmerist]] [[Victor Michal]], who impressed her.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=42–43}} From there, she visited England, and would claim that it was here that she met the "mysterious Indian" who had appeared in her childhood visions, a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] whom she referred to as the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]. While she provided various conflicting accounts of how they met, locating it in both London and [[Ramsgate]] according to separate stories, she maintained that he claimed that he had a special mission for her, and that she must travel to [[Tibet]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kuhn|1y=1992|1p=47|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=45–46|3a1=Kalnitsky|3y=2003|3p=197|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=4|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=43–44|6a1=Сенкевич|6y=2010|6p=163}}

[[File:Blavatsky.007.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Helena Blavatsky, {{circa|1850}}]]

She made her way to Asia via the Americas, heading to Canada in autumn 1851. Inspired by the novels of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], she sought out the Native American communities of [[Quebec]] in the hope of meeting their magico-religious specialists, but was instead robbed, later attributing these Natives' behavior to the corrupting influence of Christian missionaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=48|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=44–45}} She then headed south, visiting [[New Orleans]], [[Texas]], Mexico, and the Andes, before transport via ship from the [[West Indies]] to [[Ceylon]] and then [[Bombay]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=49|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=45}} She spent two years in India, allegedly following the instructions found in letters that Morya had sent to her.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=45–46}} She attempted to enter Tibet, but was prevented from doing so by the British administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=50|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=46}}

She later claimed that she then headed back to Europe by ship, surviving a shipwreck near to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] before arriving in England in 1854, where she faced hostility as a Russian citizen due to the ongoing [[Crimean War]] between Britain and Russia.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=51–52|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=46}} It was here, she claimed, that she worked as a concert musician for the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=52|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=46}} Sailing to the U.S., she visited [[New York City]], where she met up with Rawson, before touring [[Chicago]], [[Salt Lake City]], and [[San Francisco]], and then sailing back to India via Japan.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=52–54|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=46}} There, she spent time in [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Burma]], before making a second attempt to enter Tibet.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=47}} She claimed that this time she was successful, entering Tibet in 1856 through Kashmir, accompanied by a Tartar shaman who was attempting to reach Siberia and who thought that as a Russian citizen, Blavatsky would be able to aid him in doing so.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=57–58|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=177|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=60–61}} According to this account, they reached [[Leh]] before becoming lost, eventually joining a traveling Tartar group before she headed back to India.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=61–62}} She returned to Europe via [[Madras]] and [[Java]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=60|2a1=Santucci|2y=2006|2p=178|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=47}}

After spending time in France and Germany, in 1858 she returned to her family, then based in [[Pskov]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=75–76|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=63|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=4|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=47}} She later claimed that there she began to exhibit further paranormal abilities, with rapping and creaking accompanying her around the house and furniture moving of its own volition.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=4–5|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2pp=76–78|3a1=Cranston|3y=1993|3pp=65–69|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=4|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=48–49}} In 1860 she and her sister visited their maternal grandmother in Tiflis.

In 1864, while riding in [[Mingrelia]], Blavatsky fell from her horse and was in a coma for several months with a spinal fracture.

====Tibet====

[[File:Tashilhunpo Monastery, Shigatse.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Tashilhunpo Monastery, Shigatse, the place that Blavatsky claimed held the Senzar texts she translated]]

She claimed to have then received a message from Morya to travel to Constantinople, where he met her, and together they traveled overland to Tibet, going through Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and then into India, entering Tibet via Kashmir.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=4|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=63}} There, they allegedly stayed in the home of Morya's friend and colleague, Master [[Koot Hoomi]], which was near to [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]], [[Shigatse]]. According to Blavatsky, both Morya and Koot Hoomi were Kashmiris of Punjabi origin, and it was at his home that Koot Hoomi taught students of the [[Gelugpa]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Koot Hoomi was described as having spent time in London and [[Leipzig]], being fluent in both English and French, and like Morya was a [[vegetarian]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=92–83|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=4–5|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=64–65}}

She claimed that in Tibet, she was taught an ancient, unknown language known as [[Senzar language|Senzar]], and translated a number of ancient texts written in this language that were preserved by the monks of a monastery; she stated that she was, however, not permitted entry into the monastery itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=100|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=68–69}} She also claimed that while in Tibet, Morya and Koot Hoomi helped her develop and control her psychic powers. Among the abilities that she ascribed to these "Masters" were [[clairvoyance]], [[clairaudience]], [[telepathy]], the ability to control another's consciousness, to dematerialize and rematerialize physical objects, and to project their astral bodies, thus giving the appearance of being in two places at once.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=71–72}} She claimed to have remained on this spiritual retreat from late 1868 until late 1870.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=5}} Blavatsky never claimed in print to have visited [[Lhasa]], although this is a claim that would be made for her in various later sources, including the account provided by her sister.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=97|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=67}}

Many critics and biographers have expressed doubts regarding the veracity of Blavatsky's claims regarding her visits to Tibet, which rely entirely on her own claims, lacking any credible independent testimony.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=69–70|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=57}} It has been highlighted that during the nineteenth century, Tibet was closed to Europeans, and visitors faced the perils of bandits and a harsh terrain; the latter would have been even more problematic if Blavatsky had been as stout and un-athletic as she would be in later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=33|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=5|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=53–54}} However, as several biographers have noted, traders and pilgrims from neighboring lands were able to access Tibet freely, suggesting the possibility that she would have been allowed to enter accompanied by Morya, particularly if she had been mistaken for an Asian.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=82|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=64}} Blavatsky's eyewitness account of Shigatse was unprecedented in the West,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=5}} and one scholar of Buddhism, [[D. T. Suzuki]], suggested that she later exhibited an advanced knowledge of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] consistent with her having studied in a Tibetan monastery.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=84|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=5}} Lachman noted that had Blavatsky spent time in Tibet, then she would be "one of the greatest travelers of the nineteenth century",{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=53}} although he added - "in all honesty I do not know" if Blavatsky spent time in Tibet or not.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=75}} Conversely, biographer [[Marion Meade]] commented on Blavatsky's tales of Tibet and various other adventures by stating that: "hardly a word of this appears to be true".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=69}}

==Later life==

===Embracing Spiritualism and establishing Theosophy: 1870–78===

====Arriving in New York City====

[[File:Helena Blavatsky.jpg|thumb|right|Blavatsky]]

Blavatsky alleged that she departed Tibet with the mission of proving to the world that the phenomena identified by [[Spiritualists]] was objectively real, thus defending it against accusations of fraud made by [[scientific materialist]]s. However, she also stated that the entities being contacted by Spiritualist mediums were not the spirits of the dead, as the Spiritualist movement typically alleged, but instead either mischievous [[elementals]] or the "shells" left behind by the deceased.{{sfnm|1a1=Godwin|1y=1994|1p=282|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=77–78, 81}} She proceeded via the [[Suez Canal]] to Greece, where she met with another of the Masters, [[Master Hilarion]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=78}} She set sail for Egypt aboard the ''[[SS Eumonia]]'', but in July 1871 it exploded during the journey; Blavatsky was one of only 16 survivors.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=93|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=105|3a1=Godwin|3y=1994|3p=279|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=78}} Reaching Cairo, she met up with Metamon, and with the help of a woman named [[Emma Cutting]] established a ''société spirite'', which was based largely on [[Spiritism]], a form of Spiritualism founded by [[Allan Kardec]] which professed a belief in [[reincarnation]], in contrast to the mainstream Spiritualist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=94–96|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=105–106|3a1=Godwin|3y=1994|3p=279|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=5|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5p=79}} However, Blavatsky believed that Cutting and many of the mediums employed by the society were fraudulent, and she closed it down after two weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1p=106|2a1=Godwin|2y=1994|2p=279|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=80–81}} In Cairo, she also met with the Egyptologist [[Gaston Maspero]], and another of the Masters, [[Serapis Bey]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=82}} It was also here that she met up with Metrovitch, although he soon died of [[typhoid]], with Blavatsky claiming to have overseen the funeral.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=83}}

Leaving Egypt, she proceeded to Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, there encountering members of the [[Druze]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=105, 106|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=83–84}} It was during these travels that she met with the writer and traveler [[Lidia Pashkova]], who provided independent verification of Blavatsky's travels during this period.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=84}} In July 1872 she returned to her family in Odessa, before departing in April 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=106–107|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=84}} She spent time in [[Bucharest]] and Paris,{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=96–97|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2p=107|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=84}} before{{spnd}}according to her later claims{{spnd}}Morya instructed her to go to the U.S., arriving in New York City in July 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=101|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=107–108|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=40|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=84}} There, she moved into a women's housing cooperative on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], earning a wage through piece work sewing and designing advertising cards.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=102|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=40|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=87}} It was here that she attracted attention, and was interviewed by the journalist Anna Ballard of the New York newspaper ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]''; this interview was the earliest textual source in which Blavatsky claimed to have spent time in Tibet.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=102–103|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=88–89}} Indeed, it was while in New York that "detailed records" of Blavatsky's life again become available to historians.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=40}} Soon after, Blavatsky received news of her father's death, thus inheriting a considerable fortune, allowing her to move into a lavish hotel.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=89–90}} In December 1874, Blavatsky met the [[Georgians|Georgian]] Mikheil Betaneli. Infatuated with her, he repeatedly requested that they marry, to which she ultimately relented; this constituted [[bigamy]], as her first husband was still alive. However, as she refused to consummate the marriage, Betaneli sued for divorce and returned to Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=116–117, 137, 145|2a1=Kuhn|2y=1992|2p=58|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3pp=48–49|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=121–122}}

====Meeting Henry Steel Olcott and the foundation of the Theosophical Society====

Blavatsky was intrigued by a news story about [[William and Horatio Eddy]], brothers based in [[Chittenden, Vermont|Chittenden]], [[Vermont]], who it was claimed could [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] and manifest spiritual phenomena. She visited Chittenden in October 1874, there meeting the reporter Henry Steel Olcott, who was investigating the brothers' claims for the ''[[Daily Graphic]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=110–114|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=124–126|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=29|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=6|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=92–98}} Claiming that Blavatsky impressed him with her own ability to manifest spirit phenomena, Olcott authored a newspaper article on her.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=125|2a1=Cranston|2y=1993|2pp=126–127|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=98–99, 101}} They soon became close friends, giving each other the nicknames of "Maloney" (Olcott) and "Jack" (Blavatsky).{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=22|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2p=126|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=43|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=101}} He helped attract greater attention to Blavatsky's claims, encouraging the ''Daily Graphics'' editor to publish an interview with her,{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=107–108}} and discussing her in his book on Spiritualism, ''People from the Other World'' (1875),{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=23|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=122}} which her Russian correspondent [[Alexandr Aksakov]] urged her to translate into Russian.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=123}}
She began to instruct Olcott in her own occult beliefs, and encouraged by her he became celibate, tee-totaling, and vegetarian, although she herself was unable to commit to the latter.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=108–109}} In January 1875 the duo visited the Spiritualist mediums [[Nelson and Jennie Owen]] in [[Philadelphia]]; the Owens asked Olcott to test them to prove that the phenomena that they produced were not fraudulent, and while Olcott believed them, Blavatsky opined that they faked some of their phenomena in those instances when genuine phenomena failed to manifest.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=134–135|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2pp=42–43|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=108–110}}

[[File:Blavatsky.020.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Blavatsky, {{circa|1877}}]]

Drumming up interest for their ideas, Blavatsky and Olcott published a circular letter in [[Eldridge Gerry Brown]]'s [[Boston]]-based Spiritualist publication, ''[[The Spiritual Scientist]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=140|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=495|3a1=Godwin|3y=1994|3p=282|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=124}} There, they named themselves the "Brotherhood of Luxor", a name potentially inspired by the pre-existing [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=140|2a1=Godwin|2y=1994|2p=282|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=124, 126}} They began living together in a series of rented apartments in New York City, which they decorated with [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] animals and images of spiritual figures; their life was funded largely by Olcott's continued work as a lawyer.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1pp=44–45|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=143–144}} Their last such apartment came to be known as the Lamasery.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=76|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2p=177|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3pp=10–11}} Allegedly encouraged by the Masters, Blavatsky and Olcott established the Miracle Club, through which they facilitated lectures on esoteric themes in New York City.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=26|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=49|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=7|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=129–130}} It was through this group that they met an Irish Spiritualist, [[William Quan Judge]], who shared many of their interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=148|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=129–130}}

At a Miracle Club meeting on 7 September 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Judge agreed to establish an esoteric organisation, with [[Charles Sotheran]] suggesting that they call it the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=27–28|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2p=151|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3pp=53–54|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=7|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=130–31, 136}} The term ''[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]'' came from the Greek ''theos'' ("god(s)") and ''sophia'' ("wisdom"), thus meaning "god-wisdom" or "divine wisdom".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=132}} The term was not new, but had been previously used in various contexts by the [[Eirenaeus Philalethes|Philaletheian]]s and the [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Jakob Böhme]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=55|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=133}} Theosophists would often argue over how to define Theosophy, with Judge expressing the view that the task was impossible.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=132}} Blavatsky however insisted that Theosophy was not a religion in itself.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=137}} Lachman has described the movement as "a very wide umbrella, under which quite a few things could find a place".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=135}}
On foundation, Olcott was appointed chairman, with Judge as secretary, and Blavatsky as corresponding secretary, although she remained the group's primary theoretician and leading figure.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=155|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=130–131, 135–136}} Prominent early members included [[Emma Hardinge Britten]], [[Signor Bruzzesi]], [[C.C.

====''Isis Unveiled''====

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The underlying theme among these diverse topics {{bracket|in ''Isis Unveiled''}} is the existence of an ancient wisdom-religion, an ageless occult guide to the cosmos, nature and human life. The many faiths of man are said to derive from a universal religion known to both [[Plato]] and the ancient Hindu sages. The wisdom-religion is also identified with Hermetic philosophy as "the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology" (I, vii). Every religion is based on the same truth or "secret doctrine", which contains "the alpha and omega of universal science" (I, 511). This ancient wisdom-religion will become the religion of the future (I, 613).|source=—Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, 2004.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=9}}}}

In 1875, Blavatsky began work on a book outlining her Theosophical worldview, much of which would be written while staying in the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] home of [[Hiram Corson]], a Professor of English Literature at [[Cornell University]]. Although she had hoped to call it ''The Veil of Isis'', it would be published as ''[[Isis Unveiled]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=31|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2pp=152, 176|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=137, 140–143}} While writing it, Blavatsky claimed to be aware of a second consciousness within her body, referring to it as "the lodger who is in me", and stating that it was this second consciousness that inspired much of the writing.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=137–138}} In ''Isis Unveiled'', Blavatsky quoted extensively from other esoteric and religious texts, although her contemporary and colleague Olcott always maintained that she had quoted from books that she did not have access to.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=147}} Writing more than a century after her death Lachman conjectured that if this had been the case, then she may have had an [[eidetic memory]],{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=148}} such that, while relying on earlier sources, the book represented an original synthesis that connected disparate ideas not brought together before.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=154}}

Revolving around Blavatsky's idea that all the world's religions stemmed from a single "Ancient Wisdom", which she connected to the Western esotericism of ancient [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=9|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=155, 157}} it also articulated her thoughts on Spiritualism,{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=156}} and provided a criticism of [[Darwinian evolution]], stating that it dealt only with the physical world and ignored the spiritual realms.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=159–160}}
The book was edited by Professor of Philosophy [[Alexander Wilder]] and published in two volumes by J.W. Bouton in 1877.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=173, 176|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=9|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=150–151}} Although facing negative mainstream press reviews, including from those who highlighted that it extensively quoted around 100 other books without acknowledgement,{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=33|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=52}} it proved to be such a commercial success, with its initial print run of 1000 copies selling out in a week,{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=35|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2p=179|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=52|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=152}} that the publisher requested a sequel, although Blavatsky turned down the offer.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=154}}
While ''Isis Unveiled'' was a success, the Society remained largely inactive,{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=57|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=170}} having fallen into this state in autumn 1876.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=174}} This was despite the fact that new lodges of the organisation had been established throughout the U.S. and in [[London]], and prominent figures like [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Abner Doubleday]] had joined.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=171}} In July 1878, Blavatsky gained U.S. citizenship.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=183|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=171}}

===India: 1879–85===

The Theosophical Society established links with an Indian [[Hindu reform movement]], the [[Arya Samaj]], which had been founded by the Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]]; Blavatsky and Olcott believed that the two organisations shared a common spiritual world-view.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=77|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=57|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=11|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=173}} Unhappy with life in the U.S., Blavatsky decided to move to India, with Olcott agreeing to join her, securing work as a U.S. trade representative to the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=58|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=176–179}} In December, the duo auctioned off many of their possessions, although Edison gifted them a [[phonograph]] to take with them to India.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=180}} They left New York City aboard the ''Canada'', which took them to London. After meeting with well-wishers in the capital, they traveled to [[Liverpool]], there setting sail aboard the ''Speke Hall'', arriving in Bombay in February 1879.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=59|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=11|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=181–182}} In the city, they were greeted with celebrations organised by Arya Samaj member [[Hurrychund Chintamon]] before obtaining a house in Girgaum Road, part of Bombay's native area.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=79|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2pp=59–60|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=182–184}}

Associating largely with Indians rather than the governing British elite, Blavatsky took a fifteen-year-old [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] boy, Vallah "Babula" Bulla, as her personal servant.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=197|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=184}} Many educated Indians were impressed that the Theosophists championed Indian religion in the face of British imperialism and Christianization attempts.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=206|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=11–12}} Her activity in the city was monitored by British intelligence services, who were concerned that she may have been working for Russia.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=198|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=60}} 
In April, Blavatsky took Olcott, Babula, and their friend Moolji Thackersey to the [[Karla Caves]], announcing that they contained secret passages that led to an underground place where the Masters assembled.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=186–187}} Then claiming that the Masters were telepathically commanding her to head to [[Rajputana]] in the [[Punjab]], she and Olcott headed north.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=187}} At the [[Yamuna]] river, they met the [[sannyasin]] Babu Surdass, who had sat in the [[lotus position]] for 52 years, and in [[Agra]] saw the [[Taj Mahal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=202–203|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=188}} In [[Saharanpur]] they met with Dayananda and his Arya Samajists, before returning to Bombay.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=203–204|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=188–189}}

In July 1879, Blavatsky and Olcott began work on a monthly magazine, ''[[The Theosophist]]'', with the first issue coming out in October.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=79|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2pp=207–209|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3p=60|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=11|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5p=189}} The magazine soon obtained a large readership, with the management being taken over by [[Damodar K. Mavalankar]], a Theosophist who introduced the idea of referring to the Masters as ''[[mahatmas]]''.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=189}} In December, Blavatsky and Olcott travelled to [[Allahabad]], there visiting [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], the editor of ''[[The Pioneer (newspaper)|The Pioneer]]'' and keen Spiritualist. [[A.O. Hume]] was also a guest at the Sinnett's home, and Blavatsky was encouraged to manifest paranormal phenomena in their presence.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=209–211|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=61|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=12|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=190–191}} From there, they travelled to [[Benares]], where they stayed at the palace of the [[Maharaja of Vizianagram]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=211–212|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=191}} Blavatsky and Olcott were then invited to Ceylon by Buddhist monks. There they officially converted to Buddhism—apparently the first from the United States to do so&lt;ref&gt;Lori Pierce, "Origins of Buddhism in North America", in ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'', Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon (eds.). Indiana University Press, 2006. p. 637&lt;/ref&gt;—taking the [[Five Precepts]] in a ceremony at [[Ramayana Nikayana]] in May 1880.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=214–215|2a1=Godwin|2y=1994|2pp=321–322|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=12|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=193–194}} Touring the island, they were met by crowds intrigued by these unusual Westerners who embraced Buddhism rather than proselytizing Christianity. Their message proved a boost to Sinhalese nationalist self-esteem, and they were invited to see the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Buddha's Tooth]] in [[Kandy]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=194}}

Upon learning that old comrade Emma Coulomb (née Cutting) and her husband had fallen into poverty in Ceylon, Blavatsky invited them to move into her home in Bombay.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=205–206, 213–214|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=189–190, 192–193}} However, the Coulombs annoyed Rosa Bates and Edward Winbridge, two American Theosophists who were also living with Blavatsky; when Blavatsky took the side of the Coulombs, Bates and Winbridge returned to the U.S.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=215|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=79|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=194–195}} Blavatsky was then invited to [[Simla]] to spend more time with Sinnett, and there performed a range of materializations that astounded the other guests; in one instance, she allegedly made a cup-and-saucer materialize under the soil during a picnic.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=80|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2pp=216, 219–224|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=12|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=197–200}} Sinnett was eager to contact the Masters himself, convincing Blavatsky to facilitate this communication, resulting in the production of over 1400 pages allegedly authored by Koot Hoomi and Morya, which came to be known as the [[Mahatma Letters]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=227–228, 234|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=201}} Sinnett summarised the teachings contained in these letters in his book ''[[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|Esoteric Buddhism]]'' (1883), although scholars of Buddhism like [[Max Müller]] publicly highlighted that the contents were not Buddhist, and Blavatsky herself disliked the misleading title.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=202}} Since the book's publication, there has been much debate as to the authenticity of the letters, with some arguing that they were written by Blavatsky herself, and others believing that they were written by separate individuals.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=203–204}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997}} According to Meade, "there can be no reasonable doubt that Helena was their author".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=234}}

Theosophy was unpopular with both Christian missionaries and the British government,{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=219}} with India's English-language press being almost uniformly negative toward the Society.{{sfn|Сенкевич|2010|p=347}} The group nevertheless proved popular, and branches were established across the country.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=214}} While Blavatsky had emphasized its growth among the native Indian population rather than among the British elite, she moved into a comfortable bungalow in the elite Bombay suburb of [[Breach Candy]], which she said was more accessible to Western visitors.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1pp=230–231|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=214}} Olcott had decided to establish the [[Buddhist Education Fund]] to combat the spread of the Christian faith in Ceylon and encourage pride and interest in Buddhism among the island's Sinhalese population. Although Blavatsky initially opposed the idea, stating that the Masters would not approve, Olcott's project proved a success, and she changed her opinion about it.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=84|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2pp=66–67|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=215–216}}

Blavatsky had been diagnosed with [[Bright's disease]] and hoping the weather to be more conducive to her condition she took up the offer of the Society's [[Madras]] Branch to move to their city.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=217}} However, in November 1882 the Society purchased an estate in [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], which became their permanent headquarters; a few rooms were set aside for Blavatsky, who moved into them in December.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=84–85|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=66|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=13|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=217–218}} She continued to tour the subcontinent, claiming that she then spent time in [[Sikkim]] and Tibet, where she visited her teacher's ashram for several days.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=218}} With her health deteriorating, she agreed to accompany Olcott on his trip to Britain, where he was planning to argue the case for Ceylonese Buddhism and sort out problems with the Society's London Lodge.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=220–221}}{{sfn|Сенкевич|2010|p=404}}

Sailing to [[Marseilles]], France, in March 1883, she spent time in [[Nice]] with the founder of the Theosophical Society's French branch, the [[:fr:Maria de Mariategui|Countess of Caithness]] (widow of [[James Sinclair, 14th Earl of Caithness]]), with whom she continued to Paris.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=221–222}}{{sfn|Сенкевич|2010|p=397}} In London, she appeared at the lodge's meeting, where she sought to quell arguments between Sinnett on the one hand and [[Anna Kingsford]] and [[Edward Maitland]] on the other.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=131}} Unsatisfied, Kingsford{{spnd}}whom Blavatsky thought "an unbearable snobbish woman"{{spnd}}split from the Theosophical Society to form the [[Hermetic Society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1pp=76–77|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=222–223}} In London, Blavatsky made contact with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) through [[Frederic W. H. Myers]]. She complied with their request to undertake a study of her and the paranormal abilities that she claimed to possess, although wasn't impressed by the organisation and mockingly referred to it as the "Spookical Research Society".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=224, 226–227}}

With Blavatsky in Europe, trouble broke out at the society's Adyar headquarters in what became known as the [[Coulomb Affair]]. The society's Board of Control had accused Emma Coulomb of misappropriating their funds for her own purposes, and asked her to leave their center. She and her husband refused, [[blackmail]]ing the society with letters that they claimed were written by Blavatsky and which proved that her paranormal abilities were fraudulent. The society refused to pay them and expelled them from their premises, at which the couple turned to the Madras-based ''[[Christian College Magazine]]'', who published an exposé of Blavatsky's alleged fraudulence using the Coulomb's claims as a basis. The story attracted international attention and was picked up by London-based newspaper, ''[[The Times]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=88–90|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2pp=79–82|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=13|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=224–226|5a1=Сенкевич|5y=2010|5pp=411–412}} In response, in November 1884 Blavatsky headed to Cairo, where she and Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] searched for negative information on Emma Coulomb, discovering stories of her alleged former history of extortion and criminality.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=228}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=142}} Internally, the Society was greatly damaged by the Coulomb Affair,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=95}} although it remained popular in India, as did Blavatsky herself.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=94–95}}

===Final years in Europe: 1885–91===

Worsening health led Blavatsky contemplate a return to the milder climate of Europe, and resigning her position as corresponding secretary of the society, she left India in March 1885.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=85|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=231}} By 1885, the Theosophical Society had experienced rapid growth, with 121 lodges having been chartered across the world, 106 of which were located in India, Burma, and Ceylon.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=68}} Initially, each lodge was chartered directly from the Adyar headquarters, with members making democratic decisions by vote.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=68}} However, over the coming years the lodges were organised into national units with their own ruling councils, resulting in tensions between the different levels of administration.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=68}}

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=For our own part, we regard [Blavatsky] neither as the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar adventuress; we think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting imposters in history.|source=—The statement of the Society for Psychical Research on the basis of the Hodgson Report.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=93}} }}

Settling in [[Naples]], Italy, in April 1885, she began living off of a small Society pension and continued working on her next book, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=232}} She then moved to [[Würzburg]] in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], where she was visited by a Swedish Theosophist, the Countess [[Constance Wachtmeister]], who became her constant companion throughout the rest of her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=232–233}} In December 1885, the SPR published [[Hodgson Report|their report]] on Blavatsky and her alleged phenomena, authored by [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]]. In his report, Hodgson accused Blavatsky of being a spy for the Russian government, further accusing her of faking paranormal phenomena, largely on the basis of the Coulomb's claims.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=92–93|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2pp=82–83|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=13|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4pp=228–230, 236–237}} The report caused much tension within the Society, with a number of Blavatsky's followers{{spnd}}among them Babaji and [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]]{{spnd}}denouncing her and resigning from the organisation on the basis of it.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=87|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=235}}

Blavatsky wanted to sue her accusers, although Olcott advised against it, believing that the surrounding publicity would damage the Society.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=85}} In private letters, Blavatsky expressed relief that the criticism was focused on her and that the identity of the Masters had not been publicly exposed.{{sfnm|1a1=Lachman|1y=2012|1pp=235–236}} For decades after, Theosophists criticized Hodgson's methodology, arguing that he set out to disprove and attack Blavatsky rather than conduct an unbiased analysis of her claims and abilities. In 1986 the SPR admitted this to be the case and retracted the findings of the report.{{sfn|Society for Psychical Research|1986}}{{sfnm|1a1=Cranston|1y=1993|1pp=xvii–xviii|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=84|3a1=Goodrick-Clarke|3y=2004|3p=14|4a1=Lachman|4y=2012|4p=238}} However, Johnson has commented "Theosophists have overinterpreted this as complete vindication, when in fact many questions raised by Hodgson remain unanswered."{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=3}}

In 1886, by which time she was largely [[wheelchair]]-bound, Blavatsky moved to [[Ostend]] in Belgium, where she was visited by Theosophists from across Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=87|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=14|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=240–241}} Supplementing her pension, she established a small ink-producing business.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=241}} She received messages from members of the Society's London Lodge who were dissatisfied with Sinnett's running of it; they believed that he was focusing on attaining upper-class support rather than encouraging the promotion of Theosophy throughout society, a criticism Blavatsky agreed with.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=241–242}} She arrived in London in May 1887, initially staying in the [[Upper Norwood]] home of Theosophist [[Mabel Collins]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=91|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=244}} In September, she moved into the [[Holland Park]] home of fellow Theosophists, [[Bertram Keightley]] and his nephew [[Archibald Keightley]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=245}}

[[File:Blavatsky and Olcott.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Blavatsky and Olcott in 1888]]

In London, she established the [[Blavatsky Lodge]] as a rival to that run by Sinnett, draining much of its membership.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=90|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=245}} Lodge meetings were held at the Keightels' house on Thursday nights, with Blavatsky also greeting many visitors there, among them the occultist and poet [[W. B. Yeats]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=91|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=246–247}} In November 1889 she was visited by the Indian lawyer [[Mohandas Gandhi]], who was studying the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' with the Keightels. He became an associate member of Blavatsky's Lodge in March 1891, and would emphasize the close connection between Theosophy and Hinduism throughout his life.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=258–259}} In 1888, Blavatsky established the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society, a group under her complete control for which admittance was restricted to those who had passed certain tests. She identified it as a place for "true Theosophists" who would focus on the system's philosophy rather than experiment with producing paranormal phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=100|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=248–249}}

In London, Blavatsky founded a magazine, controversially titling it ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]''; in this Theosophical publication she sought to completely ignore claims regarding paranormal phenomena, and focus instead on a discussion of philosophical ideas.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=90|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=245–246}} Blavatsky also finished writing ''The Secret Doctrine'', which was then edited by the Keightels.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=91|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=246}} As a commercial publisher willing to publish the approximately 1,500 page work could not be found, Blavatsky established the [[Theosophical Publishing Company]], who brought out the work in two volumes, the first published in October 1888 and the second in January 1889.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=92|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=14|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=249–250}} Blavatsky claimed that the book constituted her commentary on the ''[[Book of Dzyan]]'', a religious text written in Senzar which she had been taught while studying in Tibet.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=92|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=14|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=250}} Buddhologist [[David Reigle]] claimed that he identified ''Books of Kiu-te'', including Blavatsky's ''Book of Dzyan'' as a first volume, as the [[Tantra]] section of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]].{{sfn|Reigle|1983}} However, most scholars of Buddhism to have examined ''The Secret Doctrine'' have concluded that there was no such text as the ''Book of Dzyan'', and that instead it was the fictional creation of Blavatsky's.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=257}} In the book, Blavatsky outlined her own [[cosmogony|cosmogonical]] ideas about how the universe, the planets, and the human species came to exist. She also discussed her views about the human being and their soul, thus dealing with issues surrounding an afterlife.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1pp=92–93|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=16–18|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=255–256}}
The two-volume book was reviewed for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' by the social reformer [[Annie Besant]]; impressed by it, Besant met with Blavatsky and joined the Theosophists.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=93|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=157–258}} In August 1890, Blavatsky moved in to Besant's large house at 19 Avenue Road in [[St. John's Wood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=100|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=259}}
[[File:Woking Crematorium 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Woking Crematorium in 2018]]
She appointed Besant to be the new head of the Blavatsky Lodge,{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=99|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=265}} and in July 1890 inaugurated the new European headquarters of the Theosophical Society in Besant's house.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=265}} There, she authored a book containing questions and corresponding answers, ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]''.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=260–261}} This was followed by ''[[The Voice of the Silence]]'', a short devotional text which she claimed was based on a Senzar text known as ''[[The Book of the Golden Precepts]]''. As with ''The Secret Doctrine'', most scholars of Buddhism have doubted that this latter text was an authentic Tibetan Buddhist document.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=261–262}} She continued to face accusations of fraud; U.S. newspaper ''The Sun'' published a July 1890 article based on information provided by an ex-member of the Society, [[Elliott Coues]]. Blavatsky sued the newspaper for libel, and they publicly retracted their accusations in September 1892.{{sfnm|1a1=Santucci|1y=2006|1p=184|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=268}}
That winter, Britain had been afflicted by an [[influenza]] epidemic, with Blavatsky contracting the virus; it led to her death on the afternoon of 8 May 1891, in Besant's house.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=100|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=17|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=269}} The date would come to be commemorated by Theosophists ever since as [[White Lotus Day]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=270}} Her body was [[cremated]] at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 11 May.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=271}}

==Personal life==
{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Blavatsky talked incessantly in a guttural voice, sometimes wittily and sometimes crudely. She was indifferent to sex yet frank and open about it; fonder of animals than of people; welcoming, unpretentious, scandalous, capricious and rather noisy. She was also humorous, vulgar, impulsive and warm-hearted, and didn't give a hoot for anyone or anything.|source=—Biographer Peter Washington, 1993.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=41}}}}

The biographer Peter Washington described Blavatsky as "a short, stout, forceful woman, with strong arms, several chins, unruly hair, a determined mouth, and large, liquid, slightly bulging eyes".{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=26}} She had distinctive azure colored eyes,{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=24}} and was [[obesity|overweight]] throughout her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=24|2a1=Godwin|2y=1994b|2p=xv}} According to the biographer [[Marion Meade]], Blavatsky's "general appearance was outrageously untidy".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=167}} In later life, she was known for wearing loose robes, and wore many rings on her fingers.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=41}} She was a heavy cigarette smoker throughout her life,{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=152|2a1=Washington|2y=1993|2p=41|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3pp=40–41}} and was known for smoking [[hashish]] at times.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=65}} She lived simply and her followers believed that she refused to accept monetary payment in return for disseminating her teachings.{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=xix}} Blavatsky preferred to be known by the acronym "HPB",{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=ix}} a sobriquet applied to her by many of her friends which was first developed by Olcott.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=43}} She avoided social functions and was scornful of social obligations.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=49}} She spoke Russian, Georgian, English, French, Italian, Arabic, and Sanskrit.{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xv}}

Meade referred to her as "an eccentric who abided by no rules except her own",{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=7}} someone who had "utter disregard for the Victorian code of morality".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=71}} Meade believed that Blavatsky perceived herself as a [[messiah|messianic]] figure whose purpose was to save the world by promoting Theosophy.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=7}} Lachman stated that Blavatsky exhibited what he referred to as "Russian traits{{spnd}}an intense devotion to spiritual truth, combined with a profound contradictory character."{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=26}} Washington expressed the view that she was "a persuasive story-teller {{bracket|with the}} power to fascinate others" although noted that she was also "self-absorbed and egotistical".{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=30}} For Meade, Blavatsky had a "vivid imagination" and a "propensity for lying".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=161}} Godwin noted that Blavatsky had "a fearsome temper".{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xv}} The religious studies scholar Bruce F. Campbell noted that she had been a "strong-willed, independent child", and that the harsh environment of her childhood may have resulted in her "difficulty in controlling her temper and ... her tendency to swear".{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=3}} In his opinion, she represented "an archetypal charismatic leader".{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=100}}
Anthropologist [[Leo Klejn]] claimed that Blavatsky's indefatigability and energy were surprising.{{sfn|Клейн|2011}} The [[Indologist]] [[Alexander Senkevich]] stated that Blavatsky's [[charisma]] exerted influence on [[Charles Massey]] and [[Stainton Moses]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2010|p=403}}

Blavatsky's sexuality has been an issue of dispute; many biographers have believed that she remained [[celibate]] throughout her life,{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=31}} with Washington believing that she "hated sex with her own sort of passion".{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=88}} In later life she stated that she was a virgin, although she had been married to two men during her lifetime.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=7}} Throughout its early years, the Theosophical Society promoted [[celibacy]], even within marriage.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=348}} Some have suggested that she may have been a [[lesbian]] or [[transvestite]], due to early accounts in which she traveled while dressed in masculine attire.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=34–35}} Meade thought that Blavatsky had, with a few exceptions, been "contemptuous" of other women, suggesting that while this may have been the result of general societal [[misogyny]], it may have reflected that Blavatsky had been jilted by another woman.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=24}}

===Socio-political beliefs===

Godwin suggested that Blavatsky's life work was "not only spiritual but socially idealistic and fiercely political".{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xviii}} He suggested that her "emotional fuel" was partly "a hatred of oppression", either through the intellectual domination of Christianity or through British imperialism.{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xviii}} Conversely, Meade thought Blavatsky to be "basically a non-political person".{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=198}}

The scholar of religion [[Olav Hammer]] noted that "on rare occasions" Blavatsky's writings are "overtly racist",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=121}} adding that her antisemitism "derives from the unfortunate position of Judaism as the origin of Christianity" and refers to "the intense dislike she felt for Christianity".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=121}} She wrote that "Judaism, built solely on Phallic worship, has become one of the latest creeds in Asia, and theologically a religion of hate and malice toward everyone and everything outside themselves."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=471}} She also stated that Jews were "degenerate in spirituality", although she still viewed them as Aryans.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=200}} She wrote that [[Africans]], [[aboriginal Australians]], and [[South Sea Islanders]] are inferior to Europeans, stating "MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity (the 'narrow-brained' savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=168}} She referred to aboriginal Australians as "half-animal".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=195}}

==Theories and doctrines==

According to Meade, Blavatsky assembled her theories and doctrines gradually, in a piecemeal fashion.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=80}} Blavatsky claimed that these Theosophical doctrines were not her own invention, but had been received from a brotherhood of secretive spiritual adepts whom she referred to as the "Masters" or "Mahatmas".{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=1}}

===Theosophy, the Masters, and the "Ancient Wisdom"===

[[File:Emb logo.png|thumb|200px|right|The logo for the Theosophical Society brought together various ancient symbols]]

Blavatsky was the leading theoretician of the Theosophical Society,{{sfnm|1a1=Santucci|1y=2006b|1p=1114|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=135–136}} responsible for establishing its "doctrinal basis".{{sfn|Bednarowski|1980|p=221}} The ideas expounded in her published texts provide the basis from which the Society and wider Theosophical movement emerged.{{sfn|Santucci|2006b|p=1114}} Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas were a form of ''[[occultism]]''. She subscribed to the anti-Christian current of thought within Western esotericism which emphasized the idea of an ancient and universal "occult science" that should be revived.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=40}} Blavatsky stated that the Theosophical teachings were passed on to her by adepts, who lived in various parts of the world.{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=xix}}

Fundamentally, the underlying concept behind Blavatsky's Theosophy was that there was an "ancient wisdom religion" which had once been found across the world, and which was known to various ancient figures, such as the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] and the ancient Hindu sages.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=36|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=216}}
Blavatsky connected this ancient wisdom religion to Hermetic philosophy, a worldview in which everything in the universe is identified as an emanation from a Godhead.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=216}} Blavatsky believed that all of the world's religions developed from this original global faith.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=216}}
Blavatsky understood her Theosophy to be the heir to the Neoplatonist philosophers of [[Late Antiquity]], who had also embraced Hermetic philosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=217}} Blavatsky claimed that due to [[Christianization]] in Europe, this magical tradition was lost there, but it persisted in modified form in India and Africa, promoting a self-consciously magical [[disenchantment]] narrative.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=117}} In turn, Blavatsky believed that the Theosophical movement's revival of the "ancient wisdom religion" would lead to it spreading across the world, eclipsing the established world religions.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=216}}
Thus, in bringing these Theosophical ideas to humanity, Blavatsky viewed herself as a [[messiah|messianic]] figure.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=7}}

According to Goodrick-Clarke, the Theosophical Society "disseminated an elaborate philosophical edifice involving a cosmogony, the macrocosm of the universe, spiritual hierarchies, and intermediary beings, the latter having correspondences with a hierarchical conception of the microcosm of man."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=220}}
Officially, the Society-based itself upon the following three objectives:

# To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour.
# To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy, and Science.
# To investigate the unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=69|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=11|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=134}}

Washington believed that the purpose of these three precepts was to lead to the "discovery of the powers latent in man through the occult study of science, philosophy and religion [which] shall be the preferred route to the social harmony and equality which will prefigure{{spnd}}and perhaps become{{spnd}}the divine harmony."{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=69}}

While living in New York City, Blavatsky had referred to herself as a "Buddhist",{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=322}} although only officially embraced Buddhism while in Ceylon.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|pp=321–322}} However, Lachman stated that her Buddhism was "highly eccentric and had little to do with the Buddhism of scholars like {{bracket|Max}} Müller or that of your average Buddhist".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=202}} Blavatsky argued that [[The Buddha]] had sought to return to the teachings of the [[Vedas]], and that Buddhism therefore represented a more accurate survival of ancient [[Brahmanism]] than modern Hinduism.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=757}}
Although critical of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], and opposing their growth in Asia, throughout her life she remained highly sympathetic to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], commenting that "with the faith of the Russian Church I will not even compare Buddhism".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=19}}

[[G. R. S. Mead]] proclaimed, "Two things in all the chaos of her {{bracket|Blavatsky's}} cosmos stood firm in every mood{{spnd}}that her Teachers existed and that she had not cheated."{{sfn|Mead|1920}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and the place of humanity===

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Blavatsky's writings garnered the materials of Neoplatonism, Renaissance magic, Kabbalah, and Freemasonry, together with ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman mythology and religion, joined by Eastern doctrines taken from Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta to present the idea of an ancient wisdom handed down from prehistoric times.|source=—Historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, 2008.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=212}}}}

Blavatsky expounded what has been described as a "monotheistic, immanentist, and mystical cosmology".{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=759}}
Blavatsky was a [[pantheism|pantheist]],{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=328}} and emphasized the idea of an impersonal divinity, referring to the Theosophical God as a "universal Divine Principle, the root of All, from which all proceeds, and within which all shall be absorbed at the end of the great cycle of being".{{sfn|Bednarowski|1980|p=221}} She was dismissive of the Christian idea of God in the Western world, describing it as "a bundle of contradictions and a logical impossibility."{{sfn|Bednarowski|1980|p=221}} She stated that the universe emanated from this Divine Principle, with each particle of matter being infused with a spark of the divine.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=753}} Lower Orders emanated from higher ones, before becoming increasingly dense and being absorbed back into the Divine Principle.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=753}}
This cosmology exhibited commonalities with the scientific discoveries of geology and biological evolution, both of which had been revealed by scientific inquiry during the 19th century.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=753}}

In ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky articulated the belief that in the beginning of time there was absolute nothingness. This primordial essence then separated itself into seven Rays, which were also intelligent beings known as the Dhyan Chohans; these Seven Rays then created the universe using an energy called ''Fohat''.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=255}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=199}} The Earth was created and underwent seven Rounds, in each of which different living beings were created.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=255}}

[[Image:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|left|After spending time in India, Blavatsky adopted a belief in reincarnation (as shown here in [[Hindu art]])]]

Blavatsky advocated the idea of "[[Root Race]]s", each of which was divided into seven Sub-Races.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}
In Blavatsky's cosmogony, the first Root Race were created from pure spirit and lived on a continent known as the "Imperishable Sacred Land".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=255}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=222}} The second Root Race, known as the Hyperboreans, were also formed from pure spirit and lived on a land near to the [[North Pole]], which then had a mild climate.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=255}} The third lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], which Blavatsky alleged survives today as Australia and Rapa Nui.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|pp=255–256}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=224}} Blavatsky alleged that during the fourth Round of the Earth, higher beings descended to the planet, with the beginnings of human physical bodies developing and the sexes separating.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} At this point, the fourth Root Race appeared, living on the continent of [[Atlantis]]; they had physical bodies but also psychic powers and advanced technology.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=225}} She claimed that some Atlanteans were giants and built such ancient monuments as [[Stonehenge]] in southern England and that they also mated with "she-animals", resulting in the creation of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} The Atlanteans were decadent and abused their power and knowledge, so Atlantis sunk into the sea, although various Atlanteans escaped and created new societies in Egypt and the Americas.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}

The fifth Root Race to emerge was the Aryans and was found across the world at the time she was writing.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=226}} She believed that the fifth Race would come to be replaced by the sixth, which would be heralded by the arrival of [[Maitreya]], a figure from Mahayana Buddhist mythology.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=223}} She further believed that humanity would eventually develop into the final, seventh Root Race.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky 1888. [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume2.htm ''Volume II: Anthropogenesis'']. [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]. 2005. Retrieved 29 January 2011. The entire volume constitutes a detailed description of the Theosophical doctrines of the evolution of Humankind, and related subjects. ([[Chakras]] references: pp. 465, 466, 483, 546).&lt;/ref&gt;
Lachman suggested that by reading Blavatsky's cosmogonical claims as a literal account of history, "we may be doing it a disservice."{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} He instead suggested that it could be read as Blavatsky's attempt to formulate "a new myth for the modern age, or as a huge, fantastic science fiction story".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}

Blavatsky taught that humans composed of three separate parts: a divine spark, an astral fluid body, and the physical body.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=755}} Later Blavatsky proclaimed the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|septenary]] of Man and Universe.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=sect. vi}} According to Blavatsky, man is composed of seven parts: [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]], [[Buddhi]], [[Mental body|Manas]], [[Kama|Kama rupa]], [[Astral body|Linga sharira]], [[Prana]], and [[Physical body|Sthula sharira]].{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=sect. vi}} In ''Isis Unveiled'', Blavatsky denied that humans would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] back on the Earth after physical death.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=221}} However, by the time that she had authored ''The Secret Doctrine'', she had changed her opinion on this issue, likely influenced by her time in India.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=135}} Here, she stated that the law of reincarnation was governed by [[karma]], with humanity's final purpose being the emancipation of the soul from the cycle of death and rebirth.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=225}} She believed that knowledge of karma would ensure that human beings lived according to moral principles, arguing that it provided a far greater basis for moral action than that of the Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=761}}
Blavatsky wrote, in ''Isis Unveiled'', that Spiritualism "alone offers a possible last refuge of compromise between" the "revealed religions and materialistic philosophies". While she acknowledged that fanatic believers "remained blind to its imperfections", she wrote that such a fact was "no excuse to doubt its reality" and asserted that Spiritualist fanaticism was "itself a proof of the genuineness and possibility of their phenomena".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877a|loc=x–xi}}

Goodrick-Clarke noted that Blavatsky's cosmology contained all four of the prime characteristics of Western esotericism that had been identified by the scholar [[Antoine Faivre]]: "(a) correspondences between all parts of the universe, the macrocosm and microcosm; (b) living nature as a complex, plural, hierarchical, and animate whole; (c) imagination and mediations in the form of intermediary spirits, symbols, and mandalas; and (d) the experience of transmutation of the soul through purification and ascent."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=224}}

==Reception==

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote={{bracket|Blavatsky was}} one of the most significant, controversial, and prolific of modern esotericists ... It is more than evident that, whatever one thinks of the more flamboyant aspects of this remarkable and many-sided woman, she possessed a keen intellect and a wide-ranging vision of what occultism could be in the modern world.|source=—Religious studies scholar Robert Ellwood, 2005.{{sfn|Ellwood|2005|p=110}}}}

Blavatsky was a highly controversial figure,{{sfnm|1a1=Kalnitsky|1y=2003|1p=178|2a1=Ellwood|2y=2005|2p=110|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=ix,4}} and attitudes toward her were typically polarized into extreme camps, one uncritically idolizing her as a holy guru and the other expressing complete disdain for her as a charlatan.{{sfnm|1a1=Meade|1y=1980|1p=9|2a1=Kalnitsky|2y=2003|2p=178|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=4}} Washington suggested that Blavatsky generated such controversy because she courted publicity without knowing how to manage it.{{sfn|Washington|1993|p=31}} Blavatsky's devotees often try to attribute the criticism that she sustained to the fact that she attacked the vested interests of both the Christian establishment and the material scientific skeptics, rather than it being a reaction to her frauds and impostures. Thus, all critics of her are deflected by her believers, who say that "the slanders on her reputation are the signs of grace: the stigmata that all great martyrs must bear."{{sfn|Washington|1993|pp=45–46}}

Various authors have questioned the authenticity of her writings, citing evidence that they are heavily plagiarized from older esoteric sources,{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=82–89}}{{sfnm|Campbell|1980|2pp=32–34}}{{sfn|Sedgwick|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GcUFmQ-NF_0C&amp;pg=PA44 44]}}&lt;ref&gt;William Emmette Coleman, [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/colemansources1895.htm "The Sources of Madame Blavatsky's Writings"], in ''A Modern Priestess of Isis'' by Vsevolod Sergyeevich Solovyoff, London, Longmans, Green, and Co., 1895, Appendix C, pp. 353–366.&lt;/ref&gt; pronouncing her claim of the existence of masters of wisdom to be utterly false, and accusing her of being a charlatan, a false medium, and a falsifier of letters.{{sfnm|Sedgwick|2004|1p=44|Campbell|1980|2pp=32–34}}{{sfn|Hower|1995}} Her supporters claimed most of the accusations were undocumented. The Eastern literature scholar [[Arthur Lillie]] published a long list of extracts from mystic works next to extracts from Blavatsky's writings purporting to show her extensive plagiarism in his book ''Madame Blavatsky and her Theosophy''. Lillie also analysed the Mahatma letters and asserted they had been written by Blavatsky, based on certain peculiarities of expression and spelling.{{sfn|Barker|1925|pp=134–139, etc.}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997}}
The traditionalist [[René Guénon]] wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy, in which he claimed that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books, not from any supernatural masters.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=82–89}} [[Carl Jung]] virulently criticized her work. [[Agehananda Bharati]] dismissed it as "a melee of horrendous hogwash and of fertile inventions of inane esoterica". [[Mircea Eliade]] suggested that her theory of spiritual evolution contradicts the entire spirit of Eastern tradition, which is "precisely an anti-evolutionist conception of the spiritual life".{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2004|p=131}} After her death, Blavatsky continued to be accused of having fraudulently produced paranormal phenomena by skeptics such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne]],&lt;ref&gt;The Fraud of Modern "Theosophy" Exposed (1912), by J. N. Maskelyne&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]],{{sfn|Carroll|2003|p=376}} and [[James Randi]].{{sfn|Randi|2006}}

According to religious studies scholar Mark Bevir, Blavatsky "adapted the occult tradition to meet the challenge of Victorian science and morality".{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=764}}
Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] described Blavatsky as "one of the century's truly international figures", whose ideas gained "considerable popularity".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=18}}
Various biographers have noted that by the late 20th and early 21st century, Blavatsky was little known among the general public.{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=45|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=xi}} In 2006, scholar [[James A. Santucci]] nevertheless noted that she was "as visible today as any modern trend-setting guru, and she will most likely remain the most memorable and innovative esotericist of the 19th century."{{sfn|Santucci|2006|p=184}}

Parasychologist [[Nandor Fodor]] stated, "Whatever result [[psycho-analyst]]s may arrive at in the study of her {{bracket|Blavatsky's}} complex character, it must be admitted that she was a remarkable woman and that she indeed possessed psychic powers which, however, fell far short of the miraculous feats she constantly aimed at."{{sfn|Fodor|2003}} A number of authors, primarily Scholars, have suggested that Blavatsky sometimes spoke and/or wrote out of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Fodor|2003}}{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=180}}{{sfn|Сенкевич|2010|p=427}}
[[G. R. S. Mead]] wrote about Blavatsky, "I know no one who detested, more than she did, any attempt to hero-worship herself{{spnd}}she positively physically shuddered at any expression of reverence to herself{{spnd}}as a spiritual teacher; I have heard her cry out in genuine alarm at an attempt to kneel to her made by an enthusiastic admirer."{{sfn|Mead|1920}} [[Leo Klejn]] wrote about Blavatsky, "Indefatigability and energy of this woman were surprising. She had a revolutionary's merits."{{sfn|Клейн|2011}}{{efn|Theosophist Leadbeater claimed that at the time of the [[French Revolution]] Blavatsky was "in [[incarnation]] under the name of Père Joseph" and worked with "the [[Comte de S. Germain]]".{{citation|last=Leadbeater |first=Charles Webster |year=1992|title=The Hidden Life in Freemasonry |location=Whitefish, MT |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1564590268|url=http://www.anandgholap.net/Hidden_Life_In_Freemasonry-CWL.htm}}}} Another person who said Blavatsky was a remarkable woman was a former associate and publisher of the Theosophical magazine ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' 1887–1889, [[Mabel Collins]]. After leaving the movement she said "She taught me one great lesson. I learned from her how foolish, how 'gullible', how easily flattered human beings are, taken ''en masse''. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater disrespect for ''les convenances'', a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings than I had ever supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not."&lt;ref&gt;Theosophy: Origin of the New Age – C.

[[File:Leo Tolstoy The Voice of the Silence.jpg|thumb|The book ''[[The Voice of the Silence]]'' presented by Blavatsky to Leo Tolstoy]]

Blavatsky presented her book ''The Voice of the Silence'', The Seven gates, ''Two Paths'' to [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In his works, Tolstoy used the dicta from the theosophical journal ''{{lang|de|Theosophischer Wegweiser}}''.{{sfn|Толстой|1955|p=67}} In his diary, he wrote on 12 February 1903, "I am reading a beautiful theosophical journal and find many common with my understanding."{{sfn|Толстой|1935|p=155}}

==Influence==

===Theosophical movement===

According to Kalnitsky, the Theosophical movement of the nineteenth century was created and defined in the main through the astuteness and conceptual ideas provided by H.P. Blavatsky. He stated that "without her [[charismatic leader]]ship and uncompromising promotion of the Theosophical agenda, it appears unlikely that the movement could have attained its unique form."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=331}} By the time of her death in 1891 she was the acknowledged head of a community numbering nearly 100,000, with journalistic organs in London, Paris, New York and Madras.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' 1911, Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna&lt;/ref&gt; Her writings have been translated and published in a wide range of European and Asian languages.{{sfn|Cranston|1993|p=xxii}}

Blavatsky's Theosophy redirected the interest in Spiritualism toward a more coherent doctrine that included cosmology with theory of evolution in an understanding of humanity's spiritual development.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=18}} Further, it took the traditional sources of Western esotericism and globalized them by restating many of their ideas in terminology adopted from Asian religions.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=18}} Blavatsky's Theosophy was able to appeal to women by de-emphasizing the importance of gender and allowing them to take on spiritual leadership equal to that of men, thus allowing them a greater role than that permitted in traditional Christianity.{{sfn|Bednarowski|1980|p=222}}

Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.{{sfn|Melton|1990|pp=xxv–xxvi}}
During the 1920s the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] had around 7,000 members in the U.S.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=942–947}} There also was a substantial following in Asia. According to a Theosophical source, the Indian section in 2008 was said to have around 13,000 members while in the US the 2008 membership was reported at around 3,900.{{sfn|TIS|2009}}

===Western esotericism===

Blavatsky's Theosophy has been described as representing "a major factor in the modern revival" of Western esotericism.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=2}} Godwin deemed there to be "no more important figure in modern times" within the Western esoteric tradition than Blavatsky.{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xv}} For Johnson, Blavatsky was "a central figure in the nineteenth-century occult revival".{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=2}} Lachman claimed that "practically all modern occultism and esotericism" can trace its origins back to her influence.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=xi}}  Blavatsky's published Theosophical ideas, particularly those regarding Root Races, have been cited as an influence on [[Ariosophy]], the esoteric movement established in late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany and Austria by [[Guido von List]] and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=21–22|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=251}}&lt;ref name="Spielvogel1986"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hitler's Racial Ideology: Content and Occult Sources.|journal=[[Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual]]|year=1986|first=Jackson|last=Spielvogel|author2=David Redles |volume=3|at=Chapter 9|issn=0741-8450|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395043|accessdate=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Newman stated that via Ariosophy, Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas "contributed to Nazi ideology".{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=73}} Nevertheless, Lachman has asserted that Blavatsky should not be held accountable to any of the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[racism|racist]] ideas that the Ariosophists promoted, commenting that were she alive to witness the development of Ariosophy she probably would have denounced its ideas regarding race.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=251}} Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas regarding Root Races have also been cited as an influence on [[Anthroposophy]], the esoteric movement developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in early 20th-century Germany,{{sfn|Staudenmaier|2008|pp=6–7}} with Steiner's [[Anthroposophical Society]] being [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|termed a "historical offshoot" of the Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=765}}

Blavatsky's Theosophy has been cited as an influence on the [[New Age Movement]], an esoteric current that emerged in Western nations during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Bevir|1y=1994|1p=765|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Santucci|3y=2006|3p=184}}
"No single organization or movement has contributed so many components to the New Age Movement as the Theosophical Society. ... It has been the major force in the dissemination of occult literature in the West in the twentieth century."{{sfn|New Age Encyclopedia|1990|pp=458–461}}{{efn|The "Chronology of the New Age Movement" in ''New Age Encyclopedia'' begins with the formation of the Theosophical Society in 1875.{{sfn|New Age Encyclopedia|1990|loc=ix,&amp;nbsp;xxxviii}} See {{harvnb|Lewis|Melton|1992|loc=xi}}.}}
Other organizations loosely based on Theosophical texts and doctrines include the [[Agni Yoga]], and a group of religions based on Theosophy called the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]: the [["I AM" Activity]], [[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Universal Medicine]] and [[The Summit Lighthouse]], which evolved into the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R., and J. Gordon Melton, eds. (1994). ''Church Universal and Triumphant in Scholarly Perspective''. Center for Academic Publication. pp. 1–2. {{ISBN|978-0-8191-9634-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
American scholar of religion Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Blavatsky and her Theosophical Society influenced late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century academic [[linguistics]]. Josephson-Storm notes that Blavatsky's linguistic theories and typologies were widely circulated in Europe, and that influential linguists such as [[Émile-Louis Burnouf]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] either practiced Theosophy as promoted by the Theosophical Society or publicly defended its doctrines.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=119-20}} [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] is also known to have attended [[séance]]s and wrote a lengthy analysis of the Theosophical claims about linguistics and India, "la théosophie brahmanique (Brahamanic Theosophy)" while delivering his [[Cours de linguistique générale]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=119}}

===South Asian religion and politics===

Hutton suggested that Blavatsky had a greater impact in Asia than in the Western world.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=19}} Blavatsky has been cited as having inspired Hindus to respect their own religious roots.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=8}}
The Theosophical Society influenced the growth of Indian national consciousness, with prominent figures in the [[Indian independence movement]], among them Mohandas Gandhi and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], being inspired by Theosophy to study their own national heritage.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}
The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]] and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|MacMahan|2008}} while Blavatsky and Olcott took part in [[Anagarika Dharmapala]]'s revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in Ceylon.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|pp=185–188}}{{sfn|Fields|1992|pp=83–118}}

Meade stated that "more than any other single individual", Blavatsky was responsible for bringing a knowledge of Eastern religion and philosophy to the West.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=8}} Blavatsky believed that Indian religion offered answers to problems then facing Westerners; in particular, she believed that Indian religion contained an evolutionary cosmology which complemented Darwinian evolutionary theory, and that the Indian doctrine of reincarnation met many of the moral qualms surrounding [[vicarious atonement]] and eternal [[damnation]] that preoccupied 19th-century Westerners.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=748}}
In doing so, Meade believed that Blavatsky paved the way for the emergence of later movements such as the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], [[Transcendental Meditation movement]], [[Zen Buddhism]], and [[yoga]] in the West.{{sfn|Meade|1980|p=8}} Hutton believed that the two greatest achievements of Blavatsky's movement were in popularizing belief in reincarnation and in a singular divine world soul within the West.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=20}}

Blavatsky "both incorporated a number of the doctrines of eastern religions into her occultism, and interpreted eastern religions in the light of her occultism", in doing so extending a view of the "mystical East" that had already been popularized through Romanticist poetry.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|p=674}}
[[Max Müller]] scathingly criticized Blavatsky's Esoteric Buddhism. Whilst he was willing to give her credit for good motives, at least at the beginning of her career, in his view she ceased to be truthful both to herself and to others with her later "hysterical writings and performances". There is a nothing esoteric or secretive in Buddhism, he wrote, in fact the very opposite. "Whatever was esoteric was ''ipso facto'' not Buddha's teaching; whatever was Buddha's teaching was ''ipso facto'' not esoteric".{{sfn|Müller|1893a}}{{efn|For Sinnett's response and Müller's rejoinder, see {{harvnb|Sinnett|1893}} and {{harvnb|Müller|1893b}}.}} Blavatsky, it seemed to Müller, "was either deceived by others or carried away by her own imaginations."{{sfn|Müller|1902}}
Blavatsky responded to those academic specialists in Indian religion who accused her of misrepresenting it by claiming that they only understood the exoteric nature of Hinduism and Buddhism and not the inner esoteric secrets of these faiths, which she traced back to the ancient Vedas.{{sfn|Bevir|1994|pp=758–759}}

The '''history of the Jews in Jersey''' dates back to at least the 1790s.&lt;ref name=jcr-uk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shulman|first1=David|title=JCR-UK: The Channel Islands Jewish Community|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Chislands.htm|website=JCR-UK|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a community in Jersey from the 1840s. The Jersey Old Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1843 and closed around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/jersey/index.htm|title=JCR-UK: Jersey Old Hebrew Congregation (Synagogue closed) Channel Islands|work=jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently about 85 [[Jews]] living in [[Jersey]], although the number is shrinking.&lt;ref name="bbc810"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jersey's Jewish community is 'in decline'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-10981345|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=BBC News Jersey|publisher=BBC|date=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War Two==

Enemy aliens, people born in a country with which Britain was at war, were restricted from entering Britain without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F. H. &amp; C. A. G. Simkins |last=Hinsley |title=British Intelligence in the Second World War: Volume 4, Security and Counter-Intelligence |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1990 |ISBN=9780521394093}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} Accordingly, a few of Jewish faith became trapped in Jersey when the islands were occupied. In addition, a few locals decided to remain in Jersey rather than evacuate in June 1940.

Following the invasion of 1940, Jersey was forced to pass laws by the German occupiers, requiring the identification of Jews. All non Jersey and British foreigners (aliens) had already been required to register with the police, but the records did not mention their faith. An advertisement appeared in the newspaper{{which|date=October 2018}} in October 1941 calling on all Jews to identify themselves.&lt;ref name="WCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.uab.cat/ablcsma/files/2010/10/War-in-the-Channel-Islands.pdf |title=War-in-the-Channel-Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans issued identity cards to everyone, which listed their nationality and faith.

"Jews", under the Nazi definition, identified on Jersey:
* Victor Emanuel 4/9/1870; British by naturalisation, born Germany; resident in Jersey for 2 years
* John Finkelstein 12/3/1882; Romanian; resident in Jersey for 8 years
* Samuel Selig Simon 3/6/1862; British, born in Jersey
* Nathan Davidson 16/8/1881; Egyptian by naturalisation, born Romania; resident in Jersey for 5 years
* Marianne Blampied 27/8/1887; British by marriage, born Holland; resident in Jersey for 2 years
* John Jacobs 29/9/1883; British; resident in Jersey for 17 years
* Theresa Marks 15/10/1862; born in Jersey
* Ruby Ellen Still 4/7/1887; British; resident in Jersey for 30 years 
* Hyam Goldman 18/5/1869; British; resident in Jersey for 32 years 
* Hedwig Bercu 23/6/1919; Romanian, born Austria; resident in Jersey for 2 years 
* Margarete Hurban 16/4/1909; German, born Austria; resident in Jersey for 3 years 
* Esther Pauline Lloyd 31/7/1906; British; resident in Jersey for 3 years

The following were shipped out of Jersey in February 1943, following a report by Dr. Casper dated 17 June 1942, and sent to Lager [[Compiègne]] in France: 
* Alfred Bertie Still (husband of Ruby) and then to [[Laufen, Germany]], a survivor
* Ruby Ellen Still and then to [[Biberach an der Riss]] Ilag V-B, a survivor
* Michael Lewis Still (son of Alfred and Ruby) and then to [[Biberach an der Riss]] Ilag V-B, a survivor
* John Max Finkelstein and then to [[Buchenwald Concentration Camp]] and finally in April 1945 to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]], where he was among the survivors. 
* Esther Pauline Lloyd and then to [[Biberach an der Riss]] Ilag V-B, returned to Jersey in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Fraser |title=The Jews Of The Channel Islands And The Rule Of Law, 1940-1945: |ISBN=9781903900284 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}
The camps in Laufen and Biberach were civilian camps containing many Channel Island civilians.

Nathan Davidson was admitted to the mental hospital in February 1943 and died in 1944.&lt;ref name=WCI/&gt;

==Current==
After the war, there was a revival of Jewish life in Jersey, founded in 1961 with its synagogue opened in 1972, is located in [[Saint Brélade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/jersey1/index.htm|title=JCR-UK: Jersey Jewish Congregation (Synagogue, active) Channel Islands|work=jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Jewish population was estimated at about 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_04155.html|title=CHANNEL ISLANDS |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently about 85 [[Jews]] living in [[Jersey]], although this number is declining.&lt;ref name=bbc810/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Hymnology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕμνος ''hymnos'', "song of praise" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is the [[scholar]]ly study of [[religious]] [[song]], or the [[hymn]], in its many aspects, with particular focus on [[choir|choral]] and [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregational]] song. It may be more or less clearly distinguished from ''[[Hymn|hymnody]]'', the creation and practice of such song. Hymnologists, such as [[Erik Routley]], may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and [[hymn tune]]s over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship.

Hymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in ''[[A Dictionary of Hymnology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Julian, ed., (1902/1985), ''A Dictionary of Hymnology'', Grand Rapids, MI:  Kregel.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[John D. Julian]], which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of [[hymnographer]]s, and very little with the [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of these hymns, or with the [[hymn tune]]s to which these are sung.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7735">'''Idolatry in Judaism''' is prohibited. [[Judaism]] holds that [[idolatry]] is not limited to the worship of an [[idolatry|idol]] itself, but also worship involving any artistic representations of [[God in Judaism|God]]. In addition it is forbidden to derive benefit (''hana'ah'') from anything dedicated to idolatry.  However, [[aniconism in Judaism]] has not prevented traditions of [[Secular Jewish culture#Visual arts and architecture|Jewish art]] at various periods.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
==Judaism's view of idolatry==
Judaism had historically stood out from other faiths in the ancient world because of its strict monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel C. Harlow|editor=John Joseph Collins|title=The "Other" in Second Temple Judaism: Essays in Honor of John J. Collins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQyVt9o2SKMC&amp;pg=PA303|date=8 February 2011|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-6625-7|pages=302–}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Judaism idolatry is the ultimate betrayal of God's relationship with humanity. It is also the ultimate metaphysical error. Idolatry was also reckoned as ''avodah zerah'' (″foreign worship″). Jewish identity in the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations was shaped by the rejection of idolatry. The strict avoidance of idolatry affected Jewish daily life in terms of cuisine, coinage, socialisations and participation in games. Jewish laws's strict prohibition of idolatry meant that Jewish movements through areas containing images were inhibited. By the first century AD Jews had responded to the idolatry of non-Jews through satire and polemics. Jewish writers used the works of their own scriptures as well as the works of Greek philosophers to denounce idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel C. Harlow|editor=John Joseph Collins|title=The "Other" in Second Temple Judaism: Essays in Honor of John J. Collins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQyVt9o2SKMC&amp;pg=PA303|date=8 February 2011|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-6625-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Judaism has never sought to impose the faith on non-Jews, it does require the elimination of idolatry from the world. According to [[Maimonides]], [[Moses]] was order to compel all the world to accept the [[Noahide laws]] and end idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuven Firestone|title=Holy War in Judaism: The Fall and Rise of a Controversial Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5WE-Ue8z70C&amp;pg=PT131|date=2 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-997715-4|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of idolatry was a sensitive one, because idolatrous actions had brought destruction in the wilderness, according to the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Liong Seng Phua|title=Idolatry and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8zeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=4 December 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-28910-0|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jews in general abhorred idolatry, some members of the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] did engage in idolatrous actions. Such Jews often objectified Yahweh, visit and worshiped in pagan temples and abandoned their Jewish heritage. Some Jews differed with others on what defined an idolatrous practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Liong Seng Phua|title=Idolatry and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8zeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=4 December 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-28910-0|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Atapanus and Pseudo-Aristeas some Jews were idolatrous on the cognitive level. Evidence from papyri and inscriptions also indicate that some Jews did not object to idolatry even while they clung on to their Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Liong Seng Phua|title=Idolatry and Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8zeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|date=4 December 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-28910-0|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah and Talmud have defined idolatry. It includes worshiping an idol in the manner of its worshipers. This is called ″customary worship″. Another criterion is worshiping the idol with acts which are for worshiping God in the Temple. These include animal sacrifice, incense burning and sprinkling blood. Performing one of these acts means the performer is dubbed an idolater. The third creterion of idolatry is prostration. this includes bowing down with at least the head or knees on the ground. Acts such as kissing, embracing and honoring are forbidden but are not considered to come under idolatry. The performer of such an act does not receive capital punishment unlike the idolater in Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Halbertal|author2=Avishai Margalit|title=Idolatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UufA8HSjmMC&amp;pg=PA210|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44313-6|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avodah Zarah'' governed Jewish interactions with idolaters. this meant there were certain restrictions on business dealings with idolaters for the days in proximity to idolatrous festivals. It was forbidden to provide or take any benefit from idolatrous actions. These regulations had a strong impact on Jewish business dealings with Christians during the [[Middle Ages]]. Because Jews regarded Christians as idolaters because of Christian doctrines such as the trinity, Jews would not do business dealings with Christians on Sundays. Business dealings with Muslims were not affected because Jews regarded the Muslims as pure monotheists like themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Halbertal|author2=Avishai Margalit|title=Idolatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UufA8HSjmMC&amp;pg=PA210|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44313-6|pages=210–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam is a religion that is more concerned with social order and law than with [[Religion and mythology|religious myths]].&lt;ref name=leeming&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Islamic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPrhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|pages=207–211|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' identifies a number of traditional narratives as "Islamic myths".&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt; These include a [[creation myth]] and a [[Afterlife#Islam|vision of afterlife]], which Islam shares to some extent with the other [[Abrahamic religions]], as well as the distinctively Islamic story of the ''[[Kaaba]]''.&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;

The traditional biography of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], which plays a central role in Islamic teachings, is generally recognized as being largely historical in nature, and Islam depends less on mythology than [[Jewish mythology|Judaism]] and [[Christian mythology|Christianity]].&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt; However, the canonical narrative includes two key supernatural events: the divine revelation of the [[Quran]] and the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] — the night journey to Jerusalem followed by the ascension to the [[Seven Heavens|Seventh Heaven]].&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt; In addition, Islamic scriptures contain a number of legendary narratives about biblical characters, which diverge from Jewish and Christian traditions in some details.&lt;ref name=leeming/&gt;

== Religion and mythology ==
{{Main|Religion and mythology}}

The discussion of religion in terms of mythology is a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "myth" is commonly used with connotations of falsehood,&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse.

It may refer to "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture"&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; or to stories which a given culture regards as true (as opposed to fables, which it recognizes as fictitious).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 1, 8-10; ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' Devid Leeming writes:&lt;ref name=leeming=preface/&gt;

{{quote|I have treated the sacred narratives of the "great religions", including the monotheistic Abrahamic religions, as myths, not to deprecate those religions, but simply because to a believer in one religion the stories -- especially the supernatural ones -- of another religion tend to be seen as myth rather than history.}}

==Biblical stories in the Quran==
{{main|Biblical and Quranic narratives}}
[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 298a.jpg|thumb|The Prophet and his companions advancing on Mecca, attended by the angels Gabriel, Michae, Israfil and Azrael. An illustration from [[Siyer-i Nebi]].]]

[[Islam]] incorporates many biblical events and heroes into its own mythology. Stories about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] (Moses)&lt;ref&gt;Quran 17:2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham)&lt;ref&gt;Quran 14:35-52&lt;/ref&gt; form parts of Islam's scriptures. The [[Quran]] retells in detail the Jewish tale of [[Joseph in Islam|Yūsuf]] (Joseph), who was sold to an Egyptian,&lt;ref&gt;Quran 12:7-100&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian tale of Mary, the mother of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Quran 19:16-33"&gt;Quran 19:16-33&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, it adds original details and an Islamic interpretation: for instance, in the Islamic version, Jesus speaks while he is still an infant,&lt;ref&gt;Quran 19:30-33&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a miraculously-conceived human prophet, not the incarnation of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quran 19:35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic creation narrative==
===Creation of world===
{{See also|Genesis creation narrative}}
According to the Quran, the skies and the earth were joined together as one "unit of creation", after which they were "cloven asunder".&lt;ref name = "atarmw"&gt;{{cite qur'an|21|30|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~gaud/bio301/content/iscrst.htm|title=Islam Creation Story|website=www2.nau.edu|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the parting of both, they simultaneously came into their present shape after going through a phase when they were smoke-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite qur'an|41|11|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Quran states that the process of creation took 6 ''ayam'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite qur'an|11|7|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the Quran, the word ''yawm'' (often translated to "day") is used loosely to mean era, for example Surah 70 verse 4: "The angels and spirit will ascend to Him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the ''[[mufassir]]s'', Islam aknowledges three different types of creation:
* '''Ex-nihilo in time''': A position especially hold by most classical scholars: God existed alone in eternity, until God's command "[[Kun (Islamic term)|Be]]", thereupon the world came into existence. This world is absolute distinct from God. Accordingly, the world was neither created out of His own essence nor did God created the world out of a primarial matter which preceded the creation, but created by His sheer command not bound on the laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Husam Muhi Eldin al- Alousi ''The Problem of Creation in Islamic Thought, Qur'an, Hadith, Commentaries, and Kalam''National Printing and Publishing, Bagdad, 1968 p. 29 and96&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Theory of Emanation''': Found especially among scholars such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Ibn Sina]]: Accordingly, the world was created out of nothing, but not in time. The world was eternal, but temporary in essence.&lt;ref&gt;Husam Muhi Eldin al- Alousi ''The Problem of Creation in Islamic Thought, Qur'an, Hadith, Commentaries, and Kalam''National Printing and Publishing, Bagdad, 1968 p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Creation out of primordial matter''': Maintined by scholars such as [[Ibn Taimiyya]]: God fashioned the whole world out of primordial matters, the waters and the smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Husam Muhi Eldin al- Alousi ''The Problem of Creation in Islamic Thought, Qur'an, Hadith, Commentaries, and Kalam''National Printing and Publishing, Bagdad, 1968 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of life===
The Quran states that God created the world and the cosmos, made all the creatures that walk, swim, crawl, and fly on the face of the earth from water.&lt;ref name = "atarmw"/&gt; He made the angels, and the sun, moon and the stars to dwell in the universe. He poured down the rain in torrents, and broke up the soil to bring forth the corn, the grapes and other vegetation; the olive and the palm, the fruit trees and the grass. Traditionally, the earth is held to be inhabited by several other creatures, like the [[jinn]], before [[God in Islam|God]] created humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Brannon Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&amp;C Black 2002 {{ISBN|9780826449566}} Page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

God molded clay, earth, sand, and water into a model of a human. He breathed life and power into it, and it evolved into life. And this first human was called [[Adam in Islam|Adam]]. God took Adam to live in a [[Jannah|Paradise]]. God taught Adam the names of all the creatures, and then commanded all the angels to bow down before Adam. All of them bowed but [[Iblis]] refused to obey.

God placed Adam in a beautiful garden in Paradise, telling him that he could eat whatever it wanted except the fruit of a [[Forbidden fruit|forbidden tree]]. [[Satan#Islam|Satan]] tempted Adam to disobey God, and eat the fruit. When Adam had disobeyed God, God cast Adam out of Paradise. Muslim scholars are divided whether the Paradise from which [[Adam]] was expelled is the paradise in the heavens awarded to the righteous at the day of judgement or a paradise on earth.

Islam breaks somewhat with Judaism and Christianity in that Eve is not mentioned in the Quran{{Clarify|reason=Is she not mentioned at all or just in the context of why they ate the fruit?|date=February 2018}} and in explaining why Adam ate the forbidden fruit. In the Hebrew account in Genesis, a [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|snake]] tempts them [[Adam and Eve]] to eat the fruit. While the [[Genesis creation narrative]] does not explicitly identify the snake with Satan, that Satan and the snake are the same being is claimed in the New Testament, in Revelation 12:9 and 20:2. In Genesis, Eve was tempted but Adam was not.&lt;ref&gt;2 Cor 11:3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 Tim 2:13, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Quran states explicitly that [[Shaitan]] (Satan) tempted Adam to eat the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Quran 7:20&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian traditions, which sees Satan as rebelling against God, Islamic tradition identifies Shaitan's disobedience as a result of his superior nature out of fire, in contrast to the nature of humans,&lt;ref&gt;Quran 7:11-12&lt;/ref&gt; since [[islamic view of angels|angels in Islam]] do not rebel against God.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_1_50/muslim_belief_in_angels.htm|title=The Muslim Belief in Angels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; God cast Iblis out of his paradise, and Iblis vowed to tempt Adams generations to corruption and to disobey God.

==The ''Kaaba''==
According to Islamic mythology, God instructed [[Adam]] to construct a building (called the ''[[Kaaba]]'') to be the earthly counterpart of the House of Heaven and that [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] ''(Abraham)'' and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismail]] ''(Ishmael)'' later rebuilt it on its original foundations after was destroyed in the flood of [[Noah in Islam|Nuh]] ''(Noah)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAdbCq8HQBIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA|title=The Shade of Swords: Jihad and the Conflict Between Islam and Christianity|author=M.

The ''Kaaba'' was originally intended as a symbolic house for the one monotheistic God. However, after Ibrahim's death, people started to fill the ''Kaaba'' with pagan idols. When [[Muhammad]] conquered Mecca after his exile, he removed the idols from the ''Kaaba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_76.html|title=Cmje|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201161759/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_76.html|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/260|title=Bridging Cultures Bookshelf: Muslim Journeys|website=bridgingcultures.neh.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the ''Kaaba'' is now empty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideislam.wisc.edu/2012/02/important-sites-the-kaba/|title=Important Sites: The Kaba|date=2012-02-14|work=Inside Islam|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now stands as an important pilgrimage site, which all [[Muslim]]s are supposed to visit at least once if they are able (''[[Hajj]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e771|title=Hajj - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Muslims are supposed to pray five times a day while facing in the ''Kaaba''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s direction ([[Qibla|''qibla'']]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephens.edu/arh101glossary/?glossary=qibla|title=qibla {{!}} Art History Glossary|website=blog.stephens.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inako 2006-10-09.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An ''itako'' at the autumn Inako Taisai festival at [[Mount Osore]], Aomori Prefecture, Japan.]]

{{nihongo||イタコ|'''Itako'''|lead=yes}}, also known as {{nihongo||市子|ichiko}} or {{nihongo||オガミサマ|ogamisama}}, are blind women who train to become [[mediumship|spiritual mediums]] in Japan.&lt;ref name="Fackler-NYTimes" /&gt; Training involves severe ascetic practices, after which the woman is said to be able to communicate with Japanese Shinto spirits, ''[[kami]]'', and the spirits of the dead.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; ''Itako'' perform rituals tied to communication with the dead&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; and [[divination]].&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt; The practice has been on the decline, with only 20 living ''itako'' in Japan, all more than 40 years old.&lt;ref name="Fackler-NYTimes" /&gt;

Training for ''itako'' traditionally began at a very young age, and included ritualized exposure to cold water. Hundreds of buckets of ice water could be poured on their bodies over the course of a few days.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; This education for ''itako'' takes about three years, and also includes memorization of songs and sutras.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; At the end of this training, a ceremony is held, announcing the marriage of the ''itako'' and her patron spirit.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Scholars suggest that blindness has long been associated with spiritual powers in Japan.&lt;ref name="deFerranti" /&gt;{{rp|24}} Furthermore, options for those with severe vision impairment to become self-sufficient were limited in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Breen2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breen|first1=John|last2=Teeuwen|first2=Mark|title=Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136827044}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190}} This led many families to send young blind women to ''itako'' apprenticeships&lt;ref name="Breen2013"/&gt;{{rp|190}} up until the start of the Meiji era, which outlawed ''itako'' rituals outright.&lt;ref name="Josephson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ānanda|title=The invention of religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226412351}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

Today, ''itako'' are most commonly associated with [[Mount Osore|Mt. Osore]] in Aomori prefecture. There, ''itako'' gather for an annual festival to channel the dead for thousands of tourists.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|31}} ''Itako'' perform ceremonies to communicate with spirits of the recently deceased,&lt;ref name="Blacker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|editor1-last=Earhart|editor1-first=Byron|title=Religion in the Japanese experience : sources and interpretations|date=1997|publisher=Wadsworth Pub.

== History ==
''Itako'' are always blind, or have very poor vision.&lt;ref name="Horii" /&gt;{{rp|279}} In pre-modern Japanese society, blindness was widely associated with spiritual capabilities; after the introduction of Buddhism, it was considered evidence of a karmic debt.&lt;ref name="deFerranti" /&gt;{{rp|24}} These beliefs lent an aura of "ambiguous sacred status"&lt;ref name="deFerranti" /&gt;{{rp|24}} to the blind. 
During the [[Edo period|Edo era]], women were expected to contribute to family wages.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; However, blind women of the era had limited opportunities to support themselves or their families.&lt;ref name="Breen2013"/&gt;{{rp|190}} The reputation of blindness and spiritual abilities led many families to seek training for young girls, typically aged 11 to 13, in a folk religious tradition in which the young girl was wed to a deity, and there on able to communicate with spirits.&lt;ref name="Breen2013" /&gt;{{rp|190}} Despite this power, blind women who became ''itako'' were still considered to occupy one of the lowest social strata within the community, especially those who relied on community support for financing their training.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

''Itako'' are thought to have risen from an ascetic cult of the Edo era, the ''yamabushi,'' male monks who were encountered during popular pilgrimages to the Kumano mountains in the 9th–10th centuries.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|2}} These monks had wives who traveled with them, selling amulets and channeling the dead through trances. Meanwhile, women in the north performed the dances and rituals of shrine ''[[miko]]''.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Over time, the two groups merged, creating the modern concept of ''itako''.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 1873, the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji era government]] attempted to ban ''itako'' and their associated ''kuchiyose'' rituals as a means of encouraging the adoption of modernized medicine.&lt;ref name="Josephson"/&gt;{{rp|179}} An estimated 200 ''itako'' were practicing at the time.&lt;ref name="Goozner" /&gt; The law led to the arrest of mediums across Japan; by 1875, ''itako'' and their healing rituals were specifically targeted and could be arrested on sight.&lt;ref name="Josephson" /&gt;{{rp|181}} Arrests of ''itako'' were based on charges such as spreading superstition, to obstruction of medical practices.&lt;ref name="Ikegami"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ikegami|first1=Yoshimasa|title=Local Newspaper Coverage of Folk Shamans in Aomori PrefectureI|url=http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/cpjr/folkbeliefs/ikegami.html|website=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper accounts of these arrests indicate that ''itako'' were commonly attributing illnesses to possession of the ill by cats or foxes.&lt;ref name="Ikegami" /&gt; Newspaper reports at the time tended to refer to ''itako'' in negative terms, and often associated the arrest of ''itako'' and the arrest of prostitutes. One editorial wrote, "These miko disgorge reckless and empty gossip, squeezing the pockets of the common people, and prostitutes tempt loose men and rob them of their money. While the professions are different, they are the same in disrupting public morals and deceiving people of their possessions."&lt;ref name="Ikegami" /&gt;

Public support, however, continued. Shortly before, and after, the surrender of Japan in 1945, many families sought out ''itako'' to communicate with the war dead, particularly those who were lost in combat abroad. Just before the end of the war, ''itako'' were also called upon to conduct "living seances" (''ikiguchi'') with soldiers overseas.&lt;ref name="Ikegami" /&gt; An editorial by intellectual Orikuchi Shinobu at the time note that the ''itako'' in Aomori prefecture had "not been subject to prohibition", in contrast to ''itako'' and shaman in other prefectures, and that "persecution would be counterproductive".&lt;ref name="Ikegami" /&gt; News stories reported locals occasionally interfering with the police attempts to arrest prominent ''itako''.&lt;ref name="Ikegami" /&gt;

Today, the small number of living ''itako'' gather annually during the [[Bon Festival|Obon]] holiday at [[Mount Osore|Mt. Osore]] in Aomori, known locally as "Mount Dread". The gathering has received televised news coverage since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schattschneider|first1=Ellen|title=Immortal wishes : labor and transcendence on a Japanese sacred mountain|date=2003|publisher=Duke University press|location=Durham (N. C.)|isbn=9780822330622}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

== Description ==
''Itako'' typically carry several artifacts. These include the {{nihongo|"box outside of Buddhist law"|外法箱|gehobako}}, a box which contains secret items representative of a protective spirit, or ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Schiffer" /&gt;{{rp|180}}&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|66}} Blacker describes an old folk tale tying the box, and its contents, to an "inugami" ritual.&lt;ref name="Blacker 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=Collected Writings of Modern Western Scholars on Japan|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} In this ritual, a dog is buried up to its neck, and starved, while staring at food too far for it to reach. The ''itako'' place the animal's skull into a box and offer its spirit a daily offering of food. In return, the spirit enters homes of her patrons and provides detailed information about the dead.&lt;ref name="Blacker 2013" /&gt;{{rp|181}}

''Itako'' also carry a black cylinder, often [[bamboo]], containing another protective charm and their certificate of ''itako'' training.&lt;ref name="Schiffer" /&gt;{{rp|180}}&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|66}} The cylinders are said to be used to trap the spirits of animals that attempt to possess a human being.&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|66}} Finally, the women carry {{nihongo|beaded necklaces|いらたか念珠|irataka nenju}}, which are used in ceremonies and made up of beads and animal bones.&lt;ref name="Schiffer" /&gt;{{rp|180}}&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|66}} The bones are typically jaw bones of deer or foxes, but have also included bear teeth, eagle claws, or shells.&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|66}}

==Definition==
The term "itako" has associations with beggars, and some mediums reject the use of the term.&lt;ref name="Dirks"&gt;{{cite book|title=In near ruins : cultural theory at the end of the century|date=1998|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816631230|editor-last=Dirks|location=Minneapolis|page=|chapter=5|last1=Ivy|first1=Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} One theory suggests the term derived from "eta no ko", or "child of the ''eta''", referring to the Japanese [[burakumin]] social class who were once associated with death.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|116}} Other possible derivations include the use of wood pieces, ''ita'', for the ceremonial writing of the name of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

The ''itako'' (then ''ita'') are first referenced in poem #1773 of the ancient [[Nara period]] poem collection, the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.&lt;ref name="Naumann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naumann|first1=Nelly|title=The itako of North-Eastern Japan and Their Chants|journal=Nachrichten der Gesellschaft für Natur- und Völkerkunde Ostasiens|date=1992|volume=152|url=https://www2.uni-hamburg.de/oag/noag/noag1992_4.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Anthropologist Wilhem Schiffer describes a local legend about the practice of recruiting blind women into [[shamanism]]. According to this legend, the practice began in an undetermined era when blind children were killed every 5 years. A local official, impressed with a blind woman's ability to describe her environment despite her lack of vision, determined that the blind must have special powers. Rather than being killed, he pressed for the blind to study [[necromancy]].&lt;ref name="Schiffer" /&gt;{{rp|182}}

''Itako'' is the common term for these women in [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] and [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]] prefectures, but the term can vary by location. They are also commonly called ''ogamisama'' in southern Iwate and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] prefectures; ''miko, mogodo, onakama'' or ''waka'' in [[Yamagata Prefecture|Yamagata]] prefecture; and ''waka'' in [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] and [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]].&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

===''Kamisama''===
There are similarities to another group of shaman women, the ''kamisama''. Both ''kamisama'' and ''itako'' believe in a marriage to a spirit, and both follow the Buddhist deity [[Fudo Myo-o|Fudo Myoo]].&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|32}} However, kamisama are sighted, typically claiming prophetic powers in the aftermath of a traumatic disease.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|31}} Unlike ''itako'', they are associated with small Shinto shrines, which they may operate themselves. Kamisama tend to view ''itako'' with suspicion, though ethnographers have found that kamisama often associate themselves with ''itako'' and ''itako'' traditions.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Rituals==
[[File:Osorezan Aomori.JPG|thumb|Osorezan and Lake Usori. Aomori prefecture, Japan.]]
''Itako'' are said to have the ability to communicate with both kami and the dead.&lt;ref name="Blacker"/&gt; An ''itako'''s role varies depending on the spirit she is connected to.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; Ceremonies vary by prefecture, but typically ''itako'' are called upon to communicate with kami spirits to garner favor or advisement on harvests, or to communicate with the spirits of the dead, particularly the recently deceased.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; The rituals typically take place on [[Mount Osore]], which locally associated with this "traditional" ritual, though evidence suggests ''itako'' withdrew to the mountain to escape pressure from the [[Meiji period|Meiji state]].&lt;ref name="Ivy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivy|first1=Marilyn|title=Discourses of the vanishing modernity, phantasm, Japan|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226388342}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174}} The ceremony had traditionally taken place in the ancestral home of the dead.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt;

Ceremonies draw on a series of Shinto practices, but most often call upon Buddhist gods.&lt;ref name="Goozner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goozner|first1=Merrill|title=Japan`s Blind Women Seers Becoming An Endangered Species|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-18/news/9204250038_1_blind-women-japan-sun-goddess-amaterasu|accessdate=12 March 2016|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=18 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chants of the itako are similar to secret practices of [[Yoshida Shinto]], and may be tied to practices at [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise shrine]].&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

Itako perform the ceremony using [[Tsugaru dialect]], and a series of "[[taboo]] words"&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt;{{rp|186}} that are not understood by all native Japanese speakers. Locals, who understand the Tsugaru dialect, are therefore often employed as translators for the ''itako''.&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt;{{rp|186}} Folklorists suggest that this allows the ''itako'' to avoid any need to personalize the communication from the departed spirit.&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt;{{rp|186}}

===''Kuchiyose''===
The ritual of contact with the dead, {{Nihongo||口寄せ|kuchiyose}}, has been named an [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage asset of Japan]].&lt;ref name="McClatchy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Benefits of shaman on patients studied|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-149062964.html|accessdate=9 March 2016|agency=McClatchy-Tribune Information Services|publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun|subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual has been documented as early as 1024 AD in the {{Nihongo||栄花物語|[[Eiga monogatari]]}}.&lt;ref name="Horii"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horii|first1=Ichiro|title=Shamanism in Japan|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=December 1975|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2386}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|280}}

The ritual is held during a funeral or anniversary of a death,&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt; though some ''itako'' claim the dead cannot be contacted until 100 days have passed.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|105}} Once the spirit communicates its own status in the afterlife, patrons receive advice and predictions for the future.&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt;

Visitors to the ''itako'' typically bring fruit, candy or other gifts, and offer the age, relationship, and gender of the deceased, but not the name.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

During the ceremony, purifying rice and salt are scattered, and a spirit is said to enter the body of the ''itako''. Gods are called forward and asked to compel the desired spirit or ghost to come forward.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt; Calling the dead usually involves calling upon a hierarchy of spirits in reverse order, beginning with kami and rising to the level of ghosts.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt;   Then, the local kami is called forward to protect those attending the ceremony. During the summoning of the deceased (''hotoke oroshi''), the itako sings songs, called ''kudoki'', said to be relayed by the contacted spirit.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miura|first1=Teeji|editor1-link=Itako and the Azusayumi|title=Asian Musics in an Asian Perspective: Report of Asian Traditional Performing Arts|date=1977|publisher=Heibonsha|location=Tokyo, Japan|pages=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the dead arrives and shares memories of its life and the afterlife, answering questions for patrons.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|105}} Then, the spirits are sent away, and songs are sung about "hell, insects, and birds."&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miura" /&gt; A final spell is repeated three times: “The old fox in the Shinoda woods, when he cries during the day, then he does not cry in the night”.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The interaction lasts about 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

As recently as 1962, ethnographers observing ''itako'' rituals noted a shaking of hands and use of special voices when channeling the dead.&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairchild|first1=William P.|title=Shamanism in Japan (1–122)|journal=Asian Ethnology|date=1962|volume=21|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/457}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}} More recent observers note that ''itako'' sang in their own voices, without any visual performance of entering a trance-state. The ritual songs are typically repeated to many patrons, suggesting that the ''itako'' are understood, even by their patrons, to be theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Ivy" /&gt; {{rp|176}} Nonetheless, a survey of 670 people with chronic illnesses in the area around Osorezan Mountain, home of many ''itako'', showed that 35% of those patients had visited ''itako'' to take part in a ''kuchiyose'' ritual.&lt;ref name="McClatchy" /&gt;

===''Mizuko kuyō''===
{{nihongo||水子供養|[[Mizuko kuyō]]}} is a ceremony performed for mothers who have lost their children in childbirth or through abortions.&lt;ref name="Breen2013" /&gt;{{rp|198}} The ritual, Buddhist in nature, gives the unborn or stillborn child a name, and then calls upon the protection of the spirit Jizo. The ceremony is considered by many to be a scam preying on grieving mothers, owing to its relatively recent origins in the 1960s. Others, however, see the practice as addressing a spiritual need created by Japan's legalization of abortion in 1948.&lt;ref name="NYTimesSteinfels"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinfels|first1=Peter|title=Beliefs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/15/us/beliefs-891892.html|accessdate=12 March 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=15 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Year Ebisu===
''Itako'' must learn a chant known as the {{nihongo|New Year Ebisu|正月えべす|shōgatsu-ebesu}}, a celebration of the New Year delivered in travels at the start of Spring.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The chant mixes Buddhist references (such as peacocks) and aspects of the Japanese national anthem. Scholars suggest the language reveals the chant is derived from songs associated with the ''[[hinin]]''.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

===''Kamioroshi''===
The {{Nihongo||神降ろし|kamioroshi}} ritual is a musical performance dedicated to Oshirasama, a god of family.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt; This ritual includes the performance of a song describing a horse who falls in love with a young human girl and is flayed alive; the girl falls ill, but is cured when the horse descends from heaven and flies her to India.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The story is told through a dance including sticks with the heads of a horse and human girl on each side.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|10}} This dance is known as the Ebisu Mai, or the "God of wealth dance," and it is said that the dolls become possessed by kami spirits during the performance.&lt;ref name="Fairchild1962" /&gt;{{rp|67}}

===Musical performance===
''Itako'' are associated with the {{nihongo|[[Azusa Yumi|catalpa bow]]|梓弓|azusa yumi}}, a plucked instrument with ties to summoning the dead. The necromantic ritual of plucked instruments is found in the earliest document of Japan's history, the ''[[Kojiki]]'', which describes a [[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'s sound in conjunction with the possession of a medium and the channeling of the dead. Another poem describes the sound of the instrument as a reflection of his wife's spirit possessing the instrument.&lt;ref name="deFerranti"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Ferranti|first1=Hugh|title=The Last Biwa Singer: A Blind Musician in History, Imagination and Performance|date=2009|publisher=East Asia Program, Cornell University|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=9781942242437|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781942242437}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://muse.jhu.edu/ Project MUSE]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The ''[[biwa hoshi]]'', itinerant blind priests, have a similar history with the instrument.&lt;ref name="deFerranti" /&gt;{{rp|32}}

The chant which opens the ''kamioroshi'' ceremony makes several references to the plucked bow. The chant announces that the first pluck of the string calls down the gods of the village, the second calls down the gods of the prefecture, and the third calls the gods of all prefectures in Japan. Additional notes summon more powerful gods, responsible for ever-increasing spans of land and spiritual realms.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|6}} These gods are sent away in reverse order at the end of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Naumann" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Training==
Women usually enter ''itako'' training at a young age, prior to menstruation, at the encouragement of her parents.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; Before the introduction of special education programs in Japan, this was a choice made by the family to assure that a blind daughter could contribute to the household.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; Adopting the role of a [[Psychic|medium]] was seen as an acceptable means for blind women to contribute to their local village and household, and avoid becoming a financial burden to their families.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

Training for ''itako'' was often paid for with contributions from villagers, rather than the family.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; Common aspects of initiation practices for these women were seen among those training in Yamagata, Aomori, and Miyagi prefectures in the 1920s and 1930s. They are trained in various practices, including memorization of [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] prayers and [[sutra]]s. Training typically involved cold-water {{nihongo|purifying baths|水垢離|mizugori}}, which in its most extreme form can involve complete, sustained drenching by ice-cold water for a period of several days.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; These rituals are observed by the community, which prays for a fast resolution through the early arrival of a marrying deity.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

Apprenticeship typically lasts three years, and involves heavy rote memorization and feats of physical [[Ritual purification|purification]].&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; During this time, the ''itako''-in-training is essentially adopted by a practicing shaman, and performs household work for the family.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

===Initiation ceremony===
Ahead of the initiation ceremony, ''itako'' dress in a white [[kimono]] for several days, similar to a burial gown.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt; She is not permitted to consume grain, salt, or meat, and must avoid artificial heat for three weeks before the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/bm/bm02/bm0205/bm020511.htm The Itako—a Spiritual Occupation for Blind Japanese Girls]&lt;/ref&gt; The lead-up to the ceremony had been described as incorporating "sleeplessness, semi-starvation and intense cold."&lt;ref name="Blacker1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blacker|first= Carmen|title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|year=2005|orig-year=1975|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|place=Richmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}

This process usually leads to a loss of consciousness, which is described as the moment in which [[Fudo-Myoo|Fudo Myoo]], or Nittensama, or some other deity, has taken possession of the ''itako'''s body.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; In some cases, the ''itako'' must collapse while naming the spirit.&lt;ref name="Kawamura"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawamura|first1=Kunimitsu|title=The Life of a Shamaness: Scenes from the Shamanism of Northeastern Japan|url=http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/cpjr/folkbeliefs/kawamura.html|website=Kokugakuin|accessdate=1 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919011355/http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/cpjr/folkbeliefs/kawamura.html|archivedate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the names of various deities are written and scattered, while the ''itako'' sweeps over them with a brush until one of them is caught, which denotes the name of the possessing spirit.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

At this point, a wedding ceremony, ''kamizukeshiki'',&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Itako no Kuchiyose|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_JPN6.html|website=UNESCO Asian-Pacific Cultural Center|publisher=UNESCO Asian-Pacific Cultural Center|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is performed as an initiation.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; The ''itako'' trainee is dressed in a red wedding dress, and red rice and fish are consumed to celebrate her marriage to the spirit.&lt;ref name="Blacker" /&gt; It is suggested that the ceremony signals the death of the ''itako'''s life as a burden and her rebirth as a contributing member of the community.&lt;ref name="Kawamura" /&gt;

==Contemporary ''itako''==
[[File:Jizo at Osorezan.jpg|thumb|A statue of Jizo at Osorezan]]
In contemporary Japan, ''itako'' are on the decline. In 2009, less than 20 remained, all over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Fackler-NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fackler|first1=Martin|title=As Japan’s Mediums Die, Ancient Tradition Fades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21japan.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=1 February 2016|archiveurl=[http://www.countryakitas.com]/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21japan.html|archivedate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Itako'' are increasingly viewed with skepticism and disdain{{why|date=April 2016}}, and contemporary education standards have all but eradicated the need for specialized training for the blind.&lt;ref name="Fackler-NYTimes" /&gt;

An annual festival is held on Mt. Osore beside the Entsuji Buddhist temple, which hangs signs disavowing any connection to the ''itako''.&lt;ref name="Schiffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiffer|first1=Wilhelm|title=Necromancers in the Tohoku|journal=Journal: Contemporary Religions in Japan|date=1967|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/3186}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Dirks" /&gt;{{rp|103}} The festival is held July 20–24, coinciding with the [[Bon Festival|Obon]] holiday, which is the traditional day on which spirits of the dead return.&lt;ref name="Schiffer" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Bocking"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bocking|first1=Brian|title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135797393|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also attend the summer festival at Kawakura Sainokawara.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|31}} Despite the disavowal of many religious organizations and temples in Japan, both events have become tourist attractions that attract crowds of hundreds. The local government includes the image of an ''itako'' in its tourist brochures, and attempted to fund a permanent ''itako'' position in the nearby temple to encourage sustained tourism throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

''Itako'', though few in number, have formed an association, the ''itako-ko'' and do occasionally work with Buddhist temples, usually providing support for funerals.&lt;ref name="Schatt2003" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

Robertson was best known as an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].

== Biography ==
Robertson was born in [[Brodick]] on the [[Isle of Arran]]; his father moved the family to [[Stirling]] while he was still young, and he attended school there until the age of 13.  He worked first as a clerk and then as a journalist, eventually becoming assistant editor of the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]''.&lt;ref name="weo"&gt;{{cite web|title =The Rt. Hon. J. M. Robertson |url =http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/others/movements/robertsonbio.html | accessdate =13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in February 1906 to a friend that he "gave up the 'divine'" when he was a teenager.&lt;ref name="Wells, G.A 1987 p. 13"&gt;Wells, G.A. Ed. (1987) ''J.M. Robertson (1856–1933) Liberal, Rationalist, and Scholar: An Assessment by Several Hands Edited by G.A. Wells''. London; Pemberton, p. 13. {{ISBN|0301870012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first contact with the [[freethought]] movement was a lecture by [[Charles Bradlaugh]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1878. Robertson became active in the [[Edinburgh Secular Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh Secular Society|url=http://edinburghsecularsociety.com/about/|work=About us|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after.&lt;ref name="Wells, G.A 1987 p. 13"/&gt; It was through the Edinburgh Secular Society that he met [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and became writer for the ''Edinburgh Evening News''.&lt;ref name="Wells, G.A 1987 p. 13"/&gt; He eventually moved to London to become assistant editor of Bradlaugh's paper ''[[National Reformer]]'', subsequently taking over as editor on Bradlaugh's death in 1891.&lt;ref name="weo" /&gt; The ''National Reformer'' finally closed in 1893.  Robertson was also an appointed lecturer for the freethinking [[South Place Ethical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Progress Through Two Centuries: A Short History of the South Place Ethical Society |url =http://www.ethicalsoc.org.uk/history.htm |accessdate =13 February 2010 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20000118230842/http://www.ethicalsoc.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate =18 January 2000 |df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1899 until the 1920s.

An advocate of the "New Liberalism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XWGuS25msYC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=duncan%20tanner%20new%20liberal%20ministers%20junior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIuYSxodOcxwIVIRfbCh2xCQBX#v=onepage&amp;q=duncan%20tanner%20new%20liberal%20ministers%20junior&amp;f=false|title=Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918|first=Duncan|last=Tanner|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's political radicalism developed in the 1880s and 1890s, and he first stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1895, failing to win Bradlaugh's old seat in [[Northampton]] as an independent [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] liberal.  Robertson was a staunch [[free trade]]r and his ''Trade and Tariffs'' (1908) "became a bible for free-traders pursuing the case for cheap food and the expansion of trade".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden, '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35783 Robertson,  John Mackinnon  (1856–1933)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918]], as a Liberal candidate he contested [[Wallsend (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallsend]], a constituency based largely on his [[Tyneside (UK Parliament constituency)|Tyneside]] seat, but finished third.  He contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923]] as Liberal candidate for [[Hendon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hendon]] without success.

Robertson died in London in 1933.&lt;ref name="weo" /&gt;

[[Homer Smith]] has described Robertson as an "outstanding exponent of rationalism and one of the foremost scholars produced in England in the last six decades."&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer Smith|Smith, Homer W]]. (1952). ''Man and His Gods''. Little, Brown and Company. p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]], and in several books he argued against the [[historicity of Jesus]]. According to Robertson, the character of Jesus in the New Testament developed from a Jewish cult of [[Joshua]], whom he identifies as a [[solar deity]].

'''Joanna Bogle''', [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|DSG]] (née '''Nash'''; born 1952) is a British Roman Catholic writer and broadcaster based in London.&lt;ref name="Auntie Joanna writes"&gt;Joanna Bogle Blogspot [http://joannabogle.blogspot.co.uk "Auntie Joanna writes"], joannabogle.blogspot.co.uk; accessed 19 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bogle worked for the ''Richmond Herald'' and later the ''Surrey Comet'' newspapers after leaving school.&lt;ref name="McCowen"&gt;Sharyn McCowen [http://www.catholicweekly.com.au/article.php?classID=3&amp;subclassID=9&amp;articleID=5950&amp;class=Features&amp;subclass=A%20conversation%20with "Author ‘lost my cool’ in AIDS debate on TV – A Conversation with Joanna Bogle"], ''The Catholic Weekly'' (Australia), 16 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She has written for the ''Catholic Times'' and the ''[[Catholic Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2016/03/22/why-thanking-our-priests-has-become-a-holy-week-tradition/ "Why thanking our priests has become a Holy Week tradition"] ''Catholic Herald'', 22 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Bogle was described by Catholic writer [[Peter Stanford]] as "a forceful, eloquent and youthful firebrand who has made it her business, with some success, to act as a counter-balance to [[Cristina Odone]] on the chat-show and soundbite circuit."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stanford [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/unholy-battle-for-faithful-readers-1319873.html "Unholy battle for faithful readers"], ''The Independent'', 20 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogle is a founder member of the Association for Catholic Women in England and contributes to [[The National Catholic Register]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle [http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/london-bridge-is-standing-strong "London Bridge is Standing Strong"], ''The National Catholic Register'', 5 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to James Bogle, a barrister and convert to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Vice Chairman – James Bogle [http://catholicunion.org.uk/2013/11/james-bogle-vice-chairman/]''The Catholic Union of Great Britain''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, she became a Dame of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great]], a little-known Papal merit award whose recipients are styled "DSG". The award is not connected to [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom]]. Bogle does not have a television &lt;ref&gt;[https://catholicjournalistinlondon.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/the-bbc-and-its-staff/ "The BBC and its staff"] ''EWTN'', 22 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but contributes to [[EWTN Global Catholic Network]], a Catholic television and radio network "dedicated to the advancement of truth as defined by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, [...] to serve the orthodox belief and teaching of the Church as proclaimed by the supreme Pontiff and his predecessors."

Her biography of 19th-century humanitarian [[Caroline Chisholm]], ''The Emigrant's Friend'', was published in 1993.

A conservative who believes the [[Catholic Church]] should advocate fundamental truths rather than liberal attitudes;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle [http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-catholicchurch/article_2430.jsp "The Catholic church is not a democracy"], Opendemocracy, 17 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Bogle is opposed to the ordination of women priests.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0001.html "Women Priests — No Chance"], Catholic Education Resource Center, 1997 article&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Bogle opposed the recommendation of the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] to use BCE and CE in place of BC and AD.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle and Rabbi Charles Middleburgh [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/08/religion.uk "Is it millennium madness to drop AD and BC?"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the [[National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]], and in 1987 was described as "[[Mary Whitehouse]]'s second-in-command" by the ''[[London Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[London Daily News]]'', 3 April 1987, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, she criticised the decision of the church to honour [[Rupert Murdoch]] with a [[knighthood]]: "It sends out the message that you can make a living out of something – soft pornography – that is regarded by the Church as sinful, and yet you can be awarded for it. The [[Knighthood of St. Gregory]] is supposed to be about honour and chivalry and splendour. To give it to Murdoch is ridiculous and wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Steve Boggan [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/catholic-anger-at-murdochs-papal-knighthood-1145252.html "Catholic anger at Murdoch's papal knighthood"], ''The Independent'', 17 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

She believes Catholics, and Christians generally, are under sustained assault in the UK and should assert themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Bogle. [http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/bogle/00063.html "Anti-Catholic Nastiness in England"], Catholicity website, 7 August 2007 (Reprinted from InsideCatholic.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Bogle participated in a debate on ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' with Dr Rachel Baggaley, head of Christian Action's HIV programme, and presenter [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], on the Church's policy towards AIDS in Africa. Snow described it as the fiercest debate in which he ever participated.&lt;ref name="McCowen"/&gt;

The '''Judaica Foundation''' located at ul. Meiselsa 17 street in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], was created in 1991. The idea for the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] was established already in the 1980s, influenced by the President of the [[Jewish]] community of Kraków. Committed to preserving the Jewish heritage in Kraków's old Jewish district of [[Kazimierz]] and to opening up a new platform for intercultural dialogue,  the Foundation also aims at spurring interest among young people for the [[Jewish culture]] and history.

The Centre for Jewish Culture run by the Judaica Foundation opened in 1993. It resides in [[Kazimierz]] at a former house of prayer (Bejit ha-midrasch) built in the 1880s and modernized in 1989-1993. The building served religious purposes right until the outbreak of World War II. In 1993 it was thoroughly restored with the help of various organisations. Today the Centre serves as a venue for lectures, workshops and exhibitions such as the Aleksander and Alicja Hetz Annual Memorial Lecture or the Settimana della Cultura Ebraica which is organised together with the Italian Institute for Culture in Kraków.

'''Muṭawwaʿ''' (مطوّع) (plural muṭawwaʿūn (مطوّعون)) is a word that is used to describe a religious [[Islam|Muslim]] man. This word is used in [[Gulf countries]] in the [[Middle East]] ([[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Kingdom of Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], &amp; [[Sultanate of Oman]]), but it may also be used in [[Yemen]], since Yemen and Gulf countries have a lot of cultural similarities. The term was also in use in Tunisia to refer to a holder of a diploma from a religious institution (see below).&lt;br /&gt;
The term has also been coopted by self-styled "religious police" (see [[Islamic religious police|Muṭawwaʿūn]]).

==Origin of The Word==
The term was originally used to describe the holder of the diploma issued by the Great Mosque of Tunis&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#HW4=683,HW3=590,LL=5_175,LS=2,HA=453,SG=668,BR=601,PR=100,AAN=371,VI=244,MGF=562,UQW=1022,UMR=668,UMS=562,UMJ=504,LL_HIDE Hans Wehr, page 670]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It also has the meanings of a volunteer, or an unsalaried trainee.

In the past (tens of years ago), this word was used for the man who used to teach children the [[Qur'an]], when there were no schools in the region.

'''Menander''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μένανδρος}}) was a first-century CE [[Samaritan]] [[gnostic]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]ian and a leader of the [[Simonians]] following the death of his master and instructor, [[Simon Magus]], who was in [[Rome]] during the reign of [[Emperor Claudius]].&lt;ref name="Tyson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph B Tyson|title=Marcion and Luke-acts: A Defining Struggle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU2U08v6aq0C&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-650-7|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groningen1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=G. van Groningen|title=First Century Gnosticism: Its Origin and Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=1967|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=144–|id=GGKEY:U5J7K6Y11UY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyprus)2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Epiphanius (Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus)|title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (sects 1-46)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKyxt9kyys8C&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17017-9|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in the works of [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and others.&lt;ref name="Ferreiro2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alberto Ferreiro|title=Simon Magus in Patristic, Medieval And Early Modern Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eX3oFohttG8C&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-14495-8|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Martyr]] is the oldest source of knowledge about Menander after he met some of the devoted [[Menandrians]] in their old age. Justin suggested that Menander was born in [[Cappareteia]] and established a school in [[Antioch]] where he announced himself the [[messiah]] and vowed to defeat the [[angel]]s that were keeping the world in captivity, possibly through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="ecc"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gT88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA315|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=315–|id=GGKEY:U6Y4PUATGJB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Simonians divided during the [[Gnostic schism]], Menander called his part of the sect [[Menandrians]], holding the belief that the world was made by [[angel]]s. His ideas contrasted with those of [[Satornilus]] and the [[Satornilians]], who believed the world was made by only seven angels against the will of a ''"Father on high"''.&lt;ref name="Cyprus)2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Epiphanius (Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus)|title=The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (sects 1-46)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKyxt9kyys8C&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17017-9|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menander held that a [[water baptism]] was essential as the source for [[eternal youth]].&lt;ref name="Grant2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert McQueen Grant|title=Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_vxEB7nT_QC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22772-2|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menander held solid to the belief that as head of the church, he was the savior and [[Power of God]]. Menander maintained that ''"the primary power continues unknown to all but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a savior, for the deliverance of men"''.&lt;ref name="Groningen1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=G. van Groningen|title=First Century Gnosticism: Its Origin and Motifs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=1967|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=144–|id=GGKEY:U5J7K6Y11UY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other magicians including [[Basilides]] and [[Cerdo (gnostic)|Cerdo]] became followers of Menander and were said to have ''"given immense development to his doctrines"'' with differing ethical consequences.&lt;ref name="Groningen1967"/&gt; It has been suggested that some of those who tried to interpret the doctrines of Menander, such as Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, took things far too literally. Irenaeus for instance, claimed that those in receipt of Menander's water baptism no longer grew old and became [[Death|immortal]].&lt;ref name="ecc"/&gt;

==General Information==
The '''Ngagyur Nyingma Institute''' (NNI), (Tib: {{bo-textonly|སྔ་འགྱུར་མཐོ་སློབ་མདོ་སྔགས་རིག་པའི་འབྱུང་གནས་གླིང་།}}, Wylie: ''snga 'gyur mtho slob mdo ngags rig pa'i 'byung gnas gling'') of [[Namdroling Monastery]] was established by His Holiness [[Penor Rinpoche]] in 1978. Students from various countries go there for higher Buddhist studies. For nine years, they mainly study the Sutra and Tantra teachings of the Buddha, as well as the commentaries written by great Indian and Tibetan scholars. As an ancillary subjects, they study Buddhist philosophy in general, poetry, composition, grammar and the history of Tibet, as well as English and other languages. During the nine-year course, students complete four years for a  {{bo-textonly|མཐའ་བྲལ་སྨྲ་བའི་དབང་ཕྱུག}} tha-bral smra-ba'i dbang-phyug degree (equivalent to a Higher Secondary degree), two more years for a  {{bo-textonly|ཕར་ཕྱིན་རབ་འབྱམས།}} phar-phyin rab-'byams degree (equivalent to a bachelor's degree) and the last three years for a  {{bo-textonly|མདོ་རྒྱུད་ངེས་དོན་བསྟན་པའི་སྣང་བྱེད་ཆེན་པོ།}} mdo-rgyud nges-don btan-pa'i nyin-byed chen-po degree (equivalent to a master's degree). After the completion of the nine-year course, earning these three degrees, they are then placed in various monasteries and Dharma centres in Himalayan countries and abroad to render their service of teaching Buddhism. NNI also provides an option to continue one’s study and research towards a PhD.&lt;ref&gt;VIth Convocation Souvenir 2010 | Published by Ngagyur Rigzod Editorial Committee, Copyright NREC-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golden Temple, Fifth Edition, Copyright 2013 |  {{ISBN|938306807-8}} | Published by Ngagyur Rigzod Editorial Committee &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbrc.org/eBooks/W1KG6201-I1KG6239-1-220-any.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince-Primate''' ({{lang-de|'''Fürstprimas'''}}, {{lang-hu|'''hercegprímás'''}}) is a rare [[prince]]ly title held by individual (prince-)[[archbishops]] of specific sees in a presiding capacity in an august assembly of mainly secular princes, notably the following:

==Germany - Confederation of the Rhine==
The ''{{lang|de|Rheinbund}}'' or '[[Confederation of the Rhine]]' was founded in 1806, when several German states seceded from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and allied themselves with Emperor [[Napoleon]] of France, who assumed the position of a [[protector (title)|protector]] of the Confederation. Its highest office was held by {{lang|de|[[Karl Theodor von Dalberg]]}}, first [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and then [[Bishop of Regensburg|of Regensburg]]. He had been the first among the princes of the Holy Roman Empire and styled its [[Archchancellor]], and as such was given the first rank among the princes of the new Confederation and the title of ''{{lang|de|Fürstprimas}}'', 'Prince Primate'. As such he presided over the ''College of Kings'' and the ''{{lang|de|Diet}} of the Confederation'', a senate-like assembly which never actually assembled.

During his term as Prince Primate, Dalberg was [[Archbishop of Regensburg]] (in [[Bavaria]]) and at first ''{{lang|de|[[Fürst]]}}'' (ruling Prince) of [[Aschaffenburg]]. Since September 19, 1806 his territories included the former {{lang|de|[[Reichsstadt]]}} and on February 16, 1810 Dalberg was promoted to the strictly secular rank of [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]], in chief of another former {{lang|de|Reichsstadt}} (on the lower [[Main (river)|Main]], enclaved in the [[Electorate of Mainz]], now in [[Hessen]]). At the same time, Napoleon appointed his stepson {{lang|fr|[[Eugène de Beauharnais]]}} — excluded from the French imperial succession — as heir to the Grand Duchy.

At the eve of the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire, Dalberg resigned his secular positions and Beauharnais succeeded him as Grand Duke, though this had no practical effect, as the dissolution of the Confederation (carved up into a revised set of monarchies) also rendered the position moot.

==Hungary==
In virtue of his dignity as [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the [[Habsburg dynasty]]'s Apostolic [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom|Archbishop of Esztergom]] enjoyed extraordinary privileges, resulting in his being titled '''Prince Primate'''.

The [[primate (bishop)|primate]] was entitled to hold national [[synods]], was [[Papal legate#Legatus Natus|{{lang|la|Legatus Natus|nocat=y}} of the Holy Roman Church]], and therefore had the right, inside of his legation (territory where he represented the [[Pope]]), to have the cross carried before him, dealt directly with [[Rome]] and had the right of [[Canonical visitation|visitation]] in the [[episcopal see]]s and the religious houses in Hungary, except the [[exemption (church)|exempt]] [[Archabbey]] of [[Pannonhalma]] (S. Martinus in Monte Pannoniæ).

Since 1715 the primate had also been a ''{{lang|de|[[Reichsfürst]]}}'', a ruling Prince of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], entitled ''Prince Primate''. He was the chief and privy [[chancellor]] of the Hungarian kingdom, and thus keeper of the great seal. Formerly he was also a member of the supreme court, and still earlier  governor, viceroy and ''{{lang|hu|Erbobergespan}}'' ('hereditary' Chief Count) of [[Esztergom county|Gran]]. To the primate also belonged the right (delegated [[regalia]]) to superintend the royal [[mint (coin)|mint]] at [[Kremnica]] ({{lang-de|Kremnitz}}, {{lang-hu|Körmöcbánya}}), for which he received a significant sum from its [[seigniorage]] revenues, called ''{{lang|la|jus piseti}}'' ('right of'). By ancient custom, he had the right to crown the [[King of Hungary]] and anoint the queen. By a gift of archiepiscopal property he was at one time able to confer [[nobility]] (''{{lang|de|Prädialadel}}''), another rarely delegated princely prerogative (usually only [[knighting]] was allowed to non-sovereign nobility). Another privilege was his right to take an oath before a court of justice through his deputy, and not personally.

The [[primate (bishop)|primate]] was also chief priest and chancellor of the Hungarian national [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|Order of St. Stephen]], established in 1764. As first [[banneret]] (''{{lang|la|baro regni}}'') of Hungary, he was a [[Magnate]], i.e. member of the [[Főrendiház|Upper House]].

'''''Psilocybe galindoi''''' is a [[psychedelic mushroom]] in the section Mexicana, having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as its main active compounds. It is also known as '''P. galindii''', the mushroom was named in honor of Mr. Carlos Galindo Arias and his family by Dr. [[Gastón Guzmán]].

==Description==
*'''Cap''': 1.9 – 2&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, [[conic]] to [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] or [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]], with a very slight [[Plant cuticle|papilla]], [[glabrous]], even to striate when moist, [[hygrophanous]], brown or yellowish brown fading to pale [[ochraceous]] or straw color. Staining blue-green where injured.
*'''Gills''': [[Adnation|Adnate]], brown to dark purple brown, with whitish edges.
*'''Stipe''': 5 — 6.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 1 – 2&amp;nbsp;mm, equal, hollow, no annulus, reddish brown in the middle, darker towards the base with long [[rhizomorphic]] strands. Veil inconspicuous, except for some white appressed silky fibrils on the pileus.
*'''Spores''': Dark purple gray in deposit. (8.1)9.6 — 12(14) x 7.1 — 8 [[µm]], [[subrhomboid]] in face view or [[subellipsoid]] in side view(around 1 [[µm]]), yellowish brown, thick walled with a broad germ pore.
*'''Odor''': [[Farinaceous]]
*'''Taste''': [[Farinaceous]]
*''' Microscopic Features''': Basidia: 18 — 24 x 7.2 — 9.6 [[µm]], [[hyaline]], 4-spored, [[ventricose]]. [[Pleurocystidia]]: 14.4 — 21 x 7 — 8.4 [[µm]], hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous, with short necks.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Psilocybe galindoi'' is found growing [[gregarious]]ly in soil at higher elevations and in tall grass in or near ''[[Pinus]]''-''[[Quercus]]'' (pine with oak) forests in [[Mexico]]. The holotype location is Pie de la Cuesta, Jalisco, Mexico - a bit south of Guadalajara.

==Consumption and cultivation==
[[File:Sclerotia galindoi.JPG|thumb|right|''Psilocybe galindoi'' [[sclerotia]] ]]
Like several other [[psilocybin mushrooms]] in the [[genus]], ''Psilocybe galindoi'' has been consumed by indigenous North American and Central American peoples for its [[entheogen]]ic effects.

In the Western world, [[sclerotia]] of ''Psilocybe galindoi'' are sometimes cultivated for [[entheogenic]] or medicinal use. The sclerotia usually have a lower content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.

'''''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ fī sīrat al-anbiyāʾ w-al-mulūk w-al-khulafāʾ''''' (روضة الصفا في سیرة الانبياء والملوك والخلفاء, ‘The Gardens of purity in the biography of the prophets and kings and caliphs’) or '''Rawdatu 's-safa''' is a Persian history of the origins of [[Islam]], early Islamic civilisation, and Persian history by [[Mīr-Khvānd|Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd]].&lt;ref name="imamate"&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/imamate/biblio.htm Imamate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821032700/http://www.al-islam.org/imamate/biblio.htm |date=2009-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The text was originally completed in seven volumes in 1497 CE (836 [[Islamic calendar#Numbering the years|AH]]);&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the date is stated as 1417 owing to a transcription error; however, Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd wasn't born until 1433; see Henry Miers Elliot, ''The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muhammadan Period'', ed. John Dowson (London: Trübner and Co., 1872), 127-129; [http://worldcat.org/oclc/3425271 OCLC 3425271], available in full text from [https://www.google.com/books?id=atgNAAAAIAAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth volume is a geographical index.&lt;ref name="salaam"&gt;[http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/biography/viewentry.php?id=1132 Salaam Knowledge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The work is very scholarly, Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd used nineteen major Arabic histories and twenty-two major Persian ones as well as others which he occasionally quotes.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliot, ''History'', 129&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was the basis for many subsequent histories including the works of Hajjī Khalfah.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

:''The ''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafā̄ʾ'' ought not to be confused with the ''Rawżat al-b̄̄āb fī taʾrīkh al-akābir w-al-ansāb'' (‘The Garden of the learned in the history of great men and genealogies’) by Abū Sulaymān Daʾūd ibn Abū al-Fatal Muḥammad al-Banākatī, which was written earlier, in 1317 (717 AH).''
==Style==
He made little attempt at a critical examination of historical traditions, and wrote in a flowery and often bombastic style, but in spite of this drawback, Mīr-Khv&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd's ''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ'' remains one of the most marvelous achievements in literature.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; It comprises seven large volumes and a geographical appendix; but the seventh volume, the history of the sultan Ḥosayn, together with a short account of some later events down to 1523, cannot have been written by Mīr-Khv&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd himself, who died in 1498. He may have compiled the preface, but it was his grandson, the historian [[Khwandamir|Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd-Amīr]] (1475–1534), who continued the main portion of this volume and to whom also a part of the appendix must be ascribed.

===Manuscripts, editions and translations===
There are various different Persian manuscripts in Iran, Vienna, Paris, London. A Persian edition was published in Paris in 1843 as ''Histoire des Samanides par Mirkhond''. It was published fully in Persian in 1843 (Paris) and lithographed in [[Mumbai]] (1848 or 1852). The standard edition used in scholarship is the Persian edition ''Tarikh i Rawzat al-Safa'' (7 vols) by Abbad Parviz (Tehran, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J.

===Translations===
Owing to its popularity, the ''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafāʾ'' has undergone several editions and translations. Around 1596, [[Pedro Teixeira]] prepared a Spanish translation of the ''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafā̄ʾ''. The book was partially translated into English in 1715,&lt;ref&gt;Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd, ''History of Persia ...: to which is added an abridgment of the lives of kings of Harmuz, or Ormuz'', transl. from Spanish text of Pedro Teixeira by John Stevens (London: J.

Freiherr von Bernhard Jenisch (Vienna: Typis Josephi Nobilis de Kurzbeck, 1782); [http://worldcat.org/oclc/46759841 OCLC 46759841].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sassanid portion (of chapter 1.2) into French in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd, ''Mémoires sur diverses antiquités de la Perse, et sur les médailles des rois de la dynastie des Sassanides; suivis de l'Histoire de cette dynastie, traduite du Persan de Mirkhond'', transl. [[Silvestre de Sacy|Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy]] (Paris, 1793); [http://worldcat.org/oclc/150200240 OCLC 150200240], available in full text via [https://www.google.com/books?id=cEkGAAAAQAAJ Google Books]. The text of this section starts at p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; A section was translated as ''Mirchondi Historia Seldschukidarum'' (1838) by Johann August Vullers.

From 1892 to 1893, a translation of the first book (up to the Rashidun caliphs) into English was prepared by the Orientalist [[Edward Rehatsek]] and edited by [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] for the Royal Asiatic Society, in two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Mīr-Kh&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;ānd, ''The Rauzat-us-safa, or, Garden of purity: containing the histories of prophets, kings, and khalifs by Muhammad bin Khâvendshâh bin Mahmûd, commonly called Mirkhond'', transl.

Lamairesse and Gaston Dujarric was translated from the English (1897).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Piepenbring ''Jésus historique'' 1909 - Page 216  "RAUZAT-US-SAFA (Jardin de Pureté) Bible de l'Islam - Théologie musulmane ou l'Histoire Sainte suivant la foi Musulmane par l'historien persan Mirkhond, traduite de l'anglais par E.

==Mentions of Jesus==

The text in [[Edward Rehatsek]]'s translation of the [[Garden of Purity]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D13501032%26ct%3D45 Edward Rehatsek translation online]&lt;/ref&gt; contains a version of the [[Abgar]] legend, regarding the conversion of king [[Abgar]] of [[Edessa]] (called Nassibin or Nasibain in the Persian text) before the crucifixion:
{{quotation|Historians have reported that in the time of I’sa — u. w. b., etc. — there was a king in the country of Nassibin who was very arrogant and tyrannical. I’sa having been sent on a mission to him, started towards Nassibin. When he arrived in the vicinity, he halted and said to his apostles: ‘Which of you will enter the city and say: I’sa, who is a servant of Allah, His messenger and His word, is coming to you.’"}}
[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|Ghulam Ahmad]] (Urdu 1899, English 1978) and later publications of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] such as [[Review of Religions]] give a paraphrase of the [[Abgar]] story from Mir Kvand's ''Rawżat aṣ-ṣafā̄ʾ'', also apparently placing the story of [[Jesus]]’s travels to Syria during his ministry and before the [[crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|Ghulam Ahmad]] ''Masih Hindustan-mein'' Urdu 1899 ''Jesus in India: being an account of Jesus' escape from death on the cross'' English translation 1978 - Page 63 "“Journeying from his country, he arrived at Nasibain. With him were a few of his disciples whom he sent into the city to preach. In the city, however, there were current wrong and unfounded rumors about Jesus (on whom be peace) and his mother. The governor of the city, therefore, arrested the disciples and then summoned Jesus. Jesus miraculously healed some persons and exhibited other miracles.  The king of the territory of Nasibain, therefore, with all his armies and his people, became a follower of his.."&lt;/ref&gt; Though later Ahmadi writers infer the events are after the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Abubakr Ben Ishmael Salahuddin, ‘Evidence of Jesus in India’, ''Review of Religions'' 97.4 (April 2002), 48–68; [http://www.alislam.org/ror/Apr2002.pdf]; Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, ''Jesus in Heaven on Earth'' (Lahore: Working Muslim Mission &amp; Literary Trust, 1952); [http://worldcat.org/oclc/18112423 OCLC 18112423]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad considered that "If the report in the Rauzat-us-Safaa is correct, it appears that, by travelling to Nasibain, Jesus intended to go to Afghanistan through Persia, and to invite to the Truth the lost tribes of Jews who had come to be known as Afghans." Ahmad then concludes that.&lt;ref&gt;Ghulam Ahmad ''Masih Hindustan-mein'' 1899 English edition 1978 "If the report in the Rauzat-us-Safaa is correct, it appears that, by travelling to Nasibain, Jesus intended to go to Afghanistan through Persia, and to invite to the Truth the lost tribes of Jews who had come to be known as Afghans."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=3ngv4Hb4quMC&amp;q=Rauza-tus-Safa&amp;dq=Rauza-tus-Safa&amp;pgis=1 Almadiyya Muslim Community, ''Review of Religions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==In text books==
Political overtones to textbook revisions were noted in attempts made in 2000-01 by [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) at restructuring government bodies tasked with overseeing textbooks. Though efforts were made to exert control over bodies, such as the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]] (ICHR), among others, the process was not "exactly satisfactory from the BJP point of view," as noted in a report published by ''The Hindu''. The BJP made no secret of its intent to saffronise education, but it was noted that the party faced the problem of implementing its intent. One obstacle to revising textbooks was found at that time in the large number of states that did not support BJP efforts to revise textbooks. However, it was noted that in the states with the BJP in power, such as [[Rajasthan]], extensive changes in textbooks were carried out.&lt;ref name="Amrik Singh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh |first=Amrik | url=http://www.thehindu.com/2001/08/25/stories/05252524.htm |title=Saffronisation and textbooks |work=The Hindu |date=August 25, 2001 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rival political party, the [[Indian National Congress]], came into power, efforts were undertaken in 2004 to reverse the saffronisation of textbooks previously made by BJP.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh |first=Randeep | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/26/india.schoolsworldwide |title=Another rewrite for India's history books |work=The Guardian |date=June 25, 2004 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Hindustan Times'' reviewed the issue of saffronisation of Indian text books in late 2014, it noted that right-wing efforts to impose this alternate recounting of history faced "some difficulty as it lacks credible historians to back its claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raza |first=Danish | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/saffronising-textbooks-where-myth-and-dogma-replace-history/story-CauM4dmmsPGrjZ3APAvNxO.html |title=Saffronising textbooks : Where myth and dogma replace history |work=Hindustan Times |date=December 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One acknowledged epoch of Indian history particularly troublesome for historians is the [[India#Medieval India|medieval period]]. Since there is no consensus about that era, history for that period is subjective and open to the influence of the textbook writer's sympathies and outlook: "the choice of the textbook writer is more decisive than anything else," it was noted in ''The Hindu'' report.&lt;ref name="Amrik Singh" /&gt;  For example, when the medieval period of India is saffronised, it is described as "a dark age of Islamic colonial rule which snuffed out the glories of the Hindu empire that preceded it".&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Another trap in the politicisation of history relates to contention over the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Amrik Singh" /&gt;

By mid-2015, ''The Times of India'' reported that the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]], which is in charge of publishing textbooks, had participated in a meeting convened by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], and during that meeting, the issue of changing textbooks was discussed. An official from the ICHR complained that the theme of nationalism did not receive proper treatment in textbooks, setting the stage for possible textbook revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Akshaya |first=Mukul | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Saffronization-fears-over-history-textbooks-rewrite-plans/articleshow/47792475.cms |title=Saffronization fears over history textbooks rewrite plans |work=The Times of India|date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state government of Rajasthan reportedly spent Rs 37 crore to reprint 36 textbooks used for classes 1 to 8 for the 2016-2017 academic session that will be based on an agenda that would promote Indian culture by including historical figures, such as [[Suraj Mal|Maharaja Surajmal]], Hem Chandra, and [[Guru Gobind Singh]].  The text books that had been approved up to the 2012-13 academic session were rendered obsolete under the rewriting of history, and those books were auctioned off. In total, 5,66 crore new text books were ordered printed for an agenda that critics described was intent on supporting the saffronisation of textbooks. Rajasthan (primary and secondary) education minister Vasudev Devnani denied the charge of saffronisation, but educationists described his decision as the "Hinduisation of education" that occurs when right-wing forces come to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goswami |first=Rakesh | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/saffron-agenda-raje-scraps-cong-textbooks-spends-rs-37-cr-on-new-ones/story-U3JaMmx52f4YsuUfb3wlNK.html |title=Saffronisation ?

The state government of [[Karnataka]] has reportedly ordered new textbooks for the 2017-18 academic session in an effort that academicians and critics have described as a "blatant attempt to saffronise textbooks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/revised-textbooks-from-201718-academic-year/article7300069.ece |title=Revised textbooks from 2017–18 academic year|work=The Hindu |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samantha Kshatriya''' are a community of [[Kerala]], India, who were historically ruling elites and feudal land owners in the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and [[Kingdom of Travancore]]. They formed a part of the [[Samantan]] [[Nair]] clan. Their residences are still called Swaroopams or Kottaram or Kovilakams, all of which mean ''palace'' in Malayalam. Members of this community hold the titles like Thampuran and Varma. They usually wear [[sacred thread]]. Unlike most Kshatriyas (warriors) found in India, Samantha Kshatriyas rarely took part in warfare, relying instead on their Nagavanshi Kshatriya cousins like [[Kiryathil Nair]]s and [[Illathu Nair]]s to command armies. The Samantha Kshatriya also followed a matrilineal system of inheritance known as [[Marumakkathayam]].

The temple of Seto Machindranath is located in [[Jana bahal|Jana Bahal]] (also known as Machhindra Bahal). Located at Keltole between [[Ason, Kathmandu|Ason]] and [[Indra Chok, Kathmandu|Indra Chok]] in central Kathmandu, the temple is believed to have been established around the 10th century. Seto Machindranath is worshipped as an aspect of [[Avalokiteshvara]].&lt;ref name= b&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurung|first=Roshan|title=Seto Machhendranath|url=http://www.ecs.com.np/living_category.php?category=4&amp;id=225|work=ECS Nepal|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = c&gt;{{cite web|first=Anisha|title=Seto Machhendranath Temple|work=bossnepal.com|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
It is believed that during the rule of King Yakshya Malla, in a place called Kantipuri people used to bathe in the holy river and visit [[Swayambhunath]] this led them to heaven after death. Once Yamraj (God of Death) came to know the power of [[Swayambhunath]] and he visited the holy temple. During his return from the Temple he was captured by King Yakshya Malla and his Tantric Guru and demanded immortality and would not let Yamraj leave. So Yamraj prayed to Arya Awalokiteshwor (Seto Machindranath) to free him. The God heard his prayer and instantly appeared from the water. The god was white in color with eyes half closed. He then told the king to build a temple where Kalmati and [[Bagmati]] meet and to organize chariot procession so that the God could visit the people and bless them with happiness and long life.&lt;ref name = e&gt;{{cite web|last=Tandukar|first=Sabina|title=The chariot festival of SETO MACHENDRANATH|url=http://www.spacesnepal.com/archives/may_jun09/seto_machendranath.htm|work=www.spacesnepal.com|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = f&gt;{{cite web|last=Shakya|first=Sagar|title=Rato Vs.

== Chariot festival ==
{{main|Jana Baha Dyah Jatra (chariot festival)}}
The chariot procession festival of Seto Machindranath is celebrated during the month of [[Chaitra]]. This is three days long festival. The chariot of Seto Machindranath is pulled from place to place during these three days. Each day when the chariot has reached its destination a group of soldiers fires their rifles into the air.

On the first day, the deity is brought to [[Jamal]] by the priests. Then it is pulled to [[Asan, Kathmandu]] via [[Ratna Park]] and [[Bhotahity]]. The next day it is pulled from [[Asan Kathmandu]] to [[Hanumandokha]]. Finally it is pulled to [[Lagantole]] via [[Maruhity]] and [[Jaisideval]]. During all three days, people come and pay their respect to the God.&lt;ref name = a/&gt;&lt;ref name= e/&gt;

== Ritual ==
In the month of [[Poush]] every year, the deity is bathed and repainted. The ceremony is held on the 8th day of the bright fortnight of [[Pohela (month)|Pohelā]] (पोहेला), the third month in the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar. In this event, the deity is brought into the courtyard of the temple. All of the ornaments and clothes of the deity are taken off. Then the deity is bathed in several containers of water both cold and hot, milk, ghee, and honey. All of the actions are carried out by the priests of the temple. The main highlight of this event is that the living goddess [[Kumari (children)|Kumari]] attends this ritual.&lt;ref name = d/&gt;&lt;ref name = g&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy vs. Ritual|url=http://janabahaa.blogspot.com/2009/12/philosophy-vs-ritual.html|publisher=Janabahaa Heritage Information Centre|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3023">'''Sharwin II''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شروین), was the tenth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 896 to 930. 

In 896, Sharwin's father, [[Rustam I]], was tortured to death by [[Rafi ibn Harthama]], who then divided Rustam's domains in [[Tabaristan]] with [[Zaydid]] [[Muhammad ibn Zayd]]. Sharwin thus succeeded Rustam I as the head of the Bavand family. In 900, Sharwin, along with the [[Qarinvand dynasty|Karenid]] ruler Shahriyar ibn Baduspan, aided the [[Samanids]] in conquering Tabaristan. After the successful Samanid conquest, Sharwin's domains were restored to him. However, in 914, [[Hasan al-Utrush]] managed to re-establish Zaydid control over Tabaristan, and forced Sharwin accept the Zaydids as his overlord and pay tribute to them.&lt;ref name="EI2-254"&gt;Strothmann (1986), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung209"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Sharwin seems to have later aided [[Makan ibn Kaki]] in his campaign to conquer [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from the [[Samanids]] in 930, where Sharwin shortly died, and was succeeded by his son [[Shahriyar II]]. [[Vushmgir]], who would become the overlord of Tabaristan in 935, married Sharwin's daughter after the latter's death.&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"&gt;Madelung (1984), pp. 747–753&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shunning''' can be the act of [[social rejection]], or emotional distance. In a religious context, shunning is a formal decision by a denomination or a congregation to cease interaction with an individual or a group, and follows a particular set of rules. It differs from, but may be associated with, [[excommunication]].

Social rejection occurs when a person or group deliberately avoids association with, and habitually keeps away from an individual or group. This can be a formal decision by a group, or a less formal group action which will spread to all members of the group as a form of solidarity. It is a sanction against association, often associated with [[religious]] groups and other tightly knit organizations and communities. Targets of shunning can include persons who have been labeled as [[apostates]], [[whistleblower]]s, [[dissident]]s, [[strikebreaker]]s, or anyone the group perceives as a threat or source of conflict. Social rejection has been established to cause psychological damage and has been categorized as torture&lt;ref name="psychotorture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/resources/library/documents-and-reports/ojeda.pdf | title=What is Psychological Torture? | publisher=humanrights.ucdavis.edu | date=September 30, 2006 | accessdate=August 31, 2011 | author=Ojeda, Almerindo}}&lt;/ref&gt; or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1137651| title = The New Synthesis in Moral Psychology| journal = Science| volume = 316| issue = 5827| pages = 998| year = 2007| last1 = Haidt | first1 = J.| url = http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.2007.new-synthesis-in-moral-psychology.pub044.pdf}} ([http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/ppig/documents/Haidt2007-Thenewsynthesisinmoralpsychology.pdf read online]) Retrieved June 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental rejection is a more individual action, where a person subconsciously or willfully ignores an idea, or a set of information related to a particular viewpoint. Some groups are made up of people who shun the same ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Earth Society |url=http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=65 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113015212/http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=65 |archivedate=2009-11-13 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social rejection has been and is a punishment used by many [[customary law|customary legal systems]]. Such sanctions include the [[ostracism]] of ancient Athens and the still-used ''[[kasepekang]]'' in [[Bali]]nese society.

==Overview==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
Shunning can be broken down into behaviours and practices that seek to accomplish either or both of two primary goals.
# To modify the behaviour of a member. This approach seeks to influence, encourage, or coerce normative behaviours from members, and may seek to dissuade, provide disincentives for, or to compel avoidance of certain behaviours. Shunning may include disassociating from a member by other members of the community who are in good standing. It may include more antagonistic psychological behaviours (described below). This approach may be seen as either ''corrective'' or ''punitive'' (or both) by the group membership or leadership, and may also be intended as a deterrent.
# To remove or limit the influence of a member (or former member) over other members in a community. This approach may seek to isolate, to discredit, or otherwise dis-empower such a member, often in the context of actions or positions advocated by that member. For groups with defined membership criteria, especially based on key behaviours or ideological precepts, this approach may be seen as ''limiting damage'' to the community or its leadership. This is often paired with some form of [[excommunication]].

Some less often practiced variants may seek to:
* Remove a specific member from general external influence to provide an ideological or psychological buffer against external views or behaviour. The amount can vary from severing ties to opponents of the group up to and including severing all non-group-affiliated intercourse.

Shunning is usually approved of (if sometimes with regret) by the group engaging in the shunning, and usually highly disapproved of by the target of the shunning, resulting in a polarization of views. Those subject to the practice respond differently, usually depending both on the circumstances of the event, and the nature of the practices being applied. Extreme forms of shunning have damaged some individuals' psychological and relational health. Responses to the practice have developed, mostly around anti-shunning advocacy; such advocates highlight the detrimental effects of many of such behaviors, and seek to limit the practice through pressure or law. Such groups often operate supportive organizations or institutions to help victims of shunning to recover from damaging effects, and sometimes to attack the organizations practicing shunning, as a part of their advocacy.

In many civil societies, kinds of shunning are practiced ''[[de facto]]'' or ''[[De jure#De jure|de jure]]'', to coerce or avert behaviours or associations deemed unhealthy. This can include:
*restraining orders or peace bonds (to avoid abusive relationships)
*court injunctions to disassociate (to avoid criminal association or temptation)
*medical or psychological instructing to avoid associating (to avoid hazardous relations, i.e. alcoholics being instructed to avoid friendship with non-recovering alcoholics, or asthmatics being medically instructed to keep to smoke-free environs)
*using background checks to avoid hiring people who have criminal records (to avoid association with felons, even when the crimes have nothing to do with the job description)

===Stealth shunning===
{{see also|Stealth banning}}
Stealth shunning is a practice where a person or an action is silently banned. When a person is silently banned, the group they have been banned from does not interact with them. This can be done by secretly distributing a [[blacklist]] announcing the person's wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2012/02/mars_hill_pastor_mark_driscoll_faces_backlash_over_church_discipline_case_.single.html|title=Mars Hill pastor Mark Driscoll faces backlash over church discipline case|first=Ruth|last=Graham|date=10 Feb 2012|website=www.slate.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can happen informally when all people in a group or email list each conclude that they do not want to interact with the person. When an action is silently banned, requests for that action are either ignored or refused with faked explanations.&lt;ref name="nowletter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/ayurveda-health-wellbeing/1093373-now-letter-writing-stealth-ban-correction.html | title=now-letter-writing-stealth-ban-correction | publisher=www.indiadivine.org | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ranks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Custom_servers/MCSharp#Ranks | title=Minecraft: McSharp Server; Ranks | publisher=www.minecraftwiki.net|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/ayurveda-health-wellbeing/1093369-stealth-ban.html | title=stealth-ban | publisher=www.indiadivine.org | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tactic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flamewarriors.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282&amp;sid=8d6666f22980a1cd39d0e9699d11ef39 | title=Tactic: Stealth Ban | publisher=www.flamewarriors.com | accessdate=August 31, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143458/http://www.flamewarriors.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282 | archivedate=April 6, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reddit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.codeunit.co.za/2011/08/03/how-do-you-know-if-your-reddit-account-has-been-stealth-banned | title=How do you know if your Reddit account has been stealth banned? | publisher=www.codeunit.co.za | accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Shunning is often used as a [[pejorative]] term to describe any organizationally mandated disassociation, and has acquired a connotation of [[Psychological abuse|abuse]] and [[relational aggression]]. This is due to the sometimes extreme damage caused by its disruption to normal relationships between individuals, such as friendships and family relations. Disruption of established relationships certainly causes pain, which is at least an [[unintended consequence]] of the practices described here, though it may also in many cases be an intended, coercive consequence. This pain, especially when seen as unjustly inflicted, can have secondary general psychological effects on self-worth and self-confidence, trust and trustworthiness, and can, as with other types of [[psychological trauma|trauma]], impair psychological function.

Shunning often involves implicit or explicit [[shame]] for a member who commits acts seen as wrong by the group or its leadership. Such shame may not be psychologically damaging if the membership is voluntary and the rules of behavior were clear before the person joined. However, if the rules are arbitrary, if the group membership is seen as essential for personal security, safety, or health, or if the application of the rules is inconsistent, such shame can be highly destructive. This can be especially damaging if perceptions are attacked or controlled, or certain tools of psychological pressure applied. Extremes of this cross over the line into [[psychological torture]] and can be permanently scarring.

A key detrimental effect of some of the practices associated with shunning relate to their effect on relationships, especially family relationships. At its extremes, the practices may destroy marriages, break up families, and separate children and their parents. The effect of shunning can be very dramatic or even devastating on the shunned, as it can damage or destroy the shunned member's closest familial, spousal, social, emotional, and economic bonds.

Shunning contains aspects of what is known as [[relational aggression]] in psychological literature. When used by church members and member-spouse parents against excommunicant parents it contains elements of what psychologists call [[parental alienation]]. Extreme shunning may cause traumas to the shunned (and to their dependents) similar to what is studied in the [[psychology of torture]].

Shunning is also a mechanism in [[family estrangement]].  When an adult child, sibling, or parent physically and/or emotionally cuts himself off from the family without proper justification, the act traumatizes the family.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013). Family Estrangement. Encyclopedia of Social Work. Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents. DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights implications===
Some aspects of shunning may also be seen as being at odds with civil rights or [[human rights]], especially those behaviours that coerce and attack. When a group seeks to have an effect through such practices outside its own membership, for instance when a group seeks to cause financial harm through isolation and disassociation, they can come at odds with their surrounding civil society, if such a society enshrines rights such as freedom of association, conscience, or belief. Many civil societies do not extend such protections to the internal operations of communities or organizations so long as an ex-member has the same rights, prerogatives, and power as any other member of the civil society.

In cases where a group or religion is state-sanctioned, a key power, or in the majority (e.g. in [[Singapore]]), a shunned former member may face severe social, political, and/or financial costs.

==In religion==

===Christianity===
{{Main|Excommunication}}

Passages in the [[New Testament]], such as  Corinthians 5:11-13 and Matthew 18:15–17, suggest shunning as an internal practice of early Christians and are cited as such by its modern-day practitioners within Christianity. However, not all Christian scholars or denominations agree on this interpretation of these verses. Douglas A. Jacoby interprets [[1 Corinthians]] 5:11 and [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:9-11 as evidence that members can be excluded from fellowship for matters perceived within the church as grave sin without a religiously acceptable repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Douglas|title=Your Bible Questions Answered: Clear, Concise, Compelling|year=2011|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=0-7369-3074-4|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6pMm8L3P0AC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Titus+3:9-11+exclude&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OYucT8ibDuLm0QGKzfWuDw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Titus%203%3A9-11%20exclude&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amish====
Certain sects of the [[Amish]] practice shunning or ''meidung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do the Amish practice shunning?|publisher=Amish America|url=http://amishamerica.com/why-do-the-amish-practice-shunning/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholicism====
Prior to the [[Code of Canon Law]] of 1983, in rare cases (known as excommunication ''[[Vitandus|vitandi]]'') the Catholic Church expected the faithful to shun an [[excommunication|excommunicated]] member in secular matters. In 1983, the distinction between ''vitandi'' and others (''tolerandi'') was abolished, and thus the expectation is not made any more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05678a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, Entry Excommunication, read on April 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline}}
{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Discipline}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] practise a form of shunning which they refer to as "[[Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline#Disfellowshipping|disfellowshipping]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Disfellowshipping follows a decision of a judicial committee established by a local congregation that a member is unrepentantly guilty of a "serious sin".

Sociologist Andrew Holden's research indicates that many Witnesses who would otherwise defect because of disillusionment with the organization and its teachings retain affiliation out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Judaism===
{{Main|Herem (censure)}}
[[Herem (censure)|Cherem]] is the highest ecclesiastical censure in the [[Jew]]ish community. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. It is still used in the Ultra-Orthodox and Chassidic community. In the 21st century, sexual abuse victims and their families who have reported abuse to civil authorities have experienced shunning in the Orthodox communities of New York&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/nyregion/ultra-orthodox-jews-shun-their-own-for-reporting-child-sexual-abuse.html Ultra-Orthodox Shun Their Own for Reporting Child Sexual Abuse] The New York Times, 9 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/19/rabbis-absolute-power-how-sex-abuse-tore-apart-australias-orthodox-jewish-community Rabbis' absolute power: how sex abuse tore apart Australia's Orthodox Jewish community] The Guardian, 18 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í faith===
{{Main|Covenant breaker}}
Members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are expected to shun those that have been declared [[Covenant-breaker]]s, and expelled from the religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The origins of the Bahá'í community of Canada, 1898-1948 | first = Willy Carl | last = Van den Hoonaard | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

===Islam===
There is no specific protocol of shunning in [[Islam]]. An individual can be considered to have committed an act of [[apostasy]] in Islam, and is treated in various ways, possibly even the death penalty.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Church of Scientology===
{{details|Disconnection}}
The [[Church of Scientology]] asks its members to quit all communication with [[Suppressive Person]]s (those whom the Church deems antagonistic to Scientology). The practice of shunning in Scientology is termed [[disconnection]]. Members can disconnect from any person they already know, including existing family members. Many examples of this policy's application have been established in court.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of Mr Justice Latey, Re: B &amp; G (Minors) (Custody) Delivered in the High Court

According to official Church statements, disconnection is only used as a last resort and only lasts until the antagonism ceases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faq.scientology.org/discon.htm What is Disconnection?] (Accessed 5/29/11)&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to disconnect from a Suppressive Person is itself labelled a Suppressive act.&lt;ref name="SciEth209"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hubbard | first = L.

However, this argument was rejected because the pressure put on individual Scientologists to disconnect means it is not voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;California appellate court, 2nd district, 7th division, Wollersheim v.

From the [[Sanskrit]] word Sinhala, meaning literally "of lions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=Sinhalese |contribution=Sinhalese |last=Harper|first=Douglas |year=2016 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sanskrit meaning is 'Sinha' (lion) + 'la' (blood or heart).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Mahavamsa|The Mahavamsa]] records the origin of the Sinhalese people and related historical events. It traces the historical origin of the Sinhalese people back to the first king of Sri Lanka, [[Prince Vijaya|Vijaya]], who is the son of [[Sinhabahu]] (Sanskrit meaning 'Sinha' (lion) + 'bahu' (hands, feet), the ruler of [[Sinhapura]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.kln.ac.lk/handle/123456789/11590 |title=The Ethical Value of Great Chronicle (Mahāvṃsa), the Prime, Heritable and Historical Record of Asians |website=University of Kelaniya}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mahavamsa, Sinhabahu was the son of princess Suppadevi of the [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]], who copulated with the king of the beast, a lion (there is no clear reference in the original text whether it was a lion or a man with lion-like features), and gave birth to a daughter called [[Sinhasivali]] and to a son, [[Sinhabahu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/mahavamsagreatch00geigrich |title=Mahavamsa: the great chronicle of Ceylon |last=Geiger |first=Wilhelm |last2=Bode |first2=Mabel Haynes |location=London, UK |publisher=Pali Text Society (by Oxford University Press) |year=1912 |pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose hands and feet were like the paws of a lion and who had the strength of a lion. King [[Prince Vijaya|Vijaya]], lineage of Sinhabahu, according to the Mahavamsa and [[Prince Vijaya#Sources and variations of the legend|other historical sources]], arrived to the island of [[Tambapanni]] (Sri Lanka), and gave origin to the lion people, Sinhalese.

Early recorded history of the Sinhalese is chronicled in two documents, the [[Mahavamsa]], written in [[Pāli]] around the 4th century CE, and the much later [[Culavamsa]] (probably penned in the 13th century CE by the Buddhist monk Dhammakitti). These are ancient sources which cover the histories of the powerful ancient Sinhalese kingdoms of [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]] which lasted for 1500 years. The Mahavamsa describes the existence of fields of [[rice]] and [[reservoirs]], indicating a well-developed [[agrarian society]].

After his coronation, which was held in the Kingdom of Tambapanni, he left it, building another one, bearing his own name. While he was king, Upatissa established the new capital [[Upatissa of Upatissa Nuwara|Upatissa]], in which the kingdom was moved to from the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]]. When Vijaya's letter arrived, Sumitta had already succeeded his father as king of his country, and so he sent his son [[Panduvasdeva of Sri Lanka|Panduvasdeva]] to rule Upatissa Nuwara.&lt;ref name=Blaze /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It was named after the regent king [[Upatissa of Sri Lanka|Upatissa]], who was the prime minister of [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]], and was founded in 505 BC after the death of [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] and the end of the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]].

===Anuradhapura period===
{{Main|Anuradhapura period}}

In 377 BC, King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka|Pandukabhaya]] (437–367 BC) moved the capital to [[Anuradhapura]] and developed it into a prosperous city.&lt;ref&gt;Blaze (1995), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yogasundaram (2008), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Anuradhapura (Anurapura) was named after the minister who first established the village and after a grandfather of Pandukabhaya who lived there. The name was also derived from the city's establishment on the [[Nakshatra|auspicious asterism]] called Anura.&lt;ref&gt;Wijesooriya (2006), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Anuradhapura was the capital of all the monarchs who ruled from the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Bandaranayake (2007), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulers such as [[Dutthagamani]], [[Valagamba]], and [[Dhatusena]] are noted for defeating the South Indians and regaining control of the kingdom. Other rulers who are notable for military achievements include [[Gajabahu I]], who launched an invasion against the invaders, and Sena II, who sent his armies to assist a [[Pandyan]] prince.

===Polonnaruwa &amp; Transitional period===
{{Main|Polonnaruwa period|Transitional period of Sri Lanka}}
[[File:King of Kandy.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Flag of the King of Kandy in 1815]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] Sri Lanka was well known for its agricultural prosperity under the [[Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa|Parakramabahu]] in Polonnaruwa during which period the island was famous around the world as the rice mill of the east. Later in the 13th century the country's administrative provinces were divided into three independent kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]], [[Kingdom of Kotte]] and the [[Kandyan kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jawad|first=Afreeha|title=Communal representation of 1848 - this country's bane|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/11/05/fea15.asp|publisher=sundayobserver.lk|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion by [[Kalinga Magha|Magha]] in the 13th century led to migrations by the Sinhalese to areas not under his control. This migration was followed by a period of conflict among the Sinhalese chiefs who tried to exert political supremacy. [[Parakramabahu VI of Kotte|Parakramabahu&amp;nbsp;VI]] in the 15th century was the only Sinhalese king during this time who could bring back the unity of the whole island. Trade also increased during this period, as Sri Lanka began to trade [[Cinnamon]] and a large number of Muslim traders were bought into the island.&lt;ref name="mendis"&gt;G.C. Mendis (2006). Ceylon under the British. Colombo: Asian Educational Services. 4. Medieval history&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century a [[Kandyan Kingdom]] formed which divided the Sinhalese politically into low-country and up-country.&lt;ref name="mendis"/&gt;

===Modern history===

====Diaspora====
{{Main|Sri Lankan diaspora}}

[[File:Sinhalese USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|right|250px|The spread of Sinhalese language in the United States]]
Sinhalese people have emigrated out to many countries for a variety of reasons. The larger diaspora communities are situated in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[United States]] and [[Canada]] among others. In addition to this there are many Sinhalese, who reside in the [[Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Europe]], temporarily in connection with employment and/or education. They are often employed as guest workers in the Middle East and professionals in the other regions.

The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of [[Melbourne]] contains just under half of the [[Sri Lankan Australian]]s. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above [[Somali language|Somali]] but behind [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian Census]], 7,220 people identified themselves as of [[Sri Lankan Canadians|Sinhalese ancestry]], out of 139,415 Sri Lankans.&lt;ref name="Sri Lankan Canadians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=1118296&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0 |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a small amount of [[Sri Lankans in India|Sinhalese people in India]], scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the [[North India|northern]] and [[South India|southern]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rog3=IN&amp;rop3=109305|title=Sinhalese in India|first=Joshua|last=Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lankan New Zealander]]s comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/sri-lankans/2|title=2.  – Sri Lankans – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|website=www.teara.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand.

Many [[Sri Lankans in Italy|Sinhalese]] have migrated to [[Italy]] since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in [[Lombardia]] (In the districts Loreto and [[Lazzaretto]]), [[Milan]], [[Lazio]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], and [[Southern Italy]] (Particularly [[Palermo]], [[Messina]] and [[Catania]]). Though [[British Sri Lankans|Sinhala]] people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK. The UK government does not record statistics on the basis of language or ethnicity and all Sri Lankans are classified into one group as [[Asian British]] or Asian Other.

===Language and literature===
{{Main|Sinhala language|Sri Lankan literature}}
{{See also|Languages of Sri Lanka}}

[[File:Word Sinhala in Yasarath font.svg|thumb|right|200px|The word Sinhala in Yasarath font.]]
[[File:Ola Scriptures And Art Works Of Venerable Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera.jpg|200px|right|thumb|An ola leaf manuscript written in Sinhala.]]

Sinhalese people speak [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], also known as "Helabasa"; this language has two varieties, spoken and written. Sinhala is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] within the broader group of [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref name="Language"/&gt; The Eerly form of the language was brought to Sri Lanka by the ancestors of the Sinhalese people from northern India who settled on the island in the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;The Mahavamsa.org. (2007). The Mahavamsa - Great Chronicle - History of Sri Lanka - Mahawansa. Available: http://mahavamsa.org/. Last accessed 3 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hussein |first1=Asiff |title=Evolution of the Sinhala language |url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/books/sinhala.htm |website=www.lankalibrary.com |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinhala developed in a way different from the other Indo-Aryan languages because of the geographic separation from its Indo-Aryan sister languages. It was influenced by many languages, prominently [[Pali]], the sacred language of Southern Buddhism, and [[Sanskrit]]. Many early texts in the language such as the ''Hela Atuwa'' were lost after their translation into [[Pali]]. Other significant Sinhala texts include ''Amāvatura'', ''Kavu Silumina'', ''Jathaka Potha'' and ''Sala Liheeniya''. Sinhala has also adopted many [[:Category:Lists of Sinhala words of foreign origin|loanwords of foreign origin]], including from many Indian such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and European languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="everyculsin"/&gt;

Sandesha Kavyas written by Buddhist priests of Sri Lanka are regarded as some of the most sophisticated and versatile works of literature in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Sinhala language was mainly inspired by Sanskrit and Pali, and many words of the Sinhala language derive from these languages. Today some English words too have come in as a result of the British occupation during colonial times, and the exposure to foreign cultures through television and foreign films. Additionally many Dutch and Portuguese words can be seen in the coastal areas. Sinhalese people, depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, may also additionally speak [[English language|English]] and or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. According to the 2012 Census 23.8% or 3,033,659 Sinhalese people also spoke English and 6.4% or 812,738 Sinhalese people also spoke Tamil.&lt;ref name="Census2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Census of Population and Housing 2011 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/index.php?fileName=FinalPopulation&amp;gp=Activities&amp;tpl=3 |website=www.statistics.gov.lk |publisher=Department of Census and Statistics |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Negombo]] area bilingual fishermen who generally identify themselves as Sinhalese also speak the [[Negombo Tamil dialect]]. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]].&lt;ref name=Bonta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonta|first=Steven|title=Negombo Fishermen's Tamil (NFT): A Sinhala Influenced Dialect from a Bilingual Sri Lankan Community|journal=International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics|date=June 2008|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk tales like ''Mahadana Muttha saha Golayo'' and ''Kawate Andare'' continue to entertain children today. ''Mahadana Muttha'' tells the tale of a fool cum Pundit who travels around the country with his followers (''Golayo'') creating mischief through his ignorance. ''Kawate Andare'' tells the tale of a witty court jester and his interactions with the royal court and his son.

In the modern period, Sinhala writers such as [[Martin Wickremasinghe]] and [[G.&amp;nbsp;B. Senanayake]] have drawn widespread acclaim. Other writers of repute include Mahagama Sekera and Madewela S. Ratnayake. [[Martin Wickramasinghe]] wrote the immensely popular children's novel ''Madol Duwa''. Munadasa Cumaratunga's ''Hath Pana'' is also widely known.

===Religion===
{{Main|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Christianity in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]

The form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is known as [[Theravada]] (school of elders). The Pali chronicles (e.g., the Mahavansa) claim that the Sinhalese as an ethnic group are destined to preserve and protect Buddhism. In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;The Library of Congress. (2009). A Country Study: Sri Lanka. Available: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lktoc.html. Last accessed 3 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Observations of current religious beliefs and practices demonstrate that Sinhalese as a religious community have complex worldview as Buddhists. Due to the proximity and on some occasions similarity of certain doctrines, there are many areas where Buddhists and Hindus share religious views and practices. This can lead to the opinion that Buddhists have adopted religious elements from Hindu traditions in their religious practices. Some of these practices may relate to ancient indigenous beliefs and traditions on spirits, worship of deities and godlings and some figures appear to [[Demons of Sri Lanka|demons]]. Some of these demonic figures are used in healing rituals and may be native to the island.&lt;ref name="everyculsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Buddhism transformed"&gt;Buddhism transformed: religious change in Sri Lanka, by Richard Gombrich, Gananath Obeyesekere, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kataragama.org"&gt;[http://www.kataragama.org/docs/popular-religion.htm Popular Sinhalese Religion], Peter R. Blood, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Sri Lankan anthropologists [[Gananath Obeyesekere]] and [[Kitsiri Malalgoda]] used the term "Protestant Buddhism" to describe a type of Buddhism that appeared among the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka as a response to [[Protestant Christian]] [[missionaries]] and their evangelical activities during the British colonial period. This kind of Buddhism involved emulating the Protestant strategies of organising religious practices. They saw the need to establish Buddhist schools for educating Buddhist youth and organising Buddhists with new organisations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association, as well as printing pamphlets to encourage people to participate in debates and religious controversies to defend Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Mahinda Deegalle. (1997). A Bibliography on Sinhala Buddhism. Available: http://www.buddhistethics.org/4/deeg1.html. Last accessed 3 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant Sinhalese [[Christian]] community, in the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="everyculsin"/&gt; Christianity was brought to the Sinhalese by Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionary groups during their respective periods of rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=David|date=1992-01-01|title=Conversion and Demonism: Colonial Christian Discourse and Religion in Sri Lanka|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=34|issue=2|pages=331–365|jstor=178949|doi=10.1017/s0010417500017710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Sinhala Christians are [[Roman Catholic]]; a minority are [[Protestant]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt; Their cultural centre is [[Negombo]].

Religion is considered very important among the Sinhalese. According to a 2008 [[Gallup poll]], 99% of Sri Lankans considered religion an important aspect of their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Crabtree and Brett Pelham. (2009).

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Sri Lanka}}

Sinhalese culture is a unique one dating as far back as 2600 years and has been nourished by Theravada Buddhism. Its main domains are sculpture, fine arts, literature, dancing, poetry and a wide variety of folk beliefs and rituals traditionally. Ancient Sinhalese stone sculpture and inscriptions are known worldwide and is a main foreign attraction in modern tourism. Sigirirya is famous for its frescoes. Folk poems were sung by workers to accompany their work and narrate the story of their lives. Ideally these poems consisted of four lines and, in the composition of these poems, special attention had been paid to the rhyming patterns. Buddhist festivals are dotted by unique music using traditionally Sinhala instruments. More ancient rituals like tovils (devil exorcism) continue to enthral audiences today and often praised and admired the good and the power of Buddha and gods in order to exorcise the demons.

===Folklore and national mythology===
According to the [[Mahavamsa]], the Sinhalese are descended from the exiled [[Prince Vijaya]] and his party of seven hundred followers who arrived on the island in 543 [[BCE]]. Vijaya and his followers were said to have arrived in Sri Lanka after being exiled from the city of [[Sinhapura]] in [[Bengal]]. The modern Sinhalese people as said in the Mahavamsa were found to be most closely related to the people of North-East India (Bengal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Papiha SS, Mastana SS, Purandare CA, Jayasekara R, Chakraborty R |title=Population genetic study of three VNTR loci (D2S44, D7S22, and D12S11) in five ethnically defined populations of the Indian subcontinent |journal=Human Biology |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=819–35 |year=1996 |pmid=8908803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malavige GN, Rostron T, Seneviratne SL, Fernando S, Sivayogan S, Wijewickrama A, Ogg GS |title=HLA analysis of Sri Lankan Sinhalese predicts North Indian origin |journal=International Journal of Immunogenetics |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=313–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17845299 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-313X.2007.00698.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought throughout Sri Lanka's history, since the founding of the Sinhalese in the 5th century BC that an influx of Indians from North India came to the island. This is further supported from the Sinhalese language being part of the Indo-Aryan language group. Sinhalese derives from the Maharashtri Prakrit, along with Marathi, Konkani and Dhivehi.&lt;ref&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/14/50/b6/1450b6f186185dd1dc08786eac4c1d93.jpg{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress===
[[File:Sinhalese Girl Wearing A Traditional Kandyan Saree (Osaria)-1.jpg|thumb|right|Sinhalese girl in [[Osaria]]]]

Traditionally during recreation the Sinhalese wear a [[sarong]] (''sarama'' in Sinhala). Men may wear a long-sleeved shirt with the sarong, while women wear a tight-fitting, short-sleeved jacket with a wrap-around called the ''cheeththaya''. In the more populated areas, Sinhalese men also wear Western-style clothing &amp;mdash; wearing suits while the women wear skirts and blouses. For formal and ceremonial occasions women wear the traditional [[Kandy]]an (Osaria) style, which consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The Kandyan style is considered as the national dress of Sinhalese women. In many occasions and functions, even the ''saree'' plays an important role in women's clothing and has become the de facto clothing for female office workers especially in government sector. An example of its use is the uniform of air hostesses of [[Sri Lankan Airlines]].&lt;ref name="everyculsin"&gt;Everyculture. (2009). Sinhalese - Religion and Expressive Culture.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Sinhalese cuisine}}
[[File:FoodAtUnawatuna RiceAndPrawns.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Sri Lankan dish of rice and prawns.]]

Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of [[South Asia]]. Due to its proximity to [[South India]], Sinhalese cuisine shows some influence, yet is in many ways quite distinct. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from [[colonial powers]] that were involved in [[Sri Lanka]] and by foreign traders. [[Rice]], which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy [[curry|curries]] are favourite dishes for [[lunch]] and [[dinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sltouristguide.com/foods.html |title=Food in Sri Lanka |publisher=Sltouristguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114919/http://sltouristguide.com/foods.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to [[Kerala cuisine]], which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with [[Kerala]].  A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is [[Kiribath]], meaning "Milk Rice." In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat "Mallung"- chopped leaves mixed with grated [[coconut]] and red [[onion]]s. [[Coconut milk]] is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.

Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its [[spices]]. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special [[curry]], accompanied by ''frikkadels'' ([[meatballs]]), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include [[roast beef]] and [[roast chicken]]. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.

The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a "main curry" of [[Fish (food)|fish]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], as well as several other curries made with [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and even [[fruit]] curries. Side-dishes include [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[chutney]]s and "sambols". The most famous of these is the [[Pol Sambola (Coconut Sambol)|coconut sambol]], made of ground coconut mixed with [[chili pepper]]s, dried [[Maldive fish]] and [[lime juice]]. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.

===Art and architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Sri Lanka}}
[[File:British Museum Asia 45 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gilded bronze statue of the Bodhisattva [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], from the [[Anuradhapura]] period, 8th century.]]

Many forms of Sri Lankan arts and crafts take inspiration from the island's long and lasting [[Buddhist]] culture which in turn has absorbed and adopted countless regional and local traditions. In most instances Sri Lankan art originates from religious beliefs, and is represented in many forms such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]]. One of the most notable aspects of Sri Lankan art are caves and temple paintings, such as the frescoes found at [[Sigiriya]], and religious paintings found in temples in [[Dambulla]] and [[Temple of the Tooth]] Relic in [[Kandy]]. Other popular forms of art have been influenced by both natives as well as outside settlers. For example, traditional wooden handicrafts and clay pottery are found around the hill country while Portuguese-inspired lacework and Indonesian-inspired [[Batik]] have become notable. It has many different and beautiful drawings.

Developed upon Indo-Aryan architectural skills in the late 6th century BCE Sinhalese people who lived upon greater kingdoms such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have built so many architectural examples such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]], [[Jetavanaramaya]] - second tallest brick building in the ancient world after [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], and [[Abayagiriya]] - third tallest brick building in the ancient world.  And also with the ancient hydraulic technology which is also unique to Sinhalese people to build ancient tanks, systematic ponds with fountains moats and Irrigational reservoirs such as [[Parakrama Samudra]], Kawdulla and [[Kandalama]]. Sigirya which consider as the 8th wonder of the world is a combination of natural and man made fortress, which consists so many architectural aspects.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Sri Lanka}}

Concerning popular music, [[Ananda Samarakoon]] developed the reflective and poignant Sarala gee style with his work in the late 1930s/early 1940s. He has been followed by artists of repute such as [[Sunil Shantha]], [[W. D. Amaradeva]], [[Premasiri Khemadasa]], [[Nanda Malini]], [[Victor Ratnayake]], Austin Munasinghe, [[T. M. Jayaratne]], [[Sanath Nandasiri]], [[Sunil Edirisinghe]], Neela Wickremasinghe, [[Gunadasa Kapuge]], Malini Bulathsinghala and [[Edward Jayakody]].

===Film and theatre===
{{Main|Cinema of Sri Lanka}}
Dramatist [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]] revitalised the drama form with ''Maname'' in 1956. The same year, film director [[Lester James Peries]] created the artistic masterwork ''[[Rekava]]'' which sought to create a uniquely Sinhala cinema with artistic integrity. Since then, Peries and other directors like [[Vasantha Obeysekera]], [[Dharmasena Pathiraja]], [[Mahagama Sekera]], W. A. B. de Silva, [[Dharmasiri Bandaranayake]], [[Sunil Ariyaratne]], [[Siri Gunasinghe]], G. D. L. Perera, [[Piyasiri Gunaratne]], [[Titus Thotawatte]], [[D. B. Nihalsinghe]], Ranjith Lal, [[Dayananda Gunawardena]], Mudalinayake Somaratne, [[Asoka Handagama]], and [[Prasanna Vithanage]] have developed an artistic Sinhala cinema. Sinhala cinema is often made colourful with the incorporation of songs and dance adding more uniqueness to the industry.

In the recent years high budget films like [[Aloko Udapadi]], [[Aba (film)]] and [[Maharaja Gemunu]] based on [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] [[epic film|epic]] [[historical]] stories gain huge success.

===Performing arts===
[[File:GataBeraya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Kandyan Drummer]]
Performing arts of the Sinhalese people can be categorised into few groups:

*[[Kandyan dance]] consist of 18 Wannam (dance routines) featuring behaviours of various animals such as elephant, eagle, cobra, monkey, peacock and rabbit, mainly performing in Annual Perahara pegent in [[Temple of the Tooth|Sri Dalada Maligawa]] Kandy.
*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Low Country Dances (Pahatharata Natum)|Pahatharata dance]] have significant dancing style which is using for cure illnesses and spiritual clarification.the main feature in this dances is dancer wear on Masks representing various Gods and Demons.and use elements such as fire and water to bless people.
*[[Dances of Sri Lanka#Sabaragamu dances (Sabaragamuwa Natum)|Sabaragamuwa dances]] have also a significant dancing style mainly to entertain people.
*Folk Music and Dances differ according to the casts of Sinhalese people and also some times in regional wise - mainly popular among small children, specially girls.These arts are widely performing during Sinhalese New year period.

===Martial arts===
{{Main|Sinhalese martial arts}}
[[File:Angampora high click.JPG|200px|thumb|rightthumb|Angampora high click.]]

Angampora is the traditional [[martial art]] of the Sinhalese people. It combines [[combat]] techniques, [[self-defence]], [[combat sport|sport]], [[exercise]] and [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=WASALA|first=Chinthana|title=‘Angampora’ the local martial art needs to be revived|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/09/01/spo20.asp|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=DailyNews|date=1 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312234213/http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/09/01/spo20.asp|archivedate=12 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key techniques observed in ''Angampora'' are: ''Angam'', which incorporates hand-to-hand fighting, and ''Illangam'', which uses indigenous weapons such as ''[[Urumi|Velayudaya]]'', staves, knives and swords. Its most distinct feature is the use of [[pressure point]] attacks to inflict pain or permanently paralyse the opponent. Fighters usually make use of both [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[grappling]] techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission [[Joint lock|lock]] that they cannot escape. Usage of weapons is discretionary. Perimeters of fighting are defined in advance, and in some of the cases is a pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulatunga|first=Thushara|title=A truly Sri Lankan art|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/11/22/mag01.asp|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=SundayObserver|date=22 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120210727/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2009/11/22/mag01.asp|archivedate=20 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perera|first=Thejaka|title=Angampora: the Martial Art of Sri Lankan Kings|url=http://exploresrilanka.lk/2010/07/angampora-the-martial-art-of-sri-lankan-kings/|accessdate=15 May 2013|publisher=ExploreSrilanka|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angampora'' became nearly extinct after the country came under [[British Ceylon|British rule]] in 1815, but survived in a few families until the country regained independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LAFFERTY|first=JAMIE|title=The Way of the Guru|url=http://angampora.org/misc/the_way_of_the_guru.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013|publisher=angampora.org|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and education===
{{Main|Education in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Sinhala palm-leaf medical manuscripts, open leaves, large image..JPG|thumb|right|200px|Sinhala ola leaf Medical Manuscripts.]]
The Sinhalese have a long history of literacy and formal learning. Instruction in basic fields like writing and reading by [[Buddhist]] Monks pre-date the [[AD|birth of Christ]]. This traditional system followed religious rule and was meant to foster Buddhist understanding. Training of officials in such skills as keeping track of revenue and other records for administrative purposes occurred under this institution.&lt;ref name="SriSurvey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Silva|first= K.&amp;nbsp;M. |title= Sri Lanka: A Survey |publisher= Institute of Asian Affairs, Hamburg |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8248-0568-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical education such as the building of [[reservoirs]] and canals was passed down from generation to generation through home training and outside craft apprenticeships.&lt;ref name="SriSurvey"/&gt;

The arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and the subsequent colonisation maintained religion as the centre of education though in certain communities under [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] hierarchy. The [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 1800s initially followed the same course. Following 1870 however they began a campaign for better education facilities in the region. Christian missionary groups were at the forefront of this development contributing to a high literacy among Christians.&lt;ref name="SriSurvey"/&gt;

By 1901 schools in the South and the North were well tended. The inner regions lagged behind however. Also, English education facilities presented hurdles for the general populace through fees and lack of access.&lt;ref name="SriSurvey"/&gt;

===Medicine===
Traditional Sinhalese villages in early days had at least one chief Medical personnel called Weda Mahaththaya (Doctor). These people practice their clinical activities by inheritance. The Sinhala Medicine resembles some of Ayurvedic practices in contrast for some treatments they use Buddhist Chantings ([[Paritta|Pirith]]) in order to strengthen the effectiveness.

According to the [[Mahavamsa]], the ancient chronicle, [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka]] (437 BC-367 BC) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documentary evidence we have of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aluvihare|first=Arjuna|date=November 1993|title=Rohal Kramaya Lovata Dhayadha Kale Sri Lankikayo|url=|journal=Vidhusara Science Magazine|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ihsg/publications/pdf/No-42.PDF Resource Mobilization in Sri Lanka's Health Sector]'' – Rannan-Eliya, Ravi P. &amp; De Mel, Nishan, [[Harvard School of Public Health]] &amp; Health Policy Programme, Institute of Policy Studies, February 1997, Page 19.

The '''Society of Free Christians''' is small group of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Christianity|Christians]] founded in 1999 by the Reverend Stephen Callander, the late Ivan Franks and others, very broadly in the spirit of the earlier [[Society of Free Catholics]] to promote liturgical 'catholic' worship within liberal Christian, non-credal, non-judgmental theology. The Society believes the uniting influence of liturgical language and worship drawing members 'God-wards' to be of more importance than the divisive influence of rigid [[dogma]]s or theological constraint.

The Society actively encouraged freedom of religious thought and practical expression.

The Society's worship was firmly entrenched in the '[[Prayer Book]]' tradition and used as its main liturgical resource the ''[[Free Church Book of Common Prayer]]'' of 1919, edited by the Rev. [[Joseph Morgan Lloyd Thomas]], founder of the Society of Free Catholics, and the ''Common Prayer of King's Chapel, Boston''.

The SFC was wholly inclusive and supported the full and equal ministry of men and women.

From its foundation SFC had members from a range of church traditions: [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], Old [[Catholic]], Reformed, Free Christian.

In November 2006 the Society of Free Christians was re-organised and renamed the [[Religious Society of St Simon]], under the administration of [[The Liberal Rite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentoldcatholic.org/history.html|title=Our History|work=Independent Old Catholic|author=[[The Liberal Rite]]|accessdate=2007-12-18}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanisława Tomczyk''' was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Spiritualist]] [[medium (spirituality)|medium]] in the early 20th century.

==Career==
Stanisława Tomczyk was the subject of experiments conducted in 1908–9 at [[Wisła]], in southern [[Poland]], by the Polish [[psychologist]] [[Julian Ochorowicz]].  Reportedly he regularly [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]]d her for therapeutic purposes, and she claimed to be controlled by an entity, "Little Stasia" ("''Stasia''" being a [[diminutive]] of Tomczyk's [[given name]], "Stanisława"), who said she was not the [[spirit]] of any dead person. Tomczyk claimed she could [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] objects without contact, stop the movement of a clock in a glass case, and influence the turn of a roulette wheel.

At the age of twenty, Tomczyk was arrested during a [[riot]] and jailed for ten days. The experience is said to have caused her [[hysteria]] and mental dissociation.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain, between 2 June and 13 July 1914, Tomczyk was tested in eleven sittings by the [[Society for Psychical Research]]. The investigation committee included electrical engineer [[Mark Barr]], [[V. J. Woolley]], [[W. W. Baggally]] and [[Everard Feilding]]. The informal experiments admittedly not subject to rigid control obtained "inconclusive results". The most striking demonstration was the momentary [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] of a celluloid ball some 9 inches above a table, with her hands about a quarter-inch away.&lt;ref&gt;

Scientists suspected that the [[telekinesis]] Tomczyk was performing involved the use of a fine [[Thread (yarn)|thread]] or hair, running between her hands to lift and suspend the objects in the air. This was confirmed when psychical researchers who tested Tomczyk occasionally observed the thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hereward |last=Carrington |authorlink=Hereward Carrington |year=1992 |title=Story of Psychic Science |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |page=136 |isbn=978-1564592590 |orig-year=1931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolman. (1977). ''Handbook of Parapsychology''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 320. {{ISBN|978-0442295769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1919 Tomczyk married the psychical researcher [[Everard Feilding]], secretary of the Society for Psychical Research.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Satsana Phi''' ({{lang-lo|ສາສະໜາຜີ}}; {{lang-th|ศาสนาผี}}, {{IPA|/sàːt.sa.nǎː.pʰǐː/|lang=th}}, "religion of spirits") is a Thai and Lao term describing ethnic [[Tai peoples|Tai]] folk beliefs.

Tai folk animist traditions are practiced by the [[Lao people|Lao]], [[Ahom people|Tai Ahom]], [[Isan people|Lao Isan]] and [[Thai people|Thai]]s of [[Thailand]]. These religions are [[pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and their practice involves classes of [[shamanism|shamans]].

Animist beliefs are often practiced side by side in Thailand and Laos. 
Among the Lao, the [[Lao Loum]] and [[Lao Lom]]&lt;ref name="Yoshihisa2006"&gt;Yoshihisa Shirayama, Samlane Phompida, Chushi Kuroiwa, 2006. p. 622, quote: «[...] Approximately 60 to 65% of the population, most of whom are Lao Lum (people of the lowlands) follow Buddhism. About 30% of the population, on the other hand, hold an animist belief system called "Sadsana Phee" [...]».&lt;/ref&gt; are predominantly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], while the [[Lao Theung]] and [[Lao Sung]] are predominantly folk religious. Tai folk animist traditions have also been incorporated into [[Buddhism in Laos|Laotian Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90142.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Laos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Within the '''Satsana Phi''' belief system, [[supernatural]] [[Deity|Deities]] (ຜີ, ผี, {{IPA|[pʰiː]}}) or gods can sometimes be the [[tutelary deity|tutelary gods]] of buildings or territories, of natural places, or of things.  Deities can also be [[ancestral spirits]], or other types of spirits of seemingly supernatural forces.  Such deities often interact with the world of the living, at times protecting people, and at other times seeming to cause harm. Guardian deities of places, such as the ''phi wat'' (ຜີວັດ, ผีวัด) of temples and the ''lak mueang'' (ຫລັກເມືອງ, หลักเมือง, {{IPA|[lak mɯːaŋ]}}) of towns are celebrated and propitiated with communal gatherings and offerings of food. Gods of [[Hindu]] derivation are included in the Satsana Phi pantheon of gods, as well as several indigenous non-Hindu gods called ''phi thaen'' (ຜີແຖນ, ผีแถน).&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, A. (2007). ''Childbirth and Tradition in Northeast Thailand. Copenhagen, Denmark: Nordic Institute of Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gods are ubiquitous, with some of them being associated with the universal elements: heaven, earth, fire, and water.

The Lao people believe in thirty-two typically protective body-spirits known as the ''khwan'' (ຂວັນ, ขวัญ, {{IPA-lo|kʰwan|}}).  At certain special occasions during the course of an individual's life, such as before a pending marriage, a job change, or at other times of high uncertainty, certain ''[[Baci]]'' (ບາສີ, {{IPA|[bàː.sǐː]}}, บายศรี, {{IPA|[bāːj.sǐː]}}) ceremonies are sometimes performed for the benefit of an individual, with the aim of properly re-binding such "khwan" body-spirits back to one's body, as the unintentional loosening of such bonds is believed to possibly risk illness or harm. The ''baci'' rite calls on all thirty-two ''khwan'' to return to one's self to bestow health, prosperity, and well-being on the affected participant. During such ceremonies, cotton strings are often tied around a participant's wrists to keep the spirits in place. The ''baci'' ceremony can also be performed to welcome guests to one's home, before and after making a long trip, as a curing ritual or after recovery from an illness.  The rite is also the central ritual for both the Lao Loum wedding ceremony and for the [[naming ceremony]] of a newborn child.&lt;ref name="Ireson"&gt;Ireson, W. Randall. "Animism in Laos". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/latoc.html ''A country study: Laos''] (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (July 1994). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In daily life, most people pay respect to the deities that reside in [[spirit house|spirit-house]]s, who are thought to protect the general vicinity of the spirit-house from harm. These spirit-houses are essentially miniature shrines, built to represent the presence of the deity of the shrine, just as a full size shrine is meant to represent such a "presence."  Offerings of flowers, [[incense]], and candles are given, and the spirits are consulted during times of change or hardship for protection and assistance. Natural deities include those that reside in trees, mountains, or forests.

Guardian spirits of people often include ancestors or angelic-beings who arrive at various points in life, better known as ''thewada''. Malevolent spirits (''phi phetu'') include those ''khwan'' of people who were bad in past lives or died of tragic deaths, such as the ghastly ''phi pob'' (ຜີປອບ, ผีปอบ) and the vampirical ''phi dip'' (ຜີດິບ, ผีดิบ). Deities associated with specific places such as the household, the river, or a grove of trees are neither inherently benevolent nor evil, and occasional offerings ensure their favor and assistance in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Ireson"/&gt;

==Priests: ''mophi''==
A class of priests called ''mophi'' (mo-phi ໝໍຜີ, หมอผี), "tellers", are locally trained [[shaman]]s, specialists in the rituals and in communication with their personal angels and gods in general. Using [[trances]], sacred objects imbued with supernatural power, or ''[[saksit]]'', possessions, and rituals like ''[[lam phi fa]]'' (ລຳຜີຟ້າ, ลำผีฟ้า, {{IPA|[lam pʰiː faː]}}) or ''baci'', the shaman is often consulted during times of trouble, hauntings, and illness or other misfortune that might be caused by malevolent or unhappy spirits. They are also usually present during religious festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, M., Fridman, E., Jacoby, J., &amp; Kibbee, J. (2007). ''Shamanism: an encyclopedia of world beliefs, practices, and culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonies==
[[File:Vientiane, baci ceremony (6172947454).jpg|thumb|150px|A ''[[baci]]'' rite conducted by a family in [[Vientiane]].]]
Ceremonies devoted to the gods commonly involve an offering of a chicken and [[rice wine]]. Once the gods have taken the spiritual essence of the offering, people may consume the earthly remains. The head of a household or the individual who wants to gain the favor of the gods usually performs the ritual. In many villages, a person, usually an older man believed to have special knowledge of the gods, may be asked to choose an auspicious day for weddings or other important events, or for household rites.

Lowland Lao villages believe they are protected by the ''phi ban'', which requires an annual offering to ensure the continued prosperity of the village. The village ritual specialist presides over this major ritual, which in the past often involved the sacrifice of a [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] and is still an occasion for closing the village to any outsiders for a day. To ''liang phi ban'' (feed the village spirit) also serves an important social function by reaffirming the village boundaries and the shared interests of all villagers.&lt;ref name="Ireson"/&gt;

For followers of '''Satsana Phi''' (Tai folk religious people), worship of [[ancestor]]s is very important, although each ethnic group has different practices and beliefs. The [[Khmu people|Khmu]] call spirits ''hrooy'', and they are similar to the ''phi'' of the Lao Loum; the house spirit is particularly important, and spirits of wild places are to be avoided or barred from the village.

==Variations==
===Lamet religion===
[[Lamet people|Lamet]] have similar beliefs, and each village must have one ritualist (''xemia''), who is responsible for making all the sacrifices to village gods. He also supervises communal houses and officiates at the construction of any new houses. When a ritual practitioner dies, one of his sons is elected by the married men of the village to be his successor. If he has no sons, one of his brother's sons is chosen.

Ancestral spirits (''mbrong n'a'') are very important to the Lamet because they look out for the well-being of the entire household. They live in the house, and no activity is undertaken without informing them of it. The spirits of the ancestors are fond of buffalos; thus buffalo skulls or horns from sacrifices are hung at the altar of the ancestors or under the [[gable]] of the house. Numerous [[taboo]]s regarding behavior in the house are observed to avoid offending ancestral spirits.&lt;ref name="Ireson"/&gt;

'''Taiwanese ''Electric Flower Cars''''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]]: 電子花車, [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]]: 电子花车, [[pinyin]]: diànzi huā chē) are [[truck]]s that have been converted into wheeled, neon-lit platforms, typically moving stages, upon which [[strippers]] can perform as the vehicle participates in religious, celebratory or [[funeral]] processions. These performances generally include stripping and occasionally involve full-on nudity. A. Marc L. Moskowitz remarked in his making of the documentary ''Funeral Strippers in Taiwan'' that stripping down to complete nudity on the Electric Flower Car has gone "underground because there were laws enacted against full nudity in the mid-80's".&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz [http://io9.com/5819625/in-taiwan-you-can-hire-a-stripper-for-your-funeral In Taiwan you can hire a stripper for your funeral]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the tradition of the Electric Flower Car has generated a considerable amount of controversy.

==Funeral beliefs==

{{Empty section|date=June 2013}}

==Traditional Buddhist funeral practice==
Despite being used in temple events and community performances, the Electric Flower Car is most well known in the funereal context. Traditionally, females clad in flamboyant and skimpy underwear would dance, sing and strip for the benefit of the dead. Statistically, 95.5%n&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmaster.com/country/tw-taiwan/rel-religion&lt;/ref&gt; of Taiwanese practice Buddhism, bringing [[Funeral (Buddhism)|Buddhist burials]] one of the most widely seen practice across [[Taiwan]], regardless of location, North or South. Traditional Buddhist burial ritual involves an open casket, the sacrifice of pigs, a procession with many people walking a certain distance to "send off" the deceased. In this practice it is believed that the louder and rowdier the procession, the easier it is for the deceased to cross over to the after-life. ''Rè Naò'', meaning "hot and noisy" in the Chinese language is an indispensable element in a funeral. In the Buddhist funereal tradition, it is believed that the quality of the deceased after-life is gauged by the number of people who are present to "send off" the deceased during the funeral. A rowdy procession not only symbolize the status of the deceased as having lived a fulfilling life with an abundance of family and friends, it also creates a celebratory mood that is meant to signify the living's willingness at letting the dead move out of the physical world and thus, ensure the dead's smooth journey into the after-life. It marks a celebration rather than one's mournful passing at a funeral.

===Rè Nào===
In order to garner crowds and create a successful and exciting public event, strippers are hired to win attention and more importantly, attendance. Strippers arrive in large moving trucks that have been elaborately decorated with neon lights and pumping stereos. Their job is to dance, sing and strip for the deceased in an effort to heighten the atmosphere and please wandering spirits. 

===Religious Association===
As a part of [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwan's traditional folk culture]], the practice of funeral stripping is closely linked to religious beliefs. It is believed by a large part of the Taiwanese people that higher Gods such as Matzu and [[Guanyin]] are more moral than the lower Gods (ghosts of real people whom people pray to and give offering to on specific festivals). However, lower Gods are associated with human vices such as gambling and womanizing. Therefore. if one would like to pray for things of a higher order such as good luck and protection, the higher Gods would be appealed to. If one wants to pray for one's vices such as addiction to drugs, gambling and womanizing, the lower Gods might be appealed to. Moskowitz, in an interview with i09 commented that besides having female strippers to send the deceased off in style, their presence is also to please the lower Gods.

==Controversy==
Due to the nature of the practice, laws have been enacted in the 1980s to limit the amount of exposure female strippers reveal during performances. The tradition of the Electric Flower Car have since moved out of Taiwan's urban centers into rural areas skirting cities. It is observed that these practices are more widespread in the South, a part of Taiwan that is associated with the working class, lack of solid education and more local traditions. 
In this light, funeral stripping have also involved itself in the discourse of the north and south, a split of culture that has always featured prominently in modern Taiwanese culture discourses. 
With the upper class men in [[Taipei]] complaining about the harmful effect of this practice on social morality, this practice has not only almost disappeared from the northern parts of Taiwan but is also slowly ebbing out as it proved to be incompatible with Taiwan's participation with a global culture.

There exists stereotypes and criticism of female funeral strippers in Taiwan. To some they appear as promiscuous, to others who wholly reject the impetus behind the practice look down on their profession. Strippers themselves, according to Moskowitz, come from generations who have been in the funereal or stripping business and thus see themselves as professionals.

==Law==
Like most folk sponsored practices such as the night markets in Taiwan, funeral stripping does not seem to be rubbing shoulders with the law, not if necessary. Moskowitz in his documentary observed that law enforces such as policemen and politicians themselves are sometimes present during these events. Managers of the event are careful to restrict the amount of skin shown during the performances.

It presents a radically [[Nominalism|nominalist]] and [[Individualism|individualist]] critique of [[Christianity]], [[nationalism]], and traditional morality on one hand; and on the other, [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], [[liberalism]], and much of the then-burgeoning [[Socialism|socialist]] movement, advocating instead an amoral (although importantly not inherently immoral or antisocial) [[egoism]]. It is considered a major influence on the development of [[anarchism]], [[existentialism]], [[nihilism]], and [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=max-stirner|title=Max Stirner|last=Leopold|first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodway, David 2006, p. 99"&gt;Goodway, David.

== Content ==
=== Part one ===
The first part of the text begins by setting out a tripartite [[dialectics|dialectical]] structure based on an individual's stages of life (Childhood, Youth and Adulthood).&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;Leopold, David, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/max-stirner/ "Max Stirner"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn&gt;{{cite book |last=Stirner |first=Max |editor=David Leopold |date=1995 |title=The Unique And Its Property |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge texts in the history of political thought |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first ''realistic'' stage, children are restricted by external material forces. Upon reaching the stage of youth, they begin to learn how to overcome these restrictions by what Stirner calls the "self-discovery of mind". However, in the ''idealistic'' stage, a youth now becomes enslaved by internal forces such as conscience, reason and other 'spooks' or 'fixed ideas' of the mind (including [[religion]], [[nationalism]] and other ideologies). The final stage, 'egoism' sees the now adult individual freed from all internal and external constraints, attaining individual autonomy.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Throughout the book, Stirner applies this dialectial structure to human history (the Ancient and Modern worlds, and the Egoistic Future). Part one is a sustained critique of the first two periods of human history and especially of the failure of the [[Modernity|Modern world]] to escape from religious modes of thinking. Stirner's analysis is opposed to the belief that modern individuals are [[Social progress|progressively]] more free than their predecessors.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; Stirner sees moderns as being oppressed by ideological forces such as [[Christianity]] and the ideologies of the modern [[nation state]].

Stirner's critique of modernity is centred on the [[Protestant Reformation]]. According to Stirner, Reformation theology extended religious domination over individuals by blurring the distinction between the sensual and the spiritual (thus allowing priests to marry for example).  The Reformation also strengthened and intensified religious belief and made it more personal, creating an internal conflict between natural desires and religious conscience. Thus the Reformation only served to further enslave Europeans under spiritual ideology.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Stirner's critique of a progressive view of history is part of his attack on the philosophies of the [[Young Hegelians|left Hegelians]], especially that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. Stirner sees Feuerbach's philosophy as merely a continuation of religious ways of thinking. Feuerbach had argued that Christianity was mistaken in taking human qualities and projecting them into a transcendent God. But according to Stirner, Feuerbach's philosophy, while rejecting a God, left the Christian qualities intact. Feuerbach had taken a set of human qualities and reified them, making them the only prescriptive view of humanity. This became just another religion for Stirner, a "change of masters" over the individual.&lt;ref name=Leopold /&gt; Stirner criticizes other left-Hegelians for setting a conception of essential human nature as a goal to be striven for outside of the individual themselves. So while liberals like [[Arnold Ruge]] found the essence of the human in citizenship, and social liberals like [[Moses Hess]] found it in labor, all of them made a similar error of ossifying an "essence" of the human and deifying it. For Stirner, 'human nature' cannot provide any prescriptions on how one ought to live. His goal is to free the individual from such notions of essential universal goals.

=== Part two ===
Part two is centered on the possibility of freedom from current ideological ways of thinking through a robust philosophical egoism. Stirner's egoism is centered on what he calls ''Eigenheit'' ('Ownness' or autonomy). This 'Ownness' is a feature of a more advanced stage of human personal and historical development. It is the groundwork for our world-view. 

Stirner's Egoism is not a descriptive [[psychological egoism]], in fact he believes that non-egoism is the most common way of thinking. Stirner also does not advocate a narrow prescriptive [[ethical egoism]] of self-interest. Stirner rejects, for example, the actions of an avaricious individual whose only pursuit is material gain. For Stirner such a pursuit enslaves the individual to a single goal and this is incompatible with his idea of autonomy.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Stirner's conception of Ownness is then a type of self-mastery in which one's actions are unrestricted by any internal or external constraints—"I am my own only when I am master of myself, instead of being mastered by...anything else".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|153}} To attain autonomy, the individual must free himself from all forces, such as ideologies, religions, ethics, other persons and even their own desires. For Stirner, ''Eigenheit'' is the only good, and is incompatible with any moral, political and familial obligations ("the forming of a family binds a man".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|102}}) Stirner's influence in anarchist circles stems from his rejection of the legitimacy of the state. Stirner argues that "own will and the state are powers in deadly hostility, between which no 'perpetual peace' is possible".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|175}} Every form of the state is rejected as a despotism over individual self ownership. Even a unanimously democratic decision does not bind Stirner's egoist, since this would freeze his "will of yesterday", making him a slave to his past desires and decisions. Stirner rejects promise keeping on similar grounds of not allowing past actions to constrain his autonomy. He states that the egoist must embrace the "heroism of the lie".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|210}}

Along with his critique of ideologies and institutions, Stirner also provides an alternative form of social relationship, the "[[union of egoists]]" (''verein von egoisten'').&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|161}} These unions are temporary groupings of self-determined individuals which do not subordinate each individual to the good of the group. The only good in these unions is the self-interest of each individual. Stirner suggests that some human relationships like [[love]] might continue in this new egoistic future. However this new kind of love is one in which the egoist does not sacrifice his autonomy and thus he loves only as long as "love makes me happy".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|256}}

Stirner does not shy away from the radical outcomes of his worldview. He explains the relationship between the egoist and his objects or other persons as one of 'ownership'. For Stirner this means that there are no restrictions, moral or otherwise, on how an egoist can relate to other things and persons. The egoist views others instrumentally, they are "nothing but - my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to use by you".&lt;ref name=TheEgoAndItsOwn/&gt;{{rp|263}} The consequences of this view is that he does not see murder, incest and infanticide as always unjustified. Stirner admits that this view affords little comfort to others but he states that his audience's concern is of no importance to him.

{{quote box|quote=Do I write out of love to men? No, I write because I want to procure for my thoughts an existence in the world; and, even if I foresaw that these thoughts would deprive you of your rest and your peace, even if I saw the bloodiest wars and the fall of many generations springing up from this seed of thought &amp;mdash; I would nevertheless scatter it. Do with it what you will and can, that is your affair and does not trouble me. You will perhaps have only trouble, combat, and death from it, very few will draw joy from it.|source=[[Max Stirner]], ''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 394|align=left|salign=right}}{{clear|left}}
He also asserted his own "doctrine" of self-interest to be neither a universal truth nor an established viewpoint, and likens his book to a [[ladder]] you throw away after climbing, a sort of self-therapy.&lt;ref&gt;The same mental image of a ladder to be thrown away after climbing is used by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in section 6.54 of ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. This turn of phrase was originally coined by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in 1844: {{quotation|However, for the man who studies to gain ''insight'', books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]| ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and structure ==
Stirner repeatedly quotes [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Bruno Bauer]] assuming that readers will be familiar with their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and [[in-joke]]s on formulations found in [[Hegel]]'s works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.

== Reception and influence ==
Initially, ''The Unique And Its Property'' received much attention, though most reviews were negative critiques by left Hegelians such as [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Moses Hess]], as well as by Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref name="Welsh17"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; p. 17. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerbach's critique, "[[The Essence of Christianity]] in Relation to The Unique And Its Property" called the work 'ingenious' and 'intelligent' but also criticizes it as 'eccentric, one-sided and falsely defined.' &lt;ref name="Welsh17" /&gt; Stirner responded to these critiques in an 1845 essay titled "Stirner's Critics".

''The Unique And Its Property'' also had a profound impact on [[Marx]] and [[Engels]]. In 1844 Engels sent a letter to Marx praising "the noble Stirner" and suggesting that his dialectical Egoism can serve as a point of departure for communism: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is certainly true that we must first make a cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it. . . . [W]e are communists out of egoism also, and it is out of egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...&lt;ref name="Welsh20"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; p. 20. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Marx and Engels would later collaborate on a lengthy criticism of Stirner's book in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845, published 1932). The critique is a polemical tirade filled with ad hominem attacks and insults against Stirner (Marx calls him a "petty bourgeois individualist intellectual").&lt;ref name="Welsh2223"&gt;Welsh, John F. Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation; pp. 22–23. Lexington Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirner also had a lasting influence in the tradition of [[Individualist Anarchism]]. American Individualist [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], editor of the Journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', adopted Stirner's Egoism in 1886 while rejecting conceptions of [[natural rights]]. This led to a bitter split in American Individualist Anarchism between Egoists such as [[James L. Walker]], [[Sidney Parker (anarchist)|Sidney Parker]], [[Dora Marsden]] and [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverly Robinson]] and the proponents of natural rights anarchism such as that of [[Lysander Spooner]].&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy.

Literature of Liberty: A Review of Contemporary Liberal Thought (1978–1982). Institute for Human Studies. Autumn 1981, VOL. IV, NO. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other Individualist Anarchists influenced by Stirner include [[Lev Chernyi]], [[Adolf Brand]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Enrico Arrigoni]],  [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]], and [[Émile Armand]].

Recently, Stirner has been an influential source for [[post-left anarchy|post-left anarchist]] thinkers such as [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]] and [[Hakim Bey]].

== Confusion of the censors ==
''He who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe'', a 1955 exhibition by University of Kansas Library noted the following regarding the book's initial publication: {{quote|Its frank espousal of anarchistic egoism led to the not unexpected announcement in the newspapers of Saxony that the book had been immediately confiscated in Leipzig. Anxious not to be outdone, where usually they were so far ahead, Prussia banned the book. Then, Berlin received more accurate news: the book had not been banned in Saxony at all. In fact, the book's farfetched overstatement was regarded at Dresden as its own best antidote. The small states of Germany fell into line, on one side or the other, often with considerable difficulty owing to the scarcity of copies to examine first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/bannedbooks/germany.html|title=''He who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe'', an exhibition of books which have survived Fire, the Sword and the Censors |publisher=University of Kansas Library |year=1955 |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Jewish Exponent''' brand consists of a weekly community newspaper, a website, and a quarterly magazine. 

The ''Jewish Exponent'' newspaper is the flagship publication of the Jewish Publishing Group, which also produces The Guide to Jewish Philadelphia and special interest supplements. 

==History==
The newspaper serves the Jewish community of Greater Philadelphia and has been published continuously since April 15, 1887.&lt;ref name=JewishExponentWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/about|website=Jewish Exponent|publisher=Jewish Exponent|accessdate=21 February 2015|ref=JewishExponentWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA&gt;{{cite news|title=Philadelphia’s ‘jewish Exponent’ to Celebrate Its 75th Anniversary|url=http://www.jta.org/1962/03/30/archive/philadelphias-jewish-exponent-to-celebrate-its-75th-anniversary|accessdate=7 May 2015|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=30 March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keating&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keating|first1=Douglas|title=100 Years As A Voice Of The Jews Of Phila.|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-06-12/news/26184885_1_jewish-exponent-front-page-jewish-community|accessdate=7 May 2015|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A predecessor newspaper, ''The Jewish Record,'' had been published since 1875.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt;

The current circulation is made up of direct subscribers and those who donate to the [http://www.jewishphilly.org/ Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia]. The paper is currently delivered to approximately 24,000 households.&lt;ref name=phillymag/&gt; The paper had 40,000 subscribers in 2009.&lt;ref name=Shister&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shister|first1=Gail|title=Redefining the Jewish Exponent A new editor brings a new approach|url=http://articles.philly.com/2009-01-20/news/25279627_1_jewish-federation-jewish-population-jewish-exponent|accessdate=7 May 2015|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the paper celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1962, it had the largest circulation of any Jewish newspaper in the United States.&lt;ref name=JTA/&gt; At the hundredth anniversary in 1987, the circulation was 65,000.&lt;ref name=Keating/&gt;

The second-oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the United States{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}, it has evolved from its roots as a voice for prominent businessmen to a multimedia platform for delivering Jewish news and information and stimulating community dialogue.

The paper was founded by 43 prominent Philadelphians—among them [[Henry Samuel Morais]]—who pledged that it would be "devoted to the interests of the Jewish people."  It was an early supporter of [[Zionism]]. In the 1940s the paper experienced financial difficulties, and on May 5, 1944, it was purchased by the Allied Jewish Appeal, a precursor of the [[Jewish Federation]] of [[Delaware Valley|Greater Philadelphia]], which still publishes it today via the Jewish Publishing Group.

In 1999, the Jewish Exponent launched its website. A totally re-designed website was launched in November 2012. The site contains timely news of a local, national, global and Israel nature, as well as blogs, special interest columns, classifieds, death notices and Mazel-Tov announcements. It is the home of the Jewish community events calendar with hundreds of events added monthly in a fashion that is searchable by event type, audience and location. The online guide to Jewish Philly provides a searchable method for the community to find out about every Jewish organization in the Delaware Valley, as well as businesses that wish to promote their products and services to the Jewish community of Greater Philadelphia. The site also allows users to register for weekly email newsletters as well as engage with the Jewish Exponent via social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest.

On June 3, 2015, the ''Exponent'' laid off its entire editorial staff.  Reports said that the paper had been losing $300,000 per year.  The owners contracted with Mid-Atlantic Media to operate the editorial department of the paper. Mid-Atlantic is based in [[Baltimore]] and produces several other Jewish papers, including the  ''[[Baltimore Jewish Times]]'', ''[[Washington Jewish Week]]'', and ''[[The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh]]''.  Joshua Runyan, Mid-Atlantic's editorial director, was named the paper's new editor, replacing Lisa Hostein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |url=http://forward.com/news/309874/whats-behind-the-mass-layoffs-at-the-philadelphia-jewish-exponent/ |title=What's Behind the Mass Layoffs at the Philadelphia Jewish Exponent? |work=[[The Forward]] |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate=2015-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Vicar of Dibley''''' is a British [[television sitcom|sitcom]] which originally ran on [[BBC One]] from 10 November 1994 to 22 January 1998 (with three sets of specials in the Winters of 1999/2000, 2004/2005 and 2006/2007). It is set in a fictional small [[Oxfordshire]] village called Dibley, which is assigned a female [[vicar]] following the 1992 changes in the [[Church of England]] that permitted the [[ordination of women]].

In ratings terms, it is among the most successful British programme in the digital era, with the various Christmas and New Year specials in 1999, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 all entering the UK top 10 programmes of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/facts/since1981/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310000055/http://www.barb.co.uk/facts/since1981 |archivedate=10 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Vicar of Dibley'' received multiple [[British Comedy Awards]] (including a Best TV Comedy Actress Award for [[Emma Chambers]]), two [[List of International Emmy Award winners|International Emmys]], and was a multiple [[British Academy Television Awards]] nominee. In 2004, it placed third in a BBC poll of ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]''.

The series also includes six charity special shorts, for [[Comic Relief]], the most recent in 2015.

The series was created by [[Richard Curtis]] and written for actress [[Dawn French]] by Curtis and [[Paul Mayhew-Archer]], with contributions from [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]]. The main character was an invention of Richard Curtis, but he and Dawn French extensively consulted [[Joy Carroll]], one of the first Anglican female priests, and garnered many character traits and much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beneath the Cassock: The Real-life Vicar of Dibley|author=[[Joy Carroll]]|isbn= 0-00-712207-1&lt;!-- 978-0007122073 --&gt;|publisher= HarperCollins|date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
{{Main article|List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes}}

''The Vicar of Dibley'' has had 20 episodes, spanning two series between 1994 and 1998, and ten specials between 1996 and 2007. In addition there have been six short charity specials, between 1997 and 2015.

The first series was broadcast on BBC One from 10 November to 15 December 1994, consisting of six episodes. Following the first series, an Easter special and a Christmas special were broadcast in 1996. A four-episode second series was ordered and screened between the 26 December 1997 and 22 January 1998. Subsequent episodes consisted of Christmas and New Year specials, with the four "Seasonal Specials" (in the order Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer, often referred to as the third series) airing from 24 December 1999 to 1 January 2000, the two-episode "A Very Dibley Christmas" screening between 25 December 2004 and 1 January 2005, and the two-part finale, "A Wholly Holy Happy Ending", which was broadcast during Christmas 2006 and New Year 2007.     

The final 2006-2007 episode, in which Geraldine marries, was publicised as the "last-ever" episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6225745.stm|title=Dibley's farewell is ratings hit|publisher=BBC|date=2 January 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there have been three [[Comic Relief]] charity specials since.

On 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as [[Geraldine Granger]] as part of her [[French and Saunders]] marathon on [[BBC Radio 2]].  She was interviewed by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] on his ''Pause for Thought'' section.

The episodes often begin and end with funny vignettes. In earlier episodes, the opening credits were followed by a humorous village scene, such as a woman knitting directly from a sheep, a man sliding off a thatched roof, or the vicar building a tower of books to amuse Alice's baby. After the closing credits Geraldine usually tells Alice a joke, to which Alice either overreacts, tries to interpret the joke literally, or understands only after Geraldine explains the joke. There are a few exceptions: in "The Window &amp; the Weather" (1994) Alice tells a joke to Geraldine; in "Love and Marriage" (1998) Geraldine tells the joke to David, as Alice is away on her honeymoon; and in "Happy New Year" (2005) the joke is told at the beginning, since the end of the episode focuses on the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign.

In May 2007, [[Richard Curtis]] received a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]] for his humanitarian pursuits as well as his creative work including ''The Vicar of Dibley''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas| first= Archie| title= British acad to honor Curtis – Scribe wrote 'Vicar of Dibley, ' 'Girl in the Cafe'|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965325.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1| work=Variety| accessdate= 21 May 2007 | date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and setting==
[[File:Turville.15.4.07.jpg|thumb|right|The village of [[Turville]] in Buckinghamshire stands in for the village of Dibley]]
[[File:Turville, St Mary.jpg|thumb|right|St. Mary's Church stands in for the fictional 'Parish Church of St. Barnabus (sic)]]
Though set in the fictional [[Oxfordshire]] village of Dibley, the series was filmed in the [[Buckinghamshire]] village of [[Turville]], with the village's St Mary the Virgin Church doubling as Dibley's St Barnabus (''sic''). Other television programmes and films, such as ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (film)|Goodnight Mister Tom]]'', ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'', ''[[Father Came Too!]]'', ''[[Marple (ITV TV series)|Marple]]'', and ''[[Foyle's War]]'' have also been filmed in the village. The exterior location for David Horton's manor (usually only seen in [[establishing shot]]s) was not located in Turville, but in the village of [[Little Missenden]], Buckinghamshire.

The opening titles show aerial shots of the [[M40 motorway]]'s [[Stokenchurch Gap]], the [[Chiltern Hills]] of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and the village of Turville.

Only two episodes, "The Window and the Weather" (1994) and "Celebrity Vicar" (1998), plus the 2013 Comic Relief sketch have scenes clearly set in locations outside the village. It is not clear whether other scenes, such as the speed dating session in "Happy New Year" (2005), were meant to be located in the village or not.

==Theme music==
The theme music was a setting of [[Psalm 23]] composed by [[Howard Goodall]] and was performed by the choir of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]], with George Humphreys&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s631456.htm |title=ABC Classic FM Music Details: Saturday 10 June 2000 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; singing the solo and also sang by the West Bromwich Albion Fans. The conductor was [[Stephen Darlington]]. Goodall originally wrote it as a serious piece of church choral music. It has been released as a [[charity record|charity single]] with proceeds to Comic Relief. It also appears on Goodall's CD ''Choral Works'', which also includes his theme for another popular comedy, ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' - and coincidentally a snippet of The Vicar of Dibley's theme music was used in ''Mr. Bean'' episode [[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]].

==DVD releases==
''The Vicar of Dibley'' was released in DVD in Region 2 (UK) from 2001. In 2002, a DVD entitled ''The Best of The Vicar of Dibley'' was released featuring a 90-minute film of Dawn French talking to the producer, [[Jon Plowman]], with clips from the series. A 2002 documentary narrated by [[Jo Brand]], entitled ''The Real Vicars of Dibley'', was also on the DVD. In 2005, a boxset of the "complete collection" was released. This included all the then aired episodes and shorts except the 1997 ''BallyKissDibley'' Comic Relief short. The final two episodes and 6-disc "ultimate" box set were released on 26 November 2007, neither included the 2007 Comic Relief short or the ''BallyKissDibley'' one.

In Australia (Region 4), all episodes have been released on DVD, but the 2007 Comic Relief short episode, "Wife Swap", has only been released on a Comic Relief DVD called ''Now That's What I Call Comedy'', having become difficult to find.

In the United States and Canada (Region 1), all episodes have been released on DVD.

The seasonal specials are often referred to as "Series 3". This is not a series, and was not released as such on VHS or DVD in the UK. In the United States, the four specials were released as "Series 3".

==Return==
In February 2016 it was reported that Dawn French was interested in returning to the role as "The Bishop Of Dibley", to follow on from the 2015 Red Nose Day Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Cable |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/vicar-dibley-set-tv-comeback-7371605 |title=Vicar of Dibley set for TV comeback - but with one very big change - Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date= 2016-02-14|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American version==
The idea for a US version of the show came about when two co-stars of the American sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', [[Jane Leeves]] and [[Peri Gilpin]], set up their production company Bristol Cities with an American version of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' as their first project. On 6 February 2007, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced plans to adapt ''The Vicar of Dibley'' into an American sitcom, titled ''The Minister of Divine''. The series starred [[Kirstie Alley]] as a former "Wild Child" who returned to her hometown as its first female minister. The series was not picked up by Fox for its 2007–2008 schedule.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-alleyministerpilotcasting,0,6229918.story?coll=zap-tv-headlines|title=Pilots: FOX 'Minister' Role Up Kirstie's Alley|publisher=Zap2it.com|accessdate=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ufomag uk v11n1.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''UFO Magazine'''s March/April 1992 issue]] --&gt;'''''UFO Magazine''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[magazine]] devoted to the subject of [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) and [[extraterrestrial life]]. It was founded in 1981 by brothers [[Graham Birdsall|Graham]] and [[Mark Birdsall]] of [[Leeds]], [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;Townsend, Mark "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/14/pressandpublishing.uknews UFO spies vanish into black hole]", [[The Observer]], March 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was one of the success stories of [[ufology]], with an international reputation for quality and a peak circulation of 35,000.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;Herbert, Ian "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ufospotters-give-up-hunt-for-flying-saucers-502194.html UFO-spotters give up hunt for flying saucers]", [[The Independent]], 10 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Virgin of Almudena''' (''Virgen de la Almudena'') is  a medieval [[icon]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], mother of [[Jesus Christ]]. The image is the advocation of the Virgin that serves as a patroness of [[Madrid]], Spain. 

Intriguingly, however, its name derives from the Arabic term of ''Al Mudayna'', or the citadel. There are various legends regarding the icon. One story is that in 712, prior to the capture of the town by the advancing Muslim forces, the inhabitants of the town secreted the image of the virgin, for its own protection, inside the walls surrounding the town. In the 11th century, when Madrid was [[Reconquista|reconquered]] by the King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], the Christian soldiers endeavored to find the statue. After days of prayer, the spot on the wall hiding the icon crumbled, revealing the statue. Another legend is that as Christian soldiers approached the town, they had a vision of Mary imploring them to allow her to lead them into the city. Again the miraculous crumbling of the wall occurred, with the icon showing an entry route through the walls. 

The [[Almudena Cathedral|Cathedral of Madrid]] is dedicated to this advocation of the Virgin and her feast day, 9 November, is a major holiday in Madrid.

'''''Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America''''' is a [[folkloristics|folkloric]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the United States. It was written by the American anthropologist and folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]] of [[California State University, Northridge]] and first published in 2004 by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. It was released as a part of a series of academic books titled 'Contemporary Ethnography', edited by the anthropologists [[Kirin Narayan]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].

Magliocco became interested in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest [[Don Frew]] and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing [[altered states of consciousness]] during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work'', which was followed by the more general ''Witching Culture'' two years later.

''Witching Culture'' provides an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role that [[folklore]] has within the movement; in this it looks both at how Pagans have adopted pre-existing folklore and how unique Pagan folklore actually develops within the community. It deals with the influence of folkloristic on the early development of Wicca, in particular the influence of figures like [[Sir James Frazer]], [[Charles Leland]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

The reviews published in specialist academic journals were predominantly positive, with [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and [[Jacqueline Simpson]] being particularly praiseworthy, although some reviewers opined that Magliocco's openly Pagan beliefs had some negative repercussions for the study.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism, is a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]] influenced by the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s that was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book that helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 then saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Next came the work of the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] with her ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; Then there was Jone Salomonsen's study of the Reclaiming tradition in San Francisco, ''[[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magliocco and her research===

Magliocco became interested in Paganism in the mid-1990s, intending to explore "the confluence of ritual, festival, gender and politics &amp;ndash; the subject of my earlier research in Italy &amp;ndash; in a new context". Initially she was interested in Paganism as a "folk revival, in issues surrounding the use of folklore from academic sources, cultural appropriation, and the construction of authenticity in the invention of rituals" rather than in any actual spiritual capacity.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1995, Magliocco attended the first Pantheacon conference, a meeting of practicing Pagans and academics held at a hotel in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California. It was at the conference that she took part in a ritual led by members of the [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wiccan]] tradition, later characterizing it as "my first powerfully affecting ritual experience in a Neo-Pagan context".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="My decision was not motivated only by expedience. I was aesthetically pleased and genuinely moved by some of the rituals I attended, and as a result of these experiences, I changed in significant ways. Because I decided to remain open and vulnerable during rituals, I gained access to imaginative experiences I had banished from my consciousness since reaching adulthood. These were crucial in helping me understand the essence of the culture I was studying; had I ''not'' had them, I would have failed to grasp the importance of religious ecstasy in the Neo-Pagan experience."|source=—Sabina Magliocco, on why she became a Pagan, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Magliocco had initially intended to conduct a long-term period of fieldwork among a single Pagan group, with a focus on understanding their "dynamics of ritual creation", but ultimately was unable to do this; from 1994 through to 1997, she held a series of temporary academic appointments at universities across the United States, preventing her from staying in one area for any lengthy period of time and studying any one particular group there.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; However, from 1995 through to 1997, she was living in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, where she immersed herself in the one of "the country's oldest and most active Neo-Pagan communities", that of the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; Here, she befriended Holly Tannen, a folklorist and ballad performer who was well known and respected among the Pagan community of northern California. It was through Trennan that she was introduced to many other members of the Pagan community, including to a local Gardnerian Wiccan coven.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt;

In 1996, she moved into a "small rental house" in the Berkeley Flats along a line of houses that were nicknamed "Witch Row" (a fact that she was unaware of at the time), and it was here that she befriended further members of the Pagan community; her neighbors were elders in the Fellowship of the Spiral Path, while another neighboring house was the home of Judy Foster, a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Several streets away lived [[Don Frew]] and Anna Korn, the high priest and high priestess of a Gardnerian group known as the Coven Trismegiston.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 11"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding that she wanted to actively participate in the religions she was studying, Magliocco was initiated into the Coven Trismegiston, and went on to begin training in the Reclaiming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 she published her first academic study of American Paganism, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work''. ''Witching Culture'' was published in the "Contemporary Ethnography" series of books, edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ConEth|University of Pennsylvania Press]]. undated.&lt;/ref&gt; Magliocco dedicated the book to the memory of Andrew Vázsonyi (1906&amp;ndash;1986),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. unnumbered opening page.&lt;/ref&gt; a Hungarian folklorist and novelist who had worked for two decades at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Döm86|Dömötör 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction, "The Ethnography of Magic and the Magic of Ethnography", Magliocco discusses how she first became involved with the Pagan movement, and includes extracts from the field notes that she made at the time. Going on to lay out the objectives of the book, Magliocco discusses the [[history of Wicca]], and the influence that early anthropologists like [[Edward Taylor]] and [[James Frazer]] had on it as a burgeoning movement. Proceeding to discuss the pre-existing academic studies of the Pagan movement, she explains her own approach to the subject and how it differs from those of her predecessors, in particular focusing on her own spiritual experiences and altered states of consciousness that she experienced while taking part in Pagan ritual and her insider-outsider perspective on the Pagan movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Roots and Branches===
Chapter one, "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", offers a historical introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking at its roots in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Sir James Frazer]]. Proceeding to look at this relationship, she highlights the work of [[Charles Leland]], [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism can be viewed as a "folk tradition" on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of [[western esotericism]], and secondly, because it acts as a form of "resistance culture" in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of "textual poachers" from the French sociologist [[Michel de Certeau]], arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two, "Boundaries and Borders: Imagining Community", opens with a discussion of how Pagans distinguish themselves from one another and from the wider society around them, before delving into the idea that folklore is vital to Pagan "group formation". Magliocco goes on to describe the Pagan community, with a particular emphasis on those in the United States, dealing with such subjects as ethnicity, education, gender and sexual orientation. Moving on to look at how Pagans forge their own identities, she highlights factors such as costume and use of language, and whether such Pagan coding is explicit, complicit or implicit. Magliocco discusses the various different Pagan traditions, and the community division between those who call themselves "witches" and those who do not. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of the anthropological fieldwork that she undertook among the San Francisco Bay Area Pagan community between 1995 and 2000, the Coven Trismegiston that she worked with, and the local [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]], [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming]] and [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn|NROOGD]] traditions that she encountered there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 57&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Religions of Experience===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The third chapter, "Making Magic: Training the Imagination", begins with Magliocco's assertion that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting the rest of the chapter to an examination of how Pagans "conceive of and practice magic", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape [[rationality]], but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim "traditional ways of knowing that privilege the imagination". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of "magic" developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate "magic" with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable "[[supernatural]]" force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the [[Wheel of the Year|celebration of seasonal Sabbats]], and the relevance that that has for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the [[Wiccan Rede]] and the [[Law of Threefold Return]], Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 95&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Beyond Experience: Religion and Identity===
{{Empty section|date=December 2011}}

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
{{Quote box

|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7
|fontsize  = 85%
|title_bg  =
|title_fnt =
|title     =
|quote     = "My absorption into the Neo-Pagan community and my subjective spiritual experiences during fieldwork beg the question that always bedevils ethnologists: to what extent did my participation in the culture cause me to "go native", to adopt the beliefs, attitudes, and worldviews of the people I studied? Am I an insider or an outsider, and how can I be "objective" about a culture if I have adopted an emic, or insider's perspective?"
|salign    = right
|source    = Sabina Magliocco, 2004.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In undertaking her fieldwork, Magliocco discussed whether she took an "outsider" perspective, thereby being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] about those whom she was researching, or whether she had adopted an "insider" perspective, thereby being [[subjectivity|subjective]] in her views of Pagans and Paganism.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; She claimed that the question as to whether she was an insider or outsider researcher was akin to a question that she had been posed as a child; being an [[Italian American]], Magliocco had often been asked whether she was Italian or American, to which she would respond that she was both.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; As she noted:

:My answer to readers who want to know whether I am "really" an insider or an outsider to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both &amp;ndash; that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological ''and'' Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is ''not'' about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt;

In this position, Magliocco was in agreement with Jone Salomonsen, the feminist theologian and ethnographer who had performed fieldwork among the Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco in order to gain research for her book ''[[Enchanted Feminism]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Magliocco 16"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Salomonsen had called this mixed insider/outsider approach the "method of compassion" and wrote that it "does not refer to a wholesale positive embracement, nor to passionate criticisms and arguing, but to something in between... Engagement is more than participation, and something other than pretending. To allow oneself to become engaged is to take the ritual seriously. It is [being] willing to let the trance induction take you into trance, to be willing to be emotionally moved as is intended by certain ritual elements, and [to] go with what happens."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]]. pp. 4, 9, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altered states of consciousness===
Magliocco also saw herself as an insider because she allowed herself to experience the [[altered states of consciousness]] that contemporary Pagan rituals are reported to induce. As she stated, "I take an experiential approach to the extraordinary experiences" that occur in ritual, and that the "essence of this approach is twofold". The first part of this involved the "conscious, willing, and full participation in ritual experiences intended to induce alternate states of consciousness, and the interpretation of visions and dreams" as different ways of interpreting life. The second part of this "mandates that I consider informants' experiences seriously" when they discuss altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magliocco highlighted the work of the anthropologists David Young and Jean-Guy Goulet in their ''Being Changed: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experience'' (1994), who had argued that spiritual experiences were relatively common among anthropologists, but that most of those working in the discipline fail to speak publicly about their experiences because of a fear of "ridicule and ostracism" by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#You94|Young and Goulet 1994]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to highlight the work of other anthropologists who have discussed their own spiritual experiences that occurred while taking part in rituals in the midst of their fieldwork,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Bruce Grindal's experience among the [[Sisala]] in Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri83|Grindal 1983]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Lee's experience with Malay spirit possession rites,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee87|Lee 1987]]. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edith Turner's experience in a [[Ndembu]] healing ritual.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tur94|Turner 1994]]. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

This highly personal lead-in story and the author's subsequent reflections in the Introduction provide readers with a clear sense of the perspective from which she approaches her topic. Magliocco makes effective use of this narrative structure—evocative personal story followed by academic reflection—throughout her book. I found her initial discussion of how contemporary ethnography has struggled to renegotiate the boundary between engagement and distance fascinating."

}}

Reviewing ''Witching Culture'' in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', the American religious studies scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] described the work as "the best survey to date" of modern Paganism, "particularly if the focus of one's interest is North American Paganism". In his opinion, ''Witching Culture'' "breaks important new ground in Pagan Studies. In fact, I anticipate that in the near future it will come to be regarded as a groundbreaking book—one to which all future studies of Paganism will refer." He went on to describe it as "my first choice for a textbook in any university class with a significant component on contemporary Paganism" and felt that "Almost every chapter contains either new insights or original analyses that extend prior discussions to a new depth."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt; Lewis noted that although he didn't have "any real criticism" of the book, he wished that it had discussed the role of solitary practitioners and teenage Wiccans, two significant sectors of the Pagan community whom Magliocco only mentioned in passing, and the infighting among the Wiccan community, which Magliocco hadn't even mentioned. Ultimately, Lewis remarked that "I can heartily recommend this book as a 'must read' for anyone in this field, whether academic observers or reflective participants."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt;

In her review for the ''Folklore'' journal, the English folklorist [[Jacqueline Simpson]] described ''Witching Culture'' as offering a "fascinating analysis" of how U.S. Pagans have "adopted and adapted elements of European folk practice to fit the Gardnerian framework of their rituals and spells". Ultimately, she characterised the work as being "a very informative and well-researched study, and a most interesting read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sim05|Simpson 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; Roman I. Shiyan of the [[University of Alberta]] reviewed ''Witching Culture'' in the journal ''Ethnologies'', stating that the work was "lucid evidence of the growing popularity of neo-pagan topics in North America and the academic world in particular" and that Magliocco "raises several important theoretical issues" regarding the topic. In conclusion, he felt that the book "takes us deep into a largely obscure and often misunderstood culture, which offers a very different perspective of the world and the place of humans in it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shi05|Shiyan 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of American Folklore'', the sociologist [[Gary Alan Fine]] published a review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as "a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since [[Leslie Prosterman]]'s ''Ordinary Life, Festival Days''". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism to be the most "politically progressive and postmodern" religion in existence "despite [its] considerable borrowings of traditional themes", Fine felt that ''Witching Culture'' was "an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple &amp;ndash; and occasionally conflicting &amp;ndash; strains from which it draws". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to "stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither is it necessary to nuzzle. This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical." He went on to remark that a "more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an "account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene", ''Witching Culture'' warrants "high praise".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fin05|Fine 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review, published in the ''History of Religions'' journal, Stefanie von Schnurbein of the Nordeuropa-Institut, [[Humboldt-Universität]], Berlin, wrote that Magliocco dealt with "a sadly understudied issue" in her study, but that "To the disappointment of a reader who expects a theoretically advanced discussion of these relations [between religious culture and academic thinking], the historical argument and material do not go far beyond [[Ronald Hutton]]'s in-depth study of the history of modern pagan witchcraft, ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]''." Continuing with her review, Von Schnurbein opines that Magliocco manages to create a "vivid impression of, and informed insights into, the different facets and contradictions of a contemporary religious movement", one that "allows for well-informed critiques of the problem of rooting spirituality in ethnic or cultural heritage and of the problem of cultural exploitation through borrowing". Nonetheless, she notes that because Magliocco herself is a practicing Pagan, it "limits to a certain degree the author's ability to scrutinize further some of the problems intrinsic to the reception and resignification of ideologically questionable concepts and theories". She also notes that in Magliocco's work, "art, creativity, and imagination are depicted as exclusively positive forces that are rooted in experience and are responsible for the potential of resistance to be found in neopagan ritual and religion". In Von Schnurbein's opinion, "The next step of critical investigation would be to analyze this concept of art as a construction as well."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Von08|Von Schnurbein 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the Pagan community===
Writing on ''The Cauldron'' website, a practicing Pagan using the pseudonym of "Pitch" described the work as "thoughtful, insightful, fruitful, grounded, and, maybe, provocative" as well as being a "Must Have, Double Bag!" book that "all of us should be proud to add to our libraries".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pit|Pitch. undated.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IndicText}}
'''Akarna Dhanurasana''' ({{lang-sa|आकर्ण धनुरासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''Ākarṇa Dhanurāsana''), also called the '''Archer pose''',&lt;ref name=Yogaasan&gt;{{cite web |title=Akarm Dhanurasana – Archer Pose, The shooting bow pose |url=https://www.yogaasan.com/akarmdhanurasana-archer-pose-the-shooting-bow-pose/ |publisher=Yogaasan |accessdate=15 November 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bow and Arrow pose''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Dr. Tommijean|last2=B.S.|first2=Benjamin A. Thomas|title=Iyengar Yoga the Integrated and Holistic Path to Health: The Effective and Scientifically Investigated System of Yoga |year=2008 |publisher=Xlibris |isbn=978-1-4628-4365-7|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Shooting Bow pose'''&lt;ref name=Yogaasan/&gt; is an [[asana]]. The posture resembles an archer about to release an arrow.

==Etymology==
'''Ākarṇa Dhanurāsana''' in translation from Sanskrit Karṇa means ear and the prefix Ā means towards; or near. ''Dhanu'' means "bow" and ''asana'' means "pose". The name alludes to a myth in the [[Ramayana]] in which the infant [[Sita]] is able to lift [[Shiva]]'s enormous bow, and when she reaches marriageable age, only [[Rama]] is able to wield it, and so become her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Zo |title=The Mythology Behind Akarna Dhanurasana (Shooting Bow Pose) |url=https://yogainternational.com/article/view/the-mythology-behind-akarna-dhanurasana-shooting-bow-pose |publisher=Yoga International |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This [[asana]] involves pulling the foot towards the ear. To achieve this asana, the practitioner begins in:

# [[Dandasana]] the foundation for all seated asanas.
#  Grabs hold of each big toes between the thumb and index finger (known as the sixth variant of the [[Paschimottanasana]]).
# Exhales, keeping the right leg in full contact with the floor and pull the left foot up towards the ear, bending the knee.
# Holds the position up to 20 seconds breathing normally. Next exhales and straightens the left leg.
# Pulls the foot to a vertical position and holding it statically for 15 seconds.
# Bends the knee returning to stage 4.
# Returns the left leg to the floor
# Repeats on the other side.

Since this asana require both strength and flexibility,&lt;ref name ="yogaJ"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2769 | title=Take Aim | author=Schumacher, John | journal=Yoga Journal | date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to prepare for it by performing a sequence consisting of asanas that promote general flexibility, such as:

*[[Supta Padangusthasana]] variants
*[[Paripurna navasana]]
*[[Ardha Navasana]]
*[[Garland Pose|Malasana]]

The following hip openers specifically promote the flexibility of the hips:

* [[Baddha Konasana]]
* [[Janu Sirsasana]]
* [[Marichyasana|Marichyasana I]]

==Benefits==
This asana improves flexibility of the leg muscles. Abdominal muscles and the lower spine are also strengthened.&lt;ref name=menuhin&gt;{{cite book |author1=Menuhin, Yehudi |author2=Iyengar, B. K.
