[[File:Arts District, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pink Cadillac in the Downtown Arts District.]]

The '''Las Vegas Arts District''', or the '''18b''' in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] was created in 1998 as an 18 block zone set aside to encourage art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downtown Arts District  | url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/nevada/las-vegas/review-178016.html | work=[[Fodor's Travel]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district won [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'s ''Best of Las Vegas'' award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ken |last = White| title=Downtown Arts District finally taking hold | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/bestoflv/2005/bestartsdistrict.jsp;jsessionid=BMGLLJLEFKAA | work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the 18b, the Las Vegas Arts District contains a mix of independent businesses including [[vintage clothing]] boutiques, antique stores, art galleries, hair salons, restaurants,  
The 18b is located halfway between the Fremont East Entertainment district and the Stratosphere Resort, clustered around Main and Charleston, bounded loosely by Commerce Street to the West, Hoover Avenue to the North, Fourth Street to the East and Wyoming Avenue at the south. It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street.  The name, "18b," represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.

The "First Friday" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.

== Events ==
The district hosts a ''First Friday'' art walk on the first Friday of every month.  First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as "entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Artsy Schmartzy | url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=148648 | publisher=[[United Jewish Communities]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''First Friday'', Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.

== Boundaries ==
The district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the ''City of Las Vegas'' website.

'''Aleksandr Aleksejevich Khanzhonkov''' ({{lang-rus|Александр Алексеевич Ханжонков|p=ɐlʲɪˈksandr ɐlʲɪˈksʲejɪvʲɪtɕ xənˈʐonkəf}}; {{OldStyleDate|8 August|1877|27 July}} — 26 September 1945) was a pioneering [[Russian Empire|Russian]] cinema entrepreneur, film director and screenwriter. He is known for producing ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]'', Russia's first [[feature film]], as well as [[Ladislas Starevich]]'s ground-breaking [[stop motion]] animation. Khanzhonkov worked as a consultant in the post-revolutionary [[Goskino]] until he was banned from cinema in 1926.&lt;ref name=''rollberg&gt;''Peter Rollberg (2016)''. [https://books.google.ru/books?id=gM6QDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema]. — [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], p. 3 {{ISBN|978-1-4422-6842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Years==
Khanzhonkov was born in the small village of Khanzhonkova of the Don Host Oblast (modern-day [[Makiivka]], [[Donetsk Oblast]]) into a [[Russian nobility|noble]] family of [[Don Cossacks]]. His father Alexei Petrovich Khanzhonkov was a landlord who went bankrupt. His mother Paraskeva Sergeevna Khanzhonkova (née Dmitrieva) came from a colonel's family who owned a [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] shop in [[Moscow]]. The noble title was first granted to Aleksandr's great-grandfather Vasily Khanzhonkov.&lt;ref name='orlova'&gt;''Irina Orlova (2007)''.

''[http://www.chaskor.ru/article/aleksandr_hanzhonkov_rab_kinematografa_v_sadu_rashodyashchihsya_tropok_19002 A slave of cinema in the garden of the parting paths]'' article at [[Chastny Korrespondent]], August 8, 2014 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksandr studied in the [[Novocherkassk]] Cossack School and was sent to serve in the Moscow host after his graduation in 1986. He took part in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] which undermined his health.&lt;ref name='orlova' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chastny' /&gt; In 1905, upon a discharge from military training due to health issues, Khanzhonkov sat in on a screening of [[Train Pulling into a Station]] by the [[Lumiere Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/cinema-and-theater/aleksansdr-khanzhonkov/ Prominent Russians: Aleksansdr Khanzhonkov in ''Russiapedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the onset of his interest and subsequent investment in film, primarily as a producer but also as a director.

==Career==
In 1906 Khanzhonkov founded Russia's first cinema factory, A. Khanzhonkov and Co., whose main financial backer was [[Ivan Ozerov]], an influential banker and member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|Russian State Council]]. Initial productions were shot on stage in the vein of [[Melies]] and were overshadowed by the work of [[Alexander Drankov]]. Known for his unabashed commercialism, Drankov would remain a competitor up to the revolution of 1917.&lt;ref name=''rollberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyda|first1=Jay|title=Prologue to the Russian Film (Part Two)|journal=Hollywood Quarterly|date=January 1947|volume=2|issue=2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1911 that Khanzhonkov's factory would receive widespread acclaim with the release of ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]''. One of the earliest full length Russian feature films, it was equally notable for its technical aspects. By the end of 1912, Khanzhonkov had established a permanent studio in Moscow and went on to produce over a hundred films over the course of the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=F.

During the [[Russian Revolution]], Khanzhonkov fled Russia to [[Constantinople]] and [[Vienna]], and, despite previous affiliation with the royal family, returned upon invitation to the [[USSR]] in 1923 and was appointed director of the new Soviet studio [[Proletkino]] and later as a production consultant for [[Goskino]]. His career in the [[Soviet Union]] ended in 1926: he was forced to abdicate after a corruption scandal struck Proletkino, and never worked in cinema again. Khanzhonkov spent the rest of his life in [[Yalta]], living on a personal pension from the state. There he survived the [[Crimea#In the Soviet Union|Nazi occupation of Crimea]] in 1941–1944, and died in Yalta after many years of declining health on September 26, 1945.

'''Alexei Augustovich Davidov''' ({{lang-ru|'''Алексей Августович Давидов'''}}) (1867-1940) was a Russian cellist and composer, and also a banker, industrialist, and businessman.

Davidov was born in Moscow on August 23, 1867, the son of mathematician and educator [[August Davidov]] originally from [[Courland]]. His uncle [[Karl Davydov|Karl Davidov]] was a cellist and composer, and head of the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]].

In 1891 Davidov was graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Saint Petersburg]] and also from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with a concentration in cello and composition.

Davidov was a founder and member (from 1894) of the [[Saint Petersburg Music Society]] ({{lang-ru|Петербургского общества музыкальных собраний}}), and in 1896 and 1897 its chairman. He participated in the staging of the operas ''[[The Maid of Pskov]]'' and ''[[Boris Godunov]]''.

Davidov served in the Special Office for Credit in the [[Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire|Ministry of Finance]] and from the late 1890s was a member of the board of trustees of the [[Saint Petersburg International Bank]]. He was head of the [[Commercial Bank of Saint Petersburg]] from 1909 to 1917, and was a member or chairman of boards of many companies with which the bank was involved, engaged in gold mining, coal mining, machinery manufacturing, and other industries. He was a board member of the Electric Lighting Company (formed in 1886) and that company's Electric Power Division, which built power plants in [[Baku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourbaku.com/index.php5/Давидов_Алексей_Августович_-_предприниматель |title=Давидов Алексей Августович - предприниматель |trans-title=Alexei Augustovich Davidov - Entrepreneur |author= |date= |work=Our Baku |accessdate=January 30, 2012}} {{language icon|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As head of the Commercial Bank, and working jointly with the [[Russo-Chinese Bank|Russo-Asiatic Bank]], Davidov participated in the creation of various monopolies.

Davidov was a member of the board of the [[Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange|Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange]] and, from 1913, a [[Table of Ranks|state councilor]] (a civilian rank equivalent to the military rank of brigadier general).

After the [[Russian Revolution]]s of 1917, Davidov fled to exile in Germany. He became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] on February 24, 1922, and died in Berlin on March 6, 1940.

Davidov was married twice, first (in 1895) to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] noblewoman Tamara Eristova. His second wife was the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] ballerina [[Eugenie Eduardova|Eugenie Platonovna Eduardova]]. He had three children, Yuri (born 1897), Cyrus (born 1900), and Tatiana (born 1902).

'''Anne Hill Carter Lee''' (March 26, 1773 – June 26, 1829) was the wife of the ninth governor of Virginia, [[Henry Lee III]], and the mother of the general-in-chief of the Confederate States of America, [[Robert E. Lee]].  As a separated wife and then as a widow, she was the head of her household at [[Lee Corner]], [[Alexandria, Virginia]], in what is now known as the [[Robert E. Lee Boyhood Home]].  Her chronic pain and straightened circumstances play a significant role in her son Robert's biography.&lt;ref name="Burdette"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jgburdette.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/the-disgraced-hero-light-horse-harry-henry-lee/ |title="The Disgraced Hero: 'Light Horse Harry' Henry Lee" |work=J.G. Burdette |accessdate=2016-08-28 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anne was born at the family seat, [[Shirley Plantation]] in [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]], on March 26, 1773.  She was born into a patrician family of tidewater Virginia, and was the daughter of Charles Carter (1732–1806), the fifth generation owner of Shirley Plantation, and Anne Butler ([[née]] Moore) Carter (1750–1809).&lt;ref name="Garber"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garber |first1=Virginia Armistead |title=The Armistead family: 1635-1910 |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21IbAAAAYAAJ |year=1910 |publisher=Whittet &amp; Shepperson Printers |location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=30–33 |chapter=John Armistead: The Second Son of William the Immigrant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her grandfather, John Carter (1690/6–1742),&lt;ref name=EV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Emory G.|title=John Carter (1695 or 1696–1742)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Carter_John_1695_or_1696-1742|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was the great-granddaughter of [[Robert Carter I|Robert "King" Carter]], the 25th [[Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses]] from 1696 to 1697 and the [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Colonial Governor of Virginia]] from 1726 to 1727.&lt;ref name="FHCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html |title=History: Robert "King" Carter of Corotoman (1663-1732) |first= |last= |author=Foundation for Historic Christ Church |work=Historic Christ Church |publisher=Historic Christ Church |location=Lancaster County, Virginia|accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Marriage==
On June 18, 1793, she married the 9th Governor of Virginia, the widower [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]] (1756–1818), in the mansion's parlor. After Lee retired from the governorship in December 1794, she followed him to his Lee family holdings in northern Virginia.  Six children were born to this marriage:&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown (October 29, 2009). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Lee_Robert_Edward_1807-1870 "Robert E. Lee (ca. 1806–1870)"].

* Catharine Mildred Lee (1811–1856), who married Edward Vernon Childe (1804–1861).&lt;ref name="Mead1868"/&gt;

Anne Carter Lee's time as a wealthy patrician of northern Virginia would, however, be short.  Their principal plantation, [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]], was relinquished in 1808 by [[Fee tail|entail]] to her stepson [[Henry Lee IV]].  Her husband had suffered repeated financial reverses, characterized by poor investments, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1809 and move to [[debtor's prison]].  Anne Carter and "Light Horse Harry" were separated for one year while the husband was under confinement.&lt;ref name="Burdette"/&gt;  

In 1810, the reunited couple tried to resume life together in Alexandria.  Despite the fall in his honor and standing, the former governor "Light Horse Harry" had maintained fervent ties to the [[Federalist Party]], and passionately opposed the decision by the other U.S. political party, the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]], to declare war on Great Britain in the [[War of 1812]].  In a July 1812 outbreak of political violence in Baltimore, [[War hawk|War Hawk]] rioters raided a Federalist strongpoint and tried to lynch its defenders, including Harry Lee.  Anne Carter Lee was forced to learn that her husband had suffered serious physical and psychological wounds in the mob outburst.&lt;ref name="Burdette"/&gt;

As life for him in Alexandria had become impossible, Henry Lee was forced to leave his wife and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2011/02/ann-hill-carter-lee.html|title=Anne Carter Lee {{!}} History of American Women|date=2011-02-26|work=History of American Women|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee emigrated to the South Atlantic coast and the Caribbean in a series of futile attempts to find a place to recuperate from his injuries.  He died on the Georgia coast on 25 March 1818, leaving Anne Carter Lee a middle-class widow.&lt;ref name="Burdette"/&gt;  

===Widowhood===
As a widow and the head of her household, Anne Carter Lee brought up her surviving children during her remaining eleven years of life.  A small bequest from her Carter family enabled her to maintain the house in modest comfort.  She suffered, however, from chronic health conditions herself.  Her medical diagnosis, if any, is unknown, and her health challenges were primarily recorded as an additional obstacle to the young life of her fourth son Robert.  Born in 1807, in his adolescent years Robert E. Lee assisted his mother to run the household.  Although not poor, she was not able to face college tuition bills for Robert, who therefore sought higher education opportunities at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.  Young Lee did not hesitate to use his mother's Carter family kinship ties to co-sign his West Point application.  

During young Lee's West Point years (1825-1829), Anne Carter Lee's health further declined.  She clung to life until the graduation of her son, and was given a place to live and be nursed at the home of an uncle, [[William Henry Fitzhugh]], the Fairfax County plantation of [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth]].  Anne Hill Carter Lee died in Ravensworth on 26 July 1829.  Her son Robert named one of his daughters, ''Anne Carter Lee'' (1839-1862), in honor of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Society of the Lees of Virginia|url=https://www.thesocietyoftheleesofva.org/|website=www.thesocietyoftheleesofva.org|publisher=The Society of the Lees of Virginia|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants===
Through her son Sydney, she was the grandmother of Confederate [[Major General]] [[Fitzhugh Lee]] (1835–1905), who later became [[Governor of Virginia]] (from 1886 to 1890), diplomat and writer; and served as Major General of [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] during the [[Spanish–American War]], as well as least four more grandsons who served in the Confederate States Army or Navy.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/robert-e-lee%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cseverest-struggle%E2%80%9D|first=Elizabeth Brown|last=Pryor|title=Robert E. Lee's 'Severest Struggle'|publisher=American Heritage|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her son Robert, she was the grandmother of seven, including [[George Washington Custis Lee]] (1832–1913), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army and [[aide-de-camp]] to President [[Jefferson Davis]], who died unmarried;  Mary Custis Lee (1835–1918), who died unmarried; [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee]] (1837–1891), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army who married twice; Anne Carter Lee (1839–1862), who died unmarried of [[typhoid fever]]; Eleanor Agnes Lee (1841–1873), who died unmarried of [[tuberculosis]]; [[Robert Edward Lee, Jr.]] (1843–1914), who served as Captain of the [[1st Rockbridge Artillery|Rockbridge Artillery]] and who married twice; and Mildred Childe Lee (1846–1905), who died unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational History ==
[[File:Henrik-Ekelund.jpg|BTS CEO and founder, Henrik Ekelund|thumb|right|205px]]BTS was founded in 1986 by [[Henrik Ekelund]], current President and Chief Executive Officer, with the support of three investors from one of Scandinavia’s prominent strategic consulting firms.

'''Berthold Beitz''' (26 September 1913 &amp;ndash; 30 July 2013) was a German industrialist.  He was the head of the [[ThyssenKrupp|Krupp]] steel conglomerate beginning in the 1950s.  He was credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the [[Ruhr Valley]] and rebuilding [[Germany]] into an industrial power.  He gained acclaim for saving some 250 [[Jew]]ish workers during [[World War II]] by declaring them to be essential workers at an oil facility in [[Poland]].  In 1973, for saving Jews, he received the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] title awarded by the [[Israel]]i [[Yad Vashem]], the highest honor given to a non-Jew.

==Early years==
Beitz was born in 1913 in [[Bentzin|Zemmin]], [[Hither Pomerania]]. He began his career as a banker at the "Pommersche Bank" in [[Stralsund]] and started to work for [[Shell Oil Company]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz, German Steel Industrialist Who Saved Jews, Dies at 99|first= Melissa |last= Eddy|date=August 1, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/business/berthold-beitz-german-steel-industrialist-who-saved-jews-dies-at-99.html?ref=obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beitz, Eine deutsche Geschichte |language=de |trans-title=Beitz, A German History |first= Norbert F. |last= Pötzl |publisher=Heyne |date=2011 | accessdate= August 3, 2013 |oclc=948635931 |isbn=9783641068110 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6oIpJpM31T8C&amp;pg=PT33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Beitz remained in the employ of Shell Oil when World War II began in 1939.  Following Germany's invasion and occupation of [[Boryslav|Borysław]] in July 1941, Beitz was assigned to supervise the Carpathian Oil Company operating the [[Boryslav|Borysław]] oil fields in what is now [[Ukraine]]. Given the importance of the oil fields to the German war effort, Beitz was able to designate workers as essential to the war effort.&lt;ref name=YV&gt;{{cite web|title=Berthold and Elsa Beitz|publisher=Yad Vashem|accessdate=August 2, 2013|url=http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/yv/en/righteous/stories/beitz.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Borysław area had a large Jewish population, with many Jews holding positions as chemical engineers, laboratory assistants, mechanics, and laborers in the area's oil industry.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;

After witnessing the "Invaliden-Aktion" in August 1942, an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-led evacuation of a Jewish orphanage in Borysław, Beitz became determined to act to save local Jews.  Having a position of importance, Beitz received advance word of Nazi actions against local Jews and provided warning to the Jewish community.  He also had the opportunity to select suitable workers from Jews who were being held at transfer points for deportation to concentration camps.  In August 1942, he "extricated 250 Jewish men and women from the transport train to the [[Belzec extermination camp]] by claiming them as 'professional workers.'"&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news |title= Berthold Beitz, ThyssenKrupp patriarch who saved wartime Jews, dies aged 99| publisher= Deutsche Welle| date=31 July 2013|url=http://www.dw.de/berthold-beitz-thyssenkrupp-patriarch-who-saved-wartime-jews-dies-aged-99/a-16990234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beitz recalled, "I should have employed qualified personnel. Instead, I chose tailors, hairdressers and Talmudic scholars and gave them all cards as vital 'petroleum technicians.'"&lt;ref name=Aus/&gt;

Together with his wife Else, Beitz also hid Jews in his home.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;&lt;ref name=JWN/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=German magnate Berthold Beitz who saved Jews in WWII dies|publisher=BBC|date=July 31, 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23522382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also issued and signed fake work permits to save other Jews from the death camps.&lt;ref name=JWN&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz, savior of hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust, dies at 99|newspaper=Jewish World News|date=August 1, 2013|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.539040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, Beitz's efforts were nearly exposed after two Jewish girls were arrested on a train to [[Hungary]] with forged "Aryan" permits signed by Beitz.  Beitz survived despite a Gestapo investigation into the incident, but he was drafted into the German army in March 1944.&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;  In total, Beitz has been credited with saving the lives of 800 Jews.&lt;ref name=Aus&gt;{{cite web|title=Berthold Beitz|publisher=Auschwitz.com|accessdate=August 2, 2013|url=http://auschwitz.dk/rescuers/id16.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitz later explained his motivation: "I saw how people were shot, how they were lined up in the night. My motives were not political; they were purely humane, moral motives."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In another interview, he explained: "It wasn't anti-Fascism, nor was it resistance. We saw from dawn to dusk, as close as could be, what was happening to Boryslav's Jews. When you see a mother holding her children being shot, while you yourself have children, your reaction has to be completely different."&lt;ref name=JWN/&gt;

For his efforts in saving Jewish workers, Beitz received Poland's highest civilian honor.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1973, he was also honored by [[Yad Vashem]], the Israeli Holocaust memorial, as a "Righteous Among the Nations", the organization's highest honor for non-Jews who saved Jews from the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;  According to Yad Vashem, "The Jews that he rescued from deportation included many unqualified workers, often in poor physical condition, who could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as 'professionals' or indispensable to the oil industry."&lt;ref name=YV/&gt;

==Post-war business career==
After the war, Beitz became the head of Iduna, an insurance company.  His innovative business methods and compensation brought him attention.  In 1953, [[Alfried Krupp]] hired him to become chairman of the [[Friedrich Krupp AG|Krupp]] steel corporation. He remained with the company for 60 years and helped build it into a publicly traded conglomerate, merging the company in the 1990s to form [[ThyssenKrupp]].  Beitz has also been credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the [[Ruhr Valley]] where Krupp's operations were based.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

After Alfried Krupp's death in 1967, Beitz served as executor and persuaded the Krupp heirs to establish a charitable foundation known as the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation]].  The foundation still owns 25% of ThyssenKrupp.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Beitz remained active in the foundation and led its effort to fund the creation of the [[Museum Folkwang]] in [[Essen]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

From 1972 to 1988, Beitz was a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and an honorary member until his death.  From 1984 to 1988, he was an IOC vice president and executive board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of Berthold Beitz, IOC Honorary Member|publisher=Olympic.org |date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/death-of-berthold-beitz-ioc-honorary-member/206954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he received the Leo-Baeck Award, the highest honor bestowed by the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berthold Beitz: Industrialist who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 1, 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/berthold-beitz-industrialist-who-saved-hundreds-of-jews-from-the-nazis-8742688.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Beitz died at age 99 at his holiday home on the island of [[Sylt]] off the northern coast of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thyssen-Krupp-Chef Hiesinger: "Verneige mich" vor Patriarch Beitz|newspaper=Spiegel|date=August 2, 2013|url=http://www.spiegel.de/thema/berthold_beitz/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his wife Else and three daughters.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Following Beitz's death, [[Ronald Lauder]], president of the [[World Jewish Congress]], called Beitz "one of the great Germans of the past century."&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;

'''Blandfield''' is a historic [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] located at [[Caret, Virginia|Caret]], [[Essex County, Virginia]]. It was built about 1716–1720, and is a brick dwelling consisting of a two-story, central block with flanking two-story dependencies connected by one-story hyphens in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style. Blandfield was built for [[William Beverley]] (1696–1756), son of Virginia's first native-born historian, [[Robert Beverley, Jr.]] (c. 1673–1722). The house is one of the largest colonial plantation mansions in Virginia, and as of 1969, was still in the Beverley family.&lt;ref name="vaNRHPnom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Essex/028-0005_Blandfield_1969_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Blandfield |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff| date=n.d.|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources}} and [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Essex/Blandfield_photo.htm ''Accompanying photo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boyd's Theater and Opera House''' was a [[theatre|theater]] and [[opera house]] at 1621 Harney Street in [[Downtown Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey S.

== History ==

The first Boyd's Opera House in Omaha was built in 1881 at 15th and Farnam Streets by [[James E. Boyd (politician)|James E. Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  In addition to serving as Nebraska's governor and Omaha's mayor, Boyd was a successful railroad and real estate developer.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  One of the first celebrities to appear at the original Boyd's was [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="Oscar Wilde ay Boyd's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oscar Wilde lectures at Boyd's in Omaha|url=http://oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/march/0321-omaha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the original Boyd Opera House burned twelve years later, Boyd built his new 2,000 seat theater and opera house at 17th and Harney Streets.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

The new five story theater was constructed on an iron framework with a pressed red brick exterior.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  There was retail space on the street level, and office space within the interior.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  The total cost of construction and furnishings was $250,000.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  The Boyd Theater's stage was 78 feet wide, 40 feet deep and 60 feet high.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fanders|first=R. H.|title=When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=October 6, 1963|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The curtain drops were 26 feet by 46 feet.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  The [[proscenium]] was modeled after an ornate arch in the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  The theater was decorated in tones of sage green and soft tones of olive to compliment the electric lighting throughout.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

There were 17 full sets of scenery when the theater opened on September 3, 1891.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  The first play presented on the house's stage was ''Alabama'', with Thomas F. Boyd as the theater's manager.&lt;ref name="Raze Boyd Theater Soon For New Store"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raze Boyd Theater Soon For New Store|newspaper=The Omaha World-Herald Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|date=June 10, 1919|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One particularly elaborate production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' required the theater to accommodate 10 train cars of [[armour]], 200 trunks of costumes, 167 professional actors and 21 full sets.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   Once local actors were added to the production, the cast ultimately rose to 300.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  The Boyd Theater was capable of handling even productions of this size.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

Some of the most prominent actors of the time appeared on the Boyd Theater's stage.  English [[Shakespearean]] actors [[Sir Henry Irving]] and [[Dame Ellen Terry]] appeared twice in Omaha.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   The first time was April 20 and 21, 1900 with the productions of ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'', ''Nance Oldfield'' and ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]''.  Their second appearances occurred on December 31, 1901 and January 1, 1902.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  Other toasted performers to grace Boyd Theater's stage included: [[Otis Skinner]], [[E. H. Sothern]], [[John Drew (actor)|John Drew]], [[Walker Whiteside]], [[Robert B. Mantell]] [[Joseph Jefferson]], [[Mrs. Leslie Carter|Leslie Carter]], [[Julia Marlowe]], [[Ethel Barrymore]] and [[Maude Adams]].&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

In 1905, [[Sarah Bernhardt]] appeared on the Boyd Theater stage in ''[[La Tosca]]''.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  Bernhardt traveled with her own custom railway car.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   Also traveling with her on the train was her own carriage, a team of black horses, and a French [[coachman]] and [[hostler]].&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   The entire city knew when Bernhardt was in town.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

Omaha-born [[pianist]] Frances Nash, who would later marry [[Edwin "Pa" Watson|Edwin Watson]], friend and senior advisor to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], often performed at Boyd's Theater.&lt;ref name="Nash-Hamlin Recital"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nash-Hamlin Recital|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1916-02-01/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1836&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Boyd+Frances+Nash+theater&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1922&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=boyd%27s+theater+frances+nash&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|publisher=The Omaha Bee News Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|accessdate=13 March 2014|page=5|date=February 1, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gives Over Life of Ease for Art She Loves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gives Over Life of Ease for Art She Loves|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1916-01-23/ed-1/seq-13/#date1=1836&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Frances+Nash&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=frances+nash&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|publisher=The Omaha Sunday Bee News Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|accessdate=14 March 2014|page=1|date=January 23, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man primarily responsible for the quality and the variety of the shows appearing on the Boyd Theater's stage was William J. Burgess.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   Burgess had been involved in theaters since the age of 12.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   He initially came to Omaha to manage the Grand Opera House and later managed the original Boyd Theater.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   When the [[Creighton Orpheum Theater]] opened, he served as its manager for two years.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;   Once that theater joined the [[Orpheum Circuit]], he took over the management of the second Boyd Theater and set about making it the premier live theater venue in Omaha.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  He introduced the first mail-order tickets in town and strived to book the premier acts.  He even opened an acting school for fledging dramatists.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  But even Burgess's efforts could not sway the audiences changing tastes towards [[film|motion pictures]] and the rising costs of mounting a live stage production.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

In 1914, Boyd's Theater was sold to the Burgess-Nash Company for $231,000.&lt;ref name="Boyd theater Building Is Sold"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boyd Theater Building Is Sold|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1914-05-17/ed-1/seq-36/#date1=1836&amp;index=17&amp;date2=1922&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Boyd+theater+Theater&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=Nebraska&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=boyd%27s+theater&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|publisher=The Omaha Sunday Bee Newspaper, Omaha, Douglas County, NE, USA|accessdate=13 March 2014|page=PART THREE, Page 8-C, Image 36|date=May 17, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially they continued to manage it as a theater, but as the competition from [[sound film|talking movies]] increased, the company eventually closed the theater.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  The last performance in the theater was on February 2, 1920.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;  It was demolished in 1920 and the property redeveloped for their department store business.&lt;ref name="Building For The Ages" /&gt;  Currently, the property houses the [[Omaha Public Power District|Omaha Public Power District's]] downtown office.&lt;ref name="When Omaha Had Its Golden Age of Theater" /&gt;

'''''Cash Flow''''' (formerly '''''CNBC's Cash Flow '''''and '''''Cash Flow From Australia''''') was a television business news program on [[CNBC Asia]]. It is produced by CNBC Asia from Singapore by a team of journalists and aired each weekday at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am Singapore/Hong Kong/[[Taiwan]] time.  It was broadcast live from [[CNBC Asia]]'s studio in Sydney and presented by Oriel Morrison and at Hong Kong's studio presented by [[Bernard Lo]] for the first hour.  It was originally presented by Maura Fogarty for the first hour and Amanda Drury for the second hour and was broadcast live from Singapore.  ''Cash Flow'' was seen in the United States on the [[CNBC World]] channel every Sunday through Thursday at 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] (9:00&amp;nbsp;pm ET without [[Daylight Saving Time]]) and on [[CNBC Europe]] at 3:00 [[UTC]]

==Program Facts==
*''Cash Flow'', which debuted on 26 March 2007 as ''CNBC's Cash Flow'', replaced ''[[Asia Market Watch]]'' (also anchored by Amanda Drury), a mid-morning Asian market program that followed ongoing stock market trading in Asia. The show was given a clear mandate—to provide actionable strategies on investments and help viewers make sense of the morning's news flow.

This was part of CNBC Asia's significant programming revamp that resulted in the cancellation of ''Asia Market Watch'', and the debut of ''[[Squawk Australia]]'', which moved ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' (which Drury co-anchored with Martin Soong) down an hour.
*The second hour of ''Cash Flow'' is also seen in the Philippines over [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]].  ANC, however has the option of pre-empting the simulcast in case of breaking news or live events such as Senate/House hearings and Christmas/Year End programs of ANC's shows.
* It features stock reports from CNBC reporters around the Asia Pacific region including [[Emily Chan]] (Hong Kong), [[Kaori Enjoji]] (Tokyo), [[Cheng Lei]] (Shanghai) and [[Tanvir Gill]] of [[CNBC-TV18]] ([[Mumbai]]). Plus [[Sri Jegarajah]] and [[Adam Bakhtiar]] at [[CNBC Asia]]'s Singapore studios.
*''Cash Flow'' started broadcasting from the news room set in July 2009. The move out of the virtual set means that all CNBC Asia programs now originate from a hard set.  This program moved to Sydney in 2010, after Maura Fogarty departed from the network.
*''Trading Matters'', once a standalone programme on the network wrapping-up the trading day in Australia was folded to become a segment on ''Cash Flow'' at around 11.40 HK/SIN time.  It now features live reports from the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] and analysis of stories from down under.
*On 14 June 2010, ''CNBC's Cash Flow'' was renamed ''Cash Flow From Australia'' to reflect the program's change of location.  [[Oriel Morrison]] became the sole anchor of the program, replacing original anchors Amanda Drury and Maura Fogarty.
* On 2 January 2013, ''Cash Flow From Australia ''was shortened to ''Cash Flow, ''dropping the second half of the program's name (''From Australia'') from the title.

==Early life and education==
Gasparino was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx, Gasparino graduated with a B.A. from [[Pace University]] before earning his master's degree in journalism from the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Fox bio"&gt;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/bios/talent/charles-gasparino/ FoxBusiness.com bio of Gasparino] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310234001/http://www.foxbusiness.com/bios/talent/charles-gasparino/ |date=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute Living"&gt;[http://sf.hauteliving.com/celebrity-city-guide/?id=175 "The Haute Insiders.

Retrieved on 2010-06-17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gasparino was previously a senior writer for ''[[Newsweek]]'', where he covered politics, Wall Street, and corporate America, and among other stories broke the news of the controversial pay package of former [[New York Stock Exchange]] chairman [[Richard Grasso]], former New York City Police Commissioner [[Bernard Kerik]]'s controversial (and eventually withdrawn) nomination to run the US Department of Homeland Security, and the dispute surrounding former New York Attorney General (and eventual Governor) [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s crackdown on corporate crime.&lt;ref name="Fox bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute Living"/&gt; Before working at ''Newsweek'', Gasparino was a reporter  for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].'' During his time at the ''WSJ'' he wrote extensively on issues on [[Wall Street]], including pension funds, [[mutual funds]] and regulatory issues. He won the [[New York Press Club]] award for coverage of Wall Street research scandals.&lt;ref name="Fox bio"/&gt; Gasparino then moved to cable business network [[CNBC]] where he reported extensively on Wall Street. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Gasparino played a major role in CNBC's coverage, breaking a number of stories, including the news that the U.S. Government was going to bail out insurer [[AIG]], as well as news of the US government's broader bailout of the financial system, the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP).&lt;ref name="New York Times story"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/business/media/17fox.html?scp=2&amp;sq=gasparino&amp;st=cse Brian Stelter "Fox Business Hires Reporter From CNBC", ''The New York Times'', 2010-02-16. Retrieved on 2010-02-17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasparino, known for being highly combative on-air (Marketwatch described him as "Fox's [[Rocky Balboa]]"), was reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as saying that "[his] job was to rip the lungs out of the competition for Fox Business Network."&lt;ref name="Marketwatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605259.html Howard Kurtz "Fox Business Lures Gasparino Away From CNBC", ''The Washington Post'', 2010-02-16. Retrieved on 2010-02-17.]&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Financial Times]]'' profile of Gasparino illustrates his combativeness, describing him as a "pugnacious pundit Wall Street can't ignore", citing as examples Gasparino's frequent run-ins with colleagues, including then-fellow CNBC reporter Dennis Kneale, and cycling star Lance Armstrong.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/0411afae-70dc-11de-9717-00144feabdc0.html John Gapper "A Pugnacious Pundit Wall Street Can't Ignore", ''Financial Times'', 2009-07-17. Retrieved on 2010-02-17.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his aggressiveness, his reporting frequently has a dramatic impact on the markets. The ''Financial Times'' quotes [[Goldman Sachs]]'s then-chief spokesman [[Lucas Van Praag]] as saying "Most trading floors have CNBC on with the sound turned down, but when Charlie comes on, they listen.... [H]e does move stock prices."&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; Similarly, Gasparino's then-colleague at CNBC [[Lawrence Kudlow]] said of him: "He broke some great stories. I give Charlie a lot of credit for having great sources and, to tell you the truth, most of his steers have been good. He has got us ahead of the game."&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;

===Move to Fox===
In February 2010, Gasparino left CNBC for the fledgling Fox Business Network.&lt;ref name="New York Times story"/&gt; In addition to his book writing, Gasparino appears on Fox Business and [[Fox News Channel]] with news reports and commentary, as well as contributing regularly to ''[[The New York Post]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' and online for [[The Daily Beast]], FoxBusiness.com, and the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref name="Mediabistro"&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/wheres_charlie_gasparino_114128.asp Chris Ariens "Where's Charlie Gasparino?", MediaBistro, 2009-04-15.

Mack|John Mack]], chairman of [[Morgan Stanley]], who declared on air that "[t]his doesn't feel like the crisis that I went through [in 2008], so I feel a lot better about it," Gasparino timed his report of Morgan Stanley's laying off 1,200 workers and closing up to 300 branches so that it aired opposite the interview.&lt;ref name="TV Newser"&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/generalities/as_cnbc_interviews_morgan_stanley_chairman_fbns_gasparino_breaks_news_on_the_company_163833.asp Kevin Allocca, "As CNBC Interviews Morgan Stanley Chairman, FBN's Gasparino Breaks News on the Company", mediabistro.com, 2010-06-07.

"Just jam it down CNBC's throat every single day."), Gasparino has also spoken highly of his former colleagues, calling [[Maria Bartiromo]] "a good reporter," [[Erin Burnett]] "a class act -- I used to love doing TV with her," and of [[Jim Cramer]], "I like Jim personally."&lt;ref name="Marketwatch"/&gt; In response to accusations of being as much a showman as a journalist, Gasparino has said, "You want to be entertaining when you present news. People don't want a droll Charlie Gasparino droning on about Merrill Lynch." &lt;ref name="Marketwatch"/&gt;

In 2010, [[Marketwatch]] named Gasparino one of "12 Broadcasters Who Are Making a Difference", and [[The Daily Beast]] called him one of the "Top 15 "Economic and Business Commentators" (and the only television journalist on the list).&lt;ref name="MarketWatch2"&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/12-broadcasters-making-a-difference-2010-09-17?reflink=MW_news_stmp Jon Friedman, "12 broadcasters who are making a difference", Marketwatch.com, 2010-09-17.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
[[File:Arthur Rothstein, Boy building a model airplane as girl watches, FSA camp, Robstown, Texas, 1942.jpg|thumb|Boy building a model airplane]]
'''DIY ethic''' refers to the ethic of [[self-sufficiency]] through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. Literally meaning "[[do it yourself]]", the DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists. The DIY ethic requires that the adherent seeks out the knowledge required to complete a given task. The term can refer to a variety of disciplines, including [[home improvement]], [[first aid]] or [[creative work]]s.

Rather than belittling or showing disdain for those who engage in manual labor or skilled crafts, DIY champions the average individual seeking such knowledge and expertise. Central to the ethic is the empowerment of individuals and communities, encouraging the employment of alternative approaches when faced with bureaucratic or societal obstacles to achieving their objectives.

== Punk culture ==

In the [[punk subculture]], the DIY ethic is tied to [[punk ideology]] and [[anticonsumerism]]. It supports the rejection of [[consumer culture]], using existing systems or existing processes that would foster dependence on established societal structures. According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Byrne]], Jeremy Deller (2010) [http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/modernpainters_2010.php ''Audio Games''], in ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', March 1, 2010. "I think I embrace a bit of the punk aesthetic that one can express oneself with two chords if that’s all you know, and likewise one can make a great film with limited means or skills or clothes or furniture. It’s just as moving and serious as works that employ great skill and craft sometimes. Granted, when you learn that third chord, or more, you don’t have to continue making 'simple' things, unless you want to. Sometimes that’s a problem."&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the earliest example of this attitude was the punk music scene of  the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/69|title = Oxford Journal of Design History Webpage|accessdate = 2007-09-24|quote = "Yet, it remains within the subculture of punk music where the homemade, A4, stapled and photocopied fanzines of the late 1970s fostered the ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) production techniques of cut-n-paste letterforms, photocopied and collaged images, hand-scrawled and typewritten texts, to create a recognizable graphic design aesthetic."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging punk bands such as [[Death (protopunk band)|Death]], who recorded their earliest demos in a bedroom without any professional equipment, began to record their music, produce albums, merchandise, distribute and promote their works independently, outside the established music industry system. So extreme was their desire for independence that they often performed at  [[basement show]]s in [[residential]] homes rather than at traditional [[Music venue|venue]]s in order to avoid [[sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsorship]] and ensure their creative freedom. Since many venues tend to shy away from more [[experimental music]], houses and other private venues were often the only places these bands could play.

[[Riot grrrl]], associated with [[third-wave feminism]], also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through [[zines]] and other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bennet | first = Andy | author-link = | last2 =Peterson | first2 =Richard A. | author2-link = | title = Music scenes: local, translocal and virtuas | pages = 116–117 | year = 2004 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zrGa3vYOoZgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;sig=rBBTiX8e-j6Q0u57_HabZje6gJQ&amp;q=do%20it%20yourself%20riot%20grrrl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of the DIY punk ethic can also work collectively. For example, punk impresario [[David Ferguson (impresario)|David Ferguson]]'s [[David Ferguson (impresario)#CD Presents|CD Presents]] was a DIY [[concert production]], [[recording studio]], and [[record label]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jarrell | first = Joe | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Putting Punk in Place--Among the Classics | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | pages = PK–45 | date = 26 September 2004 | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/26/PKGVR8RVV91.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German punk band [[:de:Mono für Alle!|Mono für Alle!]] perfected the mass production of the self-made DIY album. Their album included a tinkered wooden cover and sold over 6000 units from their website and other alternative sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monofueralle.de/urheberrecht.html MONO FÜR ALLE ! - Meinung zum Urheberrecht]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DIY punk ethic also applies to [[simple living|simple everyday living]], such as:

* Learning bicycle repair rather than taking a bike to a mechanic's shop. (See also: [[Bicycle cooperative]].)
* Sewing, repairing, or modifying clothing rather than buying new clothes.
* Vegetable gardening.
* Reclaiming recyclable products by [[dumpster diving]].

Some educators also engage in DIY teaching techniques, sometimes referred to as [[Edupunk]].

==Music==
{{Main|DIY music}}
{{see also|Independent music}}
Commercial DIY music has its origins in the mid 1970s [[punk rock]] scene.{{r|diyspace}} It developed as a way to circumnavigate the mainstream [[music industry]].{{r|albini}} By controlling the entire production and distribution chain, DIY music bands can develop a closer relationship between artists and fans. The DIY ethic gives total control over the final product without need to compromise with record labels.{{r|albini}}

== Skateboarding and cycling==

In the skateboarding culture, DIY [[skateparks]] are parks or skate spots made by skaters themselves. That involves woodworking, concrete work and a vast variety of craftsmanship to build the most original and creative spaces to skate.

The most world-renowned, and probably first, DIY skatepark ever built was [[Burnside Skatepark]], located in Portland, OR. Built without permission by skateboarders and later sanctioned by the city, Burnside is the preeminent example of action.  The Park appears in the movie [[Free Willy]] in 1993 and years after that, in 1999, the park is part of [[Tony Hawk]]'s [[Tony Hawk (series)]] video game. In 2007, it becomes the epicenter for [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Paranoid Park (film)]].

After that the culture spread over and other parks started to appear. Philadelphia's [[FDR Skatepark]], San Diego's [[Washington Street (San Diego)|Washington Street]], San Pedro's [[Channel Street]], Seattle's [[Marginal Way]], St Louis' [[U.S. Route 61|King's Highway]] and most recently Portland's [[Brooklyn Street Skate Spot]].

The DIY skateboarding culture made its way to Europe, Brazil's [[Praça Duó]] and other parts of the world, being the main style and theme for [[Pontus Alv]]'s unique approach to skateboarding film making in ''[[Strongest of the Strange]]''.

DIY bicycle projects can include creative ways to revamp or transform your bike,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/diy-bicycle-projects 24 Imaginative DIY Bicycle Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; but are primarily built on empowering cyclists to understand how their bikes work and how easy they are to fix themselves in order to make cycling an even easier transportation option.  Cycling has also seen an explosion of DIY-style shops ("[[bike co-op]]s"), such as the Bicycle Kitchen in Los Angeles, where anyone can come in and be mentored by a volunteer and get access to tools for maintaining and modifying their own bicycle.

== Around the world ==

=== United Kingdom ===

Having originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the form of the [[free festival movement]], mutating through protest camps (thus incorporating elements of earlier radical tendencies such as the beat and peace movements) and into punk through bands such as [[Crass]], [[Do it yourself|DIY]] culture became something of a recognised movement in the 1990s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where the protest (the direct action) and party (the festival) converged. The prime example of this movement was the [[Exodus Collective]]. This development constituted a significant cross-pollination of pleasure and politics resembling the anti-disciplinary politics of the 1960s. During the 1990s, demonstrating the desire for an economy of mutual aid and co-operation, the commitment to the non-commodification of art, the appropriation of digital and communication technologies for free community purposes, and the commitment to alternative technologies such as [[biodiesel]]. From 1991–1997 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government  cracked down on [[squatting]], [[animal rights]] activists, [[green politics|greens]], [[Irish Traveller|travellers]], as well as [[Rave party#1990s: United Kingdom|raves]], parties and [[dance]] culture.

In 1994, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] which contained several sections designed to curtail the growing [[free party]] and [[M11 link road protest|anti-road]] [[protest]] movements (sometimes embodied by [[rave]]rs and [[Irish Traveller|traveller]]s). It empowered [[police]] to arrest citizens who appeared to be preparing to hold a rave, waiting for a rave to start, or attending a rave.

=== United States ===

DIY culture in the [[United States]] can be linked to many of the same philosophies of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the 1900s, which sought to reconnect people with hands-on activities and the aesthetics associated with them. This was in direct opposition to the prevailing [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] which was moving many aspects of the culture's aesthetics away from the hand-made artisan-created styles of the past and toward a [[mass-produced]] sleek modern vision of the future. DIY culture in the US arguably evolved from a simple cost-saving activity of the 1940s and 1950s to an increasingly radical political activity which stood against the increasingly visible trends of mass-production, conspicuous consumerism, waste, and the industrial [[corporate]] philosophy of [[planned obsolescence]]. DIY culture in the US is a current and evolving loose coalition of various individuals. There are many members of DIY culture with distinct and [[activist]] philosophies and goals, such as Betsy Greer who coined the term [[Craftivism]] in 2003. There are also many people with a staunch neutrality of political and social issues adopted by other members of the DIY movement. The largest group fall into an area somewhere between these two opposites, as varied in the spectrum of political and social philosophy as members of any large and thriving [[subculture]].

In John Isaacson's book ''Do-It-Yourself Screenprinting'', published by Portland, Oregon's [[Microcosm Publishing]], who gained fame by publishing and distributing a wide variety of [[zines]], Jason Munn is quoted in a "[[screen printing|screenprinter]] profile" as relating to the medium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I loved the idea of designing or illustrating something and doing the printing myself. Most of my time is spent in front of the computer so the printing is a great way to get my hands dirty again, so to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, John: ''Do-It-Yourself Screenprinting'' Microcosm Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9770557-4-6}} Page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern society, it is uncommon for people to go more than a part of a day without interacting with [[computers]] or other modern technology.  This leads to disconnect between the person and the physical world around them - including other people - and is a secondary significant motivating force in leading people to embrace DIY culture.

Carla Sinclair, [[Editor in Chief]] of ''[[Craft (magazine)|Craft]]'' attempts to describe the DIY community: "This DIY renaissance embraces crafts while pushing them beyond traditional boundaries, either through technology, irony, irreverence, and creative recycling, or by using innovating materials and processes...the new craft movement encourages people to make things themselves rather than buy what thousands of others already own. It provides new venues for crafters to show and sell their wares, and it offers original, unusual, alternative, and better-made goods to consumers who choose not to fall in step with mainstream commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Various: ''Craft Magazine, Vol.1, Issue 1. O'Reilly Media, 2006. {{ISBN|0-596-52728-4}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Lupton embellishes these thoughts in her book [[D.I.Y. Design It Yourself]]: "Around the world, people are making things themselves in order to save money, to customize goods to suit their exact needs and interests, and to feel less dependent on the corporations that manufacture and distribute most of the products and media we consume. On top of these practical and political motivations is the pleasure that comes from developing an idea, making it physically real, and sharing it with other people."&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, Ellen: ''D.I.Y. Design It Yourself'' Princeton Architectural Press, 2006. {{ISBN|1-56898-552-5}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The articulation of both Isaacson and Lupton is that DIY activities and culture not only are unique in a modern world of consumerism, they give pleasure to its members simply due to the lack of corporate control or thoughts of profit and marketability which are often assigned to the act of creation outside the world of [[fine art]].

These views are not universal or without variation, however. In Tsia Carson's introduction to her book 'Craftivity: 40 Projects for the DIY Lifestyle,' she muses that "the kind of agency one gains over their life by making their things is certainly powerful, heady stuff. But I can't honestly say that is ''why'' I make things. Do I make things for spiritual reasons? I wonder if I'm ready to speak of crafting as a form of meditation when I compare the [[crochet]] hats I make for my daughter's stuffed monkey to venerable practices like making Tibetan sand [[mandalas]]. We make things for two reasons: pleasure and because we can."&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Tsia: ''Craftivity: 40 Projects for the DIY Lifestyle'' HarperCollins Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-06-084130-0}} Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; While some ascribe political or social context to their DIY activities, others ascribe personal or spiritual dimensions.

Matt Maranian, author of 'Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living,' a guide to making your own home decor specifically intended not to look like it was purchased in any store, illustrates another aspect of DIY culture: "Pad is not a book for the helpless, the aimless, or the clueless, Pad is a book for the empowered, the inspired, and the creative. It's a book for people who forge their own trail, and who know how to make the very most of what they have at hand&amp;nbsp;— or can find cheaply. Pad is the guerrilla approach to home decorating."&lt;ref&gt;Maranian, Matt ''Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living'' Chronicle Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8118-2653-8}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt articulates the sense of community and subculture present in DIY culture, perhaps even hinting at a kind of intellectual succession from a society deemed "helpless...aimless...clueless."

The first lines of Amy Spencer's 'DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture' sum up the juxtaposition of DIY culture's aspects by pointing out "the DIY movement is about using anything you can get your hands on to shape your own cultural entity: your own version of whatever you think is missing in mainstream culture. You can produce your own zine, record an album, publish your own book&amp;nbsp;— the enduring appeal of this movement is that anyone can be an artist or creator. The point is to get involved."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Amy ''DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture'' Marion Boyars Publishers, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7145-3161-8}} Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet ===

Technological developments, new internet platforms, applications and innovations in the last ten years have made it easier for artists, makers and creators of all types to circumvent professional studios and create high-quality work themselves. Developments in media [[software]] and the proliferation of [[high-speed internet]] access have given artists of all ages and abilities from across the globe, the opportunity to make their own films, records, or other creative content, and distribute it over the web. Such works were usually displayed on a private homepage, and gained popularity through word-of-mouth recommendations or being attached to [[chain letters]] (known as [[viral distribution]]).

Sites like [[Newgrounds]] and [[DeviantArt]] allow users to post their art and receive community critique, while [[Instructables]] allows DIYers to exhibit their works in an instructional [[how-to]] format. It is becoming common for content creators to share and receive compensation for their work online. Musicians can distribute their wares over the internet, independently of commercial funding, using the same computer they used to record.

The '''Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation''' ('''Damon Runyon''') is an American not-for-profit [[cancer research]] organization focused on "discovering the talent to discover the cure".&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; The organization states that its goals are to: "identify the best and brightest early career scientists in cancer research, accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new diagnostic tools and treatments, and to enable risk-taking on bold new ideas".&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;

The organization was founded in 1946 by media personality [[Walter Winchell]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], under the name '''Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund''' in memory of his colleague and friend [[Damon Runyon]], a newspaperman and author.

==History==
Almost immediately after Runyon's passing on December 10, 1946, Winchell went on the air and asked his audience for contributions to [[cancer research]].  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mr. and Mrs. United States!  A very dear friend of mine{{spaced ndash}} a great newspaperman, a great writer, and a very great guy{{spaced ndash}} Damon Runyon, was killed this week by America's Number Two killer{{spaced ndash}} Cancer.  It's time we tried to do something to fight this terrible disease.  We must fight back, and together we can do it.  Won't you send me a penny, a nickel, a dime, or a dollar?  All of your money will go directly to the cancer fighters, in Damon Runyon's name.  There will be no expenses of any kind deducted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The organization gained more visibility in 1949 when [[Milton Berle]], a long-time friend of both Runyon and Winchell, hosted the first-ever [[telethon]], raising $1.1 million for the foundation over 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Award programs and research==
The organization manages six award programs "aimed at encouraging and advancing the work of early career cancer researchers with high promise".  The Fellowship Award is the oldest and most widely known in the scientific community, giving postdoctoral researchers between $200,000 and $250,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Award Programs|url=http://www.damonrunyon.org/research_results/categories/category/award_programs/| publisher=Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation| accessdate= July 12, 2011}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Other programs include the Damon Runyon-Sohn Pediatric Cancer Fellowship Award, the Damon Runyon Clinical Investigator Award and the [http://www.damonrunyon.org/research_results/categories/category/award_programs/ Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovation Award].

The foundation has funded twelve [[Nobel Prize laureate]]s, including [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], [[Salvador E. Luria]], [[Susumu Tonegawa]] and [[Sidney Altman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Nobel Laureates |url=http://www.damonrunyon.org/research_results/more/our_nobel_laureates1 |publisher=Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728174922/http://damonrunyon.org/research_results/more/our_nobel_laureates1 |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df=mdy }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Sixty-five foundation scientists and alumni have been elected to the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]].

==Evaluations==
[[Charity Navigator]] rates the foundation four of four stars, indicating the organization "exceeds industry standards and outperforms most charities in its Cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Income Statement |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4948| publisher= [[Charity Navigator]] | accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Better Business Bureau]], the foundation met the twenty standards for charity accountability as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Report|url=http://charityreports.bbb.org/public/report.aspx?charityid=1589|publisher= [[Better Business Bureau]] |accessdate= July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A timeline listing of specific accomplishments and milestones by foundation scientists is available on the foundation's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &amp; Results|url=http://www.damonrunyon.org/research_results/timeline_of_results/|publisher=Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation|accessdate= July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Mackenzie Ogilvy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|g|ə|l|v|iː}}; 23 June 1911 – 21 July 1999) was an [[advertising]] tycoon, founder of [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], and known as the "Father of Advertising".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.facebook.com/ogilvy/photos/a.413962527993/10153985396147994/?type=3&amp;theater |title=OFFICIAL Ogilvy quotes Post|publisher=Ogilvy.com via facebook.com |accessdate =15 Sep 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained at the Gallup research organisation, he attributed the success of his campaigns to meticulous research into consumer habits.

==Early life (1911–1938)==
David Mackenzie Ogilvy was born on 23 June 1911 at [[West Horsley]], [[Surrey]] in [[England]]. His mother was Dorothy Blew Fairfield (1881-1942), daughter of Arthur Rowan Fairfield, a civil servant from Ireland. His father, Francis John Longley Ogilvy, (c. 1867 - 1943) was born in Argentina and a self-taught Gaelic-speaker who was a classics scholar and a failed financial broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.ogilvy.com/About/Our-History/David-Ogilvy-Bio.aspx |title=David Ogilvy Biography [Dead link: Sep 2018]|publisher=Ogilvy.com |accessdate =3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=C_ZxurmAk4MC&amp;lpg=PT28&amp;dq=%22Francis%20John%20Longley%20Ogilvy%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PT28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Francis%20John%20Longley%20Ogilvy%22&amp;f=false|title=The King of Madison Avenue: David Ogilvy and the Making of Modern Advertising|last=Roman|first=Kenneth|date=2010-06-08|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780230618343|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Sophie Louise Blew Jones. He was a first cousin once removed of the writer [[Rebecca West]] and of Douglas Holden Blew Jones, who was the brother-in-law of [[Freda Dudley Ward]] and the father-in-law of [[Antony Lambton]], 6th Earl of Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, Charles, editor (2003). ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes.'' Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. Cited at  http://thepeerage.com/p8403.htm Retrieved 4 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilvy attended [[St Cyprian's School]], [[Eastbourne]], on reduced fees because of his father's straitened circumstances and won a scholarship at age thirteen to [[Fettes College]], in [[Edinburgh]]. In 1929, he again won a scholarship, this time in History to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].
Without the scholarships, Ogilvy would not have been able to attend Fettes or Oxford University because his father's business was badly hit by the depression of the mid-1920s. His studies were not successful, however, and he left Oxford for [[Paris]] in 1931 where he became an apprentice [[chef]] in the [[The Peninsula Paris|Hotel Majestic]]. After a year, he returned to Scotland and started selling [[AGA cooker|AGA cooking stoves]], door-to-door. His success at this marked him out to his employer, who asked him to write an instruction manual, ''The Theory and Practice of Selling the AGA Cooker'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ogilvy|publisher=AGA Heat Limited|title=The Theory and Practice of Selling the AGA Cooker|url=http://www.agamarvel.com/total_control/aga_ogilvy_booklet.pdf|date=June 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the other salesmen. Thirty years later, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine editors called it the finest sales instruction manual ever written.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

After seeing the manual, Ogilvy's older brother Francis Ogilvy—the father of actor [[Ian Ogilvy]]—showed the manual to management at the London advertising agency Mather &amp; Crowther where he was working. They offered the younger Ogilvy a position as an account executive.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== At Gallup (1938–1948)==
In 1938, Ogilvy persuaded his agency to send him to the [[United States]] for a year, where he went to work for [[George Gallup]]'s ''Audience Research Institute'' in [[New Jersey]]. Ogilvy cites Gallup as one of the major influences on his thinking, emphasizing meticulous research methods and adherence to reality.

During [[World War II]], Ogilvy worked for the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Intelligence Service]] at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Washington, D.C.|British embassy in Washington, DC]]. There he analyzed and made recommendations on matters of diplomacy and security. According to a biography produced by [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], "he extrapolated his knowledge of human behaviour from [[consumerism]] to [[nationalism]] in a report which suggested 'applying the Gallup technique to fields of secret intelligence.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Ogilvy.com|url=http://www.ogilvy.com/history/media/biography.pdf|title=Biography|access-date=13 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306192220/http://www.ogilvy.com/history/media/biography.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]’s ''Psychological Warfare Board'' picked up the report and successfully put Ogilvy’s suggestions to work in Europe during the last year of the war.

Also during World War II David Ogilvy was a notable alumnus of the secret [[Camp X]], located near the towns of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]] and [[Oshawa]] in Ontario, Canada. According to an article on the:&lt;ref&gt;CBC website&lt;/ref&gt; "It was there he mastered the power of propaganda before becoming king of Madison Avenue. Although Ogilvy was trained in sabotage and close combat, he was ultimately tasked with projects that included successfully ruining the reputation of businessmen who were supplying the Nazis with industrial materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.cbc.ca/xcompany/m/dispatches/the-real-camp-x-10-facts-about-canadas-elite-spy-school |title=The Real Camp X: 10 Facts About Canada’s Elite Spy School|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date =29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Ogilvy bought a farm in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] and lived among the [[Amish]]. The atmosphere of "serenity, abundance, and contentment" kept Ogilvy and his wife in Pennsylvania for several years, but eventually he admitted his limitations as a farmer and moved to [[Manhattan]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== The Ogilvy &amp; Mather years (1949–1973) ==

Having worked as a chef, researcher, and farmer, Ogilvy now started his own advertising agency with the backing of Mather and Crowther, the London agency being run by his elder brother, Francis, which later acquired another London agency, [[S.H. Benson]]. The new agency in New York was called [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather|Ogilvy, Benson, and Mather]]. David Ogilvy had just $6,000 ($59,726.72 in 2016 dollars) in his account when he started the agency. He writes in ''Confessions of an Advertising Man'' that, initially, he struggled to get clients. Ogilvy also admitted (referring to the pioneer of British advertising [[Bobby Bevan]], the chairman of Benson): "I was in awe of him but Bevan never took notice of me!" They would meet later, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.rediff.com/business/1999/jul/26ogilvy.htm |title= The Adman Who Hated Hype|author=Mani Ayer|publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date =26 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogilvy &amp; Mather was built on David Ogilvy's principles; in particular, that the function of advertising is to sell and that successful advertising for any product is based on information about its consumer. He disliked advertisements that had loud patronizing voices, and believed a customer should be treated as intelligent. In 1955, he coined the phrase, "[[The customer is not a moron|The customer is not a moron, she's your wife]]" based on these values.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-cracknell/mad-men-ads_b_1305136.html|title=Ads From The Real Mad Men|first=Andrew|last=Cracknell|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His entry into the company of giants started with several [[iconic]] advertising campaigns: former First Lady, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], did a commercial for [http://www.leftovershistory.com/eleanor-roosevelt-margarine-commercial/ Good Luck Margarine] in 1959. In his autobiography, Ogilvy On Advertising, he said it had been a mistake to persuade her to do the ad – not because it was undignified, but because he had grown to realize that putting celebs in ads is a mistake.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''"The man in the [[Hathaway shirt]]"'' with his aristocratic eye patch which used George Wrangel as model; ''"The man from Schweppes is here"'' introduced Commander [[Edward Whitehead]], the elegant bearded Brit, bringing [[Schweppes]] (and "Schweppervescence") to the U.S.; a famous headline in the automobile business, ''"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] comes from the electric clock"'';
''"[[Pablo Casals]] is coming home – to [[Puerto Rico]]"'', a campaign which Ogilvy said helped change the image of a country, and was his proudest achievement.{{Says who|date=May 2018}}

One of his greatest successes was ''"Only [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] is one-quarter moisturizing cream"''. This campaign helped Dove become the top selling soap in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Ogilvy believed that the best way to get new clients was to do notable work for his existing clients. Success in his early campaigns helped Ogilvy get big clients such as [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. New clients followed and Ogilvy's company grew quickly. He was widely hailed as "The Father of Advertising".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/business/david-ogilvy-88-father-of-soft-sell-in-advertising-dies.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "New York Times Tribute, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called him "the most sought-after wizard in today's advertising industry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829288-6,00.html ''Time'' Magazine cover story, 12 October 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1973, Ogilvy retired as Chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather and moved to [[Château de Touffou|Touffou]], his estate in [[France]]. While no longer involved in the agency's day-to-day operations, he stayed in touch with the company. His correspondence so dramatically
increased the volume of mail handled in the nearby town of [[Bonnes, Vienne|Bonnes]] that the post office was reclassified at a higher status and the postmaster's salary raised.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ogilvy &amp; Mather linked with H.H.D Europe in 1972.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}

== Life with WPP and afterward (1989–1999) ==
Ogilvy came out of retirement in the 1980s to serve as chairman of Ogilvy, Benson, &amp; Mather in India. He also spent a year acting as temporary chairman of the agency’s German office, commuting weekly between Touffou and [[Frankfurt]]. He visited branches of the company around the world, and continued to represent Ogilvy &amp; Mather at
gatherings of clients and business audiences.

In 1989, ''The Ogilvy Group'' was bought by [[WPP Group]], a British parent company, for US$864 million in a [[hostile takeover]] made possible by the fact that the company group had made an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] as the first company in marketing to do so.

During the takeover procedures, Sir [[Martin Sorrell]], the founder of WPP, was described by Ogilvy as an "odious little shit",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1133996/|title=
Sorrell says Adam &amp; Eve acquisition 'shows DDB needed some help'|author=Arif Durran|publisher=Campaign|date = 28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he promised to never work again. (Reports softened it to "odious little jerk", and when Martin Sorrell signed his next company report, he followed the signature with the letters OLJ.) Two events followed simultaneously, however: WPP became the largest marketing communications firm in the world, {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}and David Ogilvy was named the company's non-executive chairman (a position he held for three years). Eventually he became a fan of Sorrell. A letter of apology from Ogilvy adorns Sorrell's office, which is said to be the only apology David Ogilvy ever offered in any form during his adult life.{{According to whom|date=May 2018}} Only a year after his derogatory comments about Sorrell, he was quoted as saying, 'When he tried to take over our company, I would liked to have killed him. But it was not legal. I wish I had known him 40 years ago. I like him enormously now.'{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

At age seventy-five, Ogilvy was asked if anything he'd always wanted had somehow eluded him. His reply was, "Knighthood. And a big family - ten children." His only child, David Fairfield Ogilvy, was born during his first marriage, to Melinda Street. That marriage ended in divorce (1955) as did a second marriage to Anne Cabot. Ogilvy married Herta Lans in France during 1973.

Ogilvy was made a [[Commander of the Order of British Empire]] (CBE) in 1967. He was elected to the U.S. Advertising Hall of Fame in 1977 and to France's [[Order of Arts and Letters]] in 1990. He chaired the Public Participation Committee for [[Lincoln Center]] in Manhattan and served as a member of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary]] Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960-1971 (bulk 1967-1970)]. [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 5 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Chairman of the [[United Negro College Fund]] in 1968, and trustee on the Executive Council of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in 1975. Mr. Ogilvy was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1979.

David Ogilvy died on 21 July 1999 at his home, the [[Château de Touffou]], in [[Bonnes, Vienne|Bonnes]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/business/david-ogilvy-88-father-of-soft-sell-in-advertising-dies.html|title=David Ogilvy, 88, Father of Soft Sell In Advertising, Dies|last=Hays|first=Constance L.|date=1999-07-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
His book ''Ogilvy on Advertising'' is a general commentary on advertising. His book ''[[Confessions of an Advertising Man]]'' is a book on advertising.

Ogilvy's advertising philosophy followed these four basic principles:{{cn|date=October 2018}}
* '''Creative brilliance''': had a strong emphasis on the "[[Big Idea (marketing)|BIG IDEA]]".
* '''Research''': coming, as he did, from a background in research, he never underestimated its importance in advertising. In fact, in 1952, when he opened his own agency, he billed himself as research director.
* '''Actual results for clients''': "In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create."
* '''Professional discipline''': "I prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance." He codified knowledge into slide and film presentations he called Magic Lanterns. He also instituted several training programs for young advertising professionals.

While Ogilvy was most famous for building and establishing brands, he was primarily interested in direct marketing. He initially built his agency using a direct mail promotion. He ran direct response advertisements in major newspapers to generate leads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kopywritingkourse.com/create-advertising-that-sells-david-ogilvy/]&lt;/ref&gt; In a video titled, "We Sell or Else", he praised direct marketers and direct marketing while pillorying "general" or branding advertising, at one point saying that branding people "worship at the altar of creativity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br2KSsaTzUc]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Efficient Consumer Response''' ('''ECR''') is a joint trade and industry body working towards making the grocery sector as a whole more responsive to consumer demand and promote the removal of unnecessary costs from the supply chain.&lt;!--But WHERE? What status? Further down, there's a European version ...--&gt;

There are four focus areas under ECR: [[demand management]], [[supply management (procurement)|supply management]], enablers and integrators, which are intended to be addressed as an integrated set. These form the basis of the ECR Global Scorecard.

==ECR Community==
In September 2016, ECR Community replaced ECR Europe as the focal point for consumer goods retailers and manufacturers to work together for the benefit of consumers across Europe. Owned and managed by the ECR National Associations, which span Europe and the international ECR Shrink and On Shelf Availability group. These associations are supported by over 1,800 retailers, manufacturers and service providers.

==ECR Europe==
ECR Europe was launched in 1994. With its headquarters in Brussels, the organization works in co-operation with national ECR initiatives in most European countries. Participation in projects at European and national levels is open to companies in the grocery and [[Fast-Moving Consumer Goods]] sectors – including retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, suppliers, brokers and third-party service providers such as logistics operators. 

Every year ECR Europe organizes projects where companies from Europe explore new areas of working together. The results of these projects are published and there is an annual ECR Europe conference.

She was known throughout her life as "Daisy."

Between 1880 and 1888, she received private lessons at the home of financier [[J. P. Morgan]].&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003034.pdf "Florence Jaffray Hurst Harriman: A Register of Her Papers in the Library of Congress,"] Library of Congress 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; She also attended the Misses Lockwood's Collegiate School for Girls.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1889, at age nineteen, she married [[J. Borden Harriman]], a New York banker (and an elder cousin of future cabinet secretary, New York Governor and diplomat [[W.

==Socialite==

For many years, Harriman led the life of a young society matron interested in charitable and civic activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Florence J. Harriman," Encyclopædia Britannica, referenced 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her life revolved around [[Mount Kisco, New York]] (where their estate overlooked the Hudson River), [[Fifth Avenue]] in New York City, and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

In 1903, she co-founded with [[Ava Lowle Willing]] (then-Mrs. [[John Jacob Astor IV]]) and [[Helen Hay Whitney]] (Mrs. [[Payne Whitney]]) the [[Colony Club]], New York City's first club exclusively for women.&lt;ref&gt;James Trager, "Park Avenue: Street of Dreams" p. 160 (Athenaeum 1990){{ISBN|0689120249}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, instead of restricting her social and civic activities to the wealthy or to members of her husband's political party (the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]), she reached out to others. For example, in 1908, she led efforts by the New York chapter of the National Women's Committee to expose harsh working conditions in New York City's factories, foundries and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/05/06/104724524.pdf  Women in Secret Crusade for Labor]," New York Times, 1908-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; She explained, "Should not the woman who spends the money which the employees help to provide take a special interest in their welfare, especially in that of the women wage earners?"&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/03/07/104849886.pdf Women in Society to Help Labor]," New York Times, 1908-03-07 at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909, she created waves when, as the "wife of a banker," she "entertained one hundred members of the International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen at her summer home."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE2D6143DE733A2575AC1A96E9C946897D6CF&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Banker%27s+Wife+Dines+Labor+Delegates&amp;st=p "Banker’s Wife Dines Labor Delegates,"] The New York Times, 1909-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Republican Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] appointed her as a member of the Board of Managers of [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford, New York]].&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

==Suffragist and social reformer==
[[Image:Daisy Harriman at Democratic rally in Union Square.jpg|thumb|Daisy Harriman (in white) oversees a Democratic rally in Union Square, New York City]]
As Harriman would later explain in her book "From Pinafores to Politics," her leadership and organizing skills became increasingly directed toward the disenfranchised and impoverished.&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt;   She was active in the [[women's suffrage]] movement in support of extending the vote to women, reportedly leading a parade of suffragists down Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"'Enter Politics:' Mrs. J. Borden Harriman's Message to American Women." New York Herald, 1912-08-12, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  She also crusaded against unhealthy conditions in New York's tenements.&lt;ref&gt;Florence J. Harriman, "[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/10/13/100594527.pdf  Fighting Tuberculosis in our Crowded Tenements]," New York Times Magazine, 1912-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] later described her as "the woman who was most responsible for helping to provide milk for dependent poor children in the great city of New York."&lt;ref&gt;President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15999&amp;st=Borden+Harriman&amp;st1= Radio Address at the White House Conference on Children in a Democracy, Washington, D.C.,]" January 19, 1940, reprinted at [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php The American Presidency Project] website, last accessed 2010-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Harriman's active support for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1912|presidential campaign]] of then-[[New Jersey Governor]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] led to national publicity and leadership roles.  She was elected as the first president of the "Women's National Wilson and Marshall Association," and organized mass meetings, and mass mailings, in support of his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Freeman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polhistory/1912.htm "The Rise of Political Woman in the Election of 1912"] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon taking office, Wilson appointed Harriman as a member of the first U.S. [[Commission on Industrial Relations]], which Congress had authorized the previous year. After 154 days of testimony, the Commission could not agree on the causes and solutions to labor-management difficulties. Harriman and Commissioner [[John R. Commons]] refused to sign the caustic report written by Commission Chair [[Frank P. Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;"Walsh Would Have Government Seize All Colossal Fortunes," Atlanta Constitution, 1915-08-24 at p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; As Commons and Harriman wrote in their separate report (joined by a narrow majority of Commissioners), the Walsh report mistakenly focused on individual "scapegoats rather than on the system that produces the demand for scapegoats."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=vHnlPQNfEL4C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=florence+harriman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oapUTJiZNJP_nAfb0fyQBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=florence%20harriman&amp;f=false Final Report of the Commission on Industrial Relations: Report of Commissioners John R.

==World War I and the Mexican Civil War==
[[Image:Florence Harriman heading Washington Ambulance Corps in Red Cross parade.jpg|thumb|Heading the Washington Ambulance Corps in a Red Cross parade]]

Harriman, her husband and daughter found themselves in the middle of Europe as [[World War I]] erupted in the summer of 1914. Hoping that the healing waters in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] spa in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] would benefit her husband, Harriman brought her family to Europe in June 1914.&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt; After meeting with leading British and French officials while relations between the European powers deteriorated, they traveled through France to Karlsbad (then a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]), and were there when Austria-Hungary attacked [[Serbia]] in late July.&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt; After leaving Karlsbad on the last train crossing the frontier through Germany to France, they eventually returned to New York on an armed British vessel, the [[RMS Adriatic (1907)|''RMS Adriatic'']].&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt;  Her husband's health continued to deteriorate, and he died on December 1, 1914.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03EED8143EE033A2575BC0A9669D946596D6CF&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Borden+Harriman&amp;st=p "J Borden Harriman Dying in Mt.

The following year, Harriman found herself near the front lines of another war - the battle along the south side of the [[Rio Grande]] near [[Brownsville, Texas]], between supporters of rebel [[Pancho Villa]] and the armies of Mexican leader [[Venustiano Carranza]].&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt; During a break in hearings on working conditions for farmworkers that she conducted in Dallas in March 1915,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/03/20/106730881.pdf  Farm Women Work Hard: Mrs. J.

After watching the battle for [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] from Brownsville, she began to tend to the wounded and visited the smoking battlefields, before returning to Washington.&lt;ref name=fptp/&gt;

Harriman increased her charitable and political activity.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She turned her Mount Kisco home into a tuberculosis sanitarium.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt;  During the period of American neutrality, she became a cofounder of the Committee of Mercy, which was created to help the women and children and other European noncombatants made destitute by the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Clyde Clarke]], "[http://net.lib.byu.edu/estu/wwi/comment/Clarke/Clarke30.htm American Women and the World War,]" (D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1918).&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1916 she was recruited by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to lead a contingent of "Independent Patriotic Women of America" in a preparedness parade.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Renehan, Jr., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=_D4_xvt74A8C&amp;dq=daisy+harriman&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Lion's Pride: Theodore Roosevelt and His Family in Peace and War]," pp. 118-19 (Oxford U. Press: 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the United States declared war on Germany, she organized the [[American Red Cross]] Women's Motor Corps of the District of Columbia, and directed the Women's Motor Corps in France.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;  From 1917 to 1919, she served as chair of the U.S. [[Council of National Defense|National Defense Advisory Commission's]] Committee on Women in Industry.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

==1919 to 1937==

Harriman participated in the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and upon her return was an advocate for American participation in the [[League of Nations]], and worked on behalf of world peace organizations.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

While the Wilson Administration ended in 1921, Harriman's Democratic activism did not. Syndicated columnist William Hard described her as "a candle for the party in its darkest days."&lt;ref&gt;William Hard, "Men and Affairs," Charleston (WV) Daily Mail, 1930-07-21 at p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  She began serving as member of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in 1920 (a position she would hold until the 1950s) and in 1922 became a founder and the first president of the [[Woman's National Democratic Club]].&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;  Her first book, "From Pinafores to Politics," was published in 1923. She was often in the company of another widowed fixture of 1920s Washington, [[Montana]] U.S. Senator [[Thomas J. Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;Laton McCartney, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdHi6ilyqk8C&amp;pg=PT181&amp;dq=senator+walsh+harriman#v=onepage&amp;q=senator%20walsh%20harriman&amp;f=false The Teapot Dome Scandal: How Big Oil Bought the Harding White House and Tried to Steal the Country]," p. 189 (2008), {{ISBN|1-4000-6316-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She resided in a large home known as "Uplands," on a hill off Foxhall Road northwest of Georgetown.&lt;ref name=mission&gt;"Florence Jaffray Harriman, "Mission to the North" (Lippincott 1941) {{ISBN|978-1-135-46324-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Time Magazine would report in 1934 that her "Sunday night salons have long been a Washington institution."&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; She would invite up to 32 guests with diverse viewpoints, then referee a thorough off-the-record discussion of a single controversial issue. She enforced two ground rules: no one was ever to grow angry, and no one was to repeat what had been said.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Arne (Associated Press), "Daisy Harriman is 70, But Don't Let That Fool You," Gallup (NM) Independent, 1941-03-12 at p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harriman reportedly "lost most of her fortune during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]," and "had to eke out her income by interior decorating and real estate" (while sharing her Washington home with well-paying guests).&lt;ref name=oslo&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788005,00.html  "To Oslo,"] Time, 1937-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; One such cohabitant in the first year of the Roosevelt Administration was the first woman cabinet member, Secretary of Labor [[Frances Perkins]].&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;

As a member of the Democratic National Committee, Harriman was also a District of Columbia delegate to the Party's conventions.  In 1932, when the [[1932 Democratic National Convention|Convention]] nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriman did not support him.  According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', "she unfortunately held out for [[Newton D. Baker]] or [[Melvin Alvah Traylor|Melvin Traylor]]."&lt;ref name=oslo/&gt; In her own words, this would cause "the triumphant members of the Roosevelt-before-the-Convention inner clique" to have "a little grey mark against me."&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; However, "after Roosevelt's nomination she hastened to repair her mistake," and became one of Roosevelt's strongest supporters at the [[1936 Democratic National Convention|1936 Convention]].&lt;ref name=oslo/&gt;

==Diplomacy and World War II==
[[File:Wilhelm Morgenstierne and Florence Harriman by Harris &amp; Ewing.jpg|thumb|Harriman with Norwegian Ambassador [[Wilhelm Morgenstierne]] in 1937]]

Early in his second term, Roosevelt scrambled many of his diplomatic assignments.&lt;ref name=oslo/&gt; Norway, the fourth nation to grant woman suffrage (after New Zealand, Australia and Finland), was considered "an obvious post for a woman diplomat."&lt;ref name=oslo/&gt;  Thus, in 1937, Harriman was appointed as the United States' Minister to Norway.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;  (Her precise title was "Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary" for Norway.)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/11435.htm Alphabetical List of Chiefs of Mission and Principal Officials, 1778-2005], accessed 2008-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of her appointment, she could hardly have known that this role would soon require her to draw on her experience in helping refugees in the previous World War.
Consequently, increasing tension in Europe and the imminent death of Turkish reformer Atatürk, compelled her to advise Secretary of State Hull to install Ismet Inonu as President of Turkey to assure a protectionist ally in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1940, Germany invaded Norway with little warning, causing Harriman and the rest of the American legation in Norway to join certain members of the Norwegian royal family and other refugees seeking protection hundreds of kilometers away in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Cleverley&gt;J. Michael Cleverley, [https://photos.state.gov/libraries/finland/788/pdfs/cleverley.pdf "'The First American Official Killed In This War,'"] Foreign Service Journal, December 2003 at 66; "[https://books.google.com/books?id=0j8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=daisy+harriman&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&amp;q=daisy%20harriman&amp;f=false 'Daisy' Harriman Outruns Bombs]," Life, 1940-05-14, at p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the chaos and bombardment, America suffered its first military casualty when Captain [[Robert M.

After the United States entered [[World War II]], Harriman continued to write on causes important to her, and wrote the foreword to the English-language edition booklet of [[Natalia Zarembina]] "Oswiecim, Camp of Death," originally published in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupied Poland]] in 1942 by the [[Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence|PPS WRN]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalia Zarembina]], "Obóz śmierci", Wydawnictwo WRN, Warszawa 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the first publications on [[the Holocaust]] and [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp]] in English language,  published in [[New York City]] in March 1944 before the camp's liberation by Soviet troops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/OswiecimCampOfDeath Oswiecim, Camp of Death]," pp. 5-6 (English edition) (Poland Fights: NY 1944) (available in the [https://archive.org/details/OswiecimCampOfDeath  Internet Archive:Open Source Books] and accessed 2008-09-25).&lt;/ref&gt;  And despite her decades of involvement in the Democratic Party, she joined a bipartisan (but unsuccessful) effort to persuade Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, [[Wendell Willkie]], to run for Governor of New York in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth Barnard, "Wendell Willkie: Fighter for Freedom" 330-31 (U. Mass. Press 1971) {{ISBN|0-87023-088-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, she campaigned on behalf of her cousin by marriage, W.

She served as the 3rd Vice President of the Board of Directors of the [[National Conference On Citizenship]] in 1960.

==Voting rights in the District of Columbia==
Harriman lived in the [[District of Columbia]] at the time of every presidential election since the adoption of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920, but the District received no electoral votes for most of her life, so she effectively could not vote in presidential elections for several decades.&lt;ref name=death&gt;Associated Press,"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zTlIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vAANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1061,14685&amp;dq=daisy+harriman&amp;hl=en 'Daisy' Harriman Dies: Democratic Party Legend]," Meriden (CT) Journal, 1967-09-01 at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, at age 84, Harriman led a parade through the capital to protest "taxation without representation" in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  That year, she wrote in a ''New York Times'' letter to the editor that "the time has come for another Boston tea party" to end the disenfranchisement of the District's residents.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The adoption of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1961 gave three electoral votes to the District, so in 1964, at age 94, Harriman cast her first vote in a presidential election - for [[Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

In 1956, Life Magazine reported that, even at age 86, she continued to host dinners for twenty-two guests nearly every Sunday night.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=00EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=daisy+harriman&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&amp;q=daisy%20harriman&amp;f=false Earned Place in Politics: Important Role of the Hostess]," Life Magazine, 1956-12-24 at p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Citation of Merit==

Harriman received a Citation of Merit for Distinguished Service, presented by [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] on April 18, 1963 (when she was 92 years old). It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In her illustrious career in public service, Mrs. Harriman has made singular and lasting contributions to the cause of peace and freedom. . . .

The '''Forced Labour Convention''', the full title of which is the '''Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, 1930 (No.29)''', is one of eight [[ILO fundamental conventions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|title=Conventions and recommendations|work=[[International Labour Organization]]|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Labour Organization]]. Its object and purpose is to suppress the use of forced labour in all its forms irrespective of the nature of the work or the sector of activity in which it may be performed. The Convention defines forced labour as "all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily", with few exceptions like compulsorly military service.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention excludes "adult able-bodied males", to whom legal imposition of forced labour is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was adopted in Geneva 28 June 1930 and came into force on 1 May 1932. By the end of 1932 ten countries had ratified the convention (Japan, Bulgaria, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Liberia, and Ireland). Austria in 1960, Luxembourg in 1964 and Malta in 1965 were the last Western European countries to ratify the convention. Canada ratified it in 2011 and as of 2015 the United States has not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:1596796144127291::::P11300_INSTRUMENT_SORT:3|title= Ratifications of C029 - Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)|author=International Labour Organization |date=2015 |website= |publisher= International Labour Organization |access-date= 4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Convention was supplemented by the [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957]] which canceled a number of exceptions to abolishment in the 1930 Convention, such as punishment for strikes and as a punishment for holding certain political views.

==Exceptions to Convention==
Article 2 of the Convention excepts from the term ''forced or compulsory labour'' the following: 
:(a) any work or service exacted in virtue of [[conscription|compulsory military service]] laws for work of a purely [[military character]];
:(b) any work or service which forms part of the normal [[civic obligations]] of the citizens of a fully [[self-governing]] country;
:(c) any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a [[court of law]], provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a [[public authority]] and that the said person is not hired to or [[private prison|placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations]];
:(d) any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of [[war]], of a [[Disaster|calamity]] or [[threatened calamity]], such as [[fire]], [[flood]], [[famine]], [[earthquake]], [[violent epidemic]] or [[epizootic diseases]], invasion by: [[animal]], [[insect]] or [[vegetable pests]], and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population;
:(e) minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered as normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services.

Article 11 of the Convention states that ''forced or compulsory labour'' may be imposed only upon "adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years".

== Ratifications==
As of 2016, the Convention has been ratified 178 of the 187 [[International Labour Organization#Membership|ILO member]]s.&lt;ref name=ratifications/&gt; The ILO members that have not ratified the convention are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312174:NO|title=Members who have not ratified |date=26 May 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011|work=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UN member states]] which are not members of the ILO are [[Andorra]], [[Bhutan]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Monaco]], [[Nauru]], and [[North Korea]]; these states are not eligible to ratify the Convention unless they first join the ILO.

== Protocol ==
In 2014, a protocol was adopted by the International Labour Conference: P29, Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930. The Protocol was adopted with 437 votes in favour, 8 against and 27 abstentions (there are 3 votes per member state: one for the government, one for employees, and one for employers). The Government of [[Thailand]] was the only state to vote against adoption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nebehay|first=Stephanie |title=Pact to halt forced labour snubbed by Thailand, Gulf - ILO |date=11 June 2014 |work=[[Reuters]] |place=Geneva |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-labour-ilo-idUKKBN0EM1XY20140611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/06/12/3447958/thailand-military-regime-slavery/&lt;/ref&gt; though it reversed its position a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganjanakhundee|first=Supalak |title=Thailand reverses earlier decision, backs ILO protocol on forced labour |date=15 June 2014 |work=The Sunday Nation |place=Thailand |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Thailand-reverses-earlier-decision-backs-ILO-proto-30236260.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol obligates states parties to provide protection and appropriate [[legal remedy|remedies]], including [[damages|compensation]], to victims of forced labour and to sanction the perpetrators of forced labour. It also obligates states parties to develop "a national policy and plan of action for the effective and sustained suppression of forced or compulsory labour".

On 14 May 2015, [[Niger]] became the first state to ratify the 2014 Protocol. As of November 2016, it has been ratified by nine states: [[Argentina]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], Niger, [[Norway]], [[Panama]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The Protocol entered into force on 9 November 2016.

In 1991 Gunter Pauli was the founder of the "Mozarteum Belgicum", founder (1988) and president of Worldwatch Europe (until 1992).

In 1994 Pauli founded the [[Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives|Zero Emissions Research Initiative]] (ZERI) in 1997.&lt;ref name="ZERI"&gt;{{cite web|title= Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives|url=http://zeri.org/|website=[[ZERI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ZERI started in Tokyo with the support of the Japanese government and [[United Nations University]] (UNU) and targeted redesigning production and consumption into clusters of industries inspired by natural systems. Today ZERI is a network of 2,800 scientists, professors, and intellectuals continuously rethinking innovations to make business and operational processes as durable as possible.

In 2009 he wrote the book ''The Blue Economy'', which was originally a report to the Club of Rome. He wrote it with the twin aims of stimulating entrepreneurship while establishing higher standards for sustainability. The book includes principles that support the blue economy concept and also one hundred business cases that follow the principles. The goals set for the blue economy as a business model are high: to create 100 million jobs and substantial capital value through 100 innovations in the 2010-2020 decade. In 2014 the book ''The Blue Economy 2.0'' and in 2017 ''The Blue Economy 3.0'' was released showing what has been realized worldwide.

In the fall of 2017 Gunter published ''The Third Dimension'' in cooperation with Jurriaan Kamp.&lt;ref&gt;https://amazon.com/Third-Dimension-Farming-Unstoppable-Trends/dp/0692973079&lt;/ref&gt; describing the trends that shape ''The Blue Economy''. The French edition was launched under a new title "Let us be as intelligent as Nature". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.editions-observatoire.com/content/Soyons_aussi_intelligents_que_la_nature&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the Spring of 2018 Gunter published ''Plan A: The Transformation of the Argentinian Economy'' &lt;ref&gt;http://ambiente.gob.ar/economiaazul&lt;/ref&gt; presenting 10 innovative sectors in the Argentinian economy applying ''The Blue Economy''

Gunter Pauli is a best selling Belgian non-fiction author.

The '''International Mercantile Marine Company Building''', also known as '''One Broadway''' and the "United States Lines-Panama Pacific Lines Building", is a historic [[office]] building located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The building was built in 1882 in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]] style as the Washington Building, on the former site of the Washington Hotel. The building was acquired by [[International Mercantile Marine Company]] (IMM) in 1919 to serve as its corporate headquarters and extensively altered to its present [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style. One Broadway served as the headquarters of IMM and its successor company, [[United States Lines]], until 1979 when the firm relocated to [[Cranford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/| title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2015-12-01}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web | url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=34464&amp;q=false | title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: International Mercantile Marine Company Building | accessdate = 2015-12-01 | author = Kathleen LaFrank | format = PDF | date = May 1989 }} ''See also:'' {{cite web |url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=34463&amp;q=false |title=Accompanying photos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 2, 1991.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; A restoration was carried out in 1992, and the ground floor now houses a [[Citibank]] branch in the former lobby space.

== History ==
The spot is more famous for its previous use: In the late 18th century it was the Kennedy House, built for [[Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis|Archibald Kennedy]], who resided in it until he succeeded as Earl of Cassilis. During the American Revolution it served briefly as headquarters for Generals [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee]]. The structure survived as the Washington Hotel. In 1884, [[Edward H. Kendall]] designed the "Washington Building", an ornate commercial building.&lt;ref name=grwnygm&gt;Wolfe, Gerard R., ''New York: A Guide to the Metropolis: Walking Tours of Architecture and History", revised edition, 1983, New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, {{ISBN|0-07-071396-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was bought by the International Mercantile Marine Company (later known as the [[United States Lines]]) in 1920 or 1921, then extensively refaced and remodelled on a maritime theme in 1921 from plans by [[Walter B. Chambers]].&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"/&gt;

Currently, the only tenant is a [[Citibank]] branch on the ground floor. [[Kenyon &amp; Kenyon]], a prominent intellectual property law firm, was the main tenant on the upper floors until it disbanded.

On May 15, 2018 it was announced that the building was being sold to Midtown Equities for $140 million and that part of the  building will be converted to apartments.  Kenyon &amp; Kenyon is vacating the space after the firm disbands and a major group of lawyers from that firm move uptown to merge with Houston-based Andrews Kurth. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2018/05/15/landmark-office-building-one-broadway-sold-for-140m/ Landmark office building One Broadway sold for $140M] Retrieved May 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://biglawbusiness.com/kenyon-kenyon-to-dissolve-lawyers-joining-andrews-kurth/ Kenyon &amp; Kenyon to Dissolve, Lawyers Joining Andrews Kurth] Retrieved May 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:(King1893NYC) pg827 WASHINGTON BUILDING. BROADWAY, BATTERY PLACE AND BATTERY PARK.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ca 1890, before renovation]]

== Architecture ==
The building has side entrances facing [[Battery Park]] which are modeled "First Class" and "Cabin Class"; The main entrance is surrounded by shells and sea icons; the windows on the second floor alternate with mosaic shields of renowned port cities; inside, a [[compass rose]] is prominently depicted in the marble floor, and two enormous murals depict shipping lanes. The former booking room is modelled on an 18th-century ballroom, with columns and elaborate railings at either end, along with four imposing chandeliers. Now a bank branch uses the room as its banking floor. The IMM competed with the Cunard Line, which had remodeled its building in a similar way two years before.&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nycaob&gt;[http://www.nyc-architecture.com/LM/LM007-ONEBROADWAY.htm Nyc-architecture.com : One Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Davison Rockefeller Jr.''' (January 29, 1874 – May 11, 1960) was an American financier and philanthropist who was a prominent member of the [[Rockefeller family]]. He was the only son among the five children of [[Standard Oil]] co-founder [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the father of the five famous Rockefeller brothers. In biographies, he is commonly referred to as "Junior" to distinguish him from his father, "Senior". His sons included [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the 41st Vice President of The United States; [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], governor of [[Arkansas]]; and banker [[David Rockefeller]].

==Early life==
Rockefeller was the fifth and last child of [[Standard Oil]] co-founder [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] and schoolteacher [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman]]. His four older sisters were [[Elizabeth Rockefeller Strong|Elizabeth (Bessie)]], Alice (who died an infant), [[Alta Rockefeller Prentice|Alta]], and [[Edith Rockefeller McCormick|Edith]]. Living in his father's mansion at 4 West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], he attended Park Avenue Baptist Church at 64th Street (now Central Presbyterian Church) and the [[Browning School]], a tutorial establishment set up for him and other children of associates of the family; it was located in a [[brownstone]] owned by the Rockefellers, on West [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]]. His father John Sr. and uncle [[William Rockefeller|William Avery Rockefeller Jr.]] co-founded Standard Oil together.

Initially he had intended to go to [[Yale University]] but was encouraged by [[William Rainey Harper]], president of the [[University of Chicago]], among others, to enter the Baptist-oriented [[Brown University]] instead. Nicknamed "Johnny Rock" by his roommates, he joined both the Glee and the Mandolin clubs, taught a Bible class, and was elected junior class president. Scrupulously careful with money, he stood out as different from other rich men's sons.&lt;ref&gt;Details of Brown University days – see Bernice Kert, ''Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: The Woman in the Family''. New York: Random House, 1993. (pp.62–63)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, after taking nearly a dozen courses in the social sciences, including a study of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]''. He joined the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

==Business career==
After graduation from Brown, Rockefeller joined his father's business in October 1897, setting up operations in the newly formed [[family office]] at [[26 Broadway]] where he became a director of Standard Oil. He later also became a director at [[J. P. Morgan]]'s [[U.S. Steel]] company, which had been formed in 1901.  Junior resigned from both companies in 1910 in an attempt to "purify" his ongoing philanthropy from commercial and financial interests after the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] media empire unearthed a bribery scandal involving [[John Dustin Archbold]] (the successor to Senior as head of Standard Oil) and two prominent members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Resignation from Standard Oil and U.S. Steel boards - see Ron Chernow, ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'', London: Warner Books, 1998. (pp.548-551)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1914, after a long period of industrial unrest, the [[Ludlow Massacre]] occurred at a tent camp occupied by striking miners from the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]] (CF&amp;I) company.  Junior owned a [[controlling interest]] in the company (40% of its stock) and sat on the board as an absentee director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=The Politics of History|year=1990|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0-252-06122-6|page=81|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 20 men, women, and children died in the incident.  This was followed by nine days of violence between miners and the Colorado State Militia.  Although he did not order the attack that began this unrest, Junior received much of the public blame for the violence.  In January 1915 Junior was called to testify before the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]].  Many critics blamed Rockefeller for ordering the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5735/ In the Hot Seat: Rockefeller Testifies on Ludlow], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 21, 1915. Retrieved December 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Sanger]] wrote an attack piece in her magazine ''The Woman Rebel'', declaring, "But remember Ludlow! Remember the men and women and children who were sacrificed in order that John D. Rockefeller Jr., might continue his noble career of charity and philanthropy as a supporter of the Christian faith." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=420013.xml The Public Papers of Margaret Sanger: Web Edition]. Nyu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Jean H. Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion Hill and Wange New York 2011 page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at the time being advised by [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and the pioneer public relations expert, [[Ivy Lee]].  Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized version of the Rockefellers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Heath, ed.. ''Encyclopedia of public relations'' (2005) 1:485&lt;/ref&gt;  Mackenzie King said Rockefeller's testimony was the turning point in Junior's life, restoring the reputation of the family name; it also heralded a new era of industrial relations in the country&lt;ref&gt;The Ludlow massacre and the turning point in Junior's life - ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'', London: Warner Books, 1998. (pp.571-586)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]] he was involved in the [[construction of the Rockefeller Center|financing, development, and construction]] of the [[Rockefeller Center]], a vast office complex in [[midtown Manhattan]], and as a result became one of the largest real estate holders in [[New York City]]. He was influential in attracting leading blue-chip corporations as tenants in the complex, including [[GE]] and its then affiliates [[RCA]], [[NBC]] and [[RKO]], as well as [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] (now [[ExxonMobil]]), [[Associated Press]], [[Time Inc]], and branches of [[Chase National Bank]] (now [[JP Morgan Chase]]).

The family office, of which he was in charge, shifted from 26 Broadway to the 56th floor of the landmark [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] upon its completion in 1933.  The office formally became "Rockefeller Family and Associates" (and informally, "Room 5600").

In 1921, Junior received about 10% of the shares of the [[Equitable Trust Company]] from his father, making him the bank's largest shareholder. Subsequently, in 1930, Equitable merged with Chase National Bank, making Chase the largest bank in the world at the time. Although his stockholding was reduced to about 4% following this merger, he was still the largest shareholder in what became known as "the Rockefeller bank." As late as the 1960s, the family still retained about 1% of the bank's shares, by which time his son [[David Rockefeller|David]] had become the bank's president.&lt;ref&gt;Largest shareholder in Chase Bank - see David Rockefeller, ''Memoirs'', New York: Random House, 2002. (pp.124-25)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, Rockefeller founded the Dunbar National Bank in [[Harlem]]. The financial institution was located within the Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments at 2824 [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] near 150th Street, servicing a primarily African-American clientele. It was unique among New York City financial institutions in that it employed African Americans as tellers, clerks and bookkeepers as well as in key management positions. However, the bank folded after only a few years of operation.&lt;ref name='Crisis-Sep1930'&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |vauthors= |editor1-first=W. E.

==Philanthropy and social causes==
In a celebrated letter to [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in June 1932, subsequently printed on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rockefeller, a lifelong [[teetotaler]], argued against the continuation of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] on the principal grounds of an increase in disrespect for the law. This letter became an important event in pushing the nation to repeal [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter on Prohibition - see Daniel Okrent, ''Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center'', New York: Viking Press, 2003. (pp.246/7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller was known for his [[philanthropy]], giving over $537 million&lt;ref&gt;The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, [http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/hall_of_fame/john_d._rockefeller_jr John Rockefeller Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; to myriad causes over his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockarch.org/bio/jdrjr.php Rockefeller Archive Center]&lt;/ref&gt; compared to $240 million to his own family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YyVkGzvV6IoC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=John+Rockefeller+Jr+1954+Trust&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UkxoU4GPOJa0yATvr4LYBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Rockefeller%20Jr%201954%20Trust&amp;f=false Agenda for Reform]&lt;/ref&gt; He created the Sealantic Fund in 1938 to channel gifts to his favorite causes; previously his main philanthropic organization had been the Davison Fund. He had become the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s inaugural president in May 1913 and proceeded to dramatically expand the scope of this institution, founded by his father. Later he would become involved in other organizations set up by Senior: [[Rockefeller University]] and the International Education Board.

In the social sciences, he founded the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial in 1918, which was subsequently folded into the Rockefeller Foundation in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Spelman Memorial - see Chernow, op.cit. (p.596)&lt;/ref&gt; A committed internationalist, he financially supported programs of the [[League of Nations]] and crucially funded the formation and ongoing expenses of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and its initial headquarters building in New York in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Funding of the CFR and other international institutions - Ibid., (p.638); John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988. (p.156)&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the Bureau of Social Hygiene in 1913, a major initiative that investigated such social issues as [[prostitution]] and [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal]] disease, as well as studies in police administration and support for [[Birth control|birth]] control clinics and research. In 1924, at the instigation of his wife, he provided crucial funding for [[Margaret Sanger]] (who ironically had previously been an opponent of his because of his mistreatment of workers) in her work on birth control and involvement in population issues.&lt;ref&gt;The Bureau of Social Hygiene and social issues; funding for Margaret Sanger - see Harr &amp; Johnson, op.cit. (pp.113-15, 191, 461-2)&lt;/ref&gt; He donated five thousand dollars to her American Birth Control League in 1924 and a second time in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Esther Sanger, Margaret ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger Volume 1: The Woman Rebel'' University of Illinois Press 2003 page 430&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John D. Rockefeller Jr..jpg|thumb|240px|John D. Rockefeller Jr., financier]]

In the arts, he gave extensive property he owned on West 54th Street in Manhattan for the site of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], which had been co-founded by his wife in 1929.

In 1925, he purchased the [[George Grey Barnard]] collection of medieval art and cloister fragments for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. He also purchased land north of the original site, now [[Fort Tryon Park]], for a new building, [[The Cloisters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cloisters: Medieval Art and Architecture |last=Barnet |first=Peter |last2=Wu |first2=Nancy |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |isbn=1-58839-176-0 |pages=11–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cloisters Museum and Gardens|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/the-cloisters-museum-and-gardens|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1926, Rockefeller came to the [[College of William and Mary]] for the dedication of an auditorium built in memory of the organizers of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the honorary scholastic fraternity founded in Williamsburg in 1776. Rockefeller was a member of the society and had helped pay for the auditorium. He had visited Williamsburg the previous March, when the Reverend Dr. [[W.A.R. Goodwin]] escorted him — along with his wife Abby, and their sons, David, Laurance, and Winthrop — on a quick tour of the city. The upshot of his visit was that he approved the plans already developed by Goodwin and launched the massive historical restoration of [[Colonial Williamsburg]] on November 22, 1927. Amongst many other buildings restored through his largesse was The College of William &amp; Mary's [[Wren Building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Autumn04/perry.cfm Colonial Williamsburg Journal, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Rockefeller hosted [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]], one of the original founders of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], and others at a dinner to tell their stories.  "News of this got out on the world wires; inquiries poured in again and many people went to the bookstores to get the book, "Alcoholics Anonymous." Rockefeller offered to pay for the publication of the book, but in keeping with AA traditions of being self-supporting, AA rejected the money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_bigbook_forewordsecondedition.pdf Forward to the 2nd Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous, p. xviii]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through negotiations by his son [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]], in 1946 he bought for $8.5 million - from the major New York real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]] - the land along the East River in Manhattan which he later donated for the [[United Nations headquarters]]. This was after he had vetoed the family estate at Pocantico as a prospective site for the headquarters (see [[Kykuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Family estate vetoed as site for the UN headquarters - Ibid., (pp.432-3)&lt;/ref&gt; Another UN connection was his early financial support for its predecessor, the [[League of Nations]]; this included a gift to endow a major library for the League in Geneva which today still remains a resource for the UN.&lt;ref&gt;Endowment of UN library - Ibid., (p.173)&lt;/ref&gt;

A confirmed ecumenicist, over the years he gave substantial sums to [[Protestant]] and [[Baptist]] institutions, ranging from the [[Interchurch World Movement]], the Federal Council of Churches, the [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]], the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], New York's [[Riverside Church]], and the [[World Council of Churches]]. He was also instrumental in the development of the research that led to Robert and Helen Lynd's famous [[Middletown studies]] work that was conducted in the city of [[Muncie, Indiana]], that arose out of the financially supported Institute of Social and Religious Research.

As a follow on to his involvement in the [[Ludlow Massacre]], Rockefeller was a major initiator with his close friend and advisor [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in the nascent industrial relations movement; along with major chief executives of the time, he incorporated Industrial Relations Counselors (IRC) in 1926, a consulting firm whose main goal was to establish industrial relations as a recognized academic discipline at [[Princeton University]] and other institutions. It succeeded through the support of prominent corporate chieftains of the time, such as [[Owen D. Young]] and [[Gerard Swope]] of [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Key involvement in the Industrial Relations movement - Ibid., (pp.183-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas philanthropy==
In the 1920s he also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after [[World War I]], such as the [[Reims Cathedral]], the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] and the [[Château de Versailles]], for which in 1936 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the [[Grand-Croix de la Legion d'honneur]], which was awarded decades later to his son David Rockefeller.

He also liberally funded the notable early excavations at [[Luxor]] in Egypt, and the American School of Classical Studies for excavation of the [[Agora]] and the reconstruction of the Stoa of Attalos, both in Athens; the American Academy in Rome; [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]] in China; [[St. Luke's International Hospital]] in Tokyo; the library of the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo; and the Shakespeare Memorial Endowment at [[Stratford-on-Avon]].

In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in [[East Jerusalem]] – the [[Rockefeller Museum]] – which today houses many antiquities and was the home of many of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] until they were moved to the Shrine of the Book at the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Restorations and constructions in France, Egypt, Greece and Jerusalem - see David Rockefeller, ''Memoirs'', op.cit. (pp.44-8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
[[File:Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway GRTE1878.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Grand Teton Range and Snake River]]

He had a special interest in conservation, and purchased and donated land for many American [[National Parks (United States)|National Parks]], including [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]] (hiding his involvement and intentions behind the [[Snake River Land Company]]), [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]], [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smoky Mountains]], [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], and [[Shenandoah National Park|Shenandoah]]. In the case of Acadia National Park, he financed and engineered an extensive Carriage Road network throughout the park.  Both the [[John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway]] that connects [[Yellowstone National Park]] to the [[Grand Teton National Park]] and the Rockefeller Memorial in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were named after him. He was also active in the movement to save [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees, making a significant contribution to [[Save the Redwoods League]] in the 1920s to enable the purchase of what would become the Rockefeller Forest in [[Humboldt Redwoods State Park]].

In 1951, he established ''Sleepy Hollow Restorations'', which brought together under one administrative body the management and operation of two historic sites he had acquired: [[Philipsburg Manor House]] in North Tarrytown, now called Sleepy Hollow (acquired in 1940 and donated to the [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Tarrytown]] Historical Society), and ''Sunnyside'', [[Washington Irving]]’s home, acquired in 1945. He bought Van Cortland Manor in Croton-on-Hudson in 1953 and in 1959 donated it to Sleepy Hollow Restorations. In all, he invested more than $12 million in the acquisition and restoration of the three properties that were the core of the organization’s holdings. In 1986, Sleepy Hollow Restorations became ''Historic Hudson Valley'', which also operates the current guided tours of the Rockefeller family estate of [[Kykuit]] in Pocantico Hills.

He is the author of the noted life principle, among others, inscribed on a tablet facing his famed [[Rockefeller Center]]: ''"I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty"''.&lt;ref&gt;Life principle - see John Donald Wilson, ''The Chase: The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 1945-1985'', Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1986. (p.328)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Rockefeller received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award, "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York." He was awarded the [[Public Welfare Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=PublicWelfare&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Welfare Award |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=14 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229180311/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In August 1900, Rockefeller was invited by the powerful Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich|Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich]] of [[Rhode Island]] to join a party aboard President [[William McKinley]]'s yacht, the USS ''[[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|Dolphin]]'', on a cruise to [[Cuba]]. Although the outing was of a political nature, Rockefeller's future wife, philanthropist/socialite [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller|Abigail Greene "Abby" Aldrich]], was included in the large party; the two had first met in the fall of 1894 and had been courting for over four years.

Rockefeller married Abby on October 9, 1901, in what was seen at the time as the consummate marriage of capitalism and politics. She was a daughter of Senator Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman "Abby" Chapman. Moreover, their wedding was the major social event of its time - one of the most lavish of the [[Gilded Age]]. It was held at the [[Aldrich Mansion]] at Warwick Neck, [[Rhode Island]], and attended by executives of [[Standard Oil]] and other companies.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the 1901 wedding - Harr &amp; Johnson, op.cit., (pp.81-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had six children; [[Abby Rockefeller Mauzé|Abby]] in 1903, [[John D. Rockefeller III|John III]] in 1906, [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]] in 1908, [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance]] in 1910, [[Winthrop Rockefeller|Winthrop]] in 1912, and [[David Rockefeller|David]] in 1915.

Abby died of a heart attack at the family apartment at 740 Park Avenue in April, 1948. Junior remarried in 1951, to [[Martha Baird Rockefeller|Martha Baird]], the widow of his old college classmate Arthur Allen. Rockefeller died of [[pneumonia]] on May 11, 1960, at the age of 86 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred in the family cemetery in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], with 40 family members present.

His sons, the five Rockefeller brothers, established an extensive network of social connections and institutional power over time, based on the foundations that Junior - and before him Senior - had laid down. David became a prominent banker, philanthropist and world statesman. Abby and John III became philanthropists. Laurance became a venture capitalist and conservationist. Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller later became state [[governor]]s; Nelson went on to become [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Gerald Ford]].

==Residences==
Junior's principal residence in New York was the 9-story mansion at 10 West 54th Street, but he owned a group of properties in this vicinity, including Nos. 4, 12, 14 and 16 (some of these properties had been previously acquired by his father, [[John D. Rockefeller]]). After he vacated No. 10 in 1936, these properties were razed and subsequently all the land was gifted to his wife's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In that year he moved into a luxurious 40-room triplex apartment at [[740 Park Avenue]]. In 1953, the real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]] bought the 740 Park Avenue apartment complex and then sold it to Rockefeller, who quickly turned the building into a [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]], selling it on to his rich neighbors in the building.

Years later, just after his son [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]] become Governor of New York, Rockefeller helped foil a bid by [[greenmail]]er [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]] to take over [[Chemical Bank]]. Steinberg bought Junior's apartment for $225,000, $25,000 less than it had cost new in 1929.

As a son of [[George Mason]], a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]], Mason was a [[kinship|scion]] of the prominent [[Mason family|Mason political family]].

==Early life and education==
Mason was born on April 4, 1766, at [[Mattawoman (plantation)|Mattawoman]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], the estate of his maternal grandparents William Eilbeck and Sarah Edgar Eilbeck.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; He was eighth child and fifth-eldest son of [[George Mason|George Mason IV]] and his wife Ann Eilbeck.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; Like his brothers, Mason was tutored at his father's estate, [[Gunston Hall]], in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; His tutors were [[Scottish people|Scotsmen]] Mr. Davidson and Mr. Constable.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Mason, his brother Thomas, and a cousin, studied with Reverend Buchnan, [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Aquia Church|Aquia]] and [[Pohick Church|Pohick]] churches, who resided on [[Passapatanzy Creek]].&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;

Mason completed his formal education in [[mathematics]] with another Scotsman, Mr. Hunter, in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert County]], Maryland.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; He was then apprenticed to a [[Quaker]] merchant William Hartshorne of the firm of Harper &amp; Hartshorne in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; Mason accompanied his father George Mason to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], but returned to continue his apprenticeship with Hartshorne before the Convention ended.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; Mason remained with Hartshorne until spring 1788, when he then entered into a partnership with merchants James and Joseph Fenwick of Maryland.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;

==Merchant and banking career==
On June 22, 1788, Mason travelled to [[Bordeaux]], France to conduct business for Fenwick &amp; Mason firm there.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;&lt;ref name=FFE&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Documentary history of the first Federal elections, 1788–1790 |last=Jensen |first=Merrill |authorlink= |author2=Gordon DenBoer |author3=Robert A.

By Spring 1792, Mason had established a branch of Fenwick &amp; Mason in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; As the firm expanded, it became involved in a variety of other lucrative ventures including bankinging, international [[commerce]], the organization of [[foundry|foundries]], and [[navigation]] and [[Toll road|turnpike]] companies.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; Fenwick &amp; Mason also became involved in the [[flour]] and [[wheat]] trade in addition to its [[tobacco]] operations.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;

Mason also served on the [[board of directors]] of the Bank of Columbia and became its president in 1798.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; Around this same time, Mason purchased large tracts of land in the [[Washington, D.C.|Federal City]].&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; His involvement with government service was enhanced through his 1807 appointment as Superintendent of the Indian Trade.&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DLG&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/meta/html/dlg/zlna/meta_dlg_zlna_krc158.html?Welcome | title=[Letter] 1808 December 19, Georgetown [to] Levi Sheftall, Savannah, [Georgia] / J[ohn] Mason | date=December 19, 1808 | accessdate=March 22, 2009 | publisher=Digital Library of Georgia | author=John Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason held this position until 1816.&lt;ref name=DLG/&gt; Mason was the first Commanding General [[brigadier general]] of the [[District of Columbia]] [[militia]], which is today's [[District of Columbia National Guard]]. &lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; He was appointed by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] on June 28, 1802--a position he would hold until 1811.&lt;ref name=VA/&gt; Through this role, Mason became commissioner general of prisoners during the [[War of 1812]]. In 1817, he became the president of the [[Potomac Company]].&lt;ref name=GH2/&gt; His nephew [[Thomson Francis Mason]] was later chairman of the [[Alexandria Canal (Virginia)|Alexandria Canal]] further downstream.

'''Julius Fahr''' (1925–2003) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Fahr immigrated to Canada in 1951 following his studies at a [[Normal school|teachers college]] where he majored in History and Languages, mastering five of them. Once in Canada he chose to shovel coal instead of accepting teaching jobs until he received a salesman position at [[BrettYoung]] [[Seed company|Seed Company]]. Shortly after, Fahr became manager of the [[hatchery]] and part owner at the firm. During this time, Fahr started farming in East St. Paul in 1954.

==Career==
In 1975 Brett Young Seed was sold to Mackenzie Seeds. With extra time on his hands, he became a member of the German Business [[Professional body|Professional Association]] and held the position of President from 1976 to 1977, and a director at Hansa [[Credit union|Credit Union]].

Much later, Fahr took on the challenge brought to him to help establish a new Lutheran congregation in East St. Paul called Abundant Life [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]]. In 1973, Fahr combined resources with four other gentlemen to start The Puratone Corporation now one of western Canada’s largest [[pig|hog]] operations. He encouraged and supported the company financially throughout its history and particularly during the challenging times. Fahr found a lot of satisfaction in seeing others succeed. Not only did he significantly invest in Puratone, but he also played an active role in ensuring that individual employees succeeded by providing them the financial resources needed to buy shares in the company, or even buy their shares back when they needed the money for other things.

Fahr was a [[Partnership|silent partner]] in many business and personal ventures. In addition, a well-respected member of the larger community. Fahr was a very optimistic person, showing courage, wisdom and generosity in many situations.{{attribution needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Klaus Martin Schwab''' (born 30 March 1938) is a German engineer and economist, best known as the founder and executive chairman of the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/about/Our%20Organization/LeadershipTeam/index.htm#executive |title=Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman |publisher=Weforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Hilde, co-founded the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwabfound.org |title=Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship - Home |publisher=Schwabfound.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in 1938, in [[Ravensburg]], Germany.

==Foundations==
In 1971, Schwab founded the European Management Forum, which in 1987 became the [[World Economic Forum]], as a not-for-profit foundation committed to improving the state of the world. He founded the Forum in 1971, the same year in which he published ''Moderne Unternehmensführung im Maschinenbau'' (Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering). In that book, he argued that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten), to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. Schwab has championed the multistakeholder concept since the Forum’s inception. In 2015, the Forum was formally recognised by the Swiss Government as the international organisation for public-private cooperation. Under Schwab's 
leadership, the Forum has been a driver for reconciliation efforts in different parts of the world, acting as a catalyst of numerous collaborations and international initiatives. 

In 1998, Schwab and his wife founded the [[Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship]], a non-profit organisation based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

In 2004, Schwab created a new foundation using the US$1 million prize money from the [[Dan David Prize]] he received that year from [[Israel]]. The Forum of Young Global Leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/ygl |title=The Forum of Young Global Leaders &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-The Forum of Young Global Leaders |publisher=Weforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to bring together over 500 people under 40 from all walks (areas) of life who have demonstrated their commitment to improving the state of the world, and encourage them to work together over the span of five years to identify and realise global pro-social and pro-capitalist change.

In 2011, he founded the [[Global Shapers|Global Shapers Community]], a global network of local communities, or "hubs", of young people aged 20 to 30 who are exceptional in their potential, achievements and drive to make a contribute to their communities. {{As of|2016|06|26}}, there are 459 Hubs with more than 6,216 Shapers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Education ==
Schwab holds a doctorate in Economics (''summa cum laude'') from the [[University of Fribourg]], a doctorate in Engineering from the [[ETH Zurich|ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology)]] and a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. Additionally, he has been the recipient of over a dozen honorary doctorates, and is an honorary professor of the [[Ben-Gurion University]] of Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.bgu.ac.il/Eng/Units/associates/HonoraryAwards |title=University Units - Honorary Awards |publisher=Web.bgu.ac.il |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219021730/http://web.bgu.ac.il/Eng/Units/associates/HonoraryAwards |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[China Foreign Affairs University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfau.edu.cn/cfauEN/index.html |title=China Foreign Affaire University |publisher=Cfau.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113235900/http://www.cfau.edu.cn/cfauEN/index.html |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional life ==
Schwab was professor of business policy at the [[University of Geneva]] from 1972 to 2002. Since 1979, he has published the ''[[Global Competitiveness Report]]'', an annual report assessing the potential for increasing productivity and economic growth of countries around the world, written by a team of economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/gcr |title=Global Competitiveness &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-Global Competitiveness |publisher=Weforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is based on a methodology developed by Schwab, measuring competitiveness not only in terms of productivity but also based on sustainability criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/gcr |title=Global Competitiveness &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-Global Competitiveness |publisher=Weforum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of several books, including ''The Fourth Industrial Revolution'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwab|first1=Klaus|title=The Fourth Industrial Revolution|date=2016|publisher=Crown Business|isbn=978-1-5247-5886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
From 1993-1995, Schwab was a member of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N95/047/20/PDF/N9504720.pdf?OpenElement{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996-1998, he was Vice-Chairman of the UN Committee for Development Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/documents/aac54.htm |title=Committee for Development Planning (A/AC.54) |publisher=Un.org |date=2002-02-26 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also exercised a number of functions in the global public interest, such as being a member of The Peres Centre for Peace&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peres-center.org/fulllist.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331101558/http://www.peres-center.org/fulllist.html|date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the board of the Lucerne Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucernefestival.ch/en/about_us/organisation/ |title=Lucerne Festival &gt; Articles &gt; Stiftungsrat |publisher=Lucernefestival.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106084155/http://www.lucernefestival.ch/en/about_us/organisation/ |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the earlier years of his career, he was on a number of company boards, such as The Swatch Group, The Daily Mail Group, and Vontobel Holding. He is a former member of the steering committee of the [[Bilderberg Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |title=Former Steering Committee Members |work=bilderbergmeetings.org |publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]] |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095633/http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European migrant crisis==
Schwab warned the refugee crisis could be a precursor to something much bigger, saying "As the crash in commodities prices spreads economic woe across the developing world, Europe could face a wave of migration that will eclipse today’s refugee crisis." "Look how many countries in Africa, for example, depend on the income from oil exports," Schwab said in an interview ahead of the WEF’s 46th annual meeting, in the Swiss resort of Davos. "Now imagine 1 billion inhabitants, imagine they all move north."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/wef-boss-schwab-warns-commodities-rout-could-spur-more-migration&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Bernardin''' is a French [[seafood restaurant]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-bernardin.com/contact-us |title=Contact Us |website=le-bernardin.com |publisher=Le Bernardin |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilbert Le Coze]] and his sister [[Maguy Le Coze]] started the restaurant in Paris in 1972, where it was called '''Les Moines de St. Bernardin'''. They restarted the restaurant in New York in 1986, not long after receiving a third [[Michelin star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thehedonistmagazine.com/2017/10/24/le-bernardin-new-york-simply-irresistible/ |title=Le Bernardin New York: Simply Irresistible |first=Yanna |last=Begelman |date=October 24, 2017 |website=The Hedonist |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert le Coze died of a [[heart attack]] in 1994, and [[Éric Ripert]] succeeded him as ''[[chef de cuisine]]''. Chef Ripert later opened another restaurant, Philadelphia's 10 Arts and Westend Bistro, in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Signature dishes include ''kindai maguro'' ([[Fish farming|farmed]] [[Pacific bluefin tuna]]) and [[wagyu beef]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2016, [[investigative journalist]]s from the US news program ''[[Inside Edition]]'' found that Le Bernardin, among other restaurants, was falsely marketing their beef as [[Kobe beef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insideedition.com/investigative/16119-3-star-michelin-restaurant-changes-menu-after-investigation-finds-its-kobe-beef-is-a-different |title=3-Star Michelin Restaurant Changes Menu After Investigation Finds Its Kobe Beef Is a Different Meat |website=InsideEdition.com |date=April 28, 2016 |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report, the restaurant reworded their menu to read ''wagyu beef''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/print/fake-kobe-wagyu-beef-japanese-steak.html |title=The Best (and Worst) of Times for Japanese Wagyu Beef in the US |last=Olmsted |first=Larry |website=[[Serious Eats]] |date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a former waitress brought suit against the restaurant, alleging [[sexual harassment]] and [[gender discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/24/le-bernardin-chef-is-a-hypocrite-for-batali-criticism-ex-waitress/ |title=Le Bernardin chef is a hypocrite for Batali criticism: ex-waitress |last=Golding |first=Bruce |date=January 24, 2018 |website=[[New York Post]] |access-date=2018-08-24 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and accolades==
In 2009, Le Bernardin ranked 15th in "[[The World's 50 Best Restaurants]]", a shortlist published by ''[[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]]'' magazine. The list is compiled by polling chefs, [[restaurateur]]s, [[food critic]]s, and [[gourmand]]s.

Le Bernardin is one of seven restaurants in New York with three [[Michelin star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michelinguide.com/us/nyc_stars_2011.html |title=NYC Michelin Guide 2011 |publisher=Michelinguide.com |date= |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925152408/http://www.michelinguide.com/us/nyc_stars_2011.html |archivedate=September 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has maintained a four-star rating from ''[[The New York Times]]'' since 1986.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/dining/reviews/only-the-four-stars-remain-constant.html|title=Only the Four Stars Remain Constant|last=Bruni|first=Frank|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas's parents were [[Hungarian Jews]] who emigrated from [[Transylvania]] to South America in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Barrionuevo, Alexei. "Mine Owner's Flair Rankles Chilean Elite". The New York Times. November 19, 2010.  Accessed on 02/17/11 at: https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/world/americas/20chile.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas studied commercial engineering at the [[University of Santiago, Chile]]. In the 1980s, he emigrated to the [[United States]] and made a living working in show business as a piano player while traveling throughout the country. He also worked in several Caribbean cruising companies until the death of his father. Farkas then returned to [[Chile]] to manage the family business. He has stakes in several industries, the [[mining]] sector being the most important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/world/americas/20chile.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alexei | last=Barrionuevo | title=Farkas's Flair Rankles Chilean Elite - The Saturday Profile | date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consideration of presidential candidacy ==

In October 2008 Farkas announced that he was considering being an independent candidate for the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009|presidential election of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valparaisotimes.cl/content/view/452/25/ |title=The Valparaiso Times - Valparaiso and Viï¿½a del Mar News - Chile News - CHILE’S LONGSHOT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GREETED AS HERO |publisher=Valparaisotimes.cl |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he declined to comment on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208170746/http://www.santiagotimes.cl/santiagotimes/index.php/2008111015071/news/editorial-opinion/leonardo-farkas-chile-s-next-president.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=December 2016}} However, on December 5,  he announced he would not be running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=333957 |title=Leonardo Farkas: No seré candidato a la presidencia |publisher=Emol.com |language=Spanish |trans-title=Leonardo Farkas: I will not be a candidate for presidency |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Farkas is widely known in Chile by his appearances in the [[Teletón (Chile)|Teletón]] (Chilean telethon), a fundraising campaign for handicapped children. Farkas donated hundreds of millions of [[Chilean peso|pesos]], and in 2008, donated 1 billion [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (approx. US$2 million), becoming the first individual to donate such amount of money to this campaign (matched hours later by [[José Luis Nazar]] during the same event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=333089 |title=Teletón finalmente cumple la meta en el Nacional (minuto a minuto) |language=Spanish |trans-title=Teletón finally accomplishes the goal in the National Stadium (minute to minute) |publisher=Emol.com |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas has been very critical of the Chilean [[upper class]], stating that “they’re usually very stingy and [[elitist]]” and don’t do enough to mitigate Chile’s social problems. He has also said that if elected president “all Chileans would have their own house”.&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/fenomeno/Farkas/seduce/Chile/elpepuintlat/20081120elpepuint_6/Tes |title=El "fenómeno Farkas" seduce a Chile · ELPAÍS.com |language=Spanish |trans-title=The "phenomenon Farkas" seduces Chile · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric of appealing to the masses of poor people has gained him substantial support among that social group and some harsh criticism from his business peers and local politicians, often labeling him as a “[[Populism|populist]]” in search of some spotlight.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

During the rescue operation in Copiapó, Chile of the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|trapped miners]], Farkas donated $10,000 to each of the 33 rescued men. Farkas reportedly gave checks in the miners' names to each of the families and set up a separate fund to collect donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39677491/ns/world_news-americas/ Showers of offers for Chile miners], MSNBC.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2011, Farkas was given an award by the [[Viña del Mar]] Mayor for  his contributions to the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://eventosdeportivos2011.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/visita-de-leonardo-farkas-a-vina-del-mar/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On February 7, 2018, Farkas offered a reward of 10 million Chilean pesos for anyone who found Emmelyn Catalina Cañales Vidal, an 11-year-old girl who was kidnapped in Licantén, Chile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t13.cl/noticia/nacional/leonardo-farkas-ofrece-recompensa-quien-encuentre-emmelyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas is also known as a patron of many other charities, including the [[March of the Living]] an annual educational program which brings students from all over the world to Poland, to study the history of the Holocaust and examine the roots of prejudice, intolerance and hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motl.org/?p=2503 | title=March of the Living expresses its gratitude to Leonardo Farkas of Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study, coordinated by Magdalena Aninat, director of the ''Centro de Filantropía e Inversiones Sociales'' (Cefis) of the ''[[Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez|Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI)]]'', which investigated the philanthropy and social investments of Chilean companies, concluded that "Farkas is an actor that it is pushing others and acting as a 'role of conscience.' It has a very interesting role to make visible a more American model of the success of the business world, where that success closes with returning the hand to society. In Chile we are not used to making donations visible, but Farkas is constantly challenging the business world to be present and that is positive," said the UAI academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/Economia/2017/11/30/885409/Filantropia-en-Chile-Por-que-y-donde-aportan-dinero-las-grandes-empresas.html|title=Filantropía en Chile: ¿Por qué y dónde aportan dinero las grandes empresas? |language=Spanish |publisher=Emol.com |date=2017-11-30 |accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
In 2014,  with the support of Leonardo Farkas,  [[March of the Living]] marked the 70th anniversary of the destruction of Hungarian Jewry at the hands of the Nazis in 1944 during World War II. On [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]], at the close of the memorial ceremony on the actual grounds of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], a number of Holocaust survivors - many whose relatives perished in the infamous death camp -  joined Leonardo Farkas in the writing of the last letters of a [[Torah]]. The [[Torah]] was donated to the [[March of the Living]] by Mr. Farkas, whose philanthropy also enabled students and survivors to take part in the [[March of the Living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=YouTube - Leonardo Farkas|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKXKWIIN6Ng|title=March of the Living Tribute to Leonardo Farkas=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Leonardo donated the seven newly written [[Sefer Torah]] sent to six different continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Farkas has a great passion for dedicating "Happy Torahs", as he refers to them, which will be used in places with a great need. Over the years, he donated many [[Sefer Torah]]s to the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|hassidic]] [[Jewish]] organization and other institutions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2518056/jewish/Seven-Torahs-to-Six-Continents-Thanks-to-One-Chilean-Businessman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42819">This is a '''list of government-owned companies'''. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Profiles of Existing Government Corporations, pp. 1–16&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of Brazilian government enterprises}}
State-owner enterprises are divided into public enterprises (''empresa pública'') and mixed-economy companies (''sociedade de economia mista''). The public enterprises are subdivided into two categories: individual &amp;ndash; with its own assets and [[Share capital|capital]] owned by the [[Federal government of Brazil|Union]] &amp;ndash; and plural companies &amp;ndash; whose assets are owned by multiple government agencies and the Union, which have the majority of the voting interest. [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], [[Correios]], [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária|Embrapa]], and [[Brazilian Development Bank|BNDES]] are examples of public enterprises. Mixed-economy companies are enterprises with the majority of stocks owned by the government, but that also have stocks owned by the [[private sector]] and usually have their shares traded on [[stock exchange]]s. [[Banco do Brasil]], [[Petrobras]], [[Sabesp]], and [[Eletrobras]] are examples of mixed-economy companies.

Beginning in the 1990s, the central government of Brazil launched a privatization program inspired by the [[Washington Consensus]]. State-owned enterprises such as [[Vale (mining company)|Vale do Rio Doce]], [[Telebrás]], [[Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional|CSN]], and [[Usiminas]] (most of them mixed-economy companies) were transferred to the private sector as part of this policy.

{{main article|Crown corporations of Canada}}
In [[Canada]], state-owned corporations are referred to as ''Crown corporations'', indicating that an organization is established by law, owned by the sovereign (either [[Monarchy of Canada|in right of Canada]] or [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|a province]]), and overseen by parliament and cabinet. Examples of federal Crown corporations include:
* the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]],
* [[Canada Post]],
* [[Bank of Canada]],
* and [[Via Rail]]. 
[[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] often control the [[share (finance)|shares]] in such public corporations, while parliament both sets out the laws that create and bind Crown corporations and sets their annual budgets.

Privatization, or the selling of Crown corporations to private interests, has become common throughout Canada over the past 30 years. [[Petro-Canada]], [[Canadian National Railway]], and [[Air Canada]] are examples of former federal Crown corporations that have been privatized. Privatized provincial Crown corporations include [[Alberta Government Telephones]] (which merged with privately owned [[BC Tel]] to form [[Telus]]), [[BCRIC]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services]], [[Saskatchewan Oil &amp; Gas Corporation]] and [[Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan]].

===China===
{{main|List of government-owned companies of China}}
After 1949, all business entities in the [[People's Republic of China]] were created and owned by the government. In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].

As of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest. Critics, such as ''The New York Times'', have alleged that China's state-owned companies are a vehicle for corruption by the families of ruling party leaders who have sometimes amassed fortunes while managing them.&lt;ref name=NYT111012&gt;{{cite news|title=China’s Grip on Economy Will Test New Leaders|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/world/asia/state-enterprises-pose-test-for-chinas-new-leaders.html|accessdate=November 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2012|first=Keith |last=Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Hong Kong ====
In the postwar years, Hong Kong's colonial government operated under a laissez-faire economic philosophy called [[positive non-interventionism]]. Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.

The [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under "prudent commercial principles", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]). MTR was privatised in 2000 although the Hong Kong Government is still the majority shareholder. KCR was operationally merged with MTR in 2007.

Examples of present-day statutory bodies include the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]], responsible for running the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], or the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority|Housing Authority]], which provides housing to about half of Hong Kong residents.

Parastatals in Kenya, partly from a lack of expertise and endemic corruption, have largely inhibited economic development. In 1979, a presidential commission went as far as saying that they constituted "a serious threat to the economy", and, by 1989, they had still not furthered industrialization or fostered the development of a Black business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Himbara |first= David |year= 1993 |title= Myths and Realities of Kenyan Capitalism |jstor= 161345 |journal= [[Journal of Modern African Studies]] |volume= 31 |issue= 1 |pages= 93–107 |doi=10.1017/s0022278x00011824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types: Government-owned companies, which legally are normal companies but mainly or fully national owned. They are expected to be funded by their sales. A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is Government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible. Based on the tradition of avoiding "[[ministerstyre|ministerial rule]]", the government has avoided interfering with the business of the companies, and allowed them to go international.

'''MEED''', abbreviated from the former name ''Middle East Economic Digest'', is a business intelligence tool for the Middle East and North Africa ([[MENA]]), providing analysis and commentary on Middle Eastern markets, companies, people and data on the regional projects market.

MEED publishes a business-to-business magazine for subscribers every Friday featuring news, analysis and commentary, features and interviews and a weekly special report.

''MEED'' was launched in 1957. When [[Rafiq Hariri]] drew up plans to rebuild a war-shattered [[Lebanon]], MEED met the prime minister and asked him to explain them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meed.com/lebanon-hariris-bold-vision/1882266.article '&amp;#39;Hariri's bold vision – MEED'&amp;#39;].

The dedication made by [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] in 2007 demonstrates MEED's positive contribution to the Middle East for over 50 years. "The celebration of this milestone is a testament to the distinguished insight into the region MEED has provided to its readers for five decades. Your acuity has recorded the region's diversity and potential, not just its challenges and crises."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meed.com/dedication-by-king-abdullah-of-jordan/1076430.article '&amp;#39;King Abdullah's letter to MEED'&amp;#39;].

==History==

The first issue of Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) was published on 8 March 1957.

MEED's founder and driving force for the next two decades was Elizabeth Collard, a champion of Arab causes who was to become an adviser to UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] on Middle East affairs and a friend of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt and [[King Hussein of Jordan]]. She also helped to establish the Council for the Advancement of Arab British Understanding ([[CAABU]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meed.com/sectors/economy/looking-back-elizabeth-collard-and-the-birth-of-meed/1076708.article '&amp;#39;Elizabeth Collard and the birth of MEED – MEED'&amp;#39;]. Meed.com (30 June 2007). Retrieved on 6 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With two part-time secretarial assistants, MEED was produced on a hand-cranked [[Ronco]] printing machine. Every Friday evening, friends and relatives would help staple and stuff envelopes with the 12-page newsletter. Lacking any editorial resources, the Middle East Economic Digest was a compilation from newspapers and other reports. Newspapers were flown in weekly from [[Cairo]] and [[Beirut]], translated and condensed.

By the time MEED was acquired by Emap in 1986, it had a staff of 20 full-time journalists and 12 researchers and newsroom assistants to cover Middle Eastern business and project news. In 2006 Emap Middle East also acquired business website [[AME Info]].

In March 2012, the owning company rebranded as Top Right Group, but retained the Emap name for its magazines operation, which at the time accounted for around 18 percent of the group's turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9171753/Emap-to-change-name-to-Top-Right-Group-and-split-into-three.html|title=Emap to change name to Top Right Group and split into three|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 Top Right Group announced it was scrapping the Emap brand and would stop producing print editions and that, over the next 12–18 months, all titles would become digital only.&lt;ref name=Sweney&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Emap brand to be scrapped as all its titles move digital-only|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/05/emap-brand-print-top-right-drapers-retail-week|accessdate=6 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 Top Right Group rebranded as [[Ascential]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipp.com/news/industrynews/top-right-group-rebrands-to-ascential|title=Top Right Group rebrands to Ascential|date=15 December 2015|publisher=Fipp|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, in January 2017, announced its intention to sell 13 titles including MEED; the 13 "heritage titles" were to be "hived off into a separate business while buyers are sought."&lt;ref name="Williams-6Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Christopher|title=Ascential puts Drapers and Nursing Times up for sale in break with trade publishing|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/01/05/ascential-puts-drapers-nursing-times-sale-break-trade-publishing/|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=Telegraph|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweney-5Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Ascential to sell Drapers and Nursing Times as it ditches 'heritage' brands|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/ascential-drapers-nursing-times-emap-retail-week|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2017, MEED was purchased from [[Ascential]] in a $17.5m cash deal by [[GlobalData]], the London-listed company formerly known as Progressive Digital Media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitallook.com/news/news-and-announcements/globaldata-buy-meed-as-ascential-completes-heritage-brand-sales--3019480.html '&amp;#39;GlobalData buy MEED as Ascential completes 'heritage brand' sales'&amp;#39;]. digitallook.com (8 December 2017). Retrieved on 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Cragg]], executive chairman of [[GlobalData]], stated: "MEED gives the Group the opportunity to further expand into a key region and adds an additional industry vertical to our offering whilst maintaining our disciplined investment criteria of premium proprietary content and strong renewable subscription based revenues."

'''McKeldin Square''' is an area of [[Downtown Baltimore]], located near the [[Inner Harbor]] at the corners of [[Pratt Street|Pratt]] and [[Light Street|Light]] Streets.

The central area is a polygon of brick. On the Pratt St. side there is a strip of grass; behind the brick there is a pool at the base of a multi-leveled concrete structure with walkways and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aquatecture: architecture and water |last=Wylson |first=Anthony |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1986 |publisher=Architectural Press |location= |isbn= |page=63 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultural facilities in mixed-use development |last=Snedcof |first=Harold R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |publisher=Urban Land Institute |location= |isbn= |page=236 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the square puts it right in the middle of Baltimore's [[Baltimore riot of 1861|1861 riots]], during which locals turned on a Union regiment that was passing through the city.

McKeldin Square has been designated as Baltimore's zone for protests, where it is legal to exercise one's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights and pass out pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spray-paint artist arrested at Inner Harbor |first=Andrea K. |last=Walker |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-09-18/news/bs-md-oc-artist-arrested-20110918_1_ocean-city-paint-spray |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permits are required for groups with groups of 25 or more requiring a permit. On October 4, 2011, it became the location of the [[Occupy Baltimore]] protests until their December 13 eviction.

'''Mermaids Casino''' was a  [[casino]] located on the [[Fremont Street Experience]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  

The casino's only gaming options were slot and video poker machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nevada.casinocity.com/las-vegas/mermaids-casino/ |title=Mermaids Casino |accessdate=2008-03-02 |publisher=Casino City }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcasinodirectory.com/casino/mermaids-2694 |title=Mermaids |accessdate=2008-03-02 |publisher=World Casino Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Silver Palace (1956-64)===
When the '''Silver Palace''' casino opened in the summer of 1956, it was the first two-level club in Las Vegas, and the escalator, connecting the casino with the lower-level restaurant, was the first in Southern Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1956/jun/08/new-silver-palace-opens/?history |title=Silver Palace Opens |accessdate=2009-02-05 |publisher=Las Vegas Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various name changes (1964-1980)===
The Silver Palace gave way to '''Carousel Casino''' in July 1964, followed by '''Gambler's Hall of Fame Casino''' in 1974. In 1976 the property became '''Sundance West''', followed by '''Sassy Sally's''' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://vintagelasvegas.com/downtown&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, owner Herb Pastor decided to move ahead with a renovation plan to transform it into Mermaids, and renovate his nearby [[Coin Castle]] casino into La Bayou, for a total of $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-problem gambler criticizes federal gaming report|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Dave Berns|date=June 14, 1999|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0FD3920EDD48B21B&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuit seeks to silence two casinos' speakers|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Peter O'Connell|date=August 27, 2000|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0FD393A1845087BE&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>It is not mandatory for NACOSS or NSI certification for many Government or non-commercial property. It is third-party certification that is mandatory, meaning that approval from other third-party certification bodies - such as the SSAIB who are mentioned within the article - are weighted the same as the NSI's. This statement is mis-leading and factually inaccurate, which is why it should be removed.</comment>

The '''National Security Inspectorate''', or '''NSI''', is the [[product certification]] and professional [[Trade association|trade organisation]] in the United Kingdom for the industry of [[home security]], and to a lesser extent [[fire safety]]; the [[Fire Protection Association]] is that industry's main trade association. It is not a [[national security]] organisation, but a security organisation with a national reach.

==History==
It was formed in 1971 as the National Supervisory Council for Intruder Alarms, which was formed as a product certification organisation for [[Security alarm|burglar alarm]]s. This merged in the 1990s with the Security Systems Inspectorate (SSI) to become the [[National Approval Council for Security Systems]] (NACOSS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03832142 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inspectorate of the Security Industry (ISI), which had formed in 1992, merged with NACOSS in 2001 to become the NSI.

Around 16 million people in the UK do not have [[Home insurance|home]] and [[contents insurance]] on their property.

==Function==
It offers product certification, industry training and examination. It offers services similar to that of the [[National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting]] (NICEIC) for electricians.

===Product certification===
It is the main product certification organisation in the UK for home security equipment such as burglar alarms and [[Smoke detector|smoke alarm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/media/3864/burglar-alarms.pdf South Lakeland District Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also provides certification for approved installers of home security equipment, who can display this with their company logos. All NSI-certified companies are routinely audited twice a year, and the certification is reissued every three years if standards have been met.

The other main similar certification organisation is the [[Security Systems and Alarms Inspection Board]] (SSAIB)&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssaib.org/page/why-choose-an-ssaib-firm/ SSAIB]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Tyne and Wear]].

'''Oaksterdam''' is a cultural [[district]] on the north end of [[Downtown Oakland|downtown Oakland, California]], where [[medical cannabis]] in a variety of competitively priced smokeable and edible preparations is available for purchase in multiple [[café|cafe]]s, [[Club (organization)|club]]s, and patient dispensaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/19/INJC18O001.DTL Oakland finds peace with its pot clubs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Oaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside]], and the financial district. It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and [[Telegraph Avenue]] on the northwest. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of "Oakland" and "[[Cannabis coffee shop|Amsterdam]]," the capital of [[the Netherlands]], [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|where marijuana is semi-legal]]. Founded in 2007, and located in the heart of Oakland, [[Oaksterdam University]] is the nation's first cannabis college.  The school's mission is to provide quality training for the cannabis industry. Those interested in learning more about this emerging industry should learn to do so safely and responsibly in accordance with the law. At Oaksterdam University, state vs. federal law is the first class you are taught, in an effort to help you understand the law before you are taught anything else. The faculty at Oaksterdam University encompasses some of the most prominent names in the industry. Many of the faculty members not only helped write state law but also took medical marijuana cases to the Supreme Court. Oaksterdam University continues to educate, retaining its support from the city of Oakland.

Since 2005, cannabis has been available to patients with patient identification and physician recommendation at a busy dispensary in the neighborhood, one of Oakland's four officially licensed dispensaries under the current municipal ordinance.  According to [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]], a statewide voter initiative which amended the [[California Health and Safety Code]], marijuana used for medical purposes is legal to possess, cultivate and donate for.&lt;ref&gt;California NORML. "Text of California Prop 215." http://www.canorml.org/prop/patientsguide.htm#prop&lt;/ref&gt; Dispensaries  require a doctor's note in order to obtain medical cannabis, which is legal under California Law but illegal under the federal [[Controlled Substances Act]].

==History==
The name ''Oaksterdam'' is a combination of ''Oakland'' and ''[[Amsterdam]]'', the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city that is famously tolerant towards cannabis use. The term was coined by the late Jim McClelland, an AIDS patient who was a founding member of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club and the Berkeley Patients Group after prompting by Andrew Glazier, a fellow activist, that the neighborhood needed a name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://growlove.blogspot.com/2007/07/oaksterdamcom-is-up.html Oaksterdam.com is Up]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohhburn.com/2009/06/marijuanalogues-1/ MarijuanaLogues #1]&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of Oaksterdam started with Oakland Buyers Cooperative Distributing to Prop 215&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 215|url=http://www.rxcbc.org/exa.html|work=Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative|publisher=OCBC|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  patients with acts of courage mixed with legal wrangling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER  v.  OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS' COOPERATIVE AND JEFFREY JONES|url=http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2000/2pet/7pet/2000-0151.pet.app.html|work=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER  v.  OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS' COOPERATIVE AND JEFFREY JONES|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they stayed open until the federal authorities became an issue. After the federal authorities ordered the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative (OCBC) to shut down, a few OCBC members (like the late Jim McClelland and late Tim Sidwell) went around the corner and opened up The Zoo.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Zoo was a well stocked dispensary with deals that had clones as well as advice on how to cultivate. Soon after that a proliferation of clubs opened like The Bulldog, Compassionate Caregivers, The Lemon Drop, Oakland Patients Group, and 420 Cafe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Dan Lundgren went on a political warpath after Prop 215 was passed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Dennis Peron was arrested and San Francisco's safe source of medical cannabis was shut down.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Oakland City Council made a few proclamations then promptly made a few patients official medical cannabis officers like Jeff Jones and Ed Rosenthal as well as approve the distribution of medical cannabis as per Proposition 215.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Oakland Politicians were pro cannabis before Prop 215 and allowed a couple of groups to distribute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Federal authorities however have continued to harass even though the Attorney General Eric Holder has stated publicly that the prosecution of medical cannabis is the federal authorities last priority.

On April 2, 2012 the [[IRS]] raided [[Oaksterdam University]]. Oaksterdam University continued to put on classes less than 2 days later. Incorrect reports often cite that the event was conducted by the DEA. No charges have been filed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Harborside has been also threatened as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/99852121/Forfeiture-Complaint-Harborside-San-Jose]&lt;/ref&gt;
Steve DeAngelo spoke out against the raids and the IRS threats and vowed to serve the patients and reminded us about the patients locked up in jail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The DEA is systematically trying to destroy the medical cannabis community.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Location and character==
Oaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the [[Lakeside Apartments District, Oakland, California|Lakeside]] and the Financial District.  It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and Telegraph Ave on the northwest. It is characterized by mixed-use office and residential buildings with unique historic architecture that is older than some of the more modern skyscrapers south of 14th Street, and an abundance of ground floor retail shop spaces, restaurants and cafes.

A Julia Morgan-designed building is located at the northwest corner of 15th and Webster Streets, which was the original location of the Oakland YWCA. The neighborhood also features the [[Cathedral Building]], an ornate, historic [[Flatiron Building]] at Latham Square at the intersection of Broadway and Telegraph.

==Educational institutions==
The district features at least two institutions of higher learning, [[Lincoln University (California)|Lincoln University]] at 15th and Franklin, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and [[Oaksterdam University]] located at 1734 Telegraph Avenue, a business college which prepares students for careers in the cannabis industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oaksterdam University: Quality Training for the Cannabis Industry|url=http://www.oaksterdamuniversity.com/|work=Oaksterdam University|publisher=oaksterdamuniversity.com.|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Oaksterdam University was raided by the DEA on April 2, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where There’s Smoke, There’s Fire|url=http://oaksterdamraid.com/?p=123|work=OaksterdamRaid.com|publisher=OaksterdamRaid.com|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they performed a smash and grab.

==Transportation infrastructure==

===Mass transit===
The 19th Street [[BART]] metrorail station is located beneath Oaksterdam on Broadway between 17th and 20th Streets. The station has entrances on Broadway and on a pedestrian [[plaza]] that opens onto Telegraph Avenue. [[AC Transit]] also recently opened the [[Uptown Oakland|Uptown]] regional transit center nearby on Thomas L. Berkley Way (20th Street), which features multiple bus shelters with seating, [[NextBus]] arrival prediction signs, and [[Rapid|Rapid Bus]] service.

===Bicycle rental===

A bicycle rental service has opened in the neighborhood on 15th Street, serving one of the only bicycle rental stores in the area.  The bike shop incorporates a glass-blowing school{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===Pedicab service===

Recently a pedi-cab service (Oaksterkabs) was opened, staffed by a single cycle rickshaw. Now dubbed "The Cannabis Cruiser", the pedicab offers its services around the downtown area to students of Oaksterdam University, Oaksterdam employees and to pedestrians in general.

==Neighborhood retail==
The district is home to a number of coffee shops, a tea shop and hydroponic supply store, cafes, restaurants open into the evenings, a gift shop, two musical instrument stores and specialty stores. These shops and services also are attractive to cannabis tourists and enjoy a superior central location next to the 19th Street BART station and AC Transit connections.

===Medical cannabis dispensation===
Since legislative changes passed by the Oakland City Council in 2005, there is no longer a proliferation of cannabis dispensaries in the neighborhood as was the case for several years previously.  Most of these dispensaries had the chance to obtain non-profit status; some chose to not become non-profit and were no longer permitted to dispense cannabis. Under current legislation, there are four officially permitted dispensaries in the City of Oakland.  One of the four permits is held by a dispensary cafe in the neighborhood.

==="Measure Z clubs"===

"Measure Z" (as of 2014, Measure Z referred to a new Oakland public safety ballot measure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Measure Z ballot text and arguments|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/elections/20141104/documents/MeasureZ-V3.pdf|publisher=Alameda County Elections Office website}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead) clubs are businesses that sell cannabis to people over the age of 18.  One private club in Oaksterdam sells cannabis and food containing cannabis to adults who do not hold valid physician recommendations for medical marijuana, which are needed to obtain county-issued patient identification cards in California. One such club is named after Oakland's Measure Z, a city ballot initiative which makes the private sales, cultivation, and possession of cannabis the lowest police priority and mandates that the City of Oakland tax and regulate cannabis as soon as possible under state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland’s 10-year-old ‘Measure Z’ Provides A Model for Marijuana Law Reform|url=http://www.theweedblog.com/oaklands-10-year-old-measure-z-provides-a-model-for-marijuana-law-reform/|work=The Weed Blog|publisher=Culture Magazine|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=David Burton|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Oaksterdam News==
From 2005 to 2007, [[Oaksterdam University]] founder Richard Lee published the ''Oaksterdam News'', a quarterly newsprint periodical covering news in the California cannabis movement, with a circulation of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty|url=http://oaksterdamuniversity.com/category/faculty/|website=Oaksterdam University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lee went on to found ''West Coast Cannabis'' (edited by author and activist [[Ngaio Bealum]]), which covers similar news stories as the ''Oaksterdam News'' in magazine format; ''Oaksterdam News'' editor [[Chris Conrad (Author)|Chris Conrad]] went on to found the ''[[West Coast Leaf]]'' that same year, with his wife [[Mikki Norris]], which ran with a circulation of 175,000 until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The West Coast Leaf|url=http://www.westcoastleaf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operational Excellence''' is the execution of the business strategy more consistently and reliably than the competition. Operational Excellence is evidenced by results. Given two companies with the same strategy, the Operationally Excellent company will have lower operational risk, lower operating costs, and increased revenues relative to its competitors, creating value for customers and shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wilsonperumal.com/blog/a-better-definition-of-operational-excellence|title=A Better Definition of Operational Excellence|last=Soto|first=Francisco|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may more simply be interpreted as "Execution Excellence."

Some interpretations of this [[management fad|management philosophy]] are based on earlier [[continuous improvement]] methodologies, such as [[Lean Thinking]], [[Six Sigma]], OKAPI and [[Scientific Management]].  However, the focus of Operational Excellence goes beyond the traditional event-based model of improvement toward a long-term change in organizational culture. Companies in pursuit of Operational Excellence do two things significantly differently than other companies: they manage their business and operational processes systematically and invest in developing the right culture.

Operational Excellence manifests itself through integrated performance across revenue, cost, and risk. It focuses on meeting customer expectation through the continuous improvement of the operational processes and the culture of the organization.

==Key Components==
There are two components fundamental to Operational Excellence: an integrated [[Management system]] (IMS) and a culture of Operational Discipline. 

The first component, the IMS, consists of a framework of processes and standards that define where the company is going, identify the risks to getting there, mitigate them, manage change, and continuously improve. Having one single, integrated management system reduces overlap, redundancy, and conflict. Early adopters of this practice have been companies such as [[Exxon]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] utilizing Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/about-us/safety-and-health/operations-integrity-management-system|title=Learn about the Operations integrity Management System at ExxonMobil|work=ExxonMobil|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Operations Excellence Management Systems (OEMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chevron.com/about/operational-excellence/oems|title=OEMS|last=Affairs|first=Chevron Policy, Government and Public|website=chevron.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, respectively. 

The second component, a culture of Operational Discipline, is commonly described as doing the right thing, the right way, every time. This culture is built upon five guiding principles developed from the United States Nuclear Navy, a [[high reliability organization]]. Those principles are integrity, questioning attitude, level of knowledge, watch team backup, and formality. These values are used to identify the behaviors expected of each and every employee and how they support the organization's mission and outcomes. 

==Shingo Prize==

The [[Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence|Shingo Prize]], an organization that recognizes success in the discipline, has identified ten key principles its award winners display:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shingo Prize - Model and Guidelines|url=http://www.shingoprize.org/model-guidelines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Respect every individual
# Lead with humility
# Seek perfection
# Assure quality at the source
# Flow and pull value
# Embrace scientific thinking
# Focus on process
# Think systemically
# Create constancy of purpose
# Create value for the customer

==OKAPI method==

The OKAPI method was created by Organizational Intelligence experts Iris Tsidon &lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-israeli-female-entrepreneurs-visit-silicon-valley-1001168309&lt;/ref&gt; and Maya Gal.&lt;ref&gt;https://women2.com/stories/2014/04/07/meet-the-female-cto-and-ceo-who-are-shaking-up-the-corporate-world-with-their-crowdsourcing-startup&lt;/ref&gt; Their system incorporates the use of a methodology of SMART KPIs ([[key performance indicator]]s).

*S – Specific: the more precise the KPI, the greater its value, and the more correct the focus it provides us. It is important that the KPI direct us towards what we want to achieve.
*M – Measurable: a KPI is supposed to measure actions, not behavior.
*A – Achievable: challenging but attainable
*R – Relevant: KPIs need to be relevant to the objective we want to achieve, and contribute in a significant way to the organization's success. 
*T– Timely: Every assignment must be scheduled with a defined time table for completion

The OKAPI method identifies the main challenges facing companies striving for operational excellence:

;Disconnect
:People are not connected enough to the larger business needs; rather, they are motivated by professional considerations, without seeing the prices we pay in the commercial aspects.
;Lack of progress
:The tasks truly important for the growth of the business are not progressing. People here work very hard and are very devoted to their work, however, the assignments we need to perform in order to grow the business are not given priority
;Unable to change to stay competitive
:In a competitive market, you need the ability to adapt your management infrastructure to change. However, this process has to happen quickly and efficiently. Many organizations do not succeed in changing courses in time to keep up with their competition.
;Data is too complicated to understand easily
:To receive a picture of the state of the company, you should not need to dig through intricate Excel reports. Complicated reports and their preparation consumes lots of valuable time. Creating a system to enable the receipt of a timely, readily available picture on a current basis will add a great deal of value.
;No coherent management plan
:There are many people who think that systematic management is not important, or they do not use one because setting it up and following a plan is not one of their strong points and they pay too heavy a price for it. They get too involved in facilitating transactions, leading business development, and creating solutions to immediate problems in the company. Managers need to learn how to delegate responsibility for their own current management, so that others can work towards the shared objectives we have defined.

Also known as PBED (Plan-Brief-Execute-Debrief) the FLEX methodology is an iterative IMS designed by fighter pilots to achieve operational excellence in combat, the methodology was adapted to a business practice in 1998. Elements of the methodology are utilised in the agile manifesto commonly used by software developers. As an iterative process it values adaptation of strategy to real world influences through the practice of debriefing. Debriefing is a tool utilised by organisations to drive cultural change, specifically "Nameless and Rankless" where who are and what your position is in an organisation is irrelevant when assessing results and developing solutions:

*Plan - Establish a long term strategy focused on a common purpose. A High Definition Destination (HDD) then follow the six steps:
1. Set a clear, measurable and achievable team objective aligned to your HDD (alignment of the organisation)
2. Identify the threats and risks to achieving the objective (define to problem)
3. Identify the resources required to mitigate the threats (define the cost)
4. Apply lessons learned (*this is the key step for this method, taking a lesson from a debrief and applying it to the plan)
5. Develop individual objectives and tasks that align to the team objective (accountability)
6. Contingency plan. (three simple steps to recover from a major disruption)
*Brief - Communicate the plan to the execution team
*Execute - Execute the plan and focus on objectives (cultural change)
*Debrief - Measure the result of daily execution vs the plan, conduct a root cause analysis and adapt the objectives (Step 4 of the six step planning process)

Philosophically individuals practising Operational Excellence within an organisation should champion simplicity over complexity. In practice this should see the self awareness exhibited around errors and mistakes in decision making be rewarded, on the basis the lesson is learned and applied, leading to continuous improvement of day to day practice and end result.

The '''Professional Risk Managers' International Association''' ('''PRMIA''') is a [[professional organization]] focused on the "promotion of sound [[risk management]] standards and practices globally", and "the integration of practice and theory";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/about-us PRMIA Charter | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was founded in 2002 as  a [[non-profit]]. &lt;ref&gt;See also under [[Financial Risk Manager#Dispute]], as well as [https://archive.today/20120909153518/http://www.riskglossary.com/link/garp_scandal.htm GARP Scandal: Global Association of Risk Professionals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides [[professional certification|certification and credentialing]] for professional [[risk manager]]s, as well as other educational programs and resources.

==Professional Risk Manager==
The Professional Risk Manager (PRM) designation is an international [[professional certification]] offered by PRMIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/?page=exam Home | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The designation was first awarded in 2004. The PRM is an "independent validation" of skills within the [[financial risk management]] profession, additionally requiring a commitment to professional ethics. The PRM and the Global Association of Risk Professional's [[Financial Risk Manager|FRM]] are often compared as being the two definitive risk management designations in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;

Candidates are required to pass four exams:
&lt;ol type="I" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance theory, financial instruments and financial markets (2 hours)&lt;/li&gt;

The computerized tests are offered on all business days. To maintain certification one is required to uphold PRMIA’s professional and ethical standards.

*The Associate PRM covers the core risk management concepts in a less mathematical fashion than the PRM, "allowing non-specialists to interpret risk management information and reports".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/?page=exam&amp;option=trainingAPRM Home | Professional Risk Managers' International Association - PRMIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A single 3 hour exam is required; the recommended text is ''The Essentials of Risk Management'' ({{ISBN|0071429662}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6057">'''Shaul Nehamia Eisenberg''' ({{lang-he|שאול אייזנברג}};  1921–1997) was a [[Jewish]] [[businessperson|businessmen]] and a billionaire tycoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= Shaul Eisenberg|work=[[Toledo Blade|"The Blade"]]| date= March 28, 1997| publisher= | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19970328&amp;id=I7tAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BAQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5756,9829905| accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Eisenberg was born in 1921 in [[Munich]] to a religious [[Jewish]] family from [[Poland]]. Shortly after the uprising of the [[Nazis]] in the government, he fled and wandered as a refugee around [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= BILLIONAIRE SHAUL EISENBERG DIES AT 76| date= March 27, 1997| publisher= | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Billionaire-Shaul-Eisenberg-dies-at-76/id-9e84d41efbf1c9c17bb8fcc450017c12| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later moved to Japan. In 1941, he married a local woman. During [[World War II]] he worked with industrial factories, associating with the [[Axis Power]] countries. After the war ended, he began working with [[United States|American]] businesses, importing iron products for the Japanese steel industry, when at the same time exporting a variety of Japanese-made products to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title= Shaul Eisenberg in a New York Times article| date= March 26, 1997| publisher= | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19970326&amp;id=4jFdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HFsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1560,3799378| work = [[New York Times]]| pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 1950s, Eisenberg expanded his business to other countries in the Far East, especially [[South Korea]], where he invested money while mediating between the local authority to manufacturers from the East that were also doing business there. Among them were: [[British Electric]], [[Siemens]], [[MAN SE]], and [[Fiat Automobiles]]. Within a decade, he managed to mediate a vast variety of projects, such as developing production lines for recycled paper and purchasing airplanes and trains. He got an award from the Korean government for his actions. Until the mid-1960s, Eisenberg was the primary factor and catalyst in the commerce between South Korea and Japan to Western countries. He got high brokerage commissions, and therefore a few of which led to local and international scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Shaul Eisenberg on |date=1997-03-20 |publisher= |url=http://www.think-aboutit.com/conspiracy/ShaulEisenberg.htm |work= |pages= |accessdate= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508195528/http://www.think-aboutit.com/conspiracy/ShaulEisenberg.htm |archivedate=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eisenberg Law and his activity in Israel==

Eisenberg founded the company [[Israel Corporation]], and a new law was enacted for him, allowing the company to have a tax break for 30 years. The law, which got its nickname from Eisenberg, was meant to encourage [[entrepreneur]]s. Upon getting these benefits, Eisenberg began mimicking his international actions and do them in Israel as well, which led him to settle in [[Savyon]], Israel. With Israel Corporation he began purchasing some holdings in the companies [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]], [[Oil Refineries]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= |authorlink= | title= Eisenberg plans to concentrate in Israel.

At the same time he took advantage of his connections to do militant transactions between the Far East and Israel, and also became an exporter of weapons from Israel to countries in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. Later on he was the first person to do commercial business between Israel and [[China]]. Eisenberg is considered a significant donor to political parties, influencing the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= Norman Kaplan|authorlink= | title= The Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Israel and China:| date= | publisher= | url = http://www.calcol.com/history-15.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Eisenberg founded "[[Beit Asia]]" in [[Tel Aviv]], which he also got special tax-cuts for, where he located his stock market investments' [[Headquarters|headquarter]], owned by Eisenberg’s Group. Jonathan Zohovsky, his daughter’s husband, as well as Michael Albin, who was the manager of the group, assisted him. After the [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|Israeli 1983 stock market crash]], the group had significant losses, and later on the [[Israel Police|police]] found that the company had been hiding information from its stockholders and Albin was found guilty. He later died in tragic reasons, and Eisenberg disconnected his relationship with his daughter and her husband. In the 1990s, his business activity began to slow down, due to involvement of other markets in the Far East and other factors. Eisenberg died in [[Beijing]] in 1997, two years before the expiration of the Eisenberg Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | authors= Mitch Abrams|authorlink= | title= Israel industrialist Shaul Eisenberg dies| date= June 5, 1997| publisher= | url = http://www.jta.org/news/article/1997/06/05/3930/BIsraelindustrial| work = | pages = | accessdate = March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Eisenberg's brother, Refael, who was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] scholar, died in 1976, leaving twelve children behind him.

'''Sobiesław Zasada''' (born 27 January 1930 in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Poland]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] former [[Rally racing|rally]] driver. He won the [[European Rally Championship]] in  1966, 1967, 1971 and was vice-champion in 1968, 1969, and 1972.

Sobieslaw Zasada first raced motorcycles, and in 1951 entered four-wheel racing.  After solid racing performances, he received support from the Polish automobile club in Warsaw.  Zasada won the European Rally Champion title in 1966 with [[Puch 500|Steyr-Puch 650]] (the smallest vehicle to achieve such victory) and in 1967 with 4-cylinder Porsche 912. In autumn of 1967 he was victorious driving his flat-six Porsche 911 in the 2055-mile stage race across Argentina. In next two seasons Zasada with his Porsche 911 was runner-up in European Rally Championship, conquered only by [[Pauli Toivonen]] in 1968 and [[Harry Källström]] in 1969. Later on Zasada drove a [[BMW 2002 TI]], regaining his European Champion title in 1971 and being surpassed only by [[Raffaele Pinto]] in 1972.

At the time of his successes racing his Porsche 912 in 1967, Zasada owned a four-person auto repair shop in Kraków.  By the late 1990s, Zasada was one of the most successful businessmen in Poland.  In 1996 Reuters reported that his Polish automotive group Sobieslaw Zasada Centrum SA launched the construction of Mercedes' Vito mini-vans.  The launch marked the first production licensee that Mercedes-Benz had granted in eastern Europe.  By that time Zasada controlled two utility car factories and several automotive parts plants.

For his sport achievements and for his contribution to the development of Polish sport, he received the [[Polonia Restituta|Order of Polonia Restituta]]:

*[[Image:POL Polonia Restituta Kawalerski BAR.svg|65px|Knight's Cross]] Knight's Cross (5th Class);

'''Syndicalism''' is a radical current in the labor movement, and was most active in the early 20th century. According to the Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], it predominated the revolutionary left in the decade preceding World War I, as Marxism was mostly reformist at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm 1973, pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major syndicalist organizations included the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labor]] in France, the [[National Confederation of Labor]] in Spain, the [[Italian Syndicalist Union]], the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]], and the [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]]. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]], and the Canadian [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]], though they did not regard themselves as syndicalists, are considered by most historians to belong to this current. A number of syndicalist organizations were, and still are to this day, linked in the [[International Workers' Association]].

== Terminology ==
The term ''syndicalism'' has French origins. In French, a ''syndicat'' is a trade union, usually a local union. The corresponding words in Spanish and Portuguese, ''sindicato'', and Italian, ''sindacato'', are similar. By extension, the French ''syndicalisme'' refers to trade unionism in general.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 4, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept ''syndicalisme révolutionnaire'' or ''revolutionary syndicalism'' emerged in French socialist journals in 1903&lt;ref&gt;Gervasoni 2006, pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labor]] (''Confédération générale du travail'', CGT) came to use the term to describe its brand of unionism. ''Revolutionary syndicalism'', or more commonly ''syndicalism'' with the ''revolutionary'' implied, was then adapted to a number of languages by unionists following the French model.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 4&amp;ndash;5, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The transplantation of the term into languages in which the etymological link to ''unionism'' was lost, was frequently criticized. Opponents of syndicalism in Northern and Central Europe seized upon this to characterize it as something non-native, even dangerous. When the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (''Freie Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften'', FVdG) endorsed syndicalism in 1908, it did not at first use the term for fear of using "foreign names".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many scholars, including Darlington, [[Marcel van der Linden]], and Wayne Thorpe, apply the term ''syndicalism'' to a number of organizations or currents within the labor movement that did not identify as ''syndicalist''. They apply the label to [[One Big Union (concept)|one big unionists]] or [[industrial unionism|industrial unionists]] in North America and Australia, [[James Larkin|Larkinists]] in Ireland, and groups that identify as revolutionary industrialists, revolutionary unionists, anarcho-syndicalists, or councilists. This includes the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in the United States, for example, which claimed its industrial unionism was "a higher type of revolutionary labor organization than that proposed by the syndicalists". Van der Linden and Thorpe use ''syndicalism'' to refer to "all revolutionary, direct-actionist organizatons". Darlington proposes that syndicalism be defined as "revolutionary trade unionism".{{refn|group=note|He adds that this definition does not encompass communist or socialist unions, because the syndicalist conception "differed from both socialist and communist counterparts in viewing the decisive agency of the revolutionary transformation of society to be unions, as opposed to political parties or the state and of a collectivized worker-managed socio-economic order to be run by unions, as opposed to political parties or the state."&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He and van der Linden argue that it is justified to group together such a wide range of organizations because their similar modes of action or practice outweigh their ideological differences.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 1&amp;ndash;2, Darlington 2008, pg. 5&amp;ndash;7, van der Linden 1998, pg. 182&amp;ndash;183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, like Larry Peterson and Erik Olssen, disagree with this broad definition. According to Olssen, this understanding has a "tendency to blur the distinctions between industrial unionism, syndicalism, and revolutionary socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Olssen 1992, pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson gives a more restrictive definition of ''syndicalism'' based on five criteria: 
#a preference for federalism over centralism,
#opposition to political parties,
#seeing the general strike as the supreme revolutionary weapon,
#favoring the replacement of the state by "a federal, economic organization of society",
#and seeing unions as the basic building blocks of a post-capitalist society.
This definition excludes the IWW and the Canadian [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]] (OBU). Peterson proposes the broader category ''revolutionary industrial unionism'' to encompass syndicalism, groups like the IWW and the OBU, and others. The defining commonality between these groups is that they sought to unite all workers in a general organization.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson 1981, pg. 53&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
===Rise===
[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|right|Mikhail Bakunin, an anarchist whom syndicalists viewed as an intellectual forerunner]]
Syndicalism originated in France and spread from there. The French CGT was the model and inspiration for syndicalist groups throughout Europe and the world.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary industrial unionism, part of syndicalism in the broader sense, originated with the IWW in the United States and then caught on in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cole/Struthers/Zimmer 2017, pg. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of countries, however, certain syndicalist practices and ideas predate the coining of the term in France or the founding of the IWW. In Bert Altena's view, a number of movements in Europe can be called syndicalist, even before 1900. According to the English social historian [[E.P. Thompson]] and the anarcho-syndicalist theorist [[Rudolf Rocker]], there were syndicalist tendencies in Britain's labor movement as early as the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 197, Zimmer 2018, pg. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists saw themselves as the heirs of the [[First International]], the international socialist organization formed in 1864, particularly its anti-authoritarian wing led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Bakunin and his followers advocated the general strike, rejected electoral politics, and anticipated workers' organizations replacing rule by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 1&amp;ndash;2, 5&amp;ndash;6, Zimmer 2018, 353&amp;ndash;354.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lucien van der Walt]], the [[Spanish Regional Federation|Spanish section of the First International]], formed in 1870, was in fact syndicalist.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2018, pg. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon Zimmer sees a "proto-syndicalism" in the influence the anarchist-led [[International Working People's Association]] (IWPA) and [[Central Labor Union (Chicago)|Central Labor Union]], which originated in the American section of the First International, had in the Chicago labor movement of the 1880s. They were involved in the nationwide struggle for an [[eight-hour day]]. On May 3, 1886, the police killed three striking workers at a demonstration in Chicago. Seven policemen and four workers were killed the following day when someone, possibly an IWPA member, threw a bomb at the police. Four anarchists were eventually executed for allegedly conspiring with the man who threw the bomb. The [[Haymarket Affair]], as these events become known, led anarchists and labor organizers, including syndicalists, in both the United States and Europe to re-evaluate the revolutionary meaning of the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 354&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Anarchist dominance in Latin American labor movements --&gt;

According to [[Émile Pouget]], a French anarchist and CGT leader, from "the United States, the idea of the general strike{{spaced ndash}} fertilized by the blood of anarchists hanged in Chicago [...]{{spaced ndash}} was imported to France".&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 357&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, French anarchists, conceding that individual action such as assassinations had failed, turned their focus to the labor movement. They were able to gain influence, particularly in the ''[[bourses du travail]]'', which served as [[labor exchange]]s, meeting places for unions, and [[trades council]]s and organized in a national federation in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 43&amp;ndash;44, 65&amp;ndash;66, Mitchell 1990, pg. 27&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the CGT was formed as a rival to the ''bourses'', but was at first much weaker. From the start, it advocated the general strike and aimed to unite all workers. Pouget, who was active in the CGT, supported the use of sabotage and direct action. In 1902, the ''bourses'' merged into the CGT.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 67&amp;ndash;70, Mitchell 1990, pg. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the federation adopted the [[Charter of Amiens]], which reaffirmed the CGT's independence from party politics and fixed the goal of uniting all French workers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1990, pg. 33&amp;ndash;34, Ridley 1970, pg. 88&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World were formed in the United States by the [[Western Federation of Miners]], the [[American Labor Union]], and a broad coalition of socialists, anarchists, and labor unionists. Its base was mostly in the Western US where labor conflicts were most violent and workers therefore radicalized.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, pg. 36&amp;ndash;37, 81&amp;ndash;82, Zimmer 2018, pg. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wobblies insisted their union was a distinctly American form of labor organization and not an import of European syndicalism, the IWW was syndicalist in the broader sense of the word. According to [[Melvyn Dubofsky]] and most other IWW historians, the IWW's industrial unionism was the specifically American form of syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, 147&amp;ndash;148, 169&amp;ndash;170, Peterson 1981, pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the IWW also had a presence in Canada and Mexico nearly from its inception, as the US economy and labor force was intertwined with those countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cole/Struthers/Zimmer 2017, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Émile Pouget.jpg|thumb|right|French syndicalist leader Émile Pouget]]
French syndicalism and American industrial unionism influenced the rise of syndicalism elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalist movements and organizations in a number of countries were established by activists who had spent time in France. [[Ervin Szabó]] visited Paris in 1904 and then established a Syndicalist Propaganda Group in his native Hungary in 1910. Several of the founders of the Spanish CNT had visited France. [[Alceste de Ambris]] and [[Armando Borghi]], both leaders in Italy's USI, were in Paris for a few months from 1910 to 1911. French influence also spread through publications. Emile Pouget's pamphlets could be read in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German, and Swedish translations. Journals and newspapers in a number of countries advocated syndicalism. For example, '' L'Action directe'', a journal mainly for miners in [[Charleroi]], Belgium, urged its readers to follow "the example of our confederated friends of France".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 20&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW's newspapers published articles on French syndicalism, particularly the tactic of sabotage and the CGT's ''[[La Vie Ouvrière]]'' carried articles about Britain's labor movement by the British syndicalist [[Tom Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration played a key role in spreading syndicalist ideas. The [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]] (''Federación Obrera Regional Argentina'', FORA), openly anarchist by 1905, was formed by Italian and Spanish immigrants in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2013, pg. 2, Thompson 1990, pg. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Many IWW leaders were European immigrants, including [[Edmondo Rossoni]] who moved between the United States and Italy and was active in both the IWW and USI.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; International work processes also contributed to the diffusion of syndicalism. For example, sailors helped establish IWW presences in port cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists formed different kinds of organizations. Some, like the French radicals, worked within existing unions to infuse them with their revolutionary spirit. Some found existing unions entirely unsuitable and built federations of their own, a strategy known as ''dual unionism''. American syndicalists formed the IWW, though [[William Z. Foster]] later abandoned the IWW after a trip to France and set up the [[Syndicalist League of North America]] (SLNA), which sought to radicalize the established [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). In Ireland, the ITGWU broke away from a more moderate, and British-based, union. In Italy and Spain, syndicalists initially worked within the established union confederations before breaking away and forming USI and the CNT respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 31&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, there were both the Norwegian Trade Union Opposition (''Norske Fagopposition'', NFO), syndicalists working within the mainstream [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]] (''Landsorganisasjonen i Norge'' in Norwegian, LO), and the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation (''Norsk Syndikalistik Federation'' in Norwegian, NSF), an independent syndicalist organization set up by the Swedish SAC.&lt;ref&gt;Persson 1990, pg. 94&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, there was a similar conflict between ISEL and the [[Industrial Workers of Great Britain|local IWW organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX, Darlington 2008, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, there were syndicalist national labor confederations in Peru,&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch 2010, pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Toledo/Biondi 2010, pg. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, pg. 169, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pg. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, and France, while Belgian syndicalists were in the process of forming one.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also groups advocating syndicalism in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 78&amp;ndash;79&lt;/ref&gt; Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Crump 1993, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;, the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of North America, the IWW also had organizations in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Burgmann 1995, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, where it was part of the [[New Zealand Federation of Labour (1909)|Federation of Labour]] (FOL),&lt;ref&gt;Olssen 1988, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain, though its membership had imploded by 1913,&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX, Darlington 2008, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2010, pg. 58&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, syndicalism took the form of the ITGWU, which espoused a mix of industrial unionism and socialist [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]], and was labeled Larkinism.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 2010, pg. 194&amp;ndash;196, 199, 202&amp;ndash;204, 213, Darlington 2008, pg. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
Scholars have given several explanations for the emergence of syndicalism. [[Werner Sombart]], a German economist and sociologist, commenting in 1905, ascribes the rise of syndicalism to the Italian and particularly the French mentality. He writes: "The only people who could possibly act up to such a system of teaching are Frenchmen and Italians. They are generally men who do things impulsively [...],  who are seized upon by a sudden passionate enthusiasm [...], but they have little application, perseverance, calm or steadiness."&lt;ref&gt;Sombart 1909, pg. 110&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a significant uptick in workers' radicalism in most developed capitalist countries from 1911 to 1922, though they relented during World War I. Strikes increased in frequency, numbers of workers involved, and duration. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, syndicalism was only one way this radicalization expressed itself.&lt;ref&gt;Screpanti 1984, pg. 512&amp;ndash;513, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, for example, the period from 1910 to 1914 became known as the [[Great Labour Unrest]]. Many historians see syndicalism as a consequence of this unrest, but [[Elie Halévy]] and the politician [[Lord Robert Cecil]] claim it was its cause. Employers in France likewise blamed an upsurge in workers' militancy in the same period on syndicalist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 38&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism was further encouraged by employers' hostility to workers' actions.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 55&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Linden and Thorpe, workers' radicalization manifested itself in their rejection of the dominant strategies in the, mostly socialist, labor movement, which was led by reformist trade unions and socialist parties. Lenin posited that "revolutionary syndicalism in many countries was a direct and inevitable result of opportunism, reformism and parliamentary cretinism." A feeling that ideological disputes were draining workers' power led Dutch, French, and American syndicalist organizations to declare themselves independent of any political groups. In countries like Italy, Spain, and Ireland, which was still under British rule, parliamentary politics were not seen as a serious means for workers to express their grievances. Most workers were disenfranchised. Yet even in France or Britain, where most male workers had the right to vote, many workers did not trust party politics. The enormous numerical growth of well-organized socialist parties, such as in Germany and Italy, did not, in the minds of many workers, correlate with any real advance in the class struggle as these parties were thought to be overly concerned with building the parties themselves and with electoral politics than with the class struggle and had therefore lost their original revolutionary edge. The socialists preached the inevitability of socialism, but were in practice bureaucratic and reformist. Similarly, the trade unions frequently allied with those parties, equally growing in numbers, were denounced for their expanding bureaucracies, their centralization, and for failing to represent workers' interests. For example, between 1902 and 1913 the German [[Free Trade Unions (Germany)|free trade unions]]'s membership grew by 350% but its bureaucracy by more than 1900%.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 57&amp;ndash;61, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 12&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common explanation for the rise of syndicalism that it is a result of the economic backwardness of the countries in which it emerged, particularly France. Newer studies have questioned this account.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 50&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Ernesto Screpanti]] hypothesized that strike waves such as the one from 1911 to 1922 generally occur during the upper turning-points of the periodic global long [[business cycle|cycles of boom and bust]] known as [[Kondratieff waves]]. Such waves of proletarian insurgency, claims Screpanti, were global in reach, saw workers breaking free of the dynamics of the capitalist system, and aimed to overthrow that system.&lt;ref&gt;Screpanti 1984, pg. 516&amp;ndash;519, 544&amp;ndash;545.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Linden and Thorpe, changes in labor processes also contributed to the radicalization of workers and thereby to the rise of syndicalism. This rise took place during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. Two groups of workers were most attracted to syndicalism: casual or seasonal laborers who frequently changed jobs and workers whose occupations were being as a result of technological advances. The first group includes landless agricultural workers, construction workers, and dockers, all of whom were disproportionately represented in several countries' syndicalist movements. Because they frequently changed jobs, such workers did not have close relationships with their employers and the risk of losing one's job as a result of a strike was reduced. Moreover, because of the time constraints of their jobs they were forced to act immediately in order to achieve anything and could not plan for the long term by building up strike funds or powerful labor organizations or by engaging in mediation. Their working conditions gave them an inclination to engage in direct confrontation with employers and apply direct action. The second group includes miners, railway employees, and certain factory workers. Their occupations were [[Deskilling|deskilled]] by technological and organizational changes. These changes made workers from the second group similar in some respects to the first group. They did not entirely result from the introduction of new technology, but were also caused by changes in management methods. This included increased supervision of workers, [[piecework]], internal promotions, all designed make workers docile and loyal and to transfer knowledge and control over the process of production from workers to employers. Frustration with this loss of power led to formal and informal resistance by workers.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 4, 7&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena disagrees with this explanation. According to him, it was workers with significant autonomy in their jobs and pride in their skills who were most attracted to syndicalism. Moreover, he argues, explanations based on workers' occupations cannot explain why only a minority of workers in those jobs became syndicalists or why in some professions workers in different locations had vastly different patterns of organization. The small size of many syndicalist unions also makes observations about which workers joined statistically irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 205&amp;ndash;207.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hornsbergshage 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting during the 1909 general strike in Sweden]]
Syndicalism came to be seen as a viable strategy because the general strike became a practical possibility. Although it had been advocated before, there were not sufficient numbers of wage workers to bring society to a standstill and they had not achieved a sufficient degree of organization and solidarity until the 1890s, according van der Linden and Thorpe. Several general or political strikes then took place before World War: [[Belgian general strike of 1893|in 1893]] and [[Belgian general strike of 1902|in 1902]] in Belgium, [[Swedish general strike of 1902|in 1902]] and [[Swedish general strike|in 1909]] in Sweden, [[Railroad strikes of 1903 in the Netherlands|in 1903]] in the Netherlands, [[1904 Italian general strike|in 1904]] in Italy in addition to significant work stoppages during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darlington cites the significance of the conscious intervention by syndicalist militants. The industrial unrest of the period created conditions which made workers receptive to syndicalist leaders' agitation. They spread their ideas through pamphlets and newspapers and had considerable influence in a number of labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 82&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, van der Linden and Thorpe point to spatial and geographical factors that shaped the rise of syndicalism. Workers who would otherwise not have had an inclination to syndicalism joined because syndicalism was dominant in their locales. Workers in the Canadian and American West for example, were generally more radical and drawn to the IWW and One Big Union than their counterparts in the East. Similarly, southern workers were more drawn to syndicalism in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Altena, the emergence of syndicalism must be analyzed at the level of local communities. Only differences in local social and economic structures explain why some towns had a strong syndicalist presence, but others did not.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 209&amp;ndash;214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Syndicalism was not informed by theory or a systematically elaborated ideology the same way socialism was by [[Marxism]]. [[Émile Pouget]], a CGT leader, maintained that: "What sets syndicalism apart from the various schools of socialism{{spaced ndash}} and makes it superior{{spaced ndash}} is its doctrinal sobriety. Inside the unions, there is little philosophising. They do better than that: they act!" Similarly, [[Andreu Nin]] of the Spanish CNT proclaimed in 1919: "I am a fanatic of action, of revolution. I believe in actions more than in remote ideologies and abstract questions." Though workers' education was important at least to committed activists, syndicalists distrusted bourgeois intellectuals, wanting to maintain workers' control over the movement. Syndicalist thinking was elaborated in pamphlets, leaflets, speeches, and articles and in the movement's own newspapers. These writings consisted mainly in calls to action and discussions of tactics in class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 18&amp;ndash;20, Thorpe 1989, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Georges Sorel]]'s ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' introduced syndicalist ideas to a broader audience. Sorel fancied himself the premier theorist of syndicalism and was frequently thought of as such, but he was not a part of the movement and his influence on syndicalism was insignificant, except in Italy and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 18, Chwedoruk 2010, pg. 142, Ridley 1970, pg. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which syndicalist positions reflected merely the views of leaders and to what extent those positions were shared by syndicalist organizations' rank-and-file is a matter of dispute. The historian [[Peter Stearns]], commenting on French syndicalism, concludes that most workers did not identify with syndicalism's long-range goals and that syndicalist hegemony accounts for the relatively slow growth of the French labor movement as a whole. Workers who joined the syndicalist movement, he claims, were on the whole indifferent to doctrinal questions, their membership in syndicalist organizations was partly accidental and leaders were unable to convert workers to syndicalist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1971, pg. 35&amp;ndash;38, 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Ridley, a political scientist, is more equivocal. According to him, leaders were very influential in the drafting of syndicalist ideas, but syndicalism was more than a mere tool of a few leaders, but a genuine product of the French labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 182&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington adds that in the Irish ITGWU most members were won over by the union's philosophy of direct action.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Altena argues that, though evidence of ordinary workers' convictions is scant, it indicates that they were aware of doctrinal differences between various currents in the labor movement and able to defend their own views. He points out that they likely understood syndicalist newspapers and debated political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 189&amp;ndash;190.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syndicalism'' is used by some interchangeably with ''[[anarcho-syndicalism]]''. This term was first used in 1907, by socialists criticizing the political neutrality of the CGT, although it was rarely used until the early 1920s when communists used it disparagingly. Only from 1922 was it used by self-avowed anarcho-syndicalists.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 29&amp;ndash;30, 32&amp;ndash;33, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 17, Berry 2002, pg. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism has traditionally been seen as a current within anarchism,&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2012, pg. 97, Darlington 2009, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but in some countries it was dominated by Marxists rather than anarchists. This was the case in Italy and much of the Anglophone world, including Ireland where anarchists had no significant influence on syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 2010, pg. 195, Zimmer 2018, pg. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which syndicalist doctrine was a product of anarchism is debated. The anarchist Iain McKay argues that ''syndicalism'' is but a new name for ideas and tactics developed by Bakunin and the anarchist wing of the First International, while it is wholly inconsistent with positions Marx and Engels took. According to him, the fact that many Marxists embraced syndicalism merely indicates that they abandoned Marx's views and converted to Bakunin's.&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2021, pg. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena too views syndicalism as part of the broader anarchist movement, but concedes there was a tension between this and the fact that it was also a labor movement. He also sees Marxist ideas reflected in the movement, as leading syndicalists such as [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis|F. Domela Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]] as well as much of the Australian syndicalist movement were influenced by them, as well as older socialist notions.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 188, 191&amp;ndash;194.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darlington, anarchism, Marxism, and revolutionary trade unionism equally contributed to syndicalism, in addition to various influences in specific countries, including [[Blanquism]], [[anti-clericalism]], [[republicanism]], and [[Peasant movement|agrarian radicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 46&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of capitalism and the state===
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.png|thumb|right|The ''Pyramid of Capitalist System'' from 1911 illustrates the IWW's critique of capitalism.]]
[[Bill Haywood]], a leading figure in the IWW, defined the union's purpose at [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|its founding congress]] as "the emancipation of the working class from the slave bondage of capitalism". Syndicalists held that society was divided into two great classes, the working class and the bourgeoisie. Their interests being irreconcilable, they must be in a constant state of [[class struggle]]. [[Tom Mann]], a British syndicalist, declared that "the object of the unions is to wage the Class War". This war, according to syndicalist doctrine, was aimed not just at gaining concessions such as higher wages or a shorter working day, but at the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg 21&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists agreed with [[Karl Marx]]'s characterization of the [[State (polity)|state]] as the "executive committee of the ruling class". They held that a society's economic order determined its political order and concluded that the former could not be overthrown by changes to the latter. Nevertheless, a number of leading syndicalist figures worked in political parties and some ran for elected office. [[Jim Larkin]], the leader of the Irish ITGWU, was active in the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], Haywood in the [[Socialist Party of America]]. Yet, they saw the economic sphere as the primary arena for revolutionary struggle, while involvement in politics could at best be an "echo" of industrial struggle. They were skeptical of parliamentary politics. According to Father [[Thomas Hagerty]], a Catholic priest and IWW leader, "dropping pieces of paper into a hole in a box never did achieve emancipation for the working class, and to my thinking it will never achieve it". Syndicalist trade unions declared their political neutrality and autonomy from political parties. Political parties, syndicalists reasoned, grouped people according to their political views, uniting members of different classes. Unions, on the other hand, were to be purely working-class organizations, uniting the entire class, and could therefore not be divided on political grounds. The French syndicalist Pouget explained: "The CGT embraces{{spaced ndash}} outside of all the schools of politics{{spaced ndash}} all workers cognisant of the struggle to be waged for the elimination of wage-slavery and the employer class." In practice, however, this neutrality was more ambiguous. The CGT, for example, worked with the Socialist Party in the struggle  against the [[Conscription in France|Three-Year Law]], which extended conscription. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the CNT, whose policy barred anyone who had been a candidate for political office or had participated in political endeavors from representing it, was intimately connected with the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (''Federación Anarquista Ibérica'', FAI).&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 22&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on class struggle===
[[File:1906 - Grève pour les 8 heures.jpg|thumb|right|''Bourse du travail'' in Paris during a strike for the eight-hour day in 1906]]
In the syndicalist conception, unions played a dual role. They were organs of struggle within capitalism for better working conditions, but they were also to play a key role in the revolution to overthrow capitalism. [[Victor Griffuelhes]] expressed this at the CGT's 1906 congress in the following manner: "In its day-to-day demands, syndicalism seeks the co-ordination of workers' efforts, the increase of workers' well-being by the achievement of immediate improvements, such as the reduction of working hours, the increase of wages, etc. But this task is only one aspect of the work of syndicalism; it prepares for complete emancipation, which can be realised only by expropriating the capitalist class". For unions to fulfill this role, it was necessary to prevent bureaucrats{{spaced ndash}} "whose sole purpose in life seems to be apologising for and defending the capitalist system of exploitation", according to Larkin{{spaced ndash}} from inhibiting workers' militant zeal. Battling bureaucracy and reformism within the labor movement was a major theme for syndicalists. One expression of this was many syndicalists' rejection of [[collective bargaining agreements]], which were thought to force labor peace upon workers and break their solidarity. The Wobblie [[Vincent St. John]] declared: "There is but one bargain that the Industrial Workers of the World will make with the employing class{{spaced ndash}} complete surrender of the means of production." The [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]] (''Federación Obrera Regional Argentina'', FORA) and the OBU did, however, accept such deals and others began accepting them eventually. Similarly, syndicalist unions did not work to build large strike funds, for fear that they would create bureaucracy separate from the rank-and-file and instill in workers the expectation that the union rather than they would wage the class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 28&amp;ndash;31, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anarchist black cat.svg|thumb|right|Wobblies used the black cat as a symbol for sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Syndicalists advocated [[direct action]], including [[working to rule]], passive resistance, sabotage, and strikes, particularly the [[general strike]], as tactics in the class struggle, as opposed to indirect action such as electoral politics. The IWW engaged in around 30 mostly successful civil disobedience campaigns they deemed [[free speech fights]]. Wobblies would defy laws restricting public speeches, in order to clog up prisons and court systems as a result of hundreds of arrests, ultimately forcing public officials to rescind such laws. Sabotage ranged from slow or inefficient work to destruction of machinery and physical violence. French railway and postal workers cut telegraph and signal lines during strikes in 1909 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 32&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step towards revolution, according to syndicalists, would be a [[general strike]]. It would be "the curtain drop on a tired old scene of several centuries, and the curtain raising on another", according to Griffuelhes.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 39&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists remained vague about the society they envisioned to replace capitalism, claiming that it was impossible to foresee in detail. Labor unions were seen as being the embryo of a new society in addition to being the means of struggle within the old. Syndicalists generally agreed that in a free society production would be managed by workers. The state apparatus would be replaced by the rule of workers' organizations. In such a society individuals would be liberated, both in the economic sphere but also in their private and social lives.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 42&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
&lt;!-- [[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a Wobbly organizer]] --&gt;
Syndicalist policies on gender issues were mixed. The CNT did not admit women as members until 1918. The CGT dismissed feminism as a bourgeois movement. Syndicalists were mostly indifferent to the question of [[women's suffrage]]. [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], an IWW organizer, insisted that women "find their power at the point of production where they work", rather than at the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 105&amp;ndash;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 230 delegates present at the founding of Canada's One Big Union, a mere 3 were women. When a female radical criticized the masculinist atmosphere at the meeting, she was rebuffed by men who insisted that labor only concern itself with class rather than gender issues.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum 1998, pg. 15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Todd McCallum concludes that syndicalists in the OBU advocated values of "radical manhood".&lt;ref&gt;McCallum 1998, pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;
Syndicalists were involved in a number strikes, labor disputes, and other struggles. In the United States, the IWW was involved in at least 150 strikes including [[Goldfield, Nevada labor troubles of 1906-1907|miners' strikes]] in [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]], Nevada in 1906&amp;ndash;1907, a [[Pressed Steel Car strike of 1909|steel workers' strike]] in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania|McKees Rocks]], Pennsylvania in 1909, a [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|textile workers' strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], Massachusetts, [[The Brotherhood of Timber Workers|timber workers' strikes]] in Louisiana and Arkansas in 1912&amp;ndash;1913, and a [[1913 Paterson silk strike|silk workers' strike]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey. The most prominent was the struggle in Lawrence. Wobblie leaders brought together 23,000 mostly immigrant workers, many of whom did not speak English. They arranged for workers' children to be sent to live with sympathetic families outside of Lawrence for the duration of the strike so their parents could focus on the struggle. Unlike most IWW-led strikes, the struggle was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 62&amp;ndash;63, 86&amp;ndash;87, Dubofsky 1969, pg. 120&amp;ndash;125, 202&amp;ndash;208, 210&amp;ndash;220, 227&amp;ndash;283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- To-do: Read up details on Southern timber strikes  --&gt; In Mexico, syndicalism first emerged in 1906 during a violent [[Cananea strike|miners' strike]] in [[Cananea]]  and an even more violent [[Río Blanco strike|textile workers' strike]] in [[Río Blanco, Veracruz|Río Blanco]], Veracruz. In 1912, during the 1910&amp;ndash;1920 [[Mexican Revolution]], anarchists formed the syndicalist union [[Casa del Obrero Mundial|House of the World Worker]] (''Casa del Obrero Mundial''). It led a series of successful strikes in 1913 in Mexico City and central Mexico. After the [[Constitutionalist Army]] occupied the capital in 1914, syndicalists allied with the government it established to defeat rural forces such as the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] and therefore received government support. Once those forces had been suppressed, this alliance broke apart and the ''Casa'' campaigned for workers' control of factories and the nationalization of foreign capital. It contributed to a rise in labor unrest that began in mid-1915. It led general strikes [[May 1916 Mexico general strike|in May]] and [[July–August Mexico general strike|in July–August]] 1916 in greater Mexico City. The latter was quelled by the army, marking the defeat of the ''Casa'', which was also suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pg. 188&amp;ndash;199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, the [[5 October 1910 revolution|deposition of the King]] in 1910 was followed by a strike wave throughout the country. After the police occupied the offices of an agricultural union, syndicalists called for a general strike. During the strike, Lisbon was controlled by workers and there were armed uprisings in several other cities. In 1912, the strike wave ebbed off.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerlein/van der Linden 1990, pg. 157&amp;ndash;158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish CNT, shortly after its first congress, participated in [[1911 Spanish general strike|a general strike]]. It was accused of having instigated the strike, but it is unclear to what extent it was responsible. In any case, the CNT was banned by the state for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Bar 1990, pg. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

British Wobblies were involved in two major strikes in Scotland, one at [[Argyll Motor Works]] and the second at a [[Singer Corporation|Singer's sewing machine factory]] in [[Clydebank]]. In 1906, several industrial unionists began to spread their ideas and organize workers at Singer's.  In 1911, they organized [[Red Clydeside#1911 strike at Singer|a strike]] after a woman was fired for not working hard enough. The strike was cleverly defeated by management and most activists lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; The ISEL leader Tom Mann was also at the center of several labor disputes during the Great Labour Unrest, including the [[1911 Liverpool general transport strike]] where he chaired the  strike committee.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, Jim Larkin and the ITGWU led 20,000 during the 1913 [[Dublin lockout]]. After the ITGWU attempted to unionize [[Dublin United Tramway Company|Dublin's trams]] and tram workers went on strike, the city's employers threatened to fire any workers who did not sign a pledge to not support the ITGWU, thereby turning the dispute into a city-wide conflict in late September. Workers' resistance crumbled in January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 42, O'Connor 2010, pg. 205&amp;ndash;207&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congress london 1913.jpg|thumb|right|A session of the First International Syndicalist Congress in 1913]]
There was no international syndicalist organization prior to World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, CGT activists presented the Charter of Amiens and syndicalism to an international audience a higher form of anarchism at the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] in 1907. Discussions at the Congress led to the formation of the international syndicalist journal ''[[Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 32, 34, Altena 2010, pg. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The CGT was affiliated with the [[International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centers]] (ISNTUC), which brought together reformist socialist unions. Both the Dutch NAS and the British ISEL attempted to remedy the lack of a syndicalist counterpart to ISNTUC in 1913, simultaneously publishing calls for an international syndicalist congress in 1913. The CGT rejected the invitation. Its leaders feared that leaving ISNTUC, which it intended to revolutionize from within, would split the CGT and harm working class unity. The IWW also did not participate, as it considered itself an international in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Lehning 1982, pg. 77&amp;ndash;78, Thorpe 1989, pg. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First International Syndicalist Congress]] was held in London from September 27 to October 2. It was attended by 38 delegates from 65 organizations in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.{{refn|group=note|The CGT's absence led the ''[[New Statesman]]'' to liken the Congress to "to playing ''Hamlet'' without the Prince of Denmark".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Discussions were contentious and did not lead to the founding of a syndicalist international. Delegates did agree on a declaration of principles describing syndicalism's core tenets. They also decided to launch an International Syndicalist Information Bureau and to hold another congress in Amsterdam. This congress did not take place due to the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Lehning 1982, pg. 78&amp;ndash;80, Thorpe 1989, pg. 69, 72, 75&amp;ndash;76, 79&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Syndicalists had long opposed nationalism and militarism. Haywood held that "it is better to be a traitor to your country than to your class". French syndicalists viewed the Army as the primary defender of the capitalist order. In 1901, the CGT published a manual for soldiers encouraging desertion. Similarly, in 1911 British syndicalists distributed an "Open Letter to British Soldiers" imploring them not to shoot on striking workers, but to join the working class's struggle against capital. Patriotism, syndicalists argued, was a means of integrating workers into capitalist society by distracting them from their true class interest. In 1908, the CGT's congress invoked the slogan of the First International, proclaiming that the "workers have no fatherland".&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 45&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christian-cornelissen.jpg|thumb|right|Christiaan Cornelissen, a Dutch anarcho-syndicalist who supported World War I]]
When World War I broke out in July 1914, socialist parties and trade unions{{spaced ndash}} both in neutral and belligerent countries{{refn|group=note|Russian, Serbian, and Italian socialists did not.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 125, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}} supported their respective nations' war efforts or national defense, despite previous pledges to do the opposite. Socialists agreed to put aside class conflict and vote for [[War bond|war credits]]. German socialists argued that war was necessary to defend against Russia's barbaric [[Tsarism]], while their French counterparts pointed to the need to defend against Prussian militarism and the German "instinct of domination and of discipline". This collaboration between the socialist movement and the state was known as the ''[[union sacrée]]'' in France, the ''[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]'' in Germany, and ''[[godsvrede]]'' in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 125&amp;ndash;127, Thorpe 2006, pg. 1005, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 24&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a number of anarchists led by [[Peter Kropotkin]], including the influential syndicalist Christiaan Cornelissen, issued the [[Manifesto of the Sixteen]], supporting the Allied cause in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 47, Thorpe 1989, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Most syndicalists, however, remained true to their internationalist and anti-militarist principles by opposing the war and their respective nation's participation in it.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the French CGT and a sizable minority in the Italian USI did not.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 984.&lt;/ref&gt; The CGT had long had a moderate, reformist wing, which gained the upper hand. As a result, according to historians like Darlington or van der Linden and Thorpe, the CGT was no longer a revolutionary syndicalist organization after the start of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 990, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the French president's call for national unity by agreeing to a no-strike pledge and to resolve labor disputes through arbitration and by actively participating in the French war effort. Most of the its members of military age were conscripted without resistance and its ranks shrank from 350,000 in 1913 to 49,000 dues-paying members in 1915. CGT leaders defended this course by arguing that France's war against Germany was a war between democracy and republicanism on the one side and barbaric militarism on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 992.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy did not initially participate in World War I, which was deeply unpopular in the country, when it broke out. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] and the reformist [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|General Confederation of Labor]] opposed Italian intervention in the Great War. Once Italy became a participant, the socialists refused to support the war effort, but also refrained from working against it. From the start of the war, even before Italy did so, a minority within USI, led by the most famous Italian syndicalist, [[Alceste De Ambris]], called on the Italian state to take the Allies' side. The pro-war syndicalists saw Italian participation in the war as the completion of nationhood. They also felt compelled to oppose the socialists' neutrality and therefore support the war. Finally, they gave similar arguments as the French, warning of the dangers posed by the "suffocating imperialism of Germany", and felt obliged to follow the CGT's lead.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 11&amp;ndash;13, Darlington 2006, pg. 994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die einigkeit.PNG|thumb|right|August 1914 edition of ''[[Die Einigkeit]]'', a German syndicalist newspaper, protesting the outbreak of war]]
USI's pro-war wing had the support of less than a third of the organization's members and it was forced out in September 1914. Its anarchist wing, led by [[Armando Borghi]], was firmly opposed to the war, deeming it incompatible with workers' internationalism and predicting that it would only serve elites and governments. Its opposition was met with government repression and Borghi and others were interned by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 13&amp;ndash;14 , Darlington 2006, pg. 995.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-war faction in the CGT, on the other hand, was a small minority. It was led by the likes of [[Pierre Monatte]] and [[Alphonse Merrheim]]. They would link up with anti-war socialists from around Europe at the 1915 [[Zimmerwald conference]]. They faced considerable difficulties putting up meaningful resistance against the war. The government called up militants to the Army, including Monatte. He considered refusing the order and being summarily executed, but decided this would be futile.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 992&amp;ndash;993.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalist organizations in other countries nearly unanimously opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 983&amp;ndash;984, Thorpe 2001, pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; "Let Germany win, let France win, it is all the same to the workers," [[José Negre]] of the CNT in neutral Spain declared. The CNT insisted that syndicalists could support neither side in an imperialist conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 985, Thorpe 2011, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of pro-British sentiment swept Ireland during the war, although the ITGWU and the rest of the Irish labor movement opposed it,  and half of the ITGWU's membership enlisted in the British military. The ITGWU had also been significantly weakened in 1913 in the [[Dublin Lockout]]. After Jim Larkin left Ireland in 1914, [[James Connolly]] took over leadership of the union. Because of the organization's weakness, Connolly allied it along with its paramilitary force, the [[Irish Citizen Army]], with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. Together, they instigated the [[Easter Rising]], seeking to weaken the British Empire and hoping that the insurrection would spread throughout Europe. The uprising was quickly quelled by the British army and Connolly was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 987&amp;ndash;989.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the small FVdG opposed the socialists' ''Burgfrieden'' and Germany's involvement in the war, challenging the claim that the country was waging a defensive war. Its journals were suppressed and a number of its members were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States did not enter the war until the spring of 1917. The start of the war had induced an economic boom in the US, tightening the labor market and thereby strengthening workers' bargaining position. The IWW profited from this, more than doubling its membership between 1916 and 1917. At the same time, the Wobblies fervently denounced the war and mulled calling an anti-war general strike. Once America became a combatant, the IWW maintained its anti-war stance, while its bitter rival, the AFL, supported the war. It did not, however, launch an anti-war campaign, as it feared the government would crush it if it did and wanted to focus on its economic struggles. The IWW's practical opposition to the war was limited, 95% of eligible IWW members registered for the draft, and most of those drafted served.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, pg. 349&amp;ndash;355, 357, Darlington 2006, pg. 997&amp;ndash;999.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists in the Netherlands and Sweden, both neutral countries, criticized the truce socialists entered with their governments in order to shore up national defense. The Dutch NAS disowned Cornelissen, one of its founders, for his support for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists from Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, and Cuba met at an anti-war congress in [[El Ferrol]], Spain, in April 1915. The congress was poorly planned and prohibited by the Spanish authorities, but delegates managed to discuss resistance to the war and extending international cooperation between syndicalist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2006, pg. 1010&amp;ndash;1012, 1016.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine, Brazilian, Spanish, and Portuguese delegates later met in October in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to continue discussions and resolved to deepen cooperation between South American syndicalists.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2006, pg. 1013&amp;ndash;1014.&lt;/ref&gt; While syndicalists were only able to put up a rather limited practical struggle against World War I,&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 984.&lt;/ref&gt; they also looked to challenge the war on an ideological or cultural level.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 23&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt; They pointed to the horrors of war and spurned efforts to legitimate it as something noble. German syndicalists drew attention to the death, injury, destruction, and misery that the war wrought.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 15, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; German, Swedish, Dutch, and Spanish syndicalists denounced nationalism with ''Tierra y Libertad'', a syndicalist journal in Barcelona, calling it a "grotesque mentality". The Dutch newspaper ''De Arbeid'' criticized nationalism, because "it finds its embodiment in the state and is the denial of class antagonism between the haves and the have-nots". German and Spanish syndicalists went further still by putting into question the concept of nationhood itself and dismissing it as a mere social construct. The Germans pointed out that most inhabitants of the German Empire identified not as Germans, but in regional terms as Prussians or Bavarians and the like. Multilingual countries like Germany and Spain also could not claim a common language as a defining characteristic of the nation nor did members of the same nation share the same values or experiences, syndicalists in Spain and Germany argued.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 16&amp;ndash;17, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 32&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists also argued against the notion that the war was a clash of different cultures or that it could be justified as a defense of civilization. Various cultures were not mutually hostile, they claimed, and the state should not be seen as the embodiment of culture, since culture was the product of the entire population, while the state acted in the interests of just a few. Moreover, they argued that if culture was to be understood as ''[[high culture]]'', the very workers dying in the war were denied access to that culture by capitalist conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 17, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 34&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, syndicalists railed against religious justifications for war. Before the war, they had rejected religion as divisive at best, but support for the war by both Catholic and Protestant clergy revealed their hypocrisy and disgraced the principles Christianity claimed to uphold, they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010a, pg. 28&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war progressed, disaffection with worsening living conditions at home and a growing numbers of casualties at the front eroded the enthusiasm and patriotism the outbreak of war had aroused. Prices were on the rise, food was scarce, and it became increasingly clear that the war would not be short. In Germany, for example, food shortages led to demonstrations and riots in a number of cities in the summer of 1916. At the same time, anti-war demonstrations started. Strikes picked up from around 1916 or 1917 on across Europe and soldiers began to [[mutiny]]. Workers distrusted their socialist leaders who had joined the war effort. Thanks in part to their fidelity to internationalism, syndicalist organizations profited from this development and expanded as the war drew to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 131&amp;ndash;133, 136&amp;ndash;137, Thorpe 2001, pg. 19, Darlington 2006, pg. 1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Revolution and post-war turmoil===
[[File:Golos Truda, Sept 14 (Sept 1).jpg|thumb|right|September 14, 1917, issue of ''Golos Truda'': The headline reads "To the workers of the world".]]
Disaffection with the war condensed in the [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|post-World War I revolutions]] that began with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1917, strikes, riots, and troop mutinies broke out in [[Petrograd]], forcing the Russian Tsar [[Nicholas II]] to abdicate on March 2 in favor of a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]]. Immediately, anarchist groups emerged. Russian syndicalists organized around the journal ''[[Golos Truda]]'' (''The Voice of Labor''), which had a circulation of around 25,000, and the Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 115, 123&amp;ndash;125, 139&amp;ndash;140, Thorpe 1989, pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Most syndicalists were exiled to Western Europe or America before the revolution and started returning in the summer. The most prominent syndicalists who returned to Russia were [[Maksim Raevskii]], [[Vladimir Shatov]], [[Alexander Schapiro]], a participant in the 1913 syndicalist congress in London, and Vseolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum, known as [[Volin]]. They were joined by the young local [[Gregori Maximoff|Grigorii Petrovitch Maksimov]]. In their New York exile, Raevskii, Shatov, and Volin had worked on the syndicalist journal ''Golos Truda'', then the organ of the [[Union of Russian Workers]]. They brought it with them proceeded to publish in Petrograd looking to spread syndicalist ideas among workers by introducing them to French movement and the general strike. Outside of Petrograd, syndicalism also gained followers in [[Vyborg]], Moscow, and in the south among the miners in the [[Donets Basin]] and cement workers and longshoremen in [[Ekaterinodar]] and [[Novorossiisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1969, pg. 137&amp;ndash;140, 146&amp;ndash;147, Thorpe 1989, pg. 71, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Anarchists found themselves agreeing with the [[Bolsheviks]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], who returned to Russia in April, as both sought to bring down the provisional government. Lenin abandoned the idea that capitalism is a [[Theory of historical trajectory|necessary stage]] on Russia's path to communism; dismissed the establishment of a parliament, favoring that power be taken by [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]; and called for the abolition of the police, the army, the bureaucracy, and finally the state{{spaced ndash}} all sentiments syndicalists shared.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 127&amp;ndash;129&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the syndicalists also welcomed the soviets, they were most enthusiastic about the [[factory committees]] and [[workers' councils]] that had emerged in all industrial centers in the course of strikes and demonstrations in the February Revolution. The committees fought for higher wages and shorter hours, but above all for [[workers' control]] over production, which both the syndicalists and Bolsheviks supported. The syndicalists viewed the factory committees as the true form of syndicalist organization, not unions.{{refn|group=note|Volin derided the unions, which were dominated by [[Mensheviks]], as a "mediator between labor and capital" and as "reformist".&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because they were better organized, the Bolsheviks were able to gain more traction in the committees with six times as many delegates in a typical factory. Despite the goals they had in common, syndicalists became anxious about the Bolsheviks' growing influence, especially after they won majorities in the Petrograd and Moscow soviets in September.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 140&amp;ndash;147, 152&amp;ndash;153, Thorpe 1989, pg. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petrograd Soviet established the 66-member [[Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee|Military Revolutionary Committee]], which included four anarchists, among them the syndicalist Shatov. On October 25, this committee led the [[October Revolution]];{{refn|group=note|Compared with the mass revolts in February it was more of a ''[[coup d'état]]''. No more than 30,000 participated, according to its commander [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1969, pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;}} after taking control of the [[Winter Palace]] and key points in the capital with little resistance, it proclaimed a Soviet government. Anarchists were jubilant at the toppling of the provisional government. They were concerned about the proclamation of a new government, fearing a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], even more so after the Bolsheviks created the central [[Soviet of People's Commissars]] composed only of members of their party. They called for decentralization of power, but agreed with Lenin's labor program, which endorsed workers' control in all enterprises of a certain minimum size. The introduction of workers' control led to economic chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 158&amp;ndash;164, Thorpe 1989, pg. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin turned to restoring discipline in the factories and order to the economy in December by putting the economy under state control. At a [[First All Russian Congress of Trade Unions|trade union congress]] in January, the syndicalists, who had paid little attention to the unions, only had 6 delegates, while the Bolsheviks had 273. No longer depending on their help in toppling the provisional government, the Bolsheviks were now in a position to ignore the syndicalists' opposition and outvoted them at this congress. They opted to disempower local committees by subordinating them to the trade unions, which in turn became organs of the state. The Bolsheviks argued that workers' control did not mean that workers controlled factories at the local level and that this control had to be centralized and put under a broader economic plan.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 165&amp;ndash;170, Thorpe 1989, pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicalists criticized the Bolshevik regime bitterly, characterizing it as [[state capitalism|state capitalist]]. They denounced state control over the factories and agitated for decentralization of power in politics and the economy and "syndicalization" of industry.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 181, 191&amp;ndash;195, Thorpe 1989, 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Golos Truda'' was suppressed and replaced with a new, but short-lived journal, ''Vol'nyi Golos Truda'' (''The Free Voice of Labor''). A first All-Russian Conference of Anarcho-Syndicalists was held August 1918, followed by a second in November, which established an [[All-Russian Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists]]. There is no evidence the Confederation was effective in coordinating syndicalist activities.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 190&amp;ndash;191, 194&amp;ndash;195, Thorpe 1989, pg. 98&amp;ndash;100, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] against the [[White Army]] split anarchists. The syndicalists were criticized harshly, because most supported the Bolshevik regime in the war even as they excoriated Bolshevik policy. They reasoned that a White victory would be worse and that the Whites had to be defeated before a third revolution could topple the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 195&amp;ndash;196, Thorpe 1989, pg. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Schapiro served in the [[Commissariat of Foreign Affairs]], while remaining a committed syndicalist and moderate critic of the regime.

Their demands had some sway with workers and dissidents within the Bolshevik party and the Bolshevik leadership viewed them as the most dangerous part of the libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 222&amp;ndash;225, Thorpe 1989, pg. 163&amp;ndash;164.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War ended, workers and sailors, including both anarchists and Bolsheviks, [[Kronstadt Rebellion|rose up]] in 1921 in [[Kronstadt]], a bastion of radicalism since 1905, against what they saw as the rule of a small number of bureaucrats. Anarchists hailed the rebellion as the start of the third revolution. The government reacted by having anarchists throughout the country arrested, including a number of syndicalist leaders. The Russian syndicalist movement was thereby defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 228&amp;ndash;231, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists in the West who had opposed World War I reacted gushingly to the Russian Revolution.{{refn|group=note|Pro-war syndicalists in the CGT, on the other hand, viewed the revolution as treason, because the Bolsheviks withdrew Russia from the war. Alceste De Ambris and the syndicalist supporters of war in Italy also denounced the upheaval as a challenge to nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 92&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;}} Though they were still coming to grips with the evolving Bolshevik ideology and despite traditional anarchist suspicions of Marxism, they saw in Russia a revolution that had taken place against parliamentary politics and under the influence of workers' councils. They also, at this point, had only limited knowledge of the reality in Russia. [[Augustin Souchy]], a German anarcho-syndicalist, hailed it "the great passion that swept us all along. In the East, so we believed, the sun of freedom rose." The Spanish CNT declared: "Bolshevism is the name, but the idea is that of all revolutions: economic freedom. [...] Bolshevism is the new life for which we struggle, it is freedom, harmony, justice, it is the life that we want and will enforce in the world." Borghi recalled: "We exulted in its victories. We trembled at its risks.[...] We made a symbol and an altar of its name, its dead, its living and its heroes."&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 92&amp;ndash;93, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; He called on Italians to "do as they did in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a revolutionary wave, inspired in part by Russia, swept Europe in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 187, Eley 2002, pg. 138, 152&amp;ndash;155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, strikes and protests against food shortage, mainly by women, escalated and by 1917 had eroded public confidence in the government. The German Emperor was [[Abdication of Wilhelm II|forced to abdicate]] in November 1918 after [[Kiel mutiny|sailors' mutinies]] sparked an [[German Revolution of 1918–19|insurrectionary movement]] throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 136&amp;ndash;138, 153&amp;ndash;154, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicalist FVdG, which had just 6,000 members before the war and was almost completely suppressed by the state during the war, regrouped at a conference in Berlin in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 6, Bock 1969, pg. 33, 86, 102&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; It was active in the revolutionary events of the following years, particularly in the [[Ruhr area]]. It supported spontaneous strikes and championed direct action and sabotage. The FVdG started to be held in high regard for its radicalism by workers, particularly miners, who appreciated the syndicalists' ability to theorize their struggles and their experience with direct action methods. Starting in the second half of 1919, workers disappointed by the socialist party's and unions' support for the war and previously non-unionized unskilled workers who were radicalized during the war flocked to the FVdG.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 105, 108&amp;ndash;109, 118&amp;ndash;120.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution also saw the introduction to Germany of industrial unionism along the lines of the IWW with some support from the American organization, but also with links to the left wing of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 124&amp;ndash;126.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1919, the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany|Free Workers' Union of Germany (Syndicalists)]] (''Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands (Syndikalisten)'', FAUD) was formed, claiming to represent over 110,000 workers, more than eighteen times the FVdG's pre-war membership. Most of the new organization came from the FVdG, but industrial unionists, whose influence was dwindling, were also involved. [[Rudolf Rocker]], an anarchist recently returned to Germany after spending several years in London, wrote the FAUD's program.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 105&amp;ndash;106, 155&amp;ndash;156, Torpe 2001, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Ideology,Radicalization: Bock, 105-108, 156-160, 167-179 --&gt;

In Portugal, working class unrest picked up from the start of the war. In 1917, radicals began to dominate the labor movement as a result of the war, [[Sidónio Pais|the dictatorship established that year]], and the influence of the Russian Revolution. In November 1918, [[1918 Portugal general strike|a general strike]] was called but failed and in 1919 the syndicalist [[General Confederation of Labour (Portugal)|General Confederation of Labour]] (''Confederação Geral do Trabalho'', CGT) was formed as the country's first national union confederation.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerlein/van der Linden 1990, pg. 159&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:São Paulo (Greve de 1917).jpg|thumb|right|The 1917 general strike in São Paulo]]
In Brazil, in both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, syndicalists, along with anarchists and socialists, were leaders in a [[1917–1919 Brazil strike movement|cycle of labor struggles]] from 1917 to 1919. It included a general strike in 1917, a failed uprising in 1918 inspired by the Russian Revolution, and a number of smaller strikes. The movement was put down by increased organization by employers to resist workers' demands and by government repression, including the closure of unions, arrests, deportations of foreign militants, and violence, with some 200 workers killed in São Paulo alone.&lt;ref&gt;Batalha 2017, pg. 92&amp;ndash;98, Toledo/Biondi 2010, pg. 387&amp;ndash;391.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, FORA had split into the anarcho-communist FORA V and the syndicalist FORA IX. While FORA V called for a futile general strike in 1915, FORA IX was more careful. It called off general strikes it had planned in 1917 and 1918. In January 1919, five workers were by the authorities during a strike led by a union with tenuous links to FORA V. At the funeral, police killed another 39 workers. Both FORA organizations called for a general strike, which continued after FORA IX reached a settlement. Vigilantes, supported by business and the military, attacked unions and militants. In all, between 100 and 700 people died in what became known as the [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]]. Nevertheless, strikes continued to increase and both FORA V and IX grew.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, pg. 169, 174&amp;ndash;178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States underwent an increase in labor militancy during the post-war period. 1919 saw a [[Seattle General Strike|a general strike in Seattle]], large miners' strikes, [[Boston Police Strike|a police strike in Boston]], and [[Steel strike of 1919|a nationwide steel strike]]. The IWW, however, had been nearly destroyed in the previous two years by local [[criminal syndicalism]] laws, the federal government, and vigilante violence. It attempted to take credit for some of the strikes, but in reality was too weak to play a significant role. The post-war [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] intensified the attacks on the IWW and by the end of 1919 the IWW was practically powerless.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 999&amp;ndash;1000, Darlington 2008, pg. 162&amp;ndash;163, Dubofsky 1969, pg. 452&amp;ndash;456.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 Canada was hit by a [[Canadian Labour Revolt|labor revolt]], leading to the formation of One Big Union, which was only partly industrial unionist.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson 1990, pg. 221, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IWA===
Though the Bolsheviks suppressed syndicalism in Russia, they courted syndicalists abroad as part of their international strategy. In March 1919, the [[Comintern]] or Third International was [[1st Congress of the Comintern|founded at a conference in Moscow]]. The Bolsheviks acknowledged syndicalism's opposition to socialist reformism and saw them as part of the revolutionary wing of the labor movement. No syndicalists attended the founding convention, mainly because the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|blockade of Russia]] by the Allies powers made travel to Moscow near impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 100&amp;ndash;101, 104, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After long discussions, the CNT opted to join the Comintern, though it classified its adherence as provisional as a concession to detractors of Bolshevism. USI also decided to join, though some like Borghi had reservations about the course of events in Russia. In France, the CGT's radical minority that had opposed the war enthusiastically supported Bolshevism. They formed the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] and attempted to push the CGT as a whole to support the Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 112&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt; The General Executive Board of the IWW decided join the Comintern, but this decision was never confirmed by a convention.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2017, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; German and Swedish syndicalists were more critical of Bolshevism from the start. Rocker declared already in August 1918 that the Bolshevik regime was "but a new system of tyranny" and they clashed on a number of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 116, 122, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|second congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 was attended by numerous syndicalists. The Italian USI, the Spanish CNT, the British shop stewards, and the revolutionary minority of the CGT had official representatives, but others like [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] of the American IWW and [[Augustin Souchy]] of the German FAUD also attended in an unofficial capacity. Western syndicalists' knowledge of the facts on the ground in Russia was at this point rather limited. They thought of the soviets as organs of workers' control over production and the Bolsheviks depicted them as such. Syndicalists were not aware of the extent to which they were in reality subordinated to the communist party. The congress, however, revealed the irreconcilable differences between the syndicalist and the Bolshevik approach.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 126&amp;ndash;129, 132, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the congress, at a meeting of the Comintern's Executive Committee a document, a document was proposed that derided the apolitical unions as "lackeys of imperialist capitalism" for their betrayal during the war, to which syndicalists replied that of the syndicalist unions this only applied to the CGT.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 132&amp;ndash;133.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[International Workers' Association]], formed in 1922, is an international syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. At its peak, it represented millions of workers and competed directly for the hearts and minds of the working class with social democratic unions and parties.

==Decline==
From the early 1920s, syndicalist movements in most countries began to wane. State repression played a significant role, but movements that were not suppressed also declined. Faced with this decline, syndicalist organizations had three choices: They could stay true to their revolutionary principles and be marginalized. They could give up those principles in order to adapt to new conditions. Finally, they could disband or merge into non-syndicalist organizations. The IWW is an example of the first case. The French CGT, which according to van der Linden and Thorpe was no longer syndicalist after 1914, went the second route.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 4&amp;ndash;5, 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Swedish SAC initially chose the first option, but as an increasing number of workers left to join the mainstream unions, it changed course and became increasingly reformist. For example, in the 1930s unemployment funds were set up in Sweden, managed by unions but with significant contributions from the state. The SAC initially refused to participate, but the ensuing loss in membership forced the SAC to give in. SAC membership then started to slowly rise.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 18&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;}} By the end of the 1930s, meaningful legal syndicalist organizations existed only in Bolivia, Chile, Sweden, and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2018, pg. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascism===
[[Georges Sorel]] played a role in shaping the views of [[Benito Mussolini]] and by extension the wider [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascist]] movement. In March 1921, Sorel wrote that Mussolini was "a man no less extraordinary than Lenin".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Talmon|J. L. Talmon]], ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization in the 20th Century'', (University of California Press, 1981), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; After Sorel's death in 1922, [[Agostino Lanzillo]], a one-time syndicalist leader who had become a fascist, wrote in the Italian fascist review ''Gerarchia'', which was edited by Mussolini: "Perhaps fascism may have the good fortune to fulfill a mission that is the implicit aspiration of the whole oeuvre of the master of syndicalism: to tear away the proletariat from the domination of the Socialist party, to reconstitute it on the basis of spiritual liberty, and to animate it with the breath of creative violence. This would be the true revolution that would mold the forms of the Italy of tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'',(Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Civil War===
The [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|anarcho-syndicalist revolution]] during the Spanish Civil War resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, [[Aragon]], [[Andalusia]] and parts of the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]]. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control—in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%.
&lt;!-- Still need good sources --&gt;

===Reasons===
Syndicalism's decline was the result of a number of factors. In Russia, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, syndicalist movements were suppressed by authoritarian governments. The IWW in the United States and the Mexican House of the World Worker were weakened considerably by state repression. Syndicalist movements that were not suppressed also declined. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, this was primarily the result of the integration of the working class into capitalist relations. Proletarian families became units of individualized consumption as standards of living increased. This was partly the result of state intervention, particularly the emergence of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Avenues for social reform opened up and the franchise was widened, giving parliamentary reformism legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 177&amp;ndash;179.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena agrees that the state's growing influence in society was decisive for syndicalism's diminished influence. In addition to the welfare state, he refers to the increased significance of national policies, which eroded local autonomy. This made centralized unions able to negotiate national agreements more important and national and parliamentary politics more enticing for workers. They therefore turned to social democracy in larger numbers. Additionally, syndicalism lost out to sports and entertainment in the cultural sphere, according to Altena.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 217&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vadim Dam'e adds to this that the development of capitalist production and changes in the division of labor diminished syndicalism's recruitment base.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; According to authors like Stearns, Edward Shorter, [[Charles Tilly]], and Bob Holton, who deem syndicalism a transitional form of workers' resistance between older craft-based and modern factory-based industry, syndicalism's decline was a product of that transition having been completed and workers being assimilated to capitalist factory discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 158&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington counters that syndicalism attracted a variety of workers, not just artisans and skilled workers, but concedes that such changes did play a role in Spain, France, and some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 159&amp;ndash;160&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors claim that syndicalism's demise was the result of workers' inherent pragmatism or conservatism, causing them to only be interested in immediate material gains, rather than long-term goals like overthrowing capitalism. [[Robert Hoxie]], [[Selig Perlman]], and Patrick Renshaw invoke this argument to explain the IWW's decline and Stearns, [[Dermot Keogh]], and [[G. D. H. Cole]] do so with respect to French, Irish, and British syndicalism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 145&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington disputes the assumption that workers are incapable of developing a revolutionary consciousness. Seeking material gains is not incompatible, he claims, with developing class consciousness, which entails the awareness that workers' material interests conflict with capitalism, particularly in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 151&amp;ndash;152.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many Marxists, syndicalism was a reaction to reformism in the labor movement and could not survive without it. The collapse of reformism after the war therefore automatically weakened syndicalism. According [[Eric Hobsbawm]], the biggest reason for syndicalism's decline, however, was the rise of communism. Several communist parties drew their cadres from the syndicalists' ranks. To radical workers the programmatic distinctions between syndicalism and communism were not all that relevant. The key is that after the war communism represented militancy or revolutionary attitude as such.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm 1973, pg. 69, 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington, too, sees the effects of the Russian Revolution as an important reason for the decline of syndicalism. The emergence of communism highlighted syndicalism's inherent weaknesses: the contradiction of building organizations that sought to be both revolutionary cadre organizations and mass labor unions, the emphasis on economic struggle to the detriment of political action, and the commitment to localism limiting its ability to provide an effective centralized organization and leadership. Bolshevism's overcoming of these limitations and its success in Russia drew syndicalist leaders and members. It also exacerbated splits within the syndicalist camp.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War put an end to syndicalism as a mass movement.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 3, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after World War II, there were attempts to rekindle anarcho-syndicalism in Germany, but they were thwarted by Cold War anti-communism, [[Stalinism]], and a failure to attract newer younger activists.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 348, Bock 1976, pg. 173&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists maintained some influence in Latin American labor movements into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1968 protests|protest movements]] of the late 1960s saw renewed interest in syndicalism by activists in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1976, pg. 253, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; the US,&lt;ref&gt;Buhle 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Travis 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, in communist Poland, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarność''), though not strictly syndicalist, attracted masses of dissident workers by reviving many syndicalist ideas and practices.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MITING CNT MONTJUÏC.jpg|thumb|right|The Spanish anarchist [[Federica Montseny]] addressing a CNT meeting in Barcelona in 1977 attended by about 300,000 people&lt;ref&gt;Ealham 2015, pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The IWA exists to this day, but with very little influence. At most, it is a "flicker of history, the custodian of doctrine" according to Wayne Thorpe.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1990, pg. 257&amp;ndash;258.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its member organizations is the British [[Solidarity Federation]], which was formed in 1994, but has roots going back to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Barberis/McHugh/Tyldesley 2000, pg. 167&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the German [[Free Workers' Union]] (''Freie Arbeiterinnen- und Arbeiter-Union'', FAU). It was formed to carry on the FAUD's tradition in 1977, but has a membership of just 350 as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Drücke 2011, pg. 39, Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz 2011, pg. 165&amp;ndash;166.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has several syndicalist federations, including the CNT, which is still part of the IWA and has around 50,000 members as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Cleminson 2012, pg. 412&amp;ndash;413, Pascual 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; After being defeated in the Civil War, tens of thousands of CNT militants went into exile, mostly in France. In exile, the organization atrophied, with just 5,000 mostly older members by 1960. During [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain's transition to democracy]], the CNT was revived with a peak membership of over 300,000 in 1978. However, it was soon weakened, first by accusations of having been involved in the [[Scala affair|bombing of a nightclub]], then by a schism.&lt;ref&gt;Ealham 2015, pg. 122, 180&amp;ndash;181, 212&amp;ndash;215.&lt;/ref&gt; Members who favored participation in state-sponsored union elections left and formed an organization they would eventually name the [[General Confederation of Labour (Spain)|General Confederation of Labor]] (''Confederación General del Trabajo'', CGT). Despite these concessions, the CGT still views itself as an anarcho-syndicalist organization and has around 100,000 members as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Ealham 2015, pg. 215&amp;ndash;216, Pascual 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Darlington, syndicalism left a legacy that was widely admired by labor and political activists in a number of countries. For example, the IWW song "[[Solidarity Forever]]" became part of the American labor movement's canon. The strike wave, including the recruitment of unskilled and foreign-born workers by the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], that swept the United States in the 1930s followed in the IWW's footsteps. The tactic of the [[sit-down strike]], made famous by the [[United Auto Workers]] in the [[Flint sit-down strike]], was pioneered by Wobblies in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 278&amp;ndash;279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stearns, in his study of French syndicalism, concludes that it was a dismal failure. The radicalism of syndicalist labor leaders, he claims, shocked French workers and the government and thereby weakened the labor movement as a whole. Syndicalism was most popular among workers not yet fully integrated into modern capitalist industry, but most French workers had adapted to this system and accepted it, according to Stearns. Therefore, syndicalism was not able to seriously challenge prevailing conditions or even scare politicians and employers.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1971, pg. 103&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both organizations had strong ties with the Protestant and liberal [[pillarization|pillar]], respectively.

The federation chose not to adopt a new name, but instead use the well-known acronyms of its constituent organizations.

==Activities==
The most important function of VNO-NCW is the CAO-talks, over wages and secondary working conditions, it holds with the [[trade union]]s. It also advises government via the [[Social Economic Council]] in which other employers' organizations, trade unions, and government-appointed experts also have seats.

==Organization==
VNO-NCW is the national [[employers' federation]], it has 160 [[Industry trade group|branch organizations]] as members, these organize 115,000 [[company|companies]]. This includes 80% of the smaller corporations and nearly all larger businesses.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt;

The VNO-NCW has got a General Board and Board. The general board meets six times a year, and sets the general policy. The Board manages the daily operation of VNO-NCW. The current chair is Bernard Wientjes. The last chairs of the organization have been member of either the liberal [[VVD]] or the [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]].

Several formally independent regional employers' associations, VNO-NCW North, VNO-NCW West, the Employers' Association of [[North Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Zeeland]], and the Employers' Association of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], cooperate with VNO-NCW.

The organization publishes ''Forum'', its own magazine. AWVN is an advisory organization linked to VNO-NCW specialized in [[labour relations]]. De Baak is an educative institution for leadership, entrepreneurship and professionals who seek for inspiration, personal development, knowledge, and insights. Evolved from the largest employer’s organization in the Netherlands (the VNO-NCW – also known as "the voice" of Dutch business).

In 2005, WMCLV announced plans for completion of an expansion increasing the space to a total of {{convert|12000000|sqft|abbr=on}} complete with [[skywalk]]s between all buildings on all levels.

Building A opened in May 2005 with {{convert|1300000|sqft|abbr=on}}.

The first show, July 21–25, 2005, was so overbooked that it used space in three Pavilions (huge [[tent]] [[structure]]s) and the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]].

Construction started on the 16 story, {{convert|1600000|sqft|abbr=on}} Building B in 2005. It opened in January 2007.

Construction on the 16 story, {{convert|2100000|sqft|abbr=on}} Building C started on September 27, 2006 and completed July 2008.  The first 2 floors are part of the [[#Las Vegas Design Center|Las Vegas Design Center]].

At a construction cost of $550 million, Building C stands with {{convert|130000|sqft|abbr=on}} on each floor, which is nearly 30 percent larger than those in Buildings A and B. In all, more than 400 showrooms comprise Building C.  In conjunction with the opening of Building C, a $60-million, seven-story [[parking garage]] with {{convert|175000|sqft|abbr=on}} on each level also opened in July 2008.

In 2008, World Market Center put plans on hold to finish its complex of buildings, originally slated to be about 12 million square feet and set for completion by 2013.

World Market Center is owned by International Market Centers, L.P. (IMC). On May 3, 2011, [[Bain Capital]], [[Oaktree Capital Management]], [[The Related Companies]], and other investors announced the formation of International Market Centers, a venture that combines properties in High Point and Las Vegas and would control 11.5 million square feet of showroom space. At that point, two of the World Market Center buildings and two of the [[High Point Market|High Point]] showroom complexes had been in receivership for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/539401-Key_Events_Leading_to_Launch_of_International_Market_Centers.php?intref=sr|title=Key events leading to Launch of International Market Centers|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Furniture Today|author=Furniture Today Staff|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a deal completed September 26, 2017,&lt;ref name=Complete&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/group-completes-purchase-of-owner-of-high-point-showrooms/article_d60aecf2-cf3c-5deb-83d7-bbdd6691c969.html|title=Group completes purchase of owner of High Point showrooms|last=Craver|first=Richard|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone Real Estate Partners, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities and Fireside Investments purchased IMC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/owner-of-high-point-las-vegas-furniture-markets-agree-to/article_23468275-b078-5716-8e0c-55c054987f5c.html|title=Owner of High Point, Las Vegas furniture markets agree to sell properties |last=Craver|first=Richard|work=[[News &amp; Record]]|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time owned  5.4 million square feet in three Las Vegas locations.&lt;ref name=Complete/&gt;
