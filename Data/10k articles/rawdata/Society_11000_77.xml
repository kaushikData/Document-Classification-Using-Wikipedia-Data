      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Acrotomophilia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκρότομος "having the top cut off" (from ἄκρον ''akron'' "extremity" and -τομος ''-tomos'' from τέμνω ''temno'' "I cut") and φιλία ''philia'' "love") is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual expresses strong sexual interest in [[amputee]]s. It is a counterpart to ''[[apotemnophilia]]'', the sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee.

==Overview==
Acrotomophiles may be attracted to [[amputee]]s because they like the way they look or they may view the amputee’s stump as a [[phallic]] object which can be used for [[sexual pleasure]]. Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an [[amputee]].

==Interests and behaviours==
In a survey of acrotomophiles, leg amputations were preferred over arm amputations, amputations of a single limb over double amputations, and amputations that left a stump over amputations that left no stump.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D. (1983). An erotic attraction to amputees. ''Sexuality and Disability, 6,'' 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.”&lt;ref&gt;Solvang, P. (2007). The amputee body desired: Beauty destabilized? Disability re-valued? ''Sexuality and Disability, 25,'' 51–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Jung]]ian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective subconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.

==Ethical issues==
Some people question whether amputating one's own body parts or operating on a partner for the sake of sexual pleasure is ethical. For some, modifying the body is a private ritual of self-ownership and freedom of choice. Psychiatrists may make a diagnosis of [[Body integrity identity disorder]] (B.I.I.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Marantz Henig. (March 22, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/health/psychology/22ampu.html At War With Their Bodies, They Seek to Sever Limbs]. [[The New York Times]]. Retrieved: 2008.02.08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fleshbot.com (March 22, 2005) [http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223070910/http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php |date=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term ''amelotatism'' has also been used to describe acrotomophilia.  The sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee is ''[[apotemnophilia]]''.&lt;ref name=money&gt;[[John Money]], Kent W. Simcoe. 1984. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k731445740p1g7q8/ Sexuality and Disability Journal. "Acrotomophilia, sex and disability: New concepts and case report".]  Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0146-1044 (Print) 1573-6717 (Online).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice M. Irvine]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA4 Disorders of Desire: Sexuality And Gender In Modern American Sexology]. {{ISBN|1-59213-151-4}}. (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; John Money (1977) used the terms ''autoapotemnophilia'' and ''alloapotemnophilia'' to describe the erotic interest of wanting to be or appear as an amputee versus wanting amputees as sexual partners;&lt;ref&gt;Money, J., Jobaris, R., &amp; Furth, G. (1977). Apotemnophilia: Two cases of self demand amputation as a sexual preference. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 13'', 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt; neither term has been widely used since. The term ''teratophilia'' is used to describe arousal from deformed or monstrous people.&lt;ref name = Aggrawal2008&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=Teratophilia&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Teratophilia | title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | last=Aggrawal | first=Anil | authorlink=Anil Aggrawal | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | year=2008 | ISBN=1-4200-4308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:DelawareCountryUGRR.png|thumb|200px|right|The River-to-Lake-Freedom Trail used for transporting slaves generally follows the present-day alignment of U.S. Route 23.]]

On August 5, 1846, the university's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], delivered his [[inauguration|inaugural address]]. He maintained that the college was a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the people of [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]], and it was fortunate that Ohio Wesleyan was founded in a community divided in religious and political opinions; Thomson believed that the friction of a mixed society prevented [[dogma]]tism and developed energy. The spirit of the college, he said, is the spirit of liberty.&lt;ref name="Hubbart22"&gt;Hubbart, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson stated in the early days of Wesleyan that a college education should be a barrier to avarice by furnishing "the understanding, the taste, and the perspective that directs us to life's higher purposes ... It would serve political tranquillity, both by accrediting the truly apt candidates for office and by creating citizenry astutely able to assert its liberty against any government's tendency to encroach".&lt;ref&gt;Burtchaell, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson was frequently vocal in the national political debates of his time, notably [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Manifest Destiny|expansion]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="1850issues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253|title=Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=2005-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413133931/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253|archive-date=2005-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857 he denounced the argument that [[Southern United States|southern]] [[Christianity|Christians]] 
The [[Underground Railroad]], used as a "transportation system" for anti-slavery activists to free black slaves fleeing from the South to Canada, was extensively utilized in Ohio. In the 19th century, Ohio had one of the most active Underground Railroad operations in the nation.&lt;ref name="underground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohioundergroundrailroad.org/Marker_Trail.htm |title=River-To-Lake Freedom Trail |publisher=Friends of Freedom Society, Inc. |accessdate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626115920/http://www.ohioundergroundrailroad.org/Marker_Trail.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the state's most frequently used corridors on the Underground Railroad passed through Delaware County near Ohio Wesleyan University, now marked along the bikeway trail at U.S. Routes 23 and 36 in the city of Delaware.&lt;ref name="undergroundtrailowu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/dist6/pdfs/UGRR/RTLFT_brochure_web.pdf|title=The River-to-Lake Freedom Trail |format=PDF |publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation |accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Boynton Harbert]] (class of 1864), a [[women's suffrage]] activist, published several books on [[feminism|women's issues]] and suffrage, ''Out of Her Sphere'' and ''The Woman's Kingdom'', and was the chief editor of a women's suffrage newspaper, ''The New Era'', in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Rakow, Lana (1990). ''The Revolution in words: Righting Women 1868–1871'', page 263. Toronto, Ontario: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-25689-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite women's suffrage being a controversial issue, Harbert became an associate president of the World's Unity League, vice-president of the Woman's Civic League of Pasadena, vice-president of the Southern California Woman's Press Association, and president of the National Household Economic Association.&lt;ref name="harbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~sch00405 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902210306/http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~sch00405 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-02 |title=Harbert, Elizabeth Boynton, b. 1845.

==Early 20th century: the effect of wars and politics==

&lt;!--commenting this out as the image is redlinked [[Image:RobinsonRickey.jpg|thumb|200px|right|On October 23, 1945, [[Branch Rickey]], an OWU grad, officially signed a contract with [[Jackie Robinson]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].]]--&gt;

[[Branch Rickey]], a 1903 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan, is regarded as a significant figure in the history of professional [[baseball]] for breaking the sport's [[baseball color line|racial barrier]].&lt;ref name="racialbarrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/sports/special/barriers/rickey.html |title=Rickey's moral conviction to social progress was mightier than dollar |work=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524170110/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/sports/special/barriers/rickey.html |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An racial incident early in Rickey's life when he was as a baseball coach for Ohio Wesleyan in 1910 would play an important role in his decision thirty years later. Rickey's team visited a hotel in South Bend, Indiana, where the hotel manager refused to provide a room for Rickey's black baseball player Charley Thomas. Rickey eventually convinced the manager to allow him to share his own room with Thomas. Rickey recalled Thomas rubbing at his hands, ashamed of the color of his skin and vowed, "Charley, the day will come when they won't have to be white."&lt;ref name="rickeyearlyOWU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/lessonplans/hs_in_robinson_rickey.htm |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: Interview Essa |publisher=Jim Crow Gateway |accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228095035/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/lessonplans/hs_in_robinson_rickey.htm |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 Rickey became president and [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].&lt;ref name="racialbarrier2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rickeybranch.shtml |title=Rickey, "Branch" (Wesley Branch) |publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061030034113/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rickeybranch.shtml |archivedate=2006-10-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 1946 signing of African American player [[Jackie Robinson]] for the Dodgers, Rickey became renowned for his role in the racial integration of the game. Rickey's feelings on integration were a primary motivating factor in his decision.&lt;ref name="racialbarrier" /&gt;

In the [[World War I|war years]] of 1917–1919, the break between the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]] struck a military tone on campus. Individual students were volunteering in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], in the [[Canadian Forces]], and other forms of service.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; As America entered World War I the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] inaugurated the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Students' Army Training Corps]], a program designed to use existing colleges and universities as training facilities for new military personnel. On the morning of October 1, 1918, about 150,000 college boys on US campuses transformed into student soldiers. This was the induction into the Students' Army Training Corps. In Delaware, on campus, approximately 400 students were given the [[oath of allegiance]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The men received the regular army training and academic instruction prescribed by the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department. The mode of student activities changed: campus traditions were put aside, and athletic events were cancelled throughout the fall semester of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbart, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus climate in the swinging sixties==
In 1966, students established an [[Upward Bound]] program, funded by the [[Economic Opportunity Act]] of 1964, to help prepare students from lower-income and poverty areas for college.&lt;ref name="upwardbound"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upward.owu.edu/ |title=Upward Bound Program |publisher=Upward Bound Office |accessdate=2005-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211191609/http://upward.owu.edu/ |archivedate=2004-12-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Castle, the Early Childhood Center, the Big Pal/Little Pal Program, the Andrews House, the Office of Community Service, and the International Ambassador High School Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community in Delaware.

Elden Smith, Wesleyan's 11th president, appointed a commission in 1968 to study student life and to refine and further edit Wesleyan's previously too-broad Statement of Aims.&lt;ref name="Burtchaell311"&gt;Burtchaell, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's report recommended four criteria that OWU's educators should foster: perception, critical judgement, enjoyment, and active responsibility for the problems of society.&lt;ref name="Burtchaell311" /&gt; On "active responsibility for the problems of society", the report stated, "A socially concerned individual who had no capacity for enjoyment, who exercised glib and trite rather than critical judgement, and who had no perception of reality, would be a public menace. Perhaps this is the meaning of 'do-gooder'. On the other hand, the absence of active responsibility for social problems might degenerate into obsession with self, and that perception might become dilettantism."&lt;ref name="Burtchaell311" /&gt;

In 1969, the Commission on Student Life drafted a new form of student life.&lt;ref name="Murchland74"&gt;Murchland, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; It formed the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs (WCSA) with the right to decide basic policies on matters related to student life.&lt;ref name="Murchland74" /&gt; The group was controversial from the start: more than two hundred students held a sit-in at the student union to gain faculty approval for issues-oriented representation.&lt;ref name="Murchland74" /&gt; WCSA became involved in the first major controversy on the Wesleyan campus in the 1960s: its representatives called for the elimination of academic credit and existence for [[ROTC]] and demanded access to the University's budget and general financial statements.&lt;ref name="Murchland74" /&gt;

==Vietnam War and Wenzlau controversy==
The escalation of the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1960s had a significant impact on Ohio Wesleyan students. A small minority had been concerned with the war for several years, but the bombing of [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in August 1964 raised campus-wide awareness almost overnight.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War, so distant, became a huge presence on campus, affected ideas of community, student power, and free speech, and influenced daily decisions like class choices and social interactions. The first stirrings of [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protest against the war]] occurred in late 1964. In December, the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs voted to send a letter to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] opposing the expansion of the war and advocating withdrawal. Opposing expansion was a fairly moderate position, but calling for withdrawal was much more radical.&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, pp. 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesleyan was the first college campus in the country to demonstrate against President [[Richard Nixon]]'s decision to invade [[Cambodia]] on April 30, 1970.&lt;ref name="Murchland77"&gt;Murchland, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Following the demonstration, two hundred students occupied the Air Force [[ROTC]] building on campus to protest both the war and the awarding of academic credit for ROTC participation.&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt; The ROTC was seen as an extension of the "Pentagon's war machine."&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt;

President Wenzlau, then the president of OWU, attempted to disperse the protesters but was shouted down.&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt; The students demanded that the school hold a campus referendum on the issue of ROTC campus disbandment and that the vote be binding on university policy.&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt;

Wenzlau called for an emergency faculty meeting on May 1, 1970.&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt; The faculty body, surrounded by more than 300 students, decided to hold a faculty meeting later in the month when the entire faculty body would be present. The faculty meeting authorized sending a telegram to Nixon demanding an immediate unilateral cease-fire for all US troops in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Murchland77" /&gt;

The student referendum was held on May 22, 1970. The student body was split on the issue of ROTC, while 67 percent voted to censure the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Murchland, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in college affairs in the 1970s==
OWU students continued to demand more say in university affairs, in addition to making a strong stand on national issues.&lt;ref name="Murchland79"&gt;Murchland, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Wesleyan Council for Student Affairs and the administration battled over appropriate wording for alcohol and visitation policies. Several hundred students staged a "drink-in" at the MUB (the student union) in 1971.&lt;ref name="Murchland79" /&gt; In the spring of 1971, students set up a tent community called "The People's Park" in front of Sturges Hall to protest housing policies.&lt;ref name="Murchland79" /&gt; Students became involved in decisions on several faculty tenure denials, the academic schedule, and plans for a new gymnasium. Starting in 1970, the Board of Trustees approved a student seat on its board, which was to be filled every three years.&lt;ref name="Murchland79" /&gt;

==On racial equality again==
Mary King, class of 1963, worked alongside the Reverend Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the U.S. [[civil rights movement]] when she was a young student, and was a member of the staff of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name="maryking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.owu.edu/2004/mlk.html|title=Mary King |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend Martin Luther King frequently spoke in the U.S. against the [[South Africa]]n government in the 1960s, urging Americans to end [[trade]] and [[investment]]s in that country.&lt;ref name="againstapartheid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novartisfoundation.com/en/publications/proceedings/human/symposium_human_rights/summary/human_rights_apartheid_experience.htm |title=Human Rights and Business: The Apartheid Experience |publisher=Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development |accessdate=2006-12-07|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061126104537/http://www.novartisfoundation.com/en/publications/proceedings/human/symposium_human_rights/summary/human_rights_apartheid_experience.htm|archivedate= 26 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following political activity by South Africa's blacks in 1985, the government &lt;!--which govt?--&gt;declared a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="againstapartheidemergency"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/a42r023.htm |title=Policies of apartheid of the Government of South Africa |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resurgence of campus activism regarding racism existing elsewhere in the world came in response to David Warren's, the 13th president, involvement in the issue.&lt;ref name="Burtch312"&gt;Burtchaell, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; In his inauguration Warren stated: "If there is one phrase which I believe best characterizes our Wesleyan education, it is: 'Here I stand.' Within these three words of Martin Luther—'Here I stand'—is compressed the whole of our historical endeavor..."&lt;ref name="Burtch312"&gt;Burtchaell, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the most organized campus movement was against investments in companies doing business in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Murchland88"&gt;Murchland, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1987, student political action had brought Ohio Wesleyan to pledge to fully [[divestment|divest]] any holdings connected to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Vellela(1988). ''New Voices: Student Political Activism in the '80s and '90s''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: South End Press. pp. 20-21, {{ISBN|0-89608-341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The OWU Committee on Divestment was organized in 1988 and funded many activities related to its cause. It sponsored an Anti-Apartheid Week, candlelight vigils, and protest marches. One event which drew a lot of media attention was the 1988 demonstration before the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="Murchland88" /&gt; Students carried a black and white paper chain as they climbed up the student union ballroom. As their leader announced "Divest!", students broke the symbolic paper chain.

==Recent activism==

'''Afro-Surinamese people''' are the inhabitants of [[Suriname]] of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry. They are descended from slaves brought to work on sugar plantations. Many of them escaped the plantations and formed independent settlements together, becoming known as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]]. They maintained vestiges of African culture and language. 

== Origins ==
Most of the slaves imported to Suriname came from [[Central Africa]] (more than 66,900 slaves, 31.6% of the total number), [[Ghana]] (more than 53,000, 25% of the total) and [[Bight of Benin]] (more than 34,700, 16.4% of the total). Thousands of slaves also arrived from [[Senegambia]] (more than 1,300, 0.7% of the total) and the current [[Sierra Leone]] (more than 1,400, 0.7% of the total),  [[Windward Coast]] (more than 7,520, 3.6% of the total) and [[Bight of Biafra]] (more than 4,300, 2.1% of the total).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The [[Akan people|Akans]] from the central [[Ghana]] were, officially, the predominant slave group in Suriname. However, in practice, slaves from [[Loango Kingdom|Loango]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UTXE8ZXTVAYC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Identidades+en+juego,+identidades+en+guerra,+pagina+49&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2EzSDV2ri&amp;sig=ukdBB2svkLP4-2yF7GcQPnoOeQU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPfrUbmLGbOQ7AaW4ICIAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Identidades%20en%20juego%2C%20identidades%20en%20guerra%2C%20pagina%2049&amp;f=false Identidades en juego, identidades en guerra] (in Spanish: Identities at stake, identities at war) - Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; purchased in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], [[Angola]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revista-batey.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126:mami-wata-diosa-de-la-migracion-africana&amp;catid=9:volumen-iii-2012 Batey: una revista cubana de Antropología sociocultural (in Spanish: Cuban magazine of Culture Anthropology) Mami Wata, Diosa de la Migración Africana]&lt;/ref&gt; were the largest group of slaves in Suriname since 1670; they surpassed the number on the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] in almost all periods. Enslaved people including the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] (who live in southern Ghana, [[Togo]] and Benin), [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] (from [[Benin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/ciencias/351104/los-genes-narran-la-rebelion-de-los-esclavos Publico.es: Los genes narran la rebelión de los esclavos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214160036/http://www.publico.es/ciencias/351104/los-genes-narran-la-rebelion-de-los-esclavos |date=December 14, 2010 }} (in Spanish: Genes tell the Revolt of the slaves). Posted by Núñez Domínguez.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Kongo people|Kongo]] (who live in the [[Republic of Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Angola]]), all left their cultural footprints in Suriname.

== History==
The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were involved in the slave trade during the early colonial years. They sought office space for their plantations. The space they received was when the British in the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]] gave land on the northern coast of South America, ceded to them in exchange for [[Province of New York|New York]]. Suriname became a slave colony. Slaves were rapidly shipped from Africa to Suriname to work on coffee and sugar plantations for the Dutch and other Europeans.

Over time, the slaves got used to their new environment{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} and they created space for their African religion with many '[[winti]]s', spirits. Some slaves asked their spirits for help with fleeing from the plantation.

Thus, every Saturday night under the watchful eye of the plantation owners and black overseers, dance parties were held until late into the night, to the great amusement of the slaveowners.

Afro-Surinamese scholar [[Gloria Wekker]] argues, for example, that working-class Afro-Surinamese women retained pre-colonial African cultural understandings of gender, sexuality, and spirituality. She, and other theorists, argue that African cultural retentions are found most often in Afro-diasporic communities that either had irregular contact with dominant groups of the host community or that shielded their cultural retentions from their colonizers. As Wekker observes, Surinamese slaves socialized, communicated, and communed with little white cultural, social, or linguistic interference.&lt;ref&gt;Wekker, Gloria. The Politics of Passion: Women’s Sexual Culture in the Afro-Surinamese Diaspora. Columbia University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maroons==
Escaped slaves in [[French Guiana]] and [[Suriname]] fled to the interior and joined with indigenous peoples to create several independent tribes, among them the [[Saramaka]], the [[Paramakans|Paramaka]], the [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka (Aukan)]], the [[Kwintis|Kwinti]], the [[Aluku|Aluku (Boni)]], and the Matawai. Because of their long isolation in interior Rain Forests, they maintained more African culture than did ethnic Africans in the cities. From 1972 to 1978, two American professors, S. Allen Counter and David L. Evans, made seven voyages upriver into the maroon areas. Both African Americans, they wanted to contact these communities and learn about the peoples, to see what African cultures they followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0312/031264.html Vincent Harding, "A remarkable search for roots;" ''I Sought My Brother: An Afro-American Reunion,'' by S. Allen Counter and David L. Evans], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 12 March 1982, accessed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the maroons in Suriname had begun to fight for their [[land rights]] to protect territory which they had long occupied.&lt;ref name="IAC"&gt;[http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_172_ing.pdf ''Case of the Saramaka People v. Suriname,'' Judgment of November 28, 2007], Inter-American Court of Human Rights (La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos), accessed 21 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They won an important case in 2007 at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which ruled they had rights to their traditional lands.&lt;ref name="IAC"/&gt;

The '''age of majority''' is the threshold of adulthood as recognized or declared in law. It is the moment when [[minor (law)|minor]]s cease to be considered such and assume legal control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them. Most countries set the age of majority at 18. The word ''majority'' here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to ''minority'', the state of being a minor. The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term "age of majority". The term typically refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood. The age of majority does not necessarily correspond to the mental or [[Sexual maturity|physical maturity]] of an individual.

Age of majority should not be confused with the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], [[age of consent|age of sexual consent]], [[marriageable age]], [[school-leaving age]], [[drinking age]], [[driving age]], [[voting age]], [[smoking age]], [[gambling age]], etc., which each may be independent of and set at a different age from the age of majority.

Although a person may attain the age of majority in a particular jurisdiction, they may still be subject to age-based restrictions regarding matters such as the right to vote or stand for elective office, act as a judge, and many others.

==Explanation==
Age of majority can be confused with the similar concept of the '''age of [[license]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David R. Senn|author2=Richard A. Weems|title=Manual of Forensic Odontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-5133-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC&amp;pg=PA212 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also pertains to the threshold of adulthood but in a much broader and more abstract way. As a legal term of art, "license" means "permission", and it can implicate a legally enforceable right or privilege. Thus, an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from government to do something. The age of majority, on the other hand, is legal ''recognition'' that one has grown into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornick|title=A Practical Guide to Family Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C|year=1995|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-314-04451-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C&amp;pg=PA229 229]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age of majority pertains solely to the acquisition of the legal control over one's person, decisions and actions, and the correlative termination of the legal authority of the parents (or guardian(s), in lieu of parent(s)) over the child’s person and affairs generally.

Many ages of license are correlated to the age of majority, but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts. One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities. Some ages of license are actually higher than the age of majority. For example, to purchase [[alcoholic beverages]], the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states. Another example is the voting age, which prior to the 1970s was 21 in the US, as was the age of majority in all or most states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/publications/Turn-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18, but one must be over 21 years of age to stand for election to the Houses of the [[Oireachtas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html|title=At what age can I?|publisher=Citizens Information Board (Bord um Fhaisnéis do Shaoránaigh / BFS)|accessdate=12 January 2011|location=Dublin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228220852/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Portugal the age of majority is 18, but one must be at least 25 years of age to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC |url=http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022091934/http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A child who is legally [[emancipation of minors|emancipated]] by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order. Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority.

In almost all places, minors who are married are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncoop.net/lcd/emancipation/emancipation_deliverable.pdf Statutory and Judicial Emancipation of Minors in the United States], 2001–2002 analysis by law students of [[Northeastern University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Refimprove section||date= September 2009}}
In many countries minors can be [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]]: depending on jurisdiction, this may happen through acts such as [[marriage]], attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational [[academic degree|degree]] or [[diploma]], or participating in a form of [[military service]]. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Emancipation of minors | publisher = Cornell | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emancipation_of_minors}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious law==
Religions have their own rules as to the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], when a child is regarded to be an adult, at least for ritual purposes:
*[[Islam]]: A person having reached the age of 15 or having entered puberty before that age is considered ''bulugh'' (adult).
*[[Judaism]]: 13 years of age for males ([[Bar Mitzvah]]) and 12 years of age for females ([[Bat Mitzvah]]). Such persons are considered adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The age requirement for Bar/Bat mitzvah | work = My Jewish Learning | url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-age-requirement-for-barbat-mitzvah/2/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archery''' is the art, sport, practice or skill of using a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] to [[shooting|shoot]] [[arrow]]s.&lt;ref name=Paterson17&gt;Paterson ''Encyclopaedia of Archery'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''arcus''. Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who participates in archery is typically called an '''archer''' or a ''bowman'', and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a '''toxophilite'''.&lt;ref&gt;The noun "toxophilite", meaning "a lover or devotee of archery, an archer" derives from ''[[Toxophilus]]'' by [[Roger Ascham]] —"imaginary proper name invented by Ascham, and hence title of his book (1545), intended to mean 'lover of the bow'." "toxophilite, n." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/204131&gt;; accessed 10 March 2011. Earlier version first published in ''New English Dictionary'', 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of archery}}

The bow and arrow seems to have been invented in the later [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]] periods. The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the {{Interlanguage link|Stellmoor|de}} in the {{Interlanguage link|Ahrensburg valley|de|3=Stellmoor–Ahrensburger Tunneltal}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany and dates from the late [[Paleolithic]], about 10,000–9000 BC. The arrows were made of [[pine]] and consisted of a main shaft and a {{convert|15|–|20|cm|in|abbr=off}} long fore shaft with a [[flint]] point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by [[spear-thrower]]s rather than bows. The [[Holmegaard bow|oldest bows]] known so far comes from the [[Holmegaard|Holmegård]] swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the [[spear-thrower]] as the predominant means for launching shafted [[projectiles]], on every continent except [[Australasia]], though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the [[Inuit]].

Bows and arrows have been present in [[Egypt]]ian &amp; neighboring [[Nubia]]n culture since its respective [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] &amp; [[Pre-Kerma]] origins. In the [[Levant]], artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the [[Natufian culture]], (c. 10,800–8,300 BC) onwards. The [[Khiamian]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPN A]] shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] civilizations, notably the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[History of Armenia|Armenians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[History of India|Indians]], [[History of Korea|Koreans]], [[History of China|Chinese]], and [[History of Japan|Japanese]] fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] were the first to use [[composite bows]] in war according to the victory stele of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zutterman|first=C.|date=2003|title=The bow in the Ancient Near East. A re-evaluation of archery from the late 2nd Millennium to the end of the Achaemenid empire|url=|journal=Iranica Antiqua|volume= XXXVIII|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians referred to [[Nubia]] as "Ta-Seti," or "The Land of the Bow," since the Nubians were known to be expert archers, and by the 16th Century BC Egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mc Leod|first=W.E.|date=Jan 1962|title=Egyptian Composite Bows in New York|url=|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume= 66,|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archery was highly developed in [[Asia]]. The [[Sanskrit]] term for archery, [[dhanurveda]], came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, [[Goguryeo]], one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of the Later Han]] [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%BE%8C%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B785]"句驪一名貊耳有別種依小水為居因名曰小水貊出好弓所謂貊弓是也"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koreantrad"&gt;{{citation|title=Korean Traditional Archery|last1=Duvernay|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Duvernay|first2=Nicholas Y.|publisher=Handong Global University|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mounted archery===
{{Main|Mounted archery}}
[[File:Maximilian 1470.png|thumb|Hunting for flying birds from the back of a galloping horse was considered the top category of archery. The favorite hobby of Prince [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], engraved by [[Dürer]] ]]
Central Asian [[tribesmen]] (after the [[domestication of the horse]]) and American [[Plains Indians]] (after gaining access to horses)&lt;ref&gt;[[T. R. Fehrenbach|Fehrenbach, Theodore Reed]] (1974) The Comanches: The Destruction of a People. Knopf, New York, {{ISBN|0-394-48856-3}}; republished in 2003 under the title The Comanches: The History of a People. New York: Anchor Books. {{ISBN|1-4000-3049-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became extremely adept at [[Mounted archery|archery on horseback]]. Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia. Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the [[composite bow]] enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons.&lt;ref name="HorseArchery"&gt;{{citation|title=The Horse, The Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the World|last1=Anthony|first1=David W.|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-05887-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective "barbarian" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the [[Han Dynasty]] referred to their neighbours, the [[Xiong-nu]], as "Those Who Draw the Bow".&lt;ref name="ChinaEnemies"&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient China &amp; Its Enemies: The Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History|last1=Di Cosmo|first1=Nicola|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-5217706-4-4|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them.&lt;ref name="ChinaEnemies" /&gt; It is possible that "barbarian" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their "civilized" counterparts—the Xiong-nu and the Han being one example. Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.&lt;ref name="JapanBows"&gt;{{citation|title=Armed Martial Arts of Japan: Swordsmanship and Archery|last1=Hurst III|first1=G. Cameron|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-04967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of archery===
The development of [[Gunpowder warfare|firearms]] rendered bows obsolete in warfare, although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice. In England and Wales, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Gunn, ''Archery Practice in Early Tudor England'', Past and Present, (2010) Vol. 209 (1): 53–81. {{doi|10.1093/pastj/gtq029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because it was recognised that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England and Wales, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America]], India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very sensitive to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range&lt;ref name="koreantrad" /&gt; and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Bows and arrows: deadly weapons of rural Kenya's war.

===Eighteenth-century revival===
[[File:The meeting of the Royal British Bowmen in the grounds of Erthig, Denbighshire.jpeg|thumb|A print of the 1822 meeting of the "Royal British Bowmen" archery club.]] 
Early recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The latter's annual [[Popinjay (sport)|Papingo]] event was first recorded in 1483. (In this event, archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately 30 meters above.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Club History|url=http://www.kilwinningarchers.com/about_us.php|website=Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers|access-date=24 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030330/http://www.kilwinningarchers.com/about_us.php|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Company of Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=William|title=Royal Company of Archers|url=http://yeomenoftheguard.com/company_of_archers.htm|website=Yeomen of the Queen's Body Guard|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archery remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the [[aristocracy]]. Sir [[Ashton Lever]], an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of [[George III|George, the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Toxophilite Society|url=http://www.longbow-archers.com/royaltoxophilitesociety.html|website=Longbow Archers|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and [[21 gun salute]]s for the competitors. The clubs were "the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnes |first=Martin |url=https://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 |title=Archery—Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales—c-1780-1840 Martin Johnes. Archery, Romance and Elite Culture in England and Wales, c. 1780–1840 |publisher=Swansea.academia.edu |date= |access-date=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often consciously styled in the manner of a [[Medieval]] [[tournament]] with titles and [[laurel wreath]]s being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of [[Robin Hood]] and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in [[Europe]]. The societies were also elitist, and the new [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the [[Industrialisation|preindustrial]] rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s 1819 novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |title=The Royal Company of Archers |access-date=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125050714/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |archivedate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A modern sport===
The 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first [[Grand National Archery Society]] meeting was held in [[York]] in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardized as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. [[Horace A. Ford]] helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.

[[File:Saxton Pope and grizzly.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of [[Saxton Pope]] taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone]]
Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as [[croquet]] and [[tennis]] became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the [[1900 Paris Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archery results - Pari 1900|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/gamesandsportsummary/?sport=31766&amp;games=1900%2f1&amp;event=122225|website=olympic.org|access-date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the [[Yahi#Yahi|Yahi Indian]] tribe, a native known as [[Ishi]], came out of hiding in California in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 4|last1=Allely|first1=Steve|year=2008|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-9645741-6-8|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ishi in Two Worlds: a biography of the last wild Indian in North America|last=Kroeber|first=Theodora|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|place=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24037-7|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctor, [[Saxton Pope]], learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hunting with the Bow and Arrow|last=Pope|first=Saxton|publisher= G.

===Mythology===
[[File:Vishwamitra archery training-1.jpg|thumb|[[Vishwamitra]] archery training from [[Ramayana]]]]

Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers, including the Greek [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]], the Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Cupid]], the Germanic [[Agilaz]], continuing in legends like those of [[Wilhelm Tell]], [[Palnetoke]], or [[Robin Hood]]. Armenian [[Hayk]] and Babylonian [[Marduk]], Indian [[Karna]] (also known as Radheya/son of Radha), [[Abhimanyu]], [[Eklavya]], [[Arjuna]], [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]], [[Rama]], and [[Shiva]] were known for their shooting skills. The famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the [[Mahabharata]].

Persian [[Arash (mythology)|Arash]] was a famous archer. Earlier Greek representations of [[Heracles]] normally depict him as an archer.

The Nymphai Hyperboreioi (Νύμφαι Ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of [[Artemis]], presiding over aspects of archery; Hekaerge (Ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, Loxo (Λοξώ), trajectory, and Oupis (Οὖπις), aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHyperboreiai.html |title=Nymphai Hyperboreioi at Theoi Greek Mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jumong]], the first [[Taewang]] of the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer. Archery features in the story of Oguz Khagan.

In [[West Africa]]n [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief, [[Ochosi|Osoosi]] is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.

==Equipment==
===Types of bow===
{{Main|Bow and arrow}}
[[File:Pacific Yew Selfbow.jpg|thumb|Clay Hayes drawing a Pacific yew selfbow using the split finger method. Selfbows are made from a single piece of wood.]]
While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being [[self bow]]s, [[laminated bow]]s and [[composite bow]]s. Bows can also be classified by the [[shape|bow shape]] of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a [[Recurve bow#Recurve bow|recurve bow]] and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic [[longbow]] is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the [[flatbow]] has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a cross-section of a yew longbow shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part (riser) of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. [[Cable-backed bow]]s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among [[Inuit]] who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or [[Wabenaki]] bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;The Penobscot War Bow. Gordon M Day. Contributions to Canadian Ethnology 1975. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper no. 31. {{ISSN|0316-1854}}. Ottawa 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

In different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow. In [[Arab archery]], [[Turkish archery]] and [[Kyūdō]], the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow. In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.

[[File:recurve bow.jpg|thumb|right|Modern (takedown) recurve bow]]

[[Compound bow]]s are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptarchery.com/ |title=99% Let Off Bows |publisher=Concept Archery |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound bow was invented by [[Holless Wilbur Allen]] in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the [[crossbow]]. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as [[siege engine]]s.

===Types of arrows and fletchings===
{{Main|Arrow}}
The most common form of arrow consists of a [[Arrow straightener|shaft]], with an [[arrowhead]] at the front end, and [[fletching]]s and a [[Arrow#Nocks|nock]] at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a [[quiver]], which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid [[wood]], [[bamboo]], [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials, in particular the X10 and A/C/E, made by [[Easton (company)|Easton]],

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.

[[File:Spliced feather 0002.jpg|thumb|Shield cut straight fletching – here the hen [[feather]]s are barred red]]
[[Fletching]] is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is ''three-fletched'', the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the "index fletch" or "cock feather" (also known as "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is ''four-fletched'', two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either ''parabolic'' cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or ''shield'' cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as ''helical'' fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called ''[[flu-flu arrow|flu-flus]]''. Misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

===Bowstring===
{{Main|Bowstring}}
[[Dacron]] and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Several modern methods of making a bowstring exist, such as the 'endless loop' and 'Flemish twist'. Almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring. The author of ''Arab Archery'' suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.&lt;ref name="arabarchery"&gt;{{citation

===Protective equipment===
{{Main|Bracer|Finger tab|Thumb ring}}
[[File:Finger-tab hg.jpg|A right-hand finger tab to protect the hand while the string is drawn.|thumb]]
Most archers wear a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "[[brassard]]", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge. The [[Navajo people]] have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.&lt;ref name="ketoh"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; but also with [[thumb ring|special rings]] of various hard materials. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art. Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time. In traditional [[Kyūdō|Japanese archery]] a special [[yugake|glove]] is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string.&lt;ref name="Elmer R.P. pages 345-349"&gt;Elmer, R. P. ''Target Archery'' (1952), pp. 345–349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release aids===
{{Main|Release aid}}
[[File:Release-aid.jpg|thumb|right|Release aid]]
A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.

===Stabilizers===
{{Main|Stabiliser (archery)}}
Stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow. Common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.

Stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow. Sights, quivers, rests, and design of the riser (the central, non-bending part of the bow) make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.

Stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration. These energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.

Stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process. Lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of interia while minimizing the weight added.

==Shooting technique and form==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

The standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is eye dominance? Why does it matter for my first bow?|url=http://esdf.org/discover-archery/equipment/what-is-eye-dominance-why-does-it-matter-for-my-first-bow/|website=Discover Archery|publisher=Easton Foundations|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (One exception is in modern [[Kyudo]] where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deprospero|first1=Dan and Jackie|title=One Point Lessons: A collection of simple lessons and explanations of Kyudo technique|url=http://www.kyudo.com/kyudo-l.html|website=Meishin Kyudojo|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.

The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the ''bow hand'' and its arm the ''bow arm''. The opposite hand is called the ''drawing hand'' or ''string hand''. Terms such as ''bow shoulder'' or ''string elbow'' follow the same convention.

If shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.

===Modern form===

To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the "open stance" or the "closed stance" may be used, although many choose to stick with a "neutral stance". Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the '''nock''' (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called "nocking the arrow". Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.

A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. ''Instinctive'' shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Billets to Bows|last = St. Charles|first = Glenn|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0965139403|location = |pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the "thumb release", style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.

The archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last inch and a half, where the draw weight is at its maximum—before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer [[Jang Yong-Ho]]. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.

In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a "T". The archer's lower [[trapezius muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step "into the bow", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100&amp;nbsp;lbs to over 175&amp;nbsp;lbs. Heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last inch and a half, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see [[Bow draw]]), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.

==Aiming methods==
{{More citations needed|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Kyujutsu14.jpg|thumb|From ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', 1817]]
There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same [[Predicted impact point|point]]. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.

Modern archery equipment usually includes [[Sight (device)|sights]]. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called "gun barreling" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordination—which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.&lt;ref name="lehman"&gt;{{citation

'''Instinctive shooting''' is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.&lt;ref name="bear"&gt;{{citation

[[File:Mongol soldiers by Rashid al-Din 1305.JPG|thumb|Mongol archers during the time of the [[Mongol conquests]] used a smaller bow suitable for horse archery.]]

When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the [[kinetic energy]] imparted by the thrower's muscles performing [[Work (physics)|work]]. However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather [[Power (physics)|power]], which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force–velocity relationship]], and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.

When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as [[elastic potential energy]], and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.

Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when [[dry firing]]. Dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75758007/The-Physics-of-Archery-AstraZeneca-Science-Teaching-Trust |title=The Physics of Archery AstraZeneca Science Teaching Trust |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Snake Indians - Testing Bows - Walters 37194060.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snake Indians]] - testing bows, circa 1837 by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]], the [[Walters Art Museum]]]]

Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the [[archer's paradox]]. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching. The arrow's manufacturer (a "fletcher") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to "plane" on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip ("bodkinhead") to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip ("broadhead") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

==Hunting==
{{Main|Bow hunting}}
[[File:Bow compound.JPG|thumb|A modern compound hunting bow]]
Using archery to take game animals is known as "bow hunting". Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow. These compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as "[[bow fishing]]".

==Modern competitive archery==
{{Main|Modern competitive archery}}
Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called [[target archery]]. A form particularly popular in Europe and [[Americas|America]] is [[field archery]], shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105090748/http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer [[Paralympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldarchery.org/Para-Archery|title=Para Archery|website=World Archery|publisher=World Archery Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as [[archery games|archery novelty games]] and [[Modern competitive archery#Flight archery|flight archery]], where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.

'''Armenians in Germany''' are ethnic [[Armenians]] living within the modern republic of [[Germany]]. Like much of the [[Armenian diaspora]], most Armenians immigrated to Germany after the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915. Others came later, fleeing conflicts in places like [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Lebanon]]. Another influx came fleeing [[Turkish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Anti-Armenianism|persecution]] in [[Turkey]]. After [[World War II]], many [[Armenian SSR|Soviet Armenians]], former [[POW]]s in particular, fled to the American occupied areas of Germany. While many traveled on, some settled in the country, providing a base for later asylum-seekers.&lt;ref name=Bedikian&gt;[http://www.armenianreporteronline.com/old/20072002/in-bedikian.htm Armenian Reporter Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Armenian organization was the ''Armenian Colony of Berlin'', established in 1923.&lt;ref name=Bedikian/&gt; By 1975, Armenian associations would be established in [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]]. In the 1980s, other associations were created in [[Bremen]], [[Braunschweig]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Duisburg]], [[Neuwied]], [[Bonn]], [[Hanau]], [[Eppingen]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Kehl]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bedikian/&gt;

Presently, there are about 35,000 naturalized Armenians and 15,000 asylum-seeking Armenians living in Germany today. Their population is concentrated in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]], many of which are Armenian asylum-seekers from [[Armenia]], for whom the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]] provides services, baptisms, Bible readings and community support. The Diocese of Germany bears all the costs of supporting Armenians from post-Soviet Armenia and regards this service as part of its mission.&lt;ref name=Bedikian/&gt;

==Germany and the Armenian Genocide==
While the [[German parliament]] has adopted a resolution that recognizes the "organized expulsion and destruction of the Armenians", and states that "numerous independent historians, parliaments and international organizations" have recognized the [[Armenian Genocide|event as genocide]], the resolution does not state such itself. The resolution also contains an apology for Germany's role in the Genocide (The German Monarchy was an
ally of [[Ottoman Turkey]] during [[World War I]], and did not intervene despite ample evidence of a policy of extermination) and calls on Turkey to examine its role in the [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/16/news/armen.php Germans press Turks on Armenian slaughter - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This resolution is deemed significant due to the comparatively large number of 
[[Turks in Germany|Turkish nationals living in Germany]].

The '''Bangi–Ntomba languages''' are a group of [[Bantu language]]s spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. They are coded Zone C.30 in Guthrie's classification, and included the trade language [[Lingala language|Lingala]], one of four national languages of the DRC and two of the RC.

According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), apart from the Ngiri languages (to [[Ngondi–Ngiri languages|Ngondi–Ngiri]]) and [[Budza language|Budza]] (Buja), and together with a few additional languages such as Mongo-Nkundu, they form a valid node. Using Guthrie's listing, they are:

*Zamba–Binza: Losengo ([[Losengo language|Losengo]], [[Loki language|Loki/Boloki]], [[Ndolo language|Ndolo]]), [[Binza language|Binza]], [[Dzamba language|Dzamba]] (Zamba)
*Bangi–Moi: [[Bangi language|Bangi]], [[Mbompo language|Mbompo]] (Mpombo), [[Moi language (Congo)|Moi]], [[Mpama language|Mpama]] (Pama), (C20) [[Kuba language|Kuba]]

[[Lingala language|Lingala]] and [[Bangala language|Bangala]] developed as trade languages, primarily on a Bangi lexical base.

The '''Bhats''' are an Indo-Aryan clan of [[Kshatriyas]] formed through the unification of [[gotras]] of [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]], [[Agnivanshi]], [[Chandravanshi]] and [[Nagavanshi]] descent. The Bhats reside primarily in the Punjab district of [[India]].

== Genetics ==

The Bhats are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people. The main two Y-DNA haplogroups that have been identified in this community are [[R1a1]] and [[Haplogroup R2|R2]]. 

The main [[MtDNA]] haplogroups that have been identified in this community are [[haplogroup U]] and [[haplogroup M3|M3]].

A high frequency of Bhats possess light hair and light eyes; [[Blue eyes| Blue]], [[Grey eyes| Grey]], [[Eye color#Green| Green]] and [[Hazel eyes| Hazel]] eyes being prime amongst them.

== History ==

The Bhats are descended from four ancient Kshatriya lineages, originating from outside of the Punjab region. Specifically from the areas encompassing [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Sindh]] and northeast [[Gujarat]].

In the [[Vedic period]] the Kshatriya ancestors of the Bhats were nobles, soldiers and kinsmen. As the period declined so did the need for excess nobility, many Kshatriyas left to live in villages with their families- losing their positions in society, but maintaining their status.

The Bhats initially came together as a ''biradari'': an ethno-social circle unified under the religion of [[Sikhism]]. Their conversion to the faith owed to the missionary efforts of Changa Bhat Rai from whom the name of the ''bhiradari'' originates. They are also colloquially known as Bhatras.

The primary occupation of members of the ''biradari'' was to evangelise and bring converts into Sikhism through serving as missionaries. However many of the Bhats worked under other occupations; as traders, businessmen, astrologers, clairvoyants and ayurvedic healers.

However in  recent years through immigration and the social elevation enabled through education Bhats have been able to work in upper and middle-class occupations.

== Religion ==

The Kshatriyas adhered to the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], which later branched into Hinduism, the descendants of these Kshatriyas were the first Bhats, abandoning their ancestral religion circa the 16th Century AD in favour of Sikhism. 

The majority of Bhats are Sikhs however there do exist visible minorities of [[Hindu|Hindus]], [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] among populations of the community who now reside across the world.

== Culture ==

Many Bhats of the older generation who profess to be Sikhs still adhere to Vedic customs such as; avoiding the consumption of beef and bovine products, fasting on auspicious days, offering worship to deities and performing pilgrimage to sacred sites in the [[Himalayas]] and along the riverbanks of the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]].

== Clan System ==

The Bhat people are subdivided into twenty-two Kshatriya Gotras.
The Bhats are descended from four lineages.

The '''British Fantasy Society''' (BFS) was founded in 1971 as the British Weird Fantasy Society, an offshoot of the [[British Science Fiction Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishfantasysociety.org.uk/index.php/constitution/1970-1984 A History of the BFS: the Early Years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206185253/http://www.britishfantasysociety.org.uk/index.php/constitution/1970-1984 |date=February 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society is dedicated to promoting the best in the [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror (genre)|horror]] [[genre]]s.

In 2000, the BFS won the Special Award: Non-Professional at the [[World Fantasy Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2000.html 2000 World Fantasy Award Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010119084100/http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2000.html |date=2001-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The society also has its own awards, the annual [[British Fantasy Award]]s, created in 1971 at the suggestion of its president, the author [[Ramsey Campbell]]. It held its first [[Convention (meeting)|Fantasycon]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/publications/fantasycon-a-short-history/ Fantasycon: A Short History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current British Fantasy Society has no direct connection with the earlier science fiction group using the same name from 1942 to 1946.

==Publications==

The BFS currently publishes two magazines, ''BFS Horizons'', its fiction publication; and the ''BFS Journal'', its non-fiction and academic publication. Each has two issues a year, with alternating schedules. These are available in both print and electronically. It also produces a monthly members only email, which rounds up news, reviews and usually includes an exclusive short story. Previous publications include ''Prism'', which featured news, reviews and columns, ''Dark Horizons'', which featured fiction, non-fiction and poetry, and enjoyed the patronage of many established authors, artists, critics and journalists, and ''New Horizons'', issued twice a year from 2008 to 2010, which published fiction and articles, but not poetry. There was also ''Shelflings'', an ezine collecting reviews from the BFS website.

The society continues to produce a series of publications, including numbered [[chapbook]]s of works by [[William Hope Hodgson]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Peter Tremayne]], [[August Derleth]], and [[M. R. James]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishfantasysociety.org.uk/index.php/bfs-publications/bfs-booklets BFS Booklets and Chapbooks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209061307/http://www.britishfantasysociety.org.uk/index.php/bfs-publications/bfs-booklets |date=February 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines previously published include ''Winter Chills'' (later renamed ''Chills''), edited by [[Peter Coleborn]], and ''Mystique: Tales Of Wonder'', edited by [[Mike Chinn]]. Both these magazines were independent publications, but linked to the BFS, and in the case of ''Mystique'', absorbed into ''Dark Horizons'' after a few issues. Paperback titles include ''[[Clive Barker]]: Mythmaker for the Millennium'' by [[Suzanne J. Barbieri]], and ''Annabel Says'', a modern ghost story by [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]] and [[Stephen Laws]]. In 2007 it published ''HP Lovecraft in Britain: a Monograph'', written by [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]] and illustrated by [[Les Edwards]].

===''Dark Horizons''===

''Dark Horizons'', the journal of the British Fantasy Society, was published from 1971 to 2010, before being folded into the '''''British Fantasy Society Journal'''''. Its contents and subject matter varied, according to the tastes of the editors and the contents of the other magazines being published by the BFS at the same time, but generally included some combination of fantasy, science-fiction and horror-related fiction, articles, poetry and artwork.

Its editors included:

*Rosemary Pardoe, issues 1-4, 1971–72
*Adrian Cole, issues ?-6, 1973-?
*Adrian Cole and David A Sutton, issues 7-?
*[[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]]

===''The BFS Journal''===

The BFS Journal is produced biannually and collects together non-fiction articles on Fantasy, Horror and Science Fiction. These include academic papers, book and film reviews, author interviews and more. The current editor for the BFS Journal is [[Allen Stroud]], who took over from Stuart Douglas in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scififantasynetwork.com/allen-stroud-from-elite-dangerous-to-chaos-reborn/|title=Allen Stroud - From Elite: Dangerous To Chaos Reborn - Sci-fi and Fantasy Network|last=Barbini|first=Francesca T|date=2016-02-02|work=Sci-fi and Fantasy Network|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freemasons' Hall, London - Camden benches.jpg|thumb|Camden benches outside [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]] in Great Queen Street, London |250x250px]]

The '''Camden bench''' is a type of [[concrete]] [[street furniture]]. It was commissioned by the [[Camden London Borough Council]] and installed in [[Camden, London]] in 2012. It is designed specifically to influence the behaviour of the public by restricting undesirable behaviour, a principle known as [[hostile architecture]], and instead be usable only as a [[bench (furniture)|bench]]. Because the design is "defined far more by what it is not than what it is" the bench has been called the "perfect anti-object"&lt;ref name="Medium" /&gt; and a "masterpiece of unpleasant design".&lt;ref name="BBC_2Dec13" /&gt; "Feature sites" for introduction of the bench were on [[Great Queen Street]] and [[High Holborn]].&lt;ref name="FactoryFurniture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google_streetview" /&gt;

Produced by UK company Factory Furniture, the bench is designed to deter [[rough sleeping|use for sleeping]], [[littering]], [[skateboarding]], [[drug dealing]], [[graffiti]] and [[theft]].&lt;ref name=FactoryFurniture /&gt; It attempts to achieve this primarily through angular surfaces (deterring sleepers and skateboarders), an absence of crevices or hiding places, and non-permeable materials (a waterproof anti-paint coating).&lt;ref name="ianvisits" /&gt; It is not secured to the ground and can be moved by a [[crane (machine)|crane]] attaching to built-in anchor points. Due to its weight it is also designed to function as a [[roadblock]].{{fact|date=December 2016}}

A Camden bench has been used as part of an [[installation art]]work by [[Roger Hiorns]].&lt;ref name="Unpleasant" /&gt;

==Awards==
The design has achieved several awards:{{fact|date=August 2014}}
* [[Keep Britain Tidy]] "Best practice street cleansing" (2010)
* [[Design Council]] "Best practice for reducing crime" (2012)
* [[Centre for Accessible Environments]] "Best European practice for inclusive design" (2012)

It has also been accredited as:
* [[Home Office]] "PAS68 approved" (a classification for vehicle security barriers) for counter-terrorism use.

==Criticism==
The Camden bench received criticism as being a prime example of a wider trend of [[urban design]] that is anti-[[homeless]], known as [[hostile architecture]].&lt;ref name="guardian_13Jun14" /&gt; The designers contend that: "Homelessness should never be tolerated in any society and if we start designing in to accommodate homeless then we have totally failed as a society. Close proximity to homelessness unfortunately makes us uncomfortable so perhaps it is good that we feel that and recognise homelessness as a problem rather than design to accommodate it."&lt;ref name=Unpleasant /&gt;

Critics also claimed it is [[emblematic]] of a society where freedom in public space has been curtailed and deviance from accepted forms of behaviour have been made impossible.&lt;ref name = Medium /&gt; The designers claim in response: "[Because] there is no 'correct' way to sit on it... it becomes a far more inclusive seat encouraging social interaction."&lt;ref name=Unpleasant /&gt;

Popular criticism focused on subverting restrictions imposed by the bench, for example by attempting to skateboard on it.&lt;ref name="Guardian_13Jun14" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7311">The '''Canadian diaspora''' is the group of [[Canadians]] living outside the borders of Canada.  As of a 2010 report by the [[Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada]], there were 2.8 million Canadian citizens abroad (plus an unknown number of former citizens and descendents of citizens).  For comparison, that is a larger population than six of the ten Canadian provinces.  More than 9% of all Canadian citizens live outside of Canada.  That compares to 1.7% of Americans, 2.6% of Chinese citizens, 3.3% of French citizens, 4.3% of Australians, 9% of British citizens, and 21.9% of New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadians Aborad'', p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In past decades, most Canadians leaving the country have moved to the [[Canadians in the United States|United States]].  In the 1980s, [[Los Angeles]] had the fourth largest Canadian population of any city in North America, with [[New York City|New York]] close behind.  Other countries and cities have emerged as major sites of Canadian settlement, notably [[Hong Kong]], [[London]], [[Beirut]], [[Sydney]], [[Paris]], and [[Dubai]].  The population in New York experienced continued growth in the 2000s, doubling between 2000 and 2008 to 21,000, representing the eighth largest foreign-born group in the Borough of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2008/07/canadians-among-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Canadians in the United States are there without legal permission; a 2008 report by the [[Urban Institute]] estimated that "65,000 and 75,000 undocumented Canadians currently live in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2008/07/canadians-among-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Canadian populations abroad by country are:&lt;ref&gt;''Canadians Abroad'', p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens born in Canada make up about 58% of the diaspora, the other 42% being people born outside Canada who became naturalized as Canadian citizens and then moved out again, often back to their country of origin, or sometimes to a third country.  Native-born Canadians had an exit rate of about 1.33% over ten years from 1996 to 2006, compared to 4.5% for naturalized Canadians.  Most Canadians in the United States are native-born, while most Canadians in Hong Kong are naturalized Canadians who were born in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadians Abroad'', p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

For native-born Canadians, the United States is the primary destination, and the emigration rate varies substantially by ethnicity.  It is especially high among Middle Eastern, Eastern European, and South Asian Canadians, indicating that the English-speaking and well-educated [[immigrant generations|children of immigrants]] are often highly mobile.  French Canadians have the highest rate of return to Canada at 29%. Among naturalized Canadians, exit rates vary by country of origin, being highest among Canadians from typically highly developed countries (Hong Kong, United States, Taiwan, France).  Exit rates among Canada's two largest immigrant populations, Mainland Chinese and Indians, were very low during 1996 to 2006 but have risen.

British Columbians are particularly likely to go overseas, more than twice as likely as an Ontarian, and five times more likely as a Quebecer, according to a 2007 survey by ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''.  Many of these are [[Hong Kong returnees]]; the so-called "astronauts" or "[[yacht people]]" who moved to Vancouver from Hong Kong in the 1980s and 90s, but later returned.  However, two-thirds of Canadians overseas (in 2007) were Canadian-born, outnumbering returning immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=f7c5de76-9bed-4679-ab02-1021407f59e4&amp;k=11395&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians living abroad cannot vote on Canadian elections after a period of five years residing overseas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/20/no-voting-rights-for-long_n_7833162.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is also similar to other Westminster democracies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''Chuvash people''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʊ|ˈ|v|ɑː|ʃ}}; {{lang-cv|чăваш}}, {{IPA-all|t͡ɕəˈʋaʂ}}; {{lang-ru|чуваши}}, {{IPA-ru|t͡ɕʊˈvaʂɨ|pron}}) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group, native to an area stretching from the [[Volga Region]] to [[Siberia]]. Most of them live in the [[Chuvashia|Republic of Chuvashia]] and surrounding areas, although Chuvash communities may be found throughout the [[Russian Federation]].

== Etymology ==
There is no universally accepted [[etymology]] of the word ''Chuvash'', but there are two main theories that try to explain it: one suggests that the word ''Chuvash'' may be derived from Common Turkic ''jăvaš'' (‘friendly’, ‘peaceful’), as opposed to [[Cheremis|''şarmăs'']] (‘warlike’). Another theory is based on the ''[[Tabghach]]'', an early medieval [[Xianbei]] clan and founders of the [[Northern Wei dynasty]] in China. The [[Old Turkic]] name ''Tabghach'' (''Tuoba'' in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]) was used by some [[Inner Asia]]n peoples to [[names for China#Tabgach|refer to China]] long after this dynasty.  [[Gerard Clauson]] has shown that through regular sound changes, the clan name Tabghach may have transformed to the ethnonym Chuvash.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Clauson, ''Studies in Turkic and Mongolic Linguistics''. Routledge, 2002, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Chuvash woman in traditional attire 2.jpg|thumb|Chuvash woman from Ulyanovsk Oblast, mid-to-late 19th century.]]
[[File:Married Chuvash woman in costume of matchmake.jpg|thumb|200px|Married Chuvash woman in costume of matchmake.]]
There are rival schools of thought on the origin of the Chuvash people. One is that they originated from a mixing between the Turkic [[Sabir people|Sabir]] tribes of [[Volga Bulgaria]] and also according to some researches with local [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Orion M. Graf, John Mitchell, Stephen Wilcox, Gregory Livshits, and Michael H. Crawford. ''Chuvash origins: Evidence from mtDNA Markers''. (2010) "Their maternal markers appear to most closely resemble Finno-Ugric speakers rather than fellow Turkic speakers."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another theory, the Chuvash may be descended from the [[Volga Bulgars]].&lt;ref name="Krueger"&gt;John R. Krueger, ''Chuvash Manual. Introduction, Grammar, Reader, and Vocabulary'' (Hague, 1961), 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been subjected to much infusion and influence, not only from Russian and Turkic peoples, but also from neighboring [[Finnic tribes]], with whom they were persistently and mistakenly identified for centuries, perhaps aided by the fact that the Chuvash language is a highly divergent form of Turkic, and was not easily recognized as such.&lt;ref name="Krueger" /&gt; Chuvash is classified, alongside the extinct [[Bulgar language]], as the only remaining member of the [[Oghuric]] branch of the Turkic language family.

==Genetics==
Physical anthropologists using the racial frameworks of the early 20th Century saw the Chuvash as a mixed Finno-Ugric and Turkic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chuvashes|volume=6|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krueger" /&gt;

In surveys of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), haplogroups [[Haplogroup J2|J2]] (mostly J2a) and [[Haplogroup E (mtDNA)|E]] are most common among the Chuvash, followed by [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]] and [[Haplogroup R (mtDNA)#Subclades|R1a.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Tree DNA – Chuvashia DNA Project|url=https://www.familytreedna.com/public/chuvashia?iframe=yresults |publisher=familytreedna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subclades of [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups [[Haplogroup R1|R1]] and [[haplogroup N-M231|N]] are most common among the Chuvash.  According to Rootsi et al. 2004, Tambets et al. 2004 (79 samples), and Trofimova 2005 (43 samples) the following distribution of haplogroups is obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/chuvashia/about/background|title=Family Tree DNA - Genetic Testing for Ancestry, Family History &amp; Genealogy|website=www.familytreedna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Haplogroup I-M253|I1]]: 7%
*I2a2: 0–2%
*I2a1: 0–2%
*[[Haplogroup J1|J1]]: 0–2%
*J2a: 0–9%
*J2b: 0–5%
*[[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q]]: 0%
*[[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]]: 2–4%
*[[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]]: 28–32%
*[[Haplogroup N1c1|N1c1]]: 18–19%
*[[Haplogroup N1c2|N1c2]]: 9–10%
*[[E-M78]]: 0–14%
*[[Haplogroup C-M130|C]]: 0–1%
Haplogroups Q and C are rare among Chuvashes. Chuvash carriers of [[Haplogroup R1a]] (19% in hundreds of samples) are [[Balto-Slavic]] Z282 subclade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=European Journal of Human Genetics – Supplementary Information for article: The phylogenetic and geographic structure of Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n1/suppinfo/ejhg201450s1.html?url=/ejhg/journal/v23/n1/full/ejhg201450a.html|website=Naturecom|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study sampling of unrelated 96 Chuvashes concluded:
{{bquote|Earlier genetic research using autosomal DNA markers suggested a Finno-Ugric origin for the Chuvash. This study examines non-recombining DNA markers to better elucidate their origins. The majority of individuals in this sample exhibit haplogroups H (31%), U (22%), and K (11%), all representative of western and northern Europeans, but absent in Altaic or Mongolian populations. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to examine distances between the Chuvash and 8 reference populations compiled from the literature. Mismatch analysis showed a unimodal distribution. Along with neutrality tests (Tajima's D (−1.43365) p &lt; 0.05, Fu's FS (−25.50518) p &lt; 0.001), the mismatch distribution is suggestive of an expanding population. These tests suggest that the Chuvash are not related to the Altai and Mongolia along their maternal line but supports the hypothesis that their language was imposed by a conquering group—leaving Chuvash mtDNA largely of Eurasian origin with a small amount of Central Asian gene flow. Their maternal markers appear to most closely resemble Finno-Ugric speakers rather than fellow Turkic speakers.}}

Later, the assertion H, U, and K are "absent in Altaic or Mongolian populations" turned into "virtually absent in Altaic or Mongolian populations."&lt;ref&gt;Orion M. Graf, Stephen M. Johnson, John Mitchell, Stephen Wilcox, Gregory Livshits, and Michael H. Crawford. "Analysis of Chuvash mtDNA points to Finno-Ugric origin"&lt;/ref&gt; The MtDNA gene pool was found to be 89.1% Caucasoid, 9.1% East Asian and 1.8% unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Fedorova2003.pdf|format=PDF|title=Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA Lineages in Yakuts|author1=S. A. Fedorova|author2=M. A. Bermisheva|author3=R. Villems|author4=N. R. Maksimova|author5=E. K. Khusnutdinova|website=Evolutsioon.ut.ee|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[autosomal]] analyses: "Present-day Chuvash speak an Altaic-Turkic language and are genetically related to Caucasians (Georgians), Mediterraneans, and Middle Easterners, and not only to Central or Northern Europeans; Chuvash contain little indications of Central Asian-Altaic gene flow. Thus, present-day Chuvash who speak an Altaic-Turkic language are probably more closely related to ancient Mesopotamian-Hittites and northern European populations than to central Asia-Altaic people."&lt;ref name="hdl" /&gt;

Finally, an autosomal analysis detected an indication of [[Oghur (tribe)|Oghur]] and possibly [[Bulgar]] ancestry, from which the Chuvashes developed their language: "Chuvashes, the only extant Oghur speakers showed an older admixture date (9th century) than their Kipchak-speaking neighbors in the Volga region. According to historical sources, when the Onogur-Bolgar Empire (northern Black Sea steppes) fell apart in the 7th century, some of its remnants migrated northward along the right bank of the Volga river and established what later came to be known as Volga Bolgars, of which the first written knowledge appears in Muslim sources only around the end of the 9th century. Thus, the admixture signal for Chuvashes is close to the supposed arrival time of Oghur speakers in the Volga region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yunusbayev |first1=Bayazit |last2=Metspalu |first2=Mait |last3=Metspalu |first3=Ene |last4=Valeev |first4=Albert |last5=Litvinov |first5=Sergei |last6=Valiev |first6=Ruslan |last7=Akhmetova |first7=Vita |last8=Balanovska |first8=Elena |last9=Balanovsky |first9=Oleg |last10=Turdikulova |first10=Shahlo |last11=Dalimova |first11=Dilbar |last12=Nymadawa |first12=Pagbajabyn |last13=Bahmanimehr |first13=Ardeshir |last14=Sahakyan |first14=Hovhannes |last15=Tambets |first15=Kristiina |last16=Fedorova |first16=Sardana |last17=Barashkov |first17=Nikolay |last18=Khidiyatova |first18=Irina |last19=Mihailov |first19=Evelin |last20=Khusainova |first20=Rita |last21=Damba |first21=Larisa  |last22=Derenko |first22=Miroslava |last23=Malyarchuk |first23=Boris |last24=Osipova |first24=Ludmila |last25=Voevoda |first25=Mikhail |last26=Yepiskoposyan |first26=Levon |last27=Kivisild |first27=Toomas |last28=Khusnutdinova|first28=Elza|last29=Villems|first29=Richard|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|journal=PLOS Genet|date=21 April 2015 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|pmid=25898006 |pmc=4405460 |issn=1553-7404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study admitted substantial [[Finno-Ugric]] component in Chuvashes, unlike its complete absence in [[Bashkirs]], but noted that some aspects of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] in [[Volga Tatars]] are close to Chuvashes and [[Bulgarians]], declaring the suggestion of [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suslova|first1=T.

According to other study of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] the Bulgar descent of the Chuvash can not be confirmed and that Bulgarians and Chuvashes are clearly different:&lt;ref name="hdl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnaiz-Villena|first1=Antonio|last2=Martinez-Laso |first2=Jorge |last3=Moscoso|first3=Juan|last4=Livshits|first4=Gregory|last5=Zamora|first5=Jorge|last6=Gomez-Casado|first6=Eduardo|last7=Silvera-Redondo|first7=Carlos|last8=Melvin|first8=Kristin|last9=Crawford|first9=Michael H.|title=HLA Genes in the Chuvashian Population from European Russia: Admixture of Central European and Mediterranean Populations|journal=Human Biology|date=1 June 2003|volume=75|issue=3|pages=375–392|doi=10.1353/hub.2003.0040|url=http://www.protobulgarians.com/Statii%20za%20prabaalgarite/Genetichni%20izsledvaniya/Chuvash_HLA.pdf|issn=1534-6617|pmid=14527201|hdl=1808/13584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, whether the Chuvash are a remnant of the Bulgar Hordes cannot be resolved with the data presented in this paper, and further studies are necessary.}}

== Subgroups ==
Chuvash people are divided into two main groups: 
* ''[[Virjal]]'' or ''Turi'' ({{lang-cv|вирьял, тури}}; ‘upper’)
* ''[[Anatri]]'' ({{lang|cv|анатри}}; ‘lower’), which is subdivided into:
** ''[[Anat jenci]]'' ({{lang|cv|анат енчи}}; ‘mid-lower’)
** ''[[Hirti]]'' ({{lang|cv|хирти}}; ‘steppe’)

[[File:Ареал расселения чувашей в Волго-Уральском регионе. По данным Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года..png|thumb|Distribution of Chuvash in the broader Volga-Ural region. Source: 2010 Russian Census.]]
The Turkic ancestors of the Chuvash people are believed to have come from central Siberia, where they lived in the [[Irtysh]] basin (between the [[Tian Shan]] and [[Altai Mountains|Altay]]) from at least the end of the third millennium BC. In the beginning of the first century AD, the Bulgars started moving west through [[Zhetysu]] and the steppes of modern-day [[Kazakhstan]], reaching the [[North Caucasus]] in 2nd–3rd centuries AD. There they established several states ([[Old Bulgaria]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast and the [[Suar Duchy]] in modern-day Dagestan.

Old Bulgaria broke up in the second half of the 7th century after a series of successful [[Caspian Sea|Khazar]] invasions. Some of its population fled north, to the [[Volga]]-[[Kama]] region, where they established Volga Bulgaria, which eventually became extremely wealthy: its capital being the 4th largest city in the world. Shortly after that, the Suvar Duchy was forced to become a [[vassal state]] of Khazaria. About half a century later, the Suvars took part in the [[Arab–Khazar wars]] of 732–737.

It is believed that the Chuvash people came in strong contact with Iranian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=The Iranian Chapter in the History of the Chuvash|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1563011014000154|journal=Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=112–119|doi=10.1016/j.aeae.2014.03.014|issn=1563-0110|last1=Salmin|first1=A.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Culture==
They speak the [[Chuvash language]] and have some pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] traditions. In addition to Chuvash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cv-haval.org/ru/node/54 |title="Haval" somera tendaro 2015 &amp;#124; Чувашская общественная организация "Хавал" |language=ru |website=Cv-haval.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; many people also use the Russian language.

==Religion==
Today Chuvash people are [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. They retain some pre-Christian (or pagan) traditions in their cultural activities.

The '''Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor''' was a ceremony in which the ruler of Europe's then-largest political entity received the [[Imperial Regalia]] at the hands of the [[Pope]], symbolizing both the pope's alleged right to crown [[Christian]] sovereigns and also the emperor's role as protector of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The [[Holy Roman Empress]]es were crowned as well.

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was established in the year 800 under [[Charlemagne]]. Later emperors were also crowned by the pope or other Catholic bishops, until [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] became the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a pope, by Clement VII at Bologna, in 1530. Thereafter, until the abolition of the empire in 1806, no further crownings by the Pope were held.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;See also Guy Stair Sainty, [http://www.chivalricorders.org/nobility/holyroman/ The Holy Roman Empire: Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090548/http://www.chivalricorders.org/nobility/holyroman/ |date=June 8, 2011 }}.

[[File:Henry VII Holy Roman Emperor.jpg|250px|thumb|Coronation of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor]]]]
Successors of Charlemagne were crowned in Rome for several centuries, where they received the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial crown]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] from the pope.

The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] (with the title ''King of Italy'' or ''King of the Lombards'') was conferred in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Church of St. Ambrose]] at [[Milan]] or at the cathedral of [[Monza]],{{#tag:ref|The Encyclopædia Britannica notes that there is no clear record of a coronation with the Iron Crown before that of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII in 1312.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294417/Iron-Crown-of-Lombardy|title=Iron Crown of Lombardy at Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="N"}} that of [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] at [[Arles]], and the German crown —which came to be the most important of all — was usually given at [[Aachen]],&lt;ref name=Muir&gt;[[#Muir|Muir (1911)]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; until 1562 when, until the last German coronation in 1792, the Emperors-elect were crowned Kings in Germany in [[Frankfurt Cathedral]], which had already in 1356 also become the established site for the imperial elections.

===The German royal ritual (Emperor crowned as King in Germany)===
The German coronation ceremony first required the [[prince-elector|electors]] to meet at [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]], under the presidency of the Elector-Archbishop of [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]], who formally summoned the electors and who always had the right of the last vote. Once a candidate was selected, the new emperor was led to the high altar of the cathedral and seated. He was then conducted to a gallery over the entrance to the choir, where he seated himself with the electors while proclamation was made of his election. The coronation itself took place on a subsequent day.

If the coronation was performed (as it usually was before 1562) at the [[Palatine Chapel at Aachen]], (now the [[Aachen Cathedral]]), then the [[Elector of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], as diocesan, was the chief officiant, and was assisted by the two other clerical electors, the [[Elector of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Elector of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;This account is of the German royal coronation ritual used for Rudolf I in 1273 and remained substantially the same until that of Matthias II at Frankfort in 1612. The account is found in [[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 122–125.&lt;/ref&gt; These three Archbishop-Electors meet the Emperor-elect at the entrance of the church and the Archbishop of Cologne says the prayer, "Almighty, everlasting God, your servant,...etc."&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The canons of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen would bring the silver-gilt reliquary bust of Charlemagne with them to the entrance for the Emperor-elect to venerate as he enter the Palatine Chapel.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the choir sings the [[antiphon]], "Behold, I sent my Angel...etc." (''Ecce mitto Angelum meum...''), as the Emperor-elect and then the Archbishops proceed into the church. The Archbishop of Cologne then said the prayers, "God, who knows the human race,...etc." and "Almighty and everlasting God of heaven and earth,...etc." The Mass is then begun, the propers being those of the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany.]] After the opening [[collect]], the collect for the [[Feast of St. Michael]]. After the [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]] is sung the [[Litany of the Saints]] and then the Archbishop of Cologne puts six questions to the Emperor-elect: 1. Will he defend the holy faith? 2. Will he defend the holy church? 3. Will he defend the kingdom? 4. Will he maintain the laws of the Empire? 5. Will he maintain justice? 6. Will he show due submission to the Pope?&lt;ref group="N"&gt;"Will you be duly subject and show reverent faith to the Father and Lord most holy in Christ, the Roman Pontiff and to the holy Roman church?"&lt;/ref&gt; To each of these he responds, "I will." The Emperor-elect then lays two fingers on the altar and swears. The Recognition then followed and when the Emperor-elect is presented and asked if those assembled accepted him as their king, they respond, "Let it be done" three times.

The Archbishop of Cologne then said the prayers, "Bless, Lord, this king,...etc." and "Ineffable God,...etc."&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The German rite as also the English has the word 'ineffable', whereas the other European coronation rites has 'inexcutable.'&lt;/ref&gt; The Archbishop then anointed him with the [[chrism|oil of the catechumens]] on his head, his breast and his shoulders, saying, "I anoint you king with the oil of sanctification in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." and then on the palms of both hands, saying, "Let these hands be anointed, as kings and prophets were anointed and as Samuel anointed David to be king may you be blessed and established king in this kingdom over this people, whom the Lord, your God, has given you to rule and govern, which he vouchsafes to grant, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns,...etc." and on the palms of both hands.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;A number of other prayers of consecration then follow, which Woolley assumes were intended as alternative prayers, since the king had already been consecrated and anointed.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then vested in the imperial robes, which included [[buskin]]s, a long [[alb]], a [[dalmatic]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] crossed priest-wise over the breast, [[gloves]] and the [[cope|mantle]].{{#tag:ref|These vestments may be seen at {{Commons category-inline|Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire}}. Woolley notes that not only was the king clothe in these robes and invested with the regalia identified as those of Charlemagne, but accounts of the coronation of Leopold II state that the king's coiffure and beard were cut to look like that of "a man of the seventh (''sic'') century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="N"}} The [[Imperial Sword|sword]] was given the German king with the words, "Receive this sword at the hands of us bishops...etc." The ring was given him with the words, "Receive this ring of royal dignity...etc." The [[sceptre]] and [[Globus cruciger|orb]] are both given to the king with the words, "Receive this rod of virtue and equity...etc." Finally the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown]] was set on his head conjointly by the three archbishop-electors with the words, "Receive this royal crown...etc." The Oath was taken again, this time in the direct form in both Latin and German, "I promise and pledge in the sight of God...etc." The responsory, "My soul is longing,...etc." and the king is enthroned&lt;ref group="N"&gt;When the ceremory took place in Aachen, the throne used was Charlemagne's own marble throne directly opposite the high altar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Before the coronation proper Saint Stephen's Purse, reliquary containing earth soaked the blood of the first Christian martyr and which had once been in Charlemagne's tomb was placed within the throne.&lt;/ref&gt; with the words, "Stand fast and hold firmely...etc." At the coronation of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz preached a homily at this point.

The coronation of the queen consort followed and was conducted jointly by the Archbishop-Electors of Mainz and Trier. The [[Te Deum]] was then sung during which Charles V dubbed a number of knights with the imperial sword, although at subsequent coronations this took place after the Coronation proper. The Mass was then concluded,
during which the king communed im one kind. Whenever the coronations were performed at Aix-la-Chapelle, the new king was made a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the church at its conclusion.&lt;ref name=Muir/&gt; From 1562 to 1792 the German coronation took place before the Altar of St. Bartholomew in the crossing of the [[Frankfurt Cathedral]].

===The Roman imperial ritual (the ceremony unique to the Holy Roman Emperor, when crowned Emperor of the Romans by the Pope)===
The Roman imperial coronation evolved over the thousand years of the empire's existence from an originally very simple ritual (but which by its very simplicity paralleled and most clearly demonstrated its origins in its Byzantine counterpart) to one of increasing complexity. The oldest manuscript of the Roman imperial coronation ritual is found in the 9th century Gemunden Codex and while it is uncertain for whom (if anyone) the ritual described in it was intended to be used in it we come the closest to seeing the very types of forms which would have been used for Charlemagne himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual began with a short prayer for the Emperor, "Hear our prayer, Lord, and those of your servant...". This was immediately followed by the prayer, "Look, Almighty God, with a serene gaze on this, your glorious servant,...", in which a golden crown was placed on the Emperor's head during the words of the concluding phrase of this prayer, "Through whom honor and glory are yours through infinite ages of ages. Amen." A sword was then given to the Emperor with the word, "Receive this sword by the hands of bishops, who, though unworthy, are consecrated to be in the place and authority of the holy Apostles, deliver it to you, with our blessing, to serve for the defense of the holy Church, divinely ordained, and remember of whom the Psalmist prophesied, saying, 'Gird the sword upon your thigh, O most Powerful One, that with it you may exercise equity.'", a form which would have a long history both in the imperial coronation ritual and in those of numerous European royal coronation rituals as well. The ''Laudes Imperiale'' (a series of formal acclamations that originated in Roman times—see below) were then chanted. The ceremony traditionally took place in the Italian city of Bologna.

====The Imperial Coronation of Frederick I Barbarossa in 1155====
In its more developed form during the High Middle Ages, before the coronation proper the Emperor&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The Emperor is attended by German archbishops or bishops, as the British monarch is similarly attended by the Anglican Bishops of Durham and of Baths and Wells.&lt;/ref&gt; and went in procession first to the Church of St. Mary in Turri,&lt;ref group="N"&gt;A church which formed part of the complex of buildings around the east atrium of the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|Old St. Peter's]].&lt;/ref&gt; where the emperor took an oath to protect the Roman Church, "In the name of Christ, I, Frederick, the Emperor, promise, pledge and guarantee in the sight of God and the blessed Apostle Peter that I will be the protector and defender of this holy Roman Church in all ways useful to her, however many, in so far as I am supported by divine assistance according to my knowledge and ability." The imperial party then proceeded to the Basilica of St. Peter.
The Emperor was met at the silver door of St. Peter's by the Cardinal [[Bishop of Albano]], who says the prayer, "God in whose hands are the hearts of kings...". He then entered the church, where the Cardinal [[Bishop of Porto]] said the prayer, "Inscrutable God, Author of the world..." The Emperor then went up into the choir and the [[Litany of the Saints]] then sung while the Emperor lay prostrate before the Altar of St. Peter. The Emperor then went to the Altar of [[St. Maurice]], the patron saint of the Empire, where the Cardinal [[Bishop of Ostia]] anointed him on his right forearm and on the nape of his neck with the Oil of the Catechumens as he said the prayer, "Lord God with whom is all power, ..." or the prayer, "God the Son of God,..."&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The Ordo of Waitz which is contemporary with this one used for Frederick I has the prayer, "God, who is glory of the just and the mercy of sinner,..." with the anointing taking place at the words, "Kindle, Lord, we ask you, his heart with the love of your grace through this anointing with oil as you have anointed priests, kings and prophets,..." After this was said the prayer, "Lord God with whom is all power,.."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The anointing with the Oil of the Catechumens by the senior cardinal before a side altar and between the shoulders and right arm may have been intended to stress the fact that a coronation was not a sacramental act, unlike the consecration of a bishop which included an anointing with [[Chrism]] before the high altar on the top of the head.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The text of this formula can be found in [[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch]].&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the Emperor proceeded to the Altar of St. Peter, where the Pope handed him a [[sword]] with the words, "Receive the imperial sword for vindication over evil..." and then kisses him. The Pope then gird the Emperor with the sword saying, "Receive the sword upon your thigh..." and kisses him again. The Emperor brandished the sword and returned it to its sheath. The Pope next handed the [[sceptre]] to the emperor with the words, "Receive the royal sceptre, the rod of virtue..." and lastly crowned him with the words, "Receive the sign of glory..." and kisses the Emperor a third time. The Germans present then chanted the ''Laudes Imperiale'' in German and Mass was celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Imperial Coronation of Henry VI and Constantia in 1191====
In the coronation of Henry VI and Constantia&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; we see the Roman imperial ritual in substantially its final form; the imperial coronation ritual used for Henry VII in 1312&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and that found in the Roman Pontifical of 1520&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 54–57.&lt;/ref&gt; differ from it only in certain details.
The Emperor and Empress go in procession to St. Mary in Turri, the choir singing, "Behold, I send an angel"&lt;ref&gt;''Ecce mitto angelum'' (Exodus 23.20).&lt;/ref&gt; ('''1312'''--The Emperor is received as a brother canon by the canons of the church and dressed in a [[surplice]] and an [[almuce]].) The Emperor takes the Oath to defend the Roman Church and swears fealty to the Pope and his successors and kisses the Pope's feet.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;In 1312 and in later coronations the Emperor no longer swears fealty to the Pope.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope gives the Emperor the Kiss of Peace and the procession sets out for the Basilica of St. Peter, the choir singing, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel" &lt;ref&gt;''Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel'' (Luke 1:68).&lt;/ref&gt;.

At the Silver Door of the Basilica the Cardinal Bishop of Albano says the prayer, "God in whose hands are the hearts of kings."&lt;ref&gt;''Deus in cujus manu sunt corda regum'' (''Cf.'' Prov. 21:1).&lt;/ref&gt; As the Pope enters the Basilica the [[responsory]] "Peter, do you love me?"&lt;ref&gt;''Petre, amas me?'' (John 21:1).&lt;/ref&gt; is sung. At the ''Rota porfiretica''&lt;ref group="N"&gt;A large circular stab of [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] set into the floor of both the Old Basilica and the present one upon which many emperors, beginning with Charlemagne, are said to have been crowned.&lt;/ref&gt; the Pope puts several questions to the Emperor about his faith and duty and then he retires to vest for the Mass. The Cardinal Bishop of Porto says the prayer, "Unerring God, Author of the World."&lt;ref&gt;''Deus inenarrabilis auctor mundi''&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor goes to the Chapel of St. Gregory where he is vested in [[amice]], [[alb]] and [[cincture]] and is then led to the Pope who 'makes him a [[cleric]]. The Emperor is then vested in [[tunicle]], [[dalmatic]], [[cope|pluviale]], [[mitre]], [[buskins]] and [[sandals]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The Emperor had the unique privilege as a layman given him by the Pope of wearing [[pontifical vestments]], ''i.e.'', the vestments proper to a bishop. Nevertheless, one should also recall that the dress and insignia of both emperors and bishops have a common origin in the dress and insignia of the Roman senators.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal Bishop of Ostia in the meanwhile goes to the Silver Door where the Empress is waiting and on meeting her says the prayer, "Almighty, eternal God, fount and source of goodness"&lt;ref&gt;''Omnipotens aeterne Deus, fons et origo bonitatis''.&lt;/ref&gt; and then leads her to the Altar of St. Gregory to await the Pope's procession.

The Pope proceeds to the [[Confession of St. Peter]] and beginning the Mass. After the [[Kyrie]], while the Emperor and Empress lie prostrate before the Confession, the Archdeacon sings the Litany of the Saints. The Emperor and Empress then rise and go to the Altar of St. Maurice where the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia anoints the Emperor with the Oil of the Catechumens on his right forearm and on the nape of his neck, while he says the prayers, "The Lord God Almighty, whose all power is"&lt;ref&gt;''Dominus Deus omnipotens, cujus est omnis potestas''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "God the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;''Deus Dei Filius''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal Bishop of Ostia then says the prayer, "God who alone has immortality"&lt;ref&gt;''Deus qui solus habes immortalitatem''.&lt;/ref&gt; for the Empress and then anoints her on the breast with the Oil of the Catechumens while he says, "The grace of the Holy Spirit through my humble ministry descend upon you copiously."&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritus Sancti gratia humiliatis nostrae officio copiosa descendat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope then descends to the Altar of St. Maurice&lt;ref group="N"&gt;where the crowns have already been deposited&lt;/ref&gt; (and '''1312'''--kisses the Emperor 'after the manner of a deacon'). The Pope then give the Emperor a ring with the words, "Receive this ring the visible witness of holy faith..." and then the short prayer, "God with whom is all power..." (a much shorter version of the prayer said at the anointing). The Pope girds the sword on the Emperor with the words, "Receive this sword with the blessing of God..." and the prayer, "God whose providence..." and then crowns the Emperor with the words, "Receive the Crown of royal excellence..." The Pope gives the Emperor the Scepter with the words, "Receive the Scepter of royal power, the rod of royal rectitude, the staff of virtue,..." and the prayer, "Lord, fount of all honor..."

The Pope returns to the Altar of St. Peter and the [[Gloria in excelsis]] is sung and the Pope says the [[collect]], "God of all kings..." (In the '''1312''' and later coronations this is said after the collect for the feastday and after these collects the ''Laudes Imperiale'' are sung). The Epistle&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Ideally read by the King of France, he is present, or by the King of Naples.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gradual]] is sung.

(In the '''1312''' and later coronations the investitures with the imperial regalia take place after the gradual. The Pope sets a miter on the Emperor's head with the points 'to the right and to the left' and crowns him with the words, "Receive the sign of glory..."&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Cf. the portrait of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] wearing such an imperial crown over a miter.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sword is then given to the Emperor and gird on him, after which he brandishes it thrice. The [[Globus cruciger|Orb]] is placed in the Emperor's right hand and the Scepter in his left hand with the words, "Receive the Rod of virtue and truth..." and the Emperor is crowned and then kisses the Pope's feet. The Pope sets a miter on the Empress' head 'with the points to the right and to the left'&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The only other women who had the right to wear a miter were the 'mitered [[abbess]]es', the superiors of certain very ancient monastic communities, although Gregory Dix in his book, ''The Shape of the Liturgy'' notes that these abbesses were originally ''ex officio'' deaconesses and that these miters were originally the caps worn by deaconesses as an insignia of their deaconal status.&lt;/ref&gt; and crowns her with the words, "Solemnly blessed as empress by our unworthy ministry, receive the crown of imperial excellence...")

The ''Laudes Imperiale'' are sung and then the Gospel is read by the Emperor. At the Offertory the Emperor offers bread, candles and gold and the Emperor offers the Pope the wine and the Empress the water for the chalice. ('''1312'''--The Emperor serves the Pope 'as a [[subdeacon]] offering him the chalice and water cruet.) Both the Emperor and the Empress communicate and in '''1312''' after Communion the Emperor kisses the Pope's cheek and the Empress kisses the Pope's hand. (After '''1312''' at the end of the Mass the Pope if he chooses may say the prayers, "Look, we ask you, Lord, with a serene countenance...", "Bless, Lord, we ask you, this prince...," or "God, Father of eternal glory...").

On leaving the Basilica the Emperor swore in three places to maintain the rights and privileges of the Roman people.

The Roman imperial coronation ritual had certain unique elements which distinguished it from those of the royal coronation rituals developed in the European royal coronation rituals, e.g., the stational character of the ritual in which individual parts of the ritual took place in different parts of the papal basilica (usually that of St. Peter's in the Vatican)&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Note that the prayer said by the cardinal bishops at the entrances of the Emperor and Empress into the church was later imitated in the French, German, Swedish and Norwegian coronation rituals.&lt;/ref&gt; and the imperial coronation is quite unique in not having a solemn enthronement of the monarch (or even any use of a throne at all) in its ritual. Instead of an enthronement ritual we find the chanting of the ''Laudes Regiae'', which paralleled in both form and importance its Byzantine imperial counterpart. Indeed, only those European coronation rituals which were directly modelled on the Roman imperial ritual, i.e., the papal coronation&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The Papal ''Laudes'' were last chanted during the entrance procession of the Inauguration Mass of Pope Benedict XVI on April 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the royal coronation ritual in the Roman Pontifical, also include such chanting of a ''Laudes''.

The custom of the emperors going to Rome to be crowned was last observed by Frederick III in 1440, his grandson, Charles V was crowned by the Pope in Bologna in 1530; after that only the German coronation ritual was celebrated.&lt;ref name=Muir/&gt;

===Coronations of the Latin Emperors of Constantinople===
R. M. Woolley states that the accounts of the coronations of the [[Latin Emperor|Latin emperors of Constantinople]] are very scant and provide no record of the actual texts used in these ceremonies, but from what is recorded it may be assumed that these imperial coronations were modelled on the forms used for the coronations of the Holy Roman Emperors, rather than those traditionally used for the coronations of the Byzantine emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woolley|Woolley (1915)]], pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="N"&gt;For the texts of the two principal prayers used for the coronation of an Eastern Orthodox emperor (i.e., the Prayer for the robing in the imperial [[chlamys]] and the Prayer for the crowning) see the [[Coronation of the Russian Monarch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowns used in the ceremonies===
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (169)pano2.jpg|thumb|[[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]]][[Image:Crown of Constance of Aragon - Cathedral of Palermo - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|240px|Constance of Aragon's crown.]]
It is unclear as to which crown was used for either the German royal coronation or the Roman imperial coronation. Lord Twining suggests that when the German royal coronation still took place at Aachen, the [[silver-gilt]] crown on the [[Bust of Charlemagne|reliquary bust of Charlemagne]] was used, since the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] or ''Reichskrone'' is made of gold. This is reinforced by medieval sources that refer to the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] of Italy, the silver crown of Germany and the gold crown of the Roman Empire. Twining indicates that it is also unclear as to what crown was used for the imperial coronation in Rome, and indicates that the Imperial Crown might have been worn by the emperor-elect for his formal entry into the city of Rome, with another gold crown, perhaps provided by the pope, being used in the actual imperial coronation ritual itself. One of these latter crowns, specifically that used for the imperial coronation of Frederick II, may be the Byzantine style closed crown found in the tomb of his mother, Constance of Sicily, in the Cathedral of Palermo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradoxplace.com/Perspectives/Sicily%20&amp;%20S%20Italy/Montages/Sicily/Palermo/Palermo%20Duomo.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, once Frankfurt had become the normal site for the German royal coronation, the Imperial Crown was always used and thus eventually became identified as the Crown of Charlemagne.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Twining|Twining (1960)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Crown was originally made for [[Otto I]] (probably in the workshops of [[Reichenau abbey]], the single arch of the crown from front to back originally separating the two halves of the now collapsed inner cap like the ribbon which similarly caused the 10th bishops' [[mitre|miters]] to bulge up on either side.&lt;ref&gt;'Crown' Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Imperial Crown is the first example of the miter crown worn as a unique privilege of the Holy Roman Emperors and Empresses. Later personal crowns of the Emperors were worn over miters with points like that of contemporary bishops' miters,&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Cf. The portrait of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]].&lt;/ref&gt; the miter eventually becoming a part of the crown itself,&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Cf. The only extant example is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria|Austrian Imperial Crown]] made for Rudolf II.&lt;/ref&gt; although in the Baroque period the two halves of the miter took the form of two hemispheres.&lt;ref group="N"&gt;The only extant example of such a crown is the [[Imperial Crown of Russia|Russian Imperial Crown]] made for Catherine the Great. Peter the Great adopted the contemporary miter crowns worn by the Habsburg emperors as the model for the actual and heraldic crowns of the Russian Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empresses and queens ==
Up to and including the coronation of [[Richenza of Northeim]] at [[Cologne]] in 1125, Holy Roman Empresses and German queens were usually anointed and crowned separately from their husbands, unless joint ceremony was required by political circumstances. From then on, joint coronation ceremonies were more common.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jäschke|Jäschke (2002)]], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''creative class''' is a posited [[social class|socioeconomic class]] identified by American economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. According to Florida, the creative class are a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]].

==Overview==
Florida describes the creative class as comprising 40 million workers (about 30 percent of the U.S. workforce). He breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* Super-creative core: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, [[computer programming]], research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to "fully engage in the creative process" (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. "Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* Creative [[professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They "draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems" using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the creative class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|title=Bohemia and Economic Geography|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|date=2002|volume=2|pages=55–71|doi=10.1093/jeg/2.1.55|url=http://creativeclass.com/rfcgdb/articles/6%20Bohemia_and_Economic_Geography.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 study, Florida concluded that the creative class would be the leading force of growth in the economy expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade, which would in 2012 equal almost 40% of the population.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]'s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore]], [[Dublin]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the creative class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to spur regional economic growth through innovation (2002).

Walter Grünzweig, professor for American Studies at [[Technical University of Dortmund]], has shown that the origin of the term “creative class” does not lie with Florida, but instead goes back to a passage in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay "Power" in his collection ''[[The Conduct of Life]]'' (1860).&lt;ref&gt;Grünzweig, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
Florida says that the creative class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes "people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today's global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the creative class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The creative class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the creative class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the creative class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today's global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Talent Development &amp; Excellence Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The impact of smart fractions, cognitive ability of politicians and average competence of peoples on social development |journal=International Research Association for Talent Development and Excellence |year=2009 |last=Rindermann |first=Heiner |authorlink=Heiner_Rindermann |last2=Sailer |first2=Michael |last3=Thompson |first3=James |authorlink3=|issn=1869-2885 |format=PDF }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high creative class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose "bobos" roughly correspond to Florida's creative class), and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by [[Ross Honeywill]] (whose NEOs deliver a more sophisticated level of evidence), has shown that cities which attract and retain creative residents prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop "Cool Cities," Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess "the three 'T's": Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class'', Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the "three 'T's", have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a "leading city in a new economy".

The "Creativity Index" is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: "the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area's openness" (2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's "Gay Index" and "Bohemian Index" developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002).

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as "people will go to where the jobs/factories are"). Creative workers are no longer bound by physical products, rather working with intellectual products. Their migration to metropolitan urban areas where creative work is available is more due to the attraction of leisure life and community rather than actual work. Although the Creative Class works towards the globalization of progressive and innovative ideas and products, they can also be considered to value local community and local autonomy. Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best "be themselves".

"The main assumption underlying this approach is that creative workers seek creative outlets in all aspects of their lives and therefore migrate to cities that actively support their preferred lifestyles" (Donegan et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;181).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Which Indicators Explain Metropolitan Economic Performance Best? Traditional or Creative Class|last = Donegan|first = Mary|date = 18 Apr 2008|journal = Journal of the American Planning Association|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year Florida and the Martin Prosperity Institute release the [[Global Creativity Index]], an international study of nations, ranking countries on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. "The GCI is a broad-based measure for advanced economic growth and sustainable prosperity based on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. It rates and ranks 139 nations worldwide on each of these dimensions and on our overall measure of creativity and prosperity" (Florida et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://martinprosperity.org/content/the-global-creativity-index-2015/|title = The Global Creativity Index 2015|date = July 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI takes into account the diversity of geographical locations noting their openness as the means for progressive ideas to prosper. "Tolerance and openness to diversity is part and parcel of the broad cultural shift toward post-materialist values... Tolerance—or, broadly speaking openness to diversity—provides an additional source of economic advantage that works alongside technology and talent" (Florida, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of the Creative Class|last = Florida|first = Richard|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity allows these locations to attract creative individuals and therefore stimulate economic growth. The findings from the 2015 GCI measured 139 countries on their creativity and prosperity. Ranked number one on the 2015 GCI is Australia.

Share of Gross National Product spent on Research and Development is constantly raising at world level. Creative activities are growing at a fast pace in most advanced countries.  60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist. Repetitive works are being robotized. The whole world is becoming a "[[Creational Society]]".

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation in a variety of experiential activities. Florida (2002) uses the term "Street Level Culture" to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a "teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators" (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy a wide variety of activities (e.g., traveling, antique shopping, bike riding, and running) that highlight the collective interest in being participants and not spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of Florida's Creative Class theory. This body of critical empirical research demonstrates how the Creative Class thesis, and the associated [[creative city]] policy prescriptions, in fact exacerbate social and economic inequalities in cities in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eugene|first=McCann|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative-City Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jeffrey|title=From brew town to cool town: neoliberalism and the creative city development strategy in Milwaukee|journal=Cities|year=2008|volume=25|issue=4|pages=230–242|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2008.04.006|url=http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/zimmerman08.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catungal|first=J.

=== Statistical indices and composition ===
Scholars in the disciplines of economics, geography, sociology, and related social sciences have challenged Florida's conception of the "creative class", particularly for the perceived fuzziness of the concept and the lack of analytical precision.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1921–1940}}&lt;ref name="Evans, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.|title=Creative cities, creative spaces, and urban policy|journal=Urban Studies|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5/6|pages=1003–1040|doi=10.1177/0042098009103853|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319103434/http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boren and Young, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=T.|author2=C.

Social scientists have also identified problems with the occupational composition of the creative class. Economic geographer Stefan Kratke challenges the inclusion of financial and real estate professionals within the creative class on two accounts: 1) these individuals played a decisive role as the "dealer class" in the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|ongoing financial crises]], and therefore cannot be considered a basis for sustainable urban and regional economic growth;{{sfn|Kratke|2011|pp=43–46}} and 2) the financial and real estate industries (especially in headquarter cities) are economically significant regional/urban players only because they are largely "reliant on inflows of wealth created by productive activities in other regions."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=50}} Moreover, Kratke argues that the "political class" is also ill-suited to be included within creative class, as they are, in many cases, implicated in neoliberal financial deregulation and the rise in highly unstable urban and regional growth regimes{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=45}} evident through [[real estate bubble]]s across the United States and in other countries. In "Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class", Ann Markusen argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative.{{sfn|Markusen|2006}} Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida's indices become insignificant after controlling for [[education]]. Markusen argues that Florida "does not seem to understand the nature of the occupational statistics he uses" and calls for the major occupational groups to be disaggregated.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1922—1923}} She questions the inclusion of particular occupations within these broad categories such as claim adjusters, funeral directors, tax collectors, yet argues that "[t]hese occupations may indeed be creative, but so too are airplane pilots, ship engineers, millwrights, and tailors – all of whom are uncreative in Florida's tally."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1923}} Moreover, it is questioned whether human creativity can be conflated with education since "[p]eople at all levels of education exercise considerable inventiveness."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1924}}

===Economic growth===

Research shows that economic growth is experienced when the significance of scientifically/technologically and artistically creative workers is taken into account, but this macro-level conclusion can be drawn without Florida's creative class theory, which provides more of an "affirmation of contemporary class relations."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=89}} Other scholars have criticized the very basis for Florida's definition of "[[creativity]]" which many argue is conceived of narrowly and is only valued for the potential for financial and [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=C.|author2=N. Klocker|title=The 'cultural turn' in Australian regional economic development discourse: neoliberalising creativity?|journal=Geographical Research|year=2005|volume=43|issue=1|pages=93–102|doi=10.1111/j.1745-5871.2005.00300.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-5871.2005.00300.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=C.|author2=L.

The creative class thesis—and [[Richard Florida]] himself—have been criticized for what appears to be a change in Florida's prognosis for America's ailing [[Rust Belt]] cities. Florida's message was so quickly and enthusiastically adopted by cities because he argued that any city had the potential to become a vibrant, creative city with the right infrastructure investments, policies, and consulting advice.{{sfn|Peck|2005}} A 2009 article, "The Ruse of the Creative Class", questions Florida's costly speaking engagements in struggling industrial cities in which he offered optimistic prognoses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|title=The Ruse of the Creative Class|url=http://prospect.org/article/ruse-creative-class-0|work=The American Prospect|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and his more recent pronouncements that many American cities may never be saved in the wake of the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=How the Crash Will Reshape America|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/how-the-crash-will-reshape-america/307293/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative class thesis has also drawn criticisms for relying on [[inner city]] [[property development]], [[gentrification]], and urban [[labor markets]] reliant on low-wage [[Service sector|service workers]], particularly in the [[hospitality industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCann|first=E.|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative City-Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|access-date=2013-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peck|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=J.|title=Recreative City: Amsterdam, Vehicular Ideas and the Adaptive Spaces of Creativity Policy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2012|volume=36|issue=3|pages=462–485|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=210–219}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jakob|first=D.|title=Constructing the creative neighborhood: hopes and limitations of creative city policies in Berlin|journal=City, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=193–198|doi=10.1016/j.ccs.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zavos|first=Alison|title=A Portrait of East Austin and the Universal Story of Gentrification|url=http://www.featureshoot.com/2012/08/a-portrait-of-east-austin-and-the-universal-story-of-gentrification/|work=Feature Shoot|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Michael|title=East Austin Gentrification|url=http://www.klru.org/austinnow/archives/gentrification/index.php|work=Austin Now|publisher=KLRU|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Chloe|title=Hipster culture comes at a price in East Austin neighborhood|url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_8ef931d8-1713-11e2-a081-001a4bcf6878.html|work=Hilltop Views|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithson|first=Kate|title=Extreme makeover: gentrification transforms East Austin|url=http://abcnews.go.com/OnCampus/story?id=7399717&amp;page=1|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=David|title=How Much Tech Can One City Take?|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/how-much-tech-can-one-city-take|work=San Francisco Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida has called for service workers' wages to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cities must strategize to boost service workers' pay|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171257463/cities-must-strategize-to-boost-service-workers-pay|work=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots resistance===

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name="Creative Class Struggle."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name="Whyte, Murray.

'''Dargin writing''' is a written form of communication representing the North East Caucasian [[Dargin language]]. This language has approximately 439,000 speakers, most of whom live in the Russian republic of [[Dagestan]]. Additionally, Darlin writing is used in the Russian Republics of [[Kalmykia]], [[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Khantia-Mansia]], and [[Chechnya]], as well as nearby countries of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]],
[[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Dargwa.|url =https://www.omniglot.com/writing/dargwa.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2018|publisher = Omniglot.|date =1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Minahan|first= James|date= 2000|title= One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |access-date= March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Arabic alphabet was adapted as the Dargin phonetics alphabet in 1920, but it was poorly adapted to the sounds of the [[Ukrainian language]]. So in 1928, as part of the All-Union project on [[Romanization]], the [[Latin-based alphabet]] was adopted for Dargin. In the same year, the first primer in this alphabet was published (cupanov r. Nuşala ʐaꝗ-sawet. Mәħәc-qala, 1928). Initially the Dargin Romanized alphabet had no capital letters. After the reform of 1932 capital letters were introduced, some Latin letters were excluded and the alphabet took the form shown in the table:

The [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]] was adopted in 1938. In the 1960s, the letter ПI, пI was added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12446">[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] with [[Disability|disabilities]] were recorded in the personal, medical, and legal writing of the period. While some people with disabilities were sought as slaves, others with disabilities that are now recognized by modern medicine were not considered disabled. Some disabilities were deemed more acceptable than others. Small, scattered medical references contain the only direct acknowledgments of disability in ancient Rome.

==Medical opinion==
{{Main article|Medicine in ancient Rome}}[[Soranus of Ephesus]] (a [[Methodic school|Methodic doctor]] who worked in [[Rome]]) wrote in his extant treatise on [[gynaecology]] that only certain children were worth raising, listing the various tests one could perform on a child to identify disabilities which might render them not worthy. The treatise also states that the physical and mental fitness of a [[midwife]] or [[wet nurse]] also needed to be assessed by parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb04290.0001.001|title=Soranus' gynecology|last=Soranus|first=of Ephesus ; Temkin|date=1991-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Roman physician [[Galen]] also mentioned the deficiencies of people with disabilities in his works on anatomy, claiming that both physical and mental handicaps resulted from physical imbalances of the [[Humorism|four humors]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hippocrates-the-writings-of-hippocrates-and-galen&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he held to the traditional triad of melancholy, mania, and phrenitis as the three categories of mental disorder.&lt;ref name = ":0" /&gt;

Roman doctors separated mental disorders into two categories: those that could be cured, and those that were not of the body. Amongst the latter were addictions, most commonly ''[[Alcoholism|vinolentia]]'' (alcoholism).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQsxiCVotx8C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Roman+seneca+on+disability&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KJ-UHQTpeg&amp;sig=YOLXpN1UqN15CvaOecRxKDhSZTI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkm6iD7ODPAhVEjVQKHW0IBt8Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Disabilities in Roman Antiquity: Disparate Bodies A Capite ad Calcem|last=Laes|first=Christian|last2=Goodey|first2=Chris|last3=Rose|first3=M. Lynn|date=2013-05-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004251251|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification |date=July 2017|talk=Disabilities in Roman Antiquity}}

Roman doctors had a variety of terms to describe different degrees of optical impairment. [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in his treatise ''On Medicine'' (''[[De Medicina]])'', devoted a chapter to the subject of common eye infections, disease, problems, and their cures.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Roman laws on disability ==
{{Main article|Roman Law}}
The [[Twelve Tables]] included a law that said disabled or deformed children should be put to death, usually by [[stoning]]. They also stipulated that if a free person or a slave is injured and subsequently disabled by an individual, the injurer has to pay a certain amount of money or is punished by being disfigured in a similar fashion.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In addition, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] wrote that the city's founder [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] required children who were born disabled to be exposed on a hillside. Historians think that this was a fairly common practice due to a believed high number of congenital defects due to the prevalence of poor nutrition, incest, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Abled Body: Rethinking Disabilities in Biblical Studies|last=Avalos|first=Hector|last2=Melcher|first2=Sarah J.|last3=Schipper|first3=Jeremy|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=9781589831865|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed however, enforcement of this law became less and less common until eventually in the third century it was reversed by a new law requiring parents to take care of infants who were disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rootedinrights.org/disability-in-ancient-rome/|title=Disability in Ancient Rome|newspaper=Rooted in Rights|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', [[Julius Caesar]] mentions that the [[Gauls]] commonly maimed his [[Centurion|centurions]], usually by blinding them, mentioning that four centurions out of a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] were blinded. Soldiers disabled in such circumstances were given a stipend by the state once they retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4zSyQH-0PIC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=caesar+blinded+centurions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IJYlme31cD&amp;sig=eipT8paRiGB45Bsep-aVGT6MIEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8rduRvd7PAhVlxVQKHZsuCy0Q6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=blinded&amp;f=false|title=The Republican Roman Army: A Sourcebook|last=Sage|first=Michael M.|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134682881|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many late period Emperors, such as Nero or Caligula, are known to have used disfigurement or disablement as punishments for legal infractions, as well as personal attacks.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== In Roman culture ==
Blindness or partial blindness was highly regarded in the Roman psyche{{mdash}}many individuals became famous after losing an eye. Notably, slaves would sometimes enter gladiatorial matches with a patch over a functioning eye, though historians disagree on whether this was in reference to the mythical cyclops or to make the gladiator appear more experienced.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It is also known that many mythological figures, as well as known historical individuals, were thought by the Romans to have been blinded in return for favors from their gods. Such gifts varied from foresight to talent in singing. The language of the day also made note of those who were fully blind, ''caecus'', and those who were partially sighted, ''luscus''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Some blind children became beggars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_310228.pdf|title=The Disabled Beggar - A Literature Review|last=Groche|first=Nora|date=November 2, 2016|website=|publisher=International Labour Office|access-date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabilities from injuries received while in the [[Military of ancient Rome|military]] were seen as marks of honor as opposed to simple disfigurements, with injuries to the eyes appearing most frequently in both common soldiers and famous personalities such as [[Hannibal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many Roman writers, such as [[Seneca the Younger]], would write about the physical failures of prominent Roman civilians who had earned no such honor and that they wished to lampoon. Roman leaders typically had themselves depicted as physically perfect in statues and coinage.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Pliny describes a wealthy but disabled man as being worthy of pity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/crips-column/2008/04/disabled-slaves-child-roman|title=Ancient world|website=www.newstatesman.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deformed slaves were so popular that Plutarch writes about the different kinds of deformations on display at the Monster Markets. It was recorded that many Roman women kept hunchbacks as pets; it was also recorded that hunchbacks appeared in the court of Caligula.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Individuals with spinal deformities were fairly common in public life, and in fact hunchbacks were in some places considered to be a source of luck for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hunchback in Hellenistic and Roman Art|last=Trentin|first=Lisa|date=2015-06-18|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781780939117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they were occasionally known to rise to stations of eminent advisors, such as Nero's advisor [[Vatinius]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

That the god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] was lame yet worked as a smith has led many historians to believe that disabled Romans similarly specialized to accommodate their injuries but were not outcast.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Notable disabled Romans ==
{{undue section|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--This section is currently only about mad emperors, not disabled Romans generally--&gt;
{{Main article|List of mentally ill monarchs}}
* [[Tiberius]] (42 BC–37 AD, ruled 14–37 AD) was a paranoid sexual deviant.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} While Tiberius was in his later years in Capri, rumors abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. Historian [[Suetonius]] recorded rumors of lurid tales of sexual perversity, including graphic depictions of child molestation and cruelty but most frequently of his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and how he impacted the Roman Principate during his 23 years of rule.
* [[Caligula]], (12–41 AD, ruled 37–41 AD) nephew of Tiberius, suffered from [[Paranoid personality disorder|paranoia]] and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissism]]. He believed that he was a god and that the god of the sea was plotting against him. He was an alcoholic, made his horse a consul, ordered political prisoners decapitated over dinner, married his sister, and ordered political assassinations.  According to multiple classical sources, his mental health deteriorated suddenly after a severe fever that nearly killed him. This suggests that organic brain damage from a high body temperature or [[encephalitis]] (possibly malarial) may have caused or worsened preexisting mental illness.
* [[Quintus Pedius (deaf painter)|Quintus Pedius]] was a deaf painter who is mentioned in Pliny's Natural History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=%22q+pedius%22+painter&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wjk2fn_Isv&amp;sig=Vs1Y-yTizhzXwcwwdkmGmbmotAc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Natural History of Pliny|last=Pliny the Elder|date=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|language=en|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nero]], (37–68 AD, ruled 54–68 AD), nephew of Caligula, suffered from the same disorders as his uncle, along with [[histrionic personality disorder]]. He ordered the deaths of his mother and step-brother, had Christians crucified and burned, declared himself a god, and allegedly started the [[Fire of Rome]] and played a [[lyre]] during it.
* [[Commodus]] (161–192 AD, ruled 180–192 AD) has been diagnosed as suffering from [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] and [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] personality disorders. He renamed Rome, the Empire, the Praetorian Guard, and various streets after himself, and believed himself to be the reincarnation of [[Hercules]]. He once had a servant burned to death for making his bath too cold.
* [[Elagabalus]] (c. 203–222, ruled 218–222) catapulted venomous snakes at the people of Rome, invited guests to dinner only to give them inedible bread and leave lions in their bedrooms, used children's entrails for [[divination]], and held lotteries where the prizes consisted of wooden boxes containing bees, dead dogs and flies. He turned the Royal Palace into a public brothel.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} 
* [[Justin II]] (520–578, ruled Eastern Rome 565–578) was driven mad in his last five years according to John of Ephesus, and spent them locked in the palace on a wheeled throne which was moved by attendants that he frequently tried to bite. His men would push the chair around the palace at great speed and play organ music among other things in attempts to distract the raving emperor and calm him down.&lt;ref&gt;John of Ephesus, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ephesus_3_book3.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Part 3, Book 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Claudius|Claudius I]] (10 BC–54 AD, ruled 41–54) was depicted as having speech and physical disorders by [[Seneca the Younger]] but it is uncertain whether this was political satire or fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/4779256/Emperor_Claudius_I_the_man_his_physical_impairment_and_reactions_to_it_by_Keith_Armstrong|title=Emperor Claudius I: the man, his physical impairment, and reactions to it by Keith Armstrong|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25037">An '''economic development incentive''' can be strictly defined as “cash or near-cash assistance provided on a discretionary basis to attract or retain business operations.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Bartik, Solving the Problems of Economic Development Incentives in Reining, in The Competition For Capital 103, 104 (Ann Markusen ed., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, it is a broadly used term denoting an array of benefits designed to promote new business activity or to encourage business or job retention. These benefits principally encompass tax and economic incentives provided by federal, state or local governmental bodies. Other entities, such as utilities and non-profits, can also make incentives available for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 15.02[4] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accord the recipient, in some manner, a monetary benefit (i.e., tax incentives) or an in-kind benefit (e.g., state regulatory releases of environmental liability, municipal infrastructure improvements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 9.03[6][a] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private enterprises, including individuals, are generally the ultimate beneficiary of economic development incentives. Depending on the incentive in question, other qualified parties are eligible to receive them, as in the case of municipalities, utilities, or economic development agencies.

==Typology of Incentives==
Economic development incentives consist of two classes of benefits: (i) one mandatory or automatic and (ii) the other discretionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 1.02 (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former classes of benefits generally comprise tax incentives, which are established by federal, state or local law, immediately triggered by a specified type of business activity. For example, a private enterprise automatically qualifies for a state sales and use tax exemption or rebate when it purchases manufacturing equipment. Discretionary incentives can consist of either tax or economic benefits and can be established by federal, state or local law, by policy of a public body or other entity, or by negotiation among transaction participants. Generally speaking, discretionary incentives consist of more complicated arrangements than automatic or mandatory incentives, and necessitate a private enterprise to solicit the incentive from, and to negotiate with, the public body or other entity conferring them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 1.02 (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Economic Development Incentives==
The following illustrates economic development incentives made available to private enterprises or other recipients:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives §§ 6.01-6.14 (Law Journal Press ed. 2014); Timothy J. Bartik, Solving the Problems of Economic Development Incentives in Reining, in The Competition For Capital 103, 129-30 (Ann Markusen ed., 2007).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	Industrial development bond financing, exempting interest from federal or state income taxes, for designated capital expenditures.

•	Federal or state new markets income tax credits for qualified capital investment for low-income communities or for low-income persons.

•	State or local taxable bond financing used to effect ad valorem property tax exemptions.

•	Tax increment financing, allocating all or a portion of new taxes (i.e., ad valorem property taxes, sales taxes) generated by projects or capital investment for the direct or indirect benefit of a private enterprise.

•	Federal or state job training grants funded to local governments or private enterprises for the training of new employees or the re-training of existing employees.

•	Refundable or non-refundable state income tax credits for job creation or retention, or capital investment, by private enterprises.

•	Enterprise or development zones, exempting all or a portion of certain taxes otherwise imposed on property or business activity within the zone from state or local taxes.

•	State and local low interest or forgivable loans made available to private enterprises financing capital investment.

•	State grants or subsidies by public bodies to private enterprises for new project development.

•	Local property transfers to private enterprises at below market or nominal consideration.

•	State and local grants for the rehabilitation of environmentally impacted sites (brownfields sites) funded to local governments or private enterprises.

•	Utility incentives provided by utilities or non-profits for capital investment.

•	Local property tax exemptions for construction or retrofitting of buildings to qualify for LEED certifications.

==Considerations Affecting Economic Development Incentives==

A number of factors come into play in the adoption of economic development incentive programs by public bodies. This section summarizes certain of these considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=See generally, Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives (Law Journal Press ed. 2014); Irene S. Rubin &amp; Herbert J. Rubin, Economic Development Incentives: The Poor (Cities) Pay more, 23 Urban Affairs Rev. 37, 38 (1987) (outlining certain factors affecting local public bodies).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public bodies can develop well-articulated strategies, guiding their adoption and implementation of economic development programs.&lt;ref&gt;The Council for Community and Economic Research,  2012 State Economic Development Incentives Survey Report (May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the federal government can offer tax credits, encouraging development of renewable energy sources as a national initiative.&lt;ref&gt;See I.R.C. § 48C (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A state can promulgate economic development legislation as a tactical move, seeking to expand the presence of a particular business sector in its jurisdiction, while a municipality can adopt a special property tax incentive program oriented toward redevelopment of its central business district.

An uninformed observation about incentives could lead one to the conclusion that a jurisdiction or local community with a weak business and employment base tends to offer more favorable incentives than one with a strong business and employment base.  Although this correlation exists in certain instances, it is by no means an accurate reflection in each case of the approach public bodies take in allocating incentives to private enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Peters &amp; Peter Fisher, The Failures of Economic Development Incentives, 70 Journal of the American Planning Assoc. Nos. 32, 33 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, a state with a strong business and employment base can leverage its financial position to offer incentive packages to a certain business class as a way to participate in an emerging national business sector. Similarly, a municipality with a weak business and employment base can be reticent to offer economic development incentives because of financial and political consequences. A municipality fitting this profile, however, could be receptive to providing incentives based on new project taxes, not otherwise available to it, generated by the recipient.

The level of competition among adjacent jurisdictions or local communities, or other entities (i.e., utilities) can impact the adoption and implementation of these programs.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute &amp; Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  A state may legislate an aggressive incentive program to preempt adjacent states from luring inbound businesses to their jurisdictions. A local community may, however, offer economic development incentives merely as a defensive measure to maintain parity with adjacent communities.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, The Perils of Tax Incentives for Economic Development, The Policy Center, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution 6 (March 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of a state’s or local community’s economic base can be a factor in the adoption of incentive programs.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute &amp; Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  A state may offer attractive incentive packages to an under-represented business class as a way to diversify its economy.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute &amp; Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a local community can orient its incentive policies toward particular businesses in an effort to counterbalance its reliance on one business sector (e.g., manufacturing).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Morgan, Using Economic Development Incentives for Better or Worse, Popular Government 20 (Winter 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The state and local tax structure of a jurisdiction can affect the availability of incentives in the jurisdiction A state may offer to private enterprises a variety of economic development incentives to offset a higher income or property tax regime.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, State and Tax Incentives for Economic Development, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute &amp; Brookings Institution (February 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a jurisdiction with a low tax structure can be less inclined to promulgate aggressive incentive programs to benefit private enterprises.

A public body’s experience with an incentive program can impact its approach toward incentive arrangements. The prior experience with an insolvent company enrolled in a program can prompt a public body to adopt rigorous prequalification criteria as part of its incentive screening process. Likewise, the failure of a recipient to meet public body’s expectations about a project (e.g., employment) can prompt it to impose strict project commitments on new incentive recipients. Conversely, an incentive program with a successful track record of business expansion or retention can encourage the expansion of the program or the adoption of new incentive programs.

Different constituencies affected by economic development policies can also influence tax incentive programs or arrangements. Taxpayers often use the courts as a vehicle to challenge tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Sadloski v. Town of Manchester, 668 A.2d 1314, 1319 (Conn. 1995); see also Munger v. State, 689 S.E.2d 230 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxing districts constitute another pool of opponents to these programs. For instance, certain school districts not infrequently challenge tax incentive programs or arrangements because of a reduction or loss of their tax revenue allocations.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Barker Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Niagara Cnty. Indus. Dev. Agency, 877 N.Y.S.2d 813 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other public bodies can oppose tax incentives, as in the case of county tax authorities, because of their impact on taxing districts and public services.&lt;ref&gt;Bd. of Assessors of City of the City of New Orleans v. City of New Orleans, 829 So.2d 501 (La. Ct. App. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inducement Tests==

Many discretionary incentive programs require the recipient to meet an inducement test as one criterion to qualify for the incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 14.03[2] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this test, the recipient must demonstrate that the incentive in question has induced, on some basis, the targeted business activity. Depending on the program, it can consist on one end of the spectrum a stringent “but for test” used for tax exempt bond financing under federal tax law and frequently for many state taxable bond issue programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 14.03[2] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other end of the spectrum, it can be a broad standard of conduct, demonstrating the recipients’ general intention to initiate the targeted business activity as a result of the incentive.

A private enterprise seeking an incentive under a more stringent inducement test typically must obtain some governmental or other action authorizing the incentive, such as a resolution or ordinance, before it can make contractual arrangements for the incentivized activity. As a case in point, prior to waiving closing conditions to purchase real estate, or entering into binding vendor contracts for a new project, a private enterprise must receive a resolution or other governmental action, authorizing the incentive from the relevant public body to satisfy this test. Therefore, incentive programs which have more stringent inducement tests often create practical issues for a private enterprise seeking incentives. They necessitate careful management of the underlying business transaction and the incentive transaction, including milestone dates, to meet the legal requirements of the incentive and the business objectives of the recipient.

==Clawbacks==

State and local public bodies sometimes establish investment, employment or other project commitments, which must be met and maintained during a test period in exchange for discretionary incentives. Under these arrangements, the recipient must repay all or a portion of the benefit received, if it fails to meet or maintain the designated metric of performance during the test period. These recapture arrangements are commonly referred to as “clawbacks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 10.3[2] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a recipient fails to create or maintain a minimum level of new positions during a specified test period, it may be required to repay a portion of the benefit based on a prearranged formula.

In addition, non-governmental entities, such as utilities, can incorporate clawback provisions as part of their incentive packages. A utility offering an in-kind benefit to a private enterprise, such as the installation of on-site energy infrastructure improvements, can stipulate that the project must reach and maintain certain energy usage thresholds as a means for the utility to recover its investment. If the recipient fails to meet these requirements, the utility can assess a charge based on a prearranged formula analogous to a governmental clawback.

==The Critique of Economic Development Incentives==

Economic development incentives have come under close scrutiny from many quarters. They question the economic benefit to public bodies and local communities, and the wisdom of the public policies, promoting them. Some suggest that most incentives are relatively modest in relation to the incentivized business activity and, therefore, have no demonstrative impact on the recipient’s decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Irene S. Rubin &amp; Herbert J. Rubin, Economic Development Incentives: The Poor (Cities) Pay More, 23 Urban Affairs Rev. 37, 50 (1987) (outlining certain factors affecting local public bodies).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a corollary, some argue economic development incentives merely facilitate the relocation of a private enterprise’s business or employment from one venue to another venue, and do not foster any new meaningful business activity.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Middleton, Tax Abatements and Economic Development Structures, The University of Kansas Center for Economic Business Policy Research Institute 8 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this line of reasoning, a recipient can relocate essentially the same operation from one community to another community in a jurisdiction by taking advantage of the other community’s ad valorem property tax incentive program. The incentive, in effect, cannibalizes the public resources of the jurisdiction at the expense of affected taxing districts.&lt;ref&gt;Norton Francis, The Perils of Tax Incentives for Economic Development, The Policy Center, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution 6 (March 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have also contended that these programs contribute to the corruption of public officials in their administration as a basis to discredit them.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Olver, Who offers tax-based business development incentives?, Journalist’s Resource (May 24, 2016, 8:56 PM), http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/taxes/tax-based-business-incentives-corruption.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media have publicized flagrant conduct by some companies, and the mismanagement by certain public bodies, under these programs as a repudiation of economic development incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Story, Lines Blur as Texas Gives Industries a Bonanza, N.Y. TIMES, (December 2, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Response to These Criticisms==
Negative commentary about economic development incentives can result in sweeping generalizations, without distinguishing the incentives used, the public policy goals sought, or the transaction participants involved. Federal, state and local governmental bodies by their nature have individual agendas in adoption of economic development programs, although they may be complementary. For instance, a state may promulgate legislation, mindful of its economic base as a whole, while regional development consortiums and local public bodies primarily focus their attention on more local considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning Local Economic Development Incentives, Local Economic  Development Incentives in Northeastern Illinois 7 (August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic development incentives vary in purpose and by type. For instance, a utility incentive designed to foster economic development in a local community has distinctive characteristics and goals from an ad valorem property tax incentive used to encourage redevelopment of blighted areas in that community. Similarly, state tax incentives directed toward capital investment are different from state income tax credits based on employment.

Certain commentators view business operations or facilities as fungible objects, easily portable from one jurisdiction or community to another.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. Bartik, Solving the Problems of Economic Development Incentives in Reining, in The Competition For Capital 103, (Ann Markusen ed., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Business relocations can, in fact, require significant investment, resources and personnel for planning and implementation. They can be disruptive to the business and undermine morale of employees, if not properly managed. Therefore, such decisions are not made lightly by businesses, irrespective of the availability of incentives to facilitate them.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.. The Ugly, Journal of Applied Research in Economic Development, Vol. 8 (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, economic development incentives should not be viewed as merely promoting static business activity, but as structures promoting and capturing organic growth of the recipient at the project level and indirectly promoting growth of related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Do Incentives Make Good Policy, Global Corporate Xpansion Magazine (June 14, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Public officials no doubt have this expectation in mind by authorizing economic development programs, even in business and employment retention incentives.

Critics of these programs also do not fully appreciate the increasing reliance of the private sector in today’s business environment on economic development incentives for business expansion or retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalpress.com/player/eBook_317_Discretionary_Tax_and_Economic_Incentives.html|title=Frederick W. Kindel, Discretionary Tax and Economic Incentives § 103[2] (Law Journal Press ed. 2014).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Incentive packages can constitute a meaningful contribution toward project investment. Consequently, business enterprises with incentive experience, frequently will include incentives as part of project site selection checklists and will treat them as relevant budget line items.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Morgan, What We Know about Economic Development Incentives, Joint Select Committee on Economic Development Incentives 16 (October 25, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a case in point, a recipient relies on incentives to offset higher development or operation costs (i.e., site or labor costs) in its selection of a location for a new project. The emergence of public-private partnerships reflects the importance that the private enterprises place on the availability of economic development incentives under these initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Vickers, Feature Story: Public-Private Partnerships – An Alliance For Progress That Works, Business Facilities, (August 20, 2014), http://businessfacilities.com/2014/08/public-private-partnerships-for-progress/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the sporadic occurrence of mismanagement or misuse of these programs by either public officials or private enterprises should not be used to undermine their efficacy to promote economic development as a whole. The inclusion of tighter prequalification criteria and effective control and other measures in economic development transactions by public bodies and other sponsors should mitigate many of these anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Middleton, Tax Abatements and Economic Development Structures, The University of Kansas Center for Economic Business Policy Research Institute 11 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gypsies Are Found Near Heaven''''' ({{lang-ru|Табор уходит в небо}}, lit. "The gypsy camp goes to heaven"; also known as '''''Queen of the Gypsies''''') is a 1975 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Romantic film|romantic]] [[Drama film|drama]] film by [[Emil Loteanu]], loosely based on short stories [[Maxim Gorky bibliography|("Makar Chudra" and "Old Izergil")]] by [[Maxim Gorky]]. Set in early 20th century [[Austria-Hungary]], the film tells a love story between the gypsy girl Rada and the horse thief Zobar of Gorky's early 1892 short story "Makar Chudra" ({{lang-ru|Макар Чудра}}).

One of the songs near the introduction of the film had become popular on [[YouTube]] as the "Gypsy Song".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

It was [[List of Soviet movies of the year by ticket sales|the most attended movie in the Soviet Union]] in 1976, with 64.9 million tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/25085/|title=Табор уходит в небо|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=KinoPoisk|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vokrug.tv/product/show/tabor_uhodit_v_nebo/|title=Табор уходит в небо|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Vokrug TV|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film takes place in the beginning of the 20th century in a gypsy camp on the [[Tisza]] river in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia region]] on the outskirts of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

Two young proud gypsies Loiko ([[Grigore Grigoriu]]) and Rada ([[Svetlana Toma]]) fall in love but believe that family life is a ball and chain that would fetter their independence. The first time Loiko meets Rada is when he becomes wounded and she finds him and heals him. Then the horse thief and the beauty meet again when Loiko accompanies Bucha ([[Borislav Brondukov]]) from Rada's gypsy camp and comes into the camp itself, which is headed by old Nur (Mikhail Shishkov).

Local middle-aged landowner-nobleman Antol Siladi (Ion Sandri Scurea) also falls in love with Rada whom he meets during his walks through the city, but she rejects him in full view of her camp and the unfortunate amorous gentleman curses the young gypsy. The bold and lucky horse thief Loiko successfully steals a white mare as Rada wishes. However he incurs the wrath of the authorities who are preparing a raid in his encampment, and the proud and beautiful sister of Loiko – Rusalina (Nelli Volshaninova) makes resistance attempts. Loiko's father finally gives his son over to the gendarmes, who sent his friend Talimon (Pavel Andrejchenko) shortly before that to the master Balint ([[Vasyl Symchych]]) for the purpose of debt collection. Unfortunately Balint says that Loiko promised to come to the estate as it was previously understood, and his servant stabs the gypsy with forks in the stables.

Meanwhile local authorities sentence Loiko to death but nevertheless Loiko manages to escape his penalty although he ends up losing his friend Bubulia (Sergiu Finiti) who comes to his aid. The horse thief catches up with Rada's gypsy camp and presents the gypsy mare to her. Rada has fun with Loiko on the river bank and then spends the night with him during which she offers him grape juice.

At the end of the film Loiko, despite the gloomy predictions of the old gypsy healer comes accompanied by his old friend Aralambi (Nikolai Volshaninov) into Rada's camp and asks his blacksmith friend Makar Choudhra (Barasbi Mulayev) to act as an advocate of the wedding. Then, he completes his girlfriend's previous condition of their wedding - to kneel (which is humiliation for the Roma) in front of her with all encampment and then kills Rada and stands in front of her body on his knees. Father of Rada – the old soldier Danilo (Vsevolod Gavrilov) who was present at his daughter's murder, kills Loiko with a knife.

==Production==
The film skillfully captures music and dancing. Songs such as "Malyarkitsa", "Dyves and rat", "Apple", "Nane tsoha" and others which were previously sung in the 1930s were chosen by composer [[Eugene Doga]] and sung anew by Roma theater performers from the [[Romen Theatre]]. Roma cameos in the film were played by actors of that theater and of the Moldavian film studio, and the role of the mayor and his entourage - the actors of the [[Lithuanian Film Studios]] because the episodes were filmed in the city of [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]], as the old architecture of these cities sometimes very similar to the [[Bessarabian|Bessarabia]] town.

[[Image:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|100px|right]]
The '''Irish Red Cross''' Society was formally established by nurse Elizabeth O'Herrin of Dublin City Hospital on 1 July 1939 under the terms of the Red Cross Act 1938.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redcrosskinsale.com/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution is based on the Geneva Conventions of 1949, their additional Protocols of 1977 and 2005 (the Geneva Conventions), to which Ireland is a party, Acts of the Oireachtas and relevant provisions of the international Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

The society has been supported by the Irish [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]] and it receives €739,000 p.a. from them. In addition to that, the Department of Defence gives €130,000 annually to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/documents/Annual_Reports/2013_Annual_Report_English_Version.pdf Department of Defence Annual Report 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years the organisation has gone through significant management and operational changes. In 2011 a new Secretary General was appointed together with a new senior management team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redcross.ie/aboutus/corporate-governance/senior-management/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red Cross Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|Headquarters in [[Dublin]], the [[Republic of Ireland]].]]

Formerly the [[Irish White Cross]] had worked in the [[Irish Free State]] in 1921–28.

The society is organised on a voluntary basis. In Ireland, its activities include [[mountain rescue]], [[first aid]] education of the public, the provision of first aid and ambulance services at public events, as well as other community services including therapeutic hand care for the elderly and training of carers. Outside Ireland, the society provides relief and humanitarian services in response to natural disasters and in regions of conflict.

The headquarters of the Irish Red Cross is located at 16 Merrion Square North, Dublin 2. The society is a member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]].

==Organisation==

The firstaid services section of the society is organised into regions, areas, branches and units for command and administration purposes.

There are four regions in the country each with a Regional Director of Units who is responsible for co-ordination of the units in their region through their Area Directors of Units.

There are 28 areas in the Irish Red Cross (The Red Cross in Northern Ireland is part of the British Red Cross). Areas are normally divided up to match county borders i.e. the Clare Red Cross area has the same geographical bounders as county Clare itself. In this way the Red Cross differs from other organisations like the Civil Defence which is divided according to local council areas. The only exception to this being with Red Cross Areas in Dublin, they are aligned to local council areas due to the population of the city and outlying areas, this meaning there are four Red Cross Areas in Dublin.

Each area is commanded and administered by an "Area Director of Units" shortened normally to "ADU". This person is appointed for a three-year term by the Central Council. The Person however is a Volunteer and receives no payment for his/her work as are all person involved in the uniformed section, the person will normally have been a volunteer for a number of years and risen through the ranks. The ADU will normally appoint a deputy director of units (DADU) and a number of assistant area directors (AADU) to assist him. The DADU is second in command of the area and may take responsibility for a particular duty (e.g. Ambulance cover on public duties). The AADU's will normally have charge over a particular section within the area (e.g. cadet members) or a particular responsibility (e.g. equipment and training)

The ADU is assisted by the Area Committee, whose members are elected from the branch committees in the area each year at an A.G.M.

Each Area will have a number of branches in it, the number varying according to area. The branch is run by a committee of its own
members, also elected at an A.G.M. each year.

Each Branch has a number of units in it the number again varying according to the branch. The unit is the main training group within that area, there may for example normally be only one unit in a village or group of village depending on population, whereas a city may have a number of units due to the population. The Unit is commanded and administered by the "Unit Officer" a person appointed by the ADU. The appointment last for one year but the person may be re-appointed continually. The Unit Officer is assisted by a "Sub-Unit Officer" and by "Assistant Unit Officers" also appointed by the ADU. The unit is where all members of the IRC would training and also where public first aid courses would be run from. Depending on the size of the Branch there may be different units for different age groups.

Persons may join the Irish Red Cross from 5 years of age, there is no maximum age. The Age profiles are broken as follows:
* "Teddybear" 5yrs-12yrs
* "Cadet" 12yrs-16yrs
* "Novice" 16yrs-18yrs
* "Senior" 18yrs+

Not all areas currently have units for the youngest age range as they area a new inclusion, within them very basic "First Aid" is taught, things such as how to call an ambulance to putting on a plaster, progressing to higher levels as the member grows older.

===Ranks===

The Ranks in the IRC are in descending order:
* National Director of Units (Three silver stars with red cross mounted in center, the lowest star surmounted with laurel leaves)
* Regional Director of Units (One silver star surmounted with laurel leaves and red cross mounted in center)

===Activities===

The Irish Red Cross has a fleet of both road and off-road ambulances in Ireland. It also has specialised Support vehicles, Command vehicles, mountain bikes, search dogs and a boat. The vehicles in the Area depending on locally need and decided upon by the ADU. These Fleets along with all IRC members provide a backup to the ambulance service in case of major emergency.

The IRC offers members of the public a number of courses. In particular Practical First Aid and Occupational First Aid, as well as skin camouflage and hand care. The Irish Red Cross is a provider of First Aid Certification in Republic of Ireland. As a [[PHECC]] training institute it also offers the Cardiac First Response (C.F.R.) course.

If a person is a member of the Red Cross they can go on to Complete other courses such as:

* Intermediate First Aid
* Ambulance Procedures
* Emergency First Responder (E.F.R. PHECC course)
* Radio Operators Course
* Emergency Medical Technician (E.M.T. PHECC course)

However a member while encouraged to do some of these courses need not and can help the society by other means, such as fundraising activities, relief work or other areas.

The Irish Red Cross provides ambulance and medical cover at a large amount of public events and functions the year round and across Ireland, including events such as concerts, motor sport events, equestrian events, rugby, soccer and GAA matches. While the events organizers are normally charged a fee, this money however does not go to the people on duty but rather to help fund the activities of the local branch.

The Irish Red Cross also provides relief services locally, nationally and internationally. Locally services range from "meals on wheels" to home visits and transport of the elderly, to nationally disaster relief such as in the wake of the flooding in Ireland in 2009. Internationally the IRC will collect donations for major relief works such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], and will also send members abroad to assist with relief works.

==Use of Red Cross insignia==
Section 4 of the 1938 Act created the offence of using "for the purpose of trade or business or any other purpose whatsoever " a ".. heraldic emblem of the red cross on a white ground formed by reversing the Federal colours of [[Switzerland]] or any emblem closely resembling such heraldic emblem" without the express permission of the [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1938/en/act/pub/0032/print.html#sec4 |title=Red Cross Act, 1938 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=14 December 1938 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2009, some financial irregularities were revealed anonymously on an [[anonymous blog]] by a [[whistleblower]], Noel Wardick, who was head of the international department. The Irish Red Cross sought court orders to obtain Mr Wardick's identity from UPC and [[Google]], which were granted. Wardick was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Taylor (27 August 2010) [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0827/1224277687034.html "Red Cross blogger reveals identity"] ''[[Irish Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Wardick had revealed that €162,000 collected locally for the 2004 [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami]] had remained unspent in a bank account years after the event.

In 2010, an internal enquiry into Wardick's allegations found other such bank accounts, and proposals to overhaul the IRC's management were discussed in the [[Dáil]] on 15 December. Questions were answered by [[Tony Killeen]], then the Minister of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2010-12-15.496.0 "Dáil debate on the IRC"]. 15 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese people in the Netherlands''' include expatriates from Japan and their descendants, as well as Dutch citizens of Japanese ancestry.

As of 2009, there were 7,524 persons of Japanese origin living in the Netherlands, according to the figures of the [[Statistics Netherlands]] office.&lt;ref name="Cbs2009" /&gt; In general, they are transient foreign residents employed by Japanese companies.&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000" /&gt;

== Demography and distribution ==
According to a 1996 survey, 80% of Japanese in the Netherlands consisted of Japanese company employees and their families. Another 10% were Japanese civil servants on overseas postings, researchers, and students. The remainder were long-term residents, largely Japanese women married to Dutch men. Most live in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000" /&gt; However, there are also about 150 living in [[Maastricht]], mostly employees of [[Mitsubishi]] and their spouses and children.&lt;ref name="Dell" /&gt;

Statistics Netherlands' 2009 figures with regards to persons of Japanese background show:
*5,985 persons born in Japan (2,691 men, 3,294 women)
*1,539 locally born persons of Japanese background (783 men, 756 women), of which:
**1,140	had one parent born outside of the Netherlands (582 men, 558 women)
**399 had both parents born outside of the Netherlands (201 men, 198 women)
For a total of 7,524 persons. This represented growth of about 2.4% over the previous year's total, and about 18% over the total for 1996, the earliest year for which statistics are made available. However, they still form only a minute proportion, little over two-tenths of a percent, of all persons of foreign background in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Cbs2009" /&gt;

== Employment ==
The workplace is one of the most important sites of cross-cultural encounters for Japanese working in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ybema|Byun|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese company offices in the Netherlands are generally small in size, numbering less than 100 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stam|2001|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision-making processes in Japanese and Dutch corporate cultures are superficially similar, both relying on achieving consensus from stakeholders and subordinates rather than devolving decision-making authority to a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stam|2001|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for Japanese expatriate middle-managers to refer plans back to headquarters in Japan, in addition to the emphasis on collective responsibility for the results of plans agreed to by consensus, means that decision-making in Japanese companies proceeds more slowly than in Dutch companies. Nevertheless, Dutch employees in Japanese companies perceive the decision-making process as achieving better and more thorough results despite its slow pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stam|2001|pp=364–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese expatriate employees in the Netherlands put in longer hours than local employees. Dutch employees feel that their Japanese superiors and colleagues put in such long hours because they use their time inefficiently; furthermore, they feel little pressure to adopt those same working hours, asserting that the Japanese managers simply receive more benefits and salary in line with their increased responsibility. However, their Japanese colleagues resent this attitude, feeling that Dutch colleagues "leave work undone on their desk and go home", leaving it for the late-working Japanese to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ybema|Byun|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese managers find they have to delineate job requirements and responsibilities more explicitly for Dutch employees than they would for Japanese employees in Japan, due to the local cultural emphasis on individual responsibility above collective responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stam|2001|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuisine ==
As of 2000, when eating outside the home, Japanese expatriates in the Netherlands most commonly patronise [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]s (29% of meals eaten out); Japanese restaurants run a close second at 25%, Italian restaurants at 19%, and French restaurants at 10%.&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000b"&gt;{{harvnb|Cwiertka|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they deride the Japanese restaurants of the Netherlands as low-quality and expensive.&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000a"&gt;{{harvnb|Cwiertka|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cook Japanese food at home, though in a pattern different from that in Japan; they consume less fish and more meat dishes (especially ''[[nikujaga]]''), and often have to find substitutes for preferred vegetables which are unavailable locally.&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000a" /&gt; Preparing Japanese food is often viewed as troublesome due to these limitations, and many Japanese wives express that they only prepare such dishes because their husbands prefer them; when the husbands are away, they cook Western-style food instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cwiertka|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the community in Amsterdam at least have some Japanese-style grocery stores available locally. For the community in Maastricht, fewer such options are available; many cross the border to Germany to do their shopping in Düsseldorf and take advantage of the many specialised grocery shops which have popped up to serve [[Japanese community of Düsseldorf|the city's significant Japanese community]], or band together and order groceries—especially fish prepared in the Japanese style—to be shipped down from Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Dell" /&gt; Another common option is to grow herb seasonings, especially [[garland chrysanthemum]], [[Perilla frutescens var. crispa|perilla]], and [[cryptotaenia]], in one's own [[back garden]].&lt;ref name="Cwiertka2000b" /&gt;

'''Judeo-Yemeni Arabic''' (also known as Judeo-Yemeni and Yemenite Judeo-Arabic) is a [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Yemen. The language is quite different from mainstream [[Yemeni Arabic]], and is written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. The cities of [[Sana'a]], [[Aden]], [[Al Bayda, Yemen|al-Bayda]], and [[Habban District]] and the villages in their districts each have (or had) their own dialect.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

The vast majority of [[Yemenite Jews]] have [[Yemenite Jews in Israel|relocated to Israel]] and have [[language shift|shifted]] to [[Modern Hebrew]] as their [[first language]]. In 1995, Israel was home to 50,000 speakers of Judeo-Yemeni in 1995, while 1,000 remained in Yemen.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;  According to Yemeni rabbi al-Marhabi, most of these have since left for the United States. {{as of|2010}}, fewer than 300 Jews were believed to remain in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berer|first=Josh|date=2010-01-06||title=Caught in Strife, Yemen’s Jews Cling Fiercely to Their Ancient Heritage|url=http://forward.com/news/122780/caught-in-strife-yemen-s-jews-cling-fiercely-to/|newspaper=Forward|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5991">{{Former monarchic orders of succession}}

Under the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], the '''line of succession to the former Egyptian throne''' was subject to a number of changes during its history. From its founding in 1805 until 1866, the dynasty followed the imperial Ottoman practice of [[agnatic seniority]], whereby the eldest male in any generation would succeed to the throne. In 1866, however, the then [[Khedive of Egypt]] [[Isma'il Pasha]] obtained a ''[[firman]]'' from the [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Emperor]] which [[Imperial Firman of 27 May 1866|restricted the succession]] to the male-line descendants of Isma'il Pasha. The resulting succession remained in force until the abolition of the Egyptian monarchy in 1953, following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Egyptian Revolution]].

In 1914, however, the British government deposed Khedive Abbas II, the senior descendant of Isma'il, and proclaimed a protectorate over Egypt. His son [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim|Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] lost his place as [[heir apparent]],&lt;ref name="Burke 35"&gt;[[#Mon80|Montgomery-Massingberd 1980]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Millfield p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the throne passed to the lines of Abbas II's uncles [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] and  [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. A Royal Edict of 13 April 1922 specifically excluded Abbas II from the succession, though it stated that "this exception shall not apply to his sons and their progeny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |authorlink=Younan Labib Rizk |date=10–16 February 2000 |title=The fallen dynasty |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |series=A Diwan of contemporary life, 324 |issue=468 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720043015/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the descendants in the male line from Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim remained eligible for the throne and retained a senior position in the [[order of precedence]] of the [[Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Cabinet of the Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Egypt |title=Protocole |year=1947 |publisher=National Printing House |location=Cairo |language=French |oclc=2482348 |page=22 |trans-chapter=Members of the Royal Family by their degree of proximity to His Majesty the King |chapter=[[:File:Protocole du Royaume d'Égypte, 1947 – Page 022.jpg|Membres de la Famille Royale dans l'ordre de leur parenté avec Sa Majesté le Roi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5408">'''Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din''' (1839 in [[Sana'a]] – 4 June 1904 in [[Al Qaflah District|Qaflat Idhar]] ({{lang-ar|قفلة عذر|translit=Qaflat Idhar}})) was an [[Imam]] of [[Yemen]] who led the resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation in 1890–1904.

==Outbreak of rebellion==

Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din was a descendant of the founder of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in Yemen, Imam [[al-Mansur al-Qasim]] (d. 1620).&lt;ref&gt;The filiation was: al-Qasim al-Mansur – al-Husayn – Muhammad – Isma'il – Muhammad – Yahya – Muhammad – Yahya Hamid ad-Din – Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din.&lt;/ref&gt; As a middle-aged scholar, he experienced the Ottoman occupation of highland Yemen in 1872. In 1876, Muhammad and other religious leaders of San'a were arrested by the Turks due to a dispute with the Ottoman authorities. They were brought to [[Hudaydah]] where they were kept under surveillance for two years. Muhammad survived the exile and returned to San'a.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Nini, ''The Jews of the Yemen 1800–1914''. Harwood 1991, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Zaidi resistance was kept alive by local groups including the followers of imams [[al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin]] (d. 1878) and [[al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din]] (d. 1890). These were unable to threaten Turkish rule in San'a and the coastland, although large parts of the highlands could not be controlled by Ottoman administration.

After the death of al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din, the Zaidi [[ulema]] agreed to choose his brother-in-law Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din, for lack of more suitable candidates. On being summoned, Muhammad left San'a for [[Sa'dah]] further to the north, where resistance was based. His full title as imam was al-Mansur billah Ahmad ad-Din Muhammad. This occurred in July 1890 (or, in another version, May 1891).&lt;ref&gt;Caesar E. Farah, ''The Sultan's Yemen; Nineteenth-Century Challenges to Ottoman Rule''. London 2002, p. 158; Website Royal Ark, http://www.royalark.net/Yemen/yemen.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; 
Muhammad had access to the treasury of his predecessor, which facilitated his leadership. He allotted stipends of grain and money to the ulema, and circulated letters among the tribesmen. He was able to stir up most of the northern tribes against the Turkish officials and troops.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of towns and forts around San'a, such as [[Hajjah]], [[Yarim]] and [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], were captured by the imam's followers. In 1892 San'a itself was besieged for a while by rebel troops. The initial successes of Muhammad's followers decreased the prestige of the Turks, already unpopular through extortions and maladministration.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar E. Farah, pp. 158–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious basis of resistance==

Although the Turks were able to prevail, they were never able to regain the military initiative. Reinforcements of troops could not stop the expansion of Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din's sphere of influence. The hit-and-run tactics of the tribesmen wore out the Ottoman militaries. Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] sent messages to Muhammad in 1891 and 1896, asking him to submit and accept a stipend and an Ottoman rank. Muhammad flatly declined the offers. He replied that his aim was not political power for its own sake, but rather the implementation of the [[shariah]] law, protection of the people from rapacious officials, and the prohibition of wine consumption and [[prostitution]]. The Turkish officials were alleged to act against [[Islamic]] precepts. In other words, Muhammad was able to frame his resistance in the professed protection of religion, against the secular and Western-influenced Turks.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Willis, 'Leaving Only Question-Marks; Geographies of Rule in Modern Yemen', in M. Al-Rasheed &amp; R. Vitalis (eds), ''Counter-Narratives; Contemporary Security, and Politics in Saudi Arabia and Yemen''. New York 2004, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;
Imamic resistance continued with new outbreaks of fighting in 1898. In the following year the imam asked the Sultan of [[Lahej]] in [[South Yemen]] to ask the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Aden]] for protection. This did not lead to any results.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar E. Farah, pp. 174, 178, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his authority was not uncontested, Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din was generally able to revive the glories of the early [[Qasimid]] imams. He put an end to customary laws in most of the northern tribal areas, organized stipends for men of religion, and alms for widows, orphans and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1904, leaving a son, [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din]], who was accepted as his successor as imam. Yahya would eventually drive the Turks out of Yemen in 1918.

Ethnic media do not always target new immigrants, though much of this particular media works to eliminate feelings of isolation in the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahtani|first=Minelle|title=Representing Minorities: Canadian media and minority identities|journal=Canadian Ethnic Studies|year=2001|volume=33|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multicultural media also services Canadian-born individuals of a visible minority as well as diasporic ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Ojo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ojo|first=T.|title=Ethnic print media in the multicultural nation of Canada: A case study of the black newspaper in Montreal|journal=Journalism|date=1 August 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.1177/1464884906065517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, multicultural media in Canada, whether it is delivered in English, French or the respective language of the culture, is to contribute to the cultural maintenance and ethnic cohesion of the culture in question but also help members of minorities to integrate into larger Canadian society.&lt;ref name="mediascapes"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Attallah |editor-first=Paul|title=Mediascapes : new patterns in Canadian communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Nelson|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-640652-3|author1=Karen H. Karim|edition=3rd|authorlink=The National-Global nexus of ethnic and diasporic media|author2=Shade, Leslie Regan|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third-language media are especially important for new immigrants, as they are usually the main source of information for those who have yet to become proficient in one of the official languages. Thus, third-language media provide crucial information on education, training, and job seeking for these immigrants.&lt;ref name="Mansell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansell|first=Robin|title=The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8mCxLhTdEdEC&amp;dq=multicultural+media+in+canada&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The promotion of multicultural media began in the late 1980s as the multicultural policy was legislated in 1988.&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt;   In the [[Canadian Multiculturalism Act|Multiculturalism Act]], the federal government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture.&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt;   Thus, multicultural media became an integral part of Canadian media overall. Upon numerous government reports showing lack of minority representation or minority misrepresentation, the Canadian government stressed separate provision be made to allow minorities and ethnicities of Canada to have their own voice in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attallah|first1=edited by Paul|title=Mediascapes : new patterns in Canadian communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Nelson|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-640652-3|author2=Yasmin Jiwani|edition=2nd|authorlink=Race(ing) the nation: media and minorities|author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today ethnic media is available across Canada from small newspapers to full-fledged broadcasting stations run by the private sector, such as [[OMNI TV]].&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; Due to the difficulty of acquiring licensing and space on the electromagnetic spectrum due to costs and threshold of the spectrum itself, many ethnic cultures in Canada have third-language channels through satellite television. However, this still creates exclusion of minorities from mass media as found in [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]'s review of the 1999 Ethnic Broadcasting Policy found technological access and financial constraints hindered many ethnic minorities from accessing specialty television.&lt;ref name="Taras"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taras|first1=edited by David|title=How Canadians communicate II : media, globalization, and identity|year=2007|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|isbn=978-1-55238-224-0|pages=66–76|author2=Bakardjieva, Maria|author3=Pannekoek, Frits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy and Legislation==
{{main article|Multiculturalism in Canada}}
In 1971 Canada became the first country to introduce a Multiculturalism policy.&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; By 1988, the policy became an act of Parliament known as the [[Canadian Multiculturalism Act|Multiculturalism Act]].&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; The act proclaimed the federal governments policy to recognize the [[Multiculturalism in Canada|diversity of cultures in Canadian society]].&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; It also provided the overall framework for management of ethnocultural and racial diversity in Canada. Similarly the [[Broadcasting Act]] of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country.&lt;ref name="Raboy"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Raboy|author2=William J. McIver|author3=Jeremy Shtern|title=Media divides: communication rights and the right to communicate in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWyICYZneAUC&amp;pg=PA104|date=15 April 2010|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-1774-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] is the governmental body which enforces the Broadcasting Act.&lt;ref name=Raboy /&gt; The CRTC revised their Ethnic Broadcasting Policy in 1999 to go into the details on the conditions of the distribution of ethnic and multilingual programming.&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; One of the conditions that this revision specified was the amount of ethnic programming needed in order to be awarded the ethnic broadcasting license. According to the act, 60% of programming on a channel, whether on the radio or television, has to be considered ethnic in order to be approved for the license under this policy.&lt;ref name=Mansell /&gt; However, this quota does not specify which language this programming be in thus not considering the needs of the ethnic audiences.

==Media==

===Radio===
In most major Canadian cities ethnic radio is available. Whether it is an ethnic designated time slot on a commercial station, on community or campus radio, or a 24-hour multilingual operation, ethnic radio is accessible.&lt;ref name=mediascapes /&gt; An example of the latter is [[CHIN Radio/TV International|CHIN radio]].&lt;ref name=mediascapes /&gt; Created by [[Johnny Lombardi]] in 1966, CHIN radio has become the largest multicultural and multilingual radio station in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyatt|first=Laurel|title=Ethnic Media Goes Mainstream|journal=Broadcaster|date=Feb 2002|volume=61|issue=2 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station is delivers programming in more than 30 languages to 30 different cultural communities in the southern Ontario and [[Greater Toronto Area]] region. Have branched out to the [[Ottawa]] and [[Gatineau]] region, CHIN also delivers programming in 18 languages there as well. The success of the station can be credited to CHIN’s unique way in providing quantitative research about their audiences to advertisers. Using custom studies and current demographic records provides CHIN the accurate numbers behind their audiences, making advertisers support the ethnic broadcaster.&lt;ref name="Numbers"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Numbers Behind Multicultural Marketing in Canada|newspaper=Marketing 111|date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the success of CHIN, many companies have begun to specialize in ethnocentric demographic and lifestyle data to help predict not only the media preferences of ethnic audiences but also their spending habits.&lt;ref name=Numbers /&gt; No longer merely relying on [[Statistics Canada]] for information on minorities in the nation gives a more of a well-rounded look at the complexities of Canadians of various cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Numbers /&gt; This information is crucial in perfecting how to market to ethnic audiences.

Recently CHIN Radio has been reaching out to the official language speaking audiences.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; This includes the children of immigrants who grew up with English and French as their dominant language but want to learn more about their heritages traditional music, cuisine, and fashion. To reach to this segment of the population, CHIN has added a few English shows to their airwaves. CHIN also holds the popular CHIN Picnic every year to further attract non-ethnic listeners.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt;

===Newspaper===
There are hundreds of ethnic newspapers available throughout the country. These papers have become increasingly more high-level in both the way they are run and the stories they cover. The larger dailies are [[Ming Pao]], [[Sing Tao Daily]], the [[World Journal]] (Chinese) and [[Corriere Canadese]] (Italian).&lt;ref name=mediascapes /&gt;

Some other notable papers are Ghanaian News, a monthly newspaper that focuses on news relating to [[Ghana]]ian immigrants now living in Toronto or [[Montreal]], the cities the paper is distributed in.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; Its contents mainly pertain to news from Ghana as well as news on [[Ghanaian Canadian]]s. Mostly Ghanaian News stresses cultural retention and investing back into the home country.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt;

The Montreal Community Contact is another minority paper serving the Montreal black public.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; Founded in 1992 by Egbert Gaye, the Montreal Community Contact contains stories pertaining to all black regardless of country of origin (unlike Ghanaian News).&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; Ninety per cent of the paper is devoted to issues confronting foreign and Canadian born black people in Montreal.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; The stories in the Montreal Community Contact go in-depth on issues concerning the black community.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; The paper also reports stories on small business started by members of the black community as well as successful black Canadians.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; However the paper does its best to not be biased as it also reports on conflict and crime within the community it serves. Ultimately however the Montreal Community Contact tries to promote a positive image of the black community.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt;

===Television===
The role of ethnic television media is to provide informational programming, which pertains to the needs of the various cultural communities within Canada. The information provided by these programs gives these communities information that the mainstream media does not provide.&lt;ref name=mediascapes /&gt;

[[Omni Television]] provides ethnic programming to cities in Ontario, [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="Rickwood"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rickwood|first=Lee|title=OMNI Celebrates 25 Years of Diversity Programming|newspaper=Broadcaster|date=1 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their programming is mostly produced in Canada with a few shows from the various diasporas.&lt;ref name=Rickwood/&gt; The [[television system]]'s three stations are offered on basic cable and show 60 percent or more of their programming in 40 languages to 50 ethnocultural communities.&lt;ref name=Numbers /&gt; Knowing the importance of appealing not only to recent immigrants but also to the second and [[Immigrant generations|third generation immigrants]], Omni, along with the other Canadian ethnic television stations, have started to raise the quality of programming.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; These shows are much slicker and better produced than ethnic programs of the past.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; Furthermore, shows produced at Omni, such as ''Canadian Desi'', understand the complexities of the minorities they serve. The show, which can be understood by both [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] speaking audiences, understands the vast cultural differences of these audiences. As such, generic words with no particular cultural weight are used as well as subtitles in either language when necessary.&lt;ref name=Rickwood /&gt;

[[CJNT-DT]] is a multicultural broadcast television station in [[Montreal]] owned independently from Omni Television (owned by [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]] since 2009), whose roots are traced back to a [[Public-access television|public access]] ethnic cable channel that launched in the 1980s called La Télévision Ethnique du Québec (TEQ). The station broadcasts approximately 60 percent of its programming in seven languages. The station has the unusual distinction of being the only multicultural television station to be affiliated with an English-language television system as it served as an affiliate of [[E! (Canadian TV system)|CH]] (later E!) from 2001 to 2009 under the ownership of [[Canwest Global Communications|Canwest]]; as a CH/E! affiliate, the station aired select programming from the system in varied languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, in order to partially fulfill its language requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.fagstein.com/2007/09/10/cjnt-multicultural-american-celebrity-news CJNT: Multicultural American celebrity news]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[Rogers Media]] announced the purchase of CJNT from Channel Zero, with the intent to affiliate the station with its primary television system [[Citytv]] rather than affiliate the station with Omni Television (though some of Omni's ethnic programming will likely be supplied to fulfill ethnic programming requirements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/203765--citytv-expanding-into-quebec-western-canada Citytv expanding into Quebec &amp; Western Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509185944/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/203765--citytv-expanding-into-quebec-western-canada |date=2012-05-09 }}, ''[[CityNews]]'', May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Canadian ethnic television service is specialty cable channel [[Telelatino]]. Serving [[Italian people|Italian]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] Canadian audiences, the station is available in 3.5 million Canadian homes on the second tier.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; Telelatino is also committed to reaching out to a bigger audience outside of first generation immigrants. It has tried to grab a larger audience by introducing third-language programming in English as well as dubbing a second audio in English over its third-language programming.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; As it is majority owned by [[Corus Entertainment]], TLN also shows children shows from [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Treehouse TV]] dubbed in Spanish.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; The audiences of ethnic stations are large enough to matter to advertisers, and this was made most obvious in the case of Italian-Australian comic [[Joe Avati]]'s local Canadian tour. With TLN's promotion of the tour, Avati sold out 1800 seats for $50 each in 15 minutes. With this success due in part to TLN’s promotion, Avati expanded his tour by seven more shows in southern Ontario and Montréal.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt; TLN subsidizes their 60 percent third language shows by showing 40 percent English programming. Many ethnic broadcasters use this 60/40 model.&lt;ref name=Hyatt /&gt;

==Issues==

===Newspaper===
The need for ethnic newspapers is high as the representation of ethnic minorities is low in mainstream Canadian newspapers.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; The newsgathering staffs of 37 newspapers from across the 10 Canadian provinces only have 3.4 per cent non-white individuals.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; In fact, 22 out the 37 newspapers have an all white staff.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; With no diversity in ethnicities the stories being presented through the mainstream papers do not present issues of interest to minorities or present an accurate picture of minority culture to the mainstream audience. This is in part due to the lack of structure in funneling minorities into the reporting and editing sphere, a structure that is present in the United States.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; As such the black community in Montreal, for example, receive limited coverage in mainstream papers. This coverage is usually around “black” events such as Black History Month in February or during summer for Nuit D’afrique and Carifestival.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; This “calendar journalism” presents a very limited view of these communities and only further removes them from being included in to mainstream discourse as this coverage further perpetuates otherness. If the black community does get coverage in the mainstream English papers of Montreal, it is to highlight a black athletes success at a sporting event, or to highlight a violent crime.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; This only further perpetuates stereotypes of the black community both good and bad. The reductionist coverage of black individuals in the cities mainstream print publications is undoubtedly related to the lack of diversity in the newsrooms. Ultimately the Multicultural Policy, which was created to avoid this under and misrepresentation, does not address the racism that causes these structural inequalities in the media.

Thus the ''Montreal Community Contact'' has not changed the mainstream coverage of the black community in their city. Once one looks at the numbers, this is not hard to understand. Despite the 159,000 black people in Montreal in 2001, the ''Contact'' only had a circulation of less than 8,000 papers. Only 7% of the community read the paper that year.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; Furthermore, there is limited mainstream access to the paper. The ''Montreal Community Contact'' is distributed by being left at ethnic stores or black community centres.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; This is a common distribution strategy for many ethnic newspapers in Canada.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; This is problematic as by making the paper only available to the ethnic audiences, little impact is made in changing the image of minorities to the mainstream population. Furthermore, the papers cannot impact the community’s image of itself as it is not accessible to all members of the community.

===Television===
One of the problems ethic television station face is the lack of both qualitative and quantitative research information about their audiences.&lt;ref name=Numbers /&gt; Audience measurement numbers such as the [[Nielson ratings|A.C. Nielson]] and [[BBM Canada|BBM]] do not have the metrics to provide accurate tacking of ethnic audiences.&lt;ref name=Rickwood /&gt; This problem led to OMNI’s purchase of the Manifold Data Mining to provide the numbers to verify the Chinese and South Asian markets purchasing power to advertisers.&lt;ref name=Numbers /&gt; However, other channels that wish to corroborate their ethnic audience numbers do not have such tools thus severely effecting they’re funding from advertisers.

Another issue, which affects the ethnic broadcasters, is the way their audiences have come to see their news coverage. In Minelle Mahtani’s article “Racializing the Audience: Immigrant Perceptions of Mainstream Canadian English-Language TV News”, Mahtani found that ethnic audiences are unconvinced of the TV news channels geared towards minorities.&lt;ref name="Racializing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahtani|first=Minelle|title=Racializing the Audience: Immigrant Perceptions of Mainstream Canadian English-Language TV News|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|year=2008|volume=22|issue=4|pages=639–660}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a focus group of Iranian immigrants conducted in Vancouver one participant stated “If I’m really looking for information I will turn to CBC…if I want serious information I wouldn’t watch [[CHNM-DT|Channel M]].”&lt;ref name=Racializing /&gt; Other participants of the focus groups deemed ethnic channels as “fluffy” or not providing information relevant to them.&lt;ref name=Racializing /&gt; What is more is, these participants felt that ethnic media did not represent their lives in a less reductionist manner than mainstream media.&lt;ref name=Racializing /&gt; Thus the audiences of ethnic media still do not feel their cultures’ complexities are represented accurately or at all. The ethnic broadcasts that focused on cultural events did not serve their needs and the ethnic audiences wanted more “inclusive and representative storytelling”.&lt;ref name=Racializing /&gt; The ethnic television stations lack of legitimacy in mainstream realm further affects the minorities’ view of them. By tackling this issue of legitimacy, the ethnic broadcasters will not only help their image to mainstream audiences but also to their target audiences.

===Satellite Television===

====Grey Market Satellite Systems====
Recently, Canada has seen the advance of the “[[Grey market]] satellite system”.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt;  These are subscription based TV services not owned by Canadian companies but have subscribers in Canada. In September 2002 the President of the Canadian Cable Televisions Association estimated as many as 700,000 illegal satellites were in Canada.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt;  Most of these dishes are not purchased from Canadian companies. This revenue could have gone to licensed Canadian companies such as [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]] or [[Rogers Cable|Rogers Digital Cable]].&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; Immigrants who want and need programs and stations from their native home countries purchase many of these dishes.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; The figures point to a need for an expansion of third-language media as well as a lack of satisfaction of existing third-language media in Canada. Despite the need to grow third-language media further, in 2003 the government rejected adding more foreign-language broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; In the same year, the CRTC stated in a report “Canadians enjoy access to a wide variety of ethnic services”.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; This statement was extremely problematic as at that time, though there were 93 foreign-owned channels licensed for broadcasting in Canada but only 10 were in languages other than English or French.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; Also, though most third-language broadcasters are approved by the CRTC they do not have carriers, making them inaccessible to Canadians.&lt;ref name=Raboy /&gt; Furthermore, in the 14 largest TV markets, only 4 analogue specialty services were available which only catered to Italian, Spanish, Cantonese, South Asian and Greek communities.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; With the limited numbers of ethnic programming provided by the legal means, the immigrant and ethnic communities’ reliance on “illegal” satellite services only grows.

In February 2004 there was an attempt to amend the [[Radiocommunication Act]] to increase the penalty for transmitting or decoding unauthorized satellite signal.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; As the CRTC refused to add more third-language channels to the existing cable and satellite services, many saw this amendment as a direct attack on the minorities whose needs were not being met by the framework set in place.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; The amendment did not go through as it was seen as an attack on cultural diversity.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt;

By mid-2004, the CRTC allowed access to more third-language channels but only to subscribers who already paid for ethnic channels based in Canada.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt;

====Al Jazeera====
[[Al Jazeera English]] was approved for broadcasting in Canada by the CRTC in 2004.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; There was support for the station by the Muslim and Arabic communities in Canada.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; However, the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] was less than enthusiastic about the networks availability in Canada. They stated “Under the guise of a seemingly legitimate news agency, Al Jazeera has provided hatemongers and terrorists with a platform for their view.”&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; Ultimately, many in the Jewish communities found the station allowed and promoted [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] sentiments. The CRTC eventually concluded that though Al Jazeera had not promoted any such hateful views yet, it could potentially.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; This finding is extremely problematic as it gives any community or lobbyist the power to influence what channels are and are not approved by the CRTC. Any station can potentially promote hateful or spiteful messages. To allow any segment of the population to influence the CRTC’s decision on an ethnic channel can keep any third-language station off of Canadian airwaves legally. In the case of Al Jazeera, the CRTC made it the responsibility of the cable and satellite distributors to alter or delete any “abusive comments” made on Al Jazeera programming.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; The censorship power is otherwise forbidden to distributors.&lt;ref name=Raboy /&gt; The authorization of this censorship can be seen as an act of racism on behalf of the CRTC as they only granted this censorship authority for this Arabic station. This marked the Arabic message as a deviant and ultimately uncanadian message, further perpetuating a growing Muslimphobia in the post 9/11 landscape. Furthermore, by passing the responsibility of censorship to distributors, the CRTC ensured the network would not receive carriage by the Canadian cable and satellite distributors.&lt;ref name=Raboy /&gt; As [[Shaw Communications]] President Peter Bissonette explained by taking the responsibility which came with Al Jazeera, meant having a human monitoring the channel for 24 hours, who was fluent in Arabic, and knew contemporary broadcasting standards.&lt;ref name=Taras /&gt; Due to this demand in human and technological services, Al Jazeera is still not viewed on television in Canadian homes legally.&lt;ref name=Raboy /&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}
'''Participatory budgeting''' (PB) is a process of democratic [[deliberation]] and decision-making, in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a [[municipal]] or public [[budget]]. Participatory budgeting allows [[citizen]]s to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://theconversation.com/the-citizen-budgets-of-africa-make-governments-more-transparent-58275|first=Usman W.|last=Chohan|title=The 'citizen budgets' of Africa make governments more transparent| website=The Conversation|date=2016-04-20|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/who-we-are/mission-approach/|title=Mission &amp; Approach| website=Participatory Budgeting Project|date=2012-09-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and accountability, increased levels of [[public participation]] (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03252-8.html |title= Participatory Budgeting in Brazil |work= PSUpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frameworks of PB differentiate variously throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. PB, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of PB vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, PB has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, PB has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porto de Oliveira|first1=Osmany|title=Internatioanl Policy Diffusion and Participatory Budgeting: Ambassadors of Participation, International Institutional and Transnational Networks|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=Springer Nature|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-43337-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB stands as one of several democratic innovations such as [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly]], encompassing the ideals of a [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Röcke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9 |doi=10.1057/9781137326669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, PB has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

==Procedure==
Most broadly, all participatory budgeting schemes allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives subjurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. There is, therefore, a need for mediating institutions to facilitate the aggregation of budget preferences expressed by subjurisdictions.

According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for PB to be adopted: "[...]strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators' attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens."&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=24|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are generally two approaches through which PB formulates: top-down versus bottom-up. The adoption of PB has been required by the federal government in nations such as Peru, while there are cases where local governments initiated PB independent from the national agenda such as Porto Alegre. With the bottom-up approach, NGO's and local organizations have played crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members.&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24" /&gt;

PB processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps:&lt;ref name="Shah2007p26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=26|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The municipality is divided geographically into multiple districts.
* Representatives of the divided districts are either elected or volunteered to work with government officials in a PB committee.
* The committees are established with regularly scheduled meetings under a specific timeline to deliberate. 
* Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc.
* Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on.
* The drafted budget is shared to the public and put for a vote. 
* The municipal government implements the top proposals.
* The cycle is repeated on an annual basis.

== History ==
[[File:Esquina democrática.jpg|thumb|right|Participatory budgeting has been practiced in [[Porto Alegre]] since 1989.]]

Participatory Budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers' Party]], drawing on the party's stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a spring board for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] in municipalities such as [[Pelotas]] &lt;ref name="Shah2007p92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Budgeting|last=Shah|first=Anwar|publisher=The World Bank|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8213-6923-4|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6923-4|pages=92|url=http://hdrnet.org/498/1/br_27_56.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in 1989, in the city of [[Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre, Brazil]], a capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center, at that time with a population of 1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making a People's Budget in Porto Alegre. NACLA Report On The Americas|last=Wainwright|first=H.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=36(5), 37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial success of PB in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented PB, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =How Participatory Budgeting Travels the Globe|issue = 2|url = http://www.publicdeliberation.net/jpd/vol8/iss2/art8/|journal = Journal of Public Deliberation|volume = 8|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2012-12-30|last1 = Ganuza|first1 = Ernesto|last2 = Baiocchi|first2 = Gianpaolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto Alegre===

In its [[Constitution of Brazil#Title 1|first Title]], the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Citizen Constitution .281988 .E2.80.93 present.29|1988 Constitution of Brazil]] states that "All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution." The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/511.short|title = From Clientelism to Cooperation: Local Government, Participatory Policy, and Civic Organizing in Porto Alegre, Brazil|last = Abers|first = Jessica|date = 1998|journal = Politics &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004004|pmid = |access-date = 15 November 2015|pages = 511–537|volume=26|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's contemporary [[political economy]] is an outgrowth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire's]] patrimonial capitalism, where "power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Social Innovation and the Dialectical Relationship of State and Civil Society|url = http://usj.sagepub.com/content/42/11/2023|journal = Urban Studies|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0042-0980|pages = 2023–2036|volume = 42|issue = 11|doi = 10.1080/00420980500279828|first = Andreas|last = Novy|first2 = Bernhard|last2 = Leubolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Athenian democracy|Athenian ideal of democracy]], in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil's government is structured as a [[republic]] with [[Representative democracy|elected representatives]]. This institutional arrangement has created a separation between the state and [[civil society]], which has opened the doors for [[clientelism]]. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain 'clients', typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors, and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader represents the views of shop owners to the local party boss, asking for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. In exchange, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party bosses and influential citizens rather than the broader public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/461|journal = Politics &amp; Society|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0032-3292|pages = 461–510|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004003|first = BOAVENTURA de SOUSA|last = Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Olívio Dutra]] won the mayor's seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT's organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is one example of what we now know as Participatory Budgeting.

=== Outcomes ===
A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of [[school]]s quadrupled since 1986.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=2}}

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=3}} In a paper that updated the World Bank's methodology, expanding statistical scope and analyzing Brazil's 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term – it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cps.sagepub.com/content/47/10/1442.full?keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spcps&amp;ijkey=qPmuzabskSFkQ |title= Improving Social Well-Being Through New Democratic Institutions |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the [[Poverty|poor]]. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as [[unemployment]], it leads to "noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various [[public welfare]] amenities".{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=1}}

Based on Porto Alegre more than 140 (about 2.5%) of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil have adopted participatory budgeting.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

==Implementation &amp; Policy Diffusion==
As of 2015, over 1,500 instances of PB have been implemented across the five continents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the democratic spirit of PB remains the same throughout the world, institutional variations abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Budgets for the People|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-11/budgets-people|journal = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru have implemented participatory budgeting in all local governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watsonblogs.org/participatorybudgeting/historypb.html |title=History|work= The Participatory Budgeting Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of towns and cities in [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]] have also initiated participatory budgeting processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | title = Volumen zwei: Endbericht Bürgerhaushalt Europa 5 |trans-title = Volume two | format = PDF | place = [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Bürgerhaushalt Europa | url = http://www.buergerhaushalt-europa.de/documents/Volumen_zwei_Endbericht_Buergerhaushalt_Europa5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], participatory budgeting has been implemented with public housing, neighbourhood groups, and a public schools, in the cities of [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontohousing.ca/participatory_budgeting|title= Participatory Budgeting – Working together, making a difference | publisher = Toronto Community Housing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guelph]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = PB Hamilton, Ontario | url = http://pbhamont.ca/ | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Vancouver]]. Since its emergence in Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has spread to hundreds of [[Latin America]]n cities, and dozens of cities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]. In some cities, participatory budgeting has been applied for school, university, and public housing budgets. In France, the Region [[Poitou-Charentes]] is notable for launching participatory budgeting in its secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Poitou-Charentes' participatory budget in the high schools | type = wiki | contribution-url = http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Poitou-Charentes%27_participatory_budget_in_the_highschools | title = Participedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These international approaches differ significantly, and they are shaped as much by their local contexts as by the Porto Alegre model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Participatory budgeting | publisher = CFE | url = http://www.cfe.org.uk/uploaded/files/Participatory%20Budgeting.pdf | format = PDF | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Participatory budgeting in [[Porto Alegre]] occurs annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite journal | date = December 31, 2002 |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title = Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People | first = David | last = Lewit |journal= Yes! Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porto Alegre spends about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, this money is subject to participatory budgeting.  Annual spending on fixed expenses, such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre now take part in the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants growing year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name= autogenerated2 /&gt;

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and assemblies across the city facilitate maximum participation and interaction. Each February there is instruction from city specialists in technical and system aspects of city budgeting. In March there are plenary assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts as well as assemblies dealing with such areas as transportation, health, education, sports, and economic development.  These large meetings—with participation that can reach over 1,000—elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following months, delegates meet weekly or biweekly in each district to review technical project criteria and district needs. City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget.  The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
The city of Rosario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rosario.gov.ar/web/gobierno/presupuestos/presupuesto-participativo/resultados-del-presupuesto-participativo-2018|title=Resultados del Presupuesto Participativo 2018|website=Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario|language=es|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina mixed participatory budgeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenlab.co/blog/civic-engagement/participatory-budgeting/what-if-citizens-set-city-budgets-with-participatory-budgeting/|title=What if citizens set the city budgets? - CitizenLab|website=www.citizenlab.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an approach called ‘gender budgeting’. In practice it means taking appropriate actions to involve more women in the participatory budgeting process, and to make all participants more sensitive of gender issues and the impact of the participatory budgeting projects on these issues.

===United States of America &amp; Canada===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

The first recorded Participatory Budgeting process in the United States of America is in the [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2010-05-27 | url = http://permaculture.org.au/2010/05/27/chicagos-1-3-million-experiment-in-democracy/|title= Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy | place = [[Australia|AU]] | publisher = The Permaculture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Yes Magazine | date = April 10, 2010 | title = Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy; For the First Time in the US, the City's 49th Ward Lets Taxpayers Directly Decide How Public Money is Spent | url = http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/chicagos-1.3-million-experiment-in-democracy| last1 = Lerner | first1 = Josh }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the ward's Alderman, Joe Moore, Chicago's 49th Ward is undertaking this process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ward49.com/participatory-budgeting/ |title= Participatory budgeting | place = Chicago | publisher = 49th Ward|accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Alderman's "Menu Money."  Menu Money is a yearly budgeted amount each of Chicago's 50 wards receives for use on capital expenses. This money in other wards is typically allocated at the complete discretion of a ward's Alderman. Since 2011 more examples have been occurring in the US, in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pbnyc.org/ |title=Participatory budgeting in New York City |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now [[Participatory budgeting in Vallejo, California|citywide in Vallejo, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Public policy | url = http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/davenport-institute/incommon/index.php/2012/04/city-wide-pb-in-vallejo-ca/ | publisher = Pepperdine | title= Participatory budgeting city wide in Vallejo, CA |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in [[Greensboro, NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greensboro-nc.gov/index.aspx?page=4796 | publisher = City of Greensboro| title= City of Greensboro NC: Participatory Budgeting |accessdate= December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the first youth-led participatory budgeting process in the US allows teens to decide how to spend $1 million of the city's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youth.boston.gov/youth-lead-the-change/|title=Participatory Budgeting Boston|last=|first=|date=|website=Youth Lead the Change|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipal Processes ====

===== Cambridge, Massachusetts =====
Cambridge's first PB occurred in 2014-2015, with $528,000 allocated towards the implementation of six winning projects. Winning projects included one hundred healthy trees, twenty laptops for a community center, bilingual books for children learning english, a public bathroom in Central Square, bike report stations, and free public wifi in six outdoor locations.

===== New York City =====
New York City's Participatory Budgeting process (PBNYC) is the largest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://council.nyc.gov/html/pr/092115launch.shtml|title=Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and New York City Council Launch 2015-2016 Participatory Budgeting Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=New York City Council|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process began in 2011-2012 as a pilot program in four City Council districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/examples-of-participatory-budgeting/|title=Examples of PB|last=|first=|date=|website=Participatory Budgeting Project|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its sixth year (2016-2017), PBNYC has grown to include 31 of the city's 51 districts. Community members in each district decide how to spend at least $1 million of their City Council member's discretionary funds.&lt;ref name="Participate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.council.nyc/pb/participate/|title=Participate|website=New York City Council|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBNYC cycles run from early fall through the spring. Districts hold neighborhood meetings to collect ideas for community improvement projects. Idea collection is focused particularly on hard-to-reach communities, such as immigrants with limited English proficiency, youth, senior citizens, and public housing residents. Volunteers then research community needs and work with city agencies to turn ideas into concrete proposals. The proposals are put to a community vote, which is open to any resident of the district over the age of 14. City agencies implement the winning projects.&lt;ref name="Participate"/&gt;

==== Housing Complex Processes ====

===== Toronto (Canada) =====
In Toronto Community Housing, PB is part of a broader "tenant participation system." PB has been a part of Toronto Community Housing since 2001. This inspired the launch of a three-year pilot of PB at the ward-level in Toronto, beginning in 2015. In the months of May and June 2018 the city will begin debating what to do with PB at the municipal-level, following annual evaluations of the pilot. Thirty-seven projects have been voted for through the entirety of the three-year pilot process, comprising a total of $1.8 million in residents directly allocating funds towards projects.

===== New York City =====
Citing the case of Toronto, Community Voices Heard (CVH) has called for PB within the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA). As part of a platform for democratizing and improving access to public housing, CVH has advocated for developing a kind of participatory system tied together by PB. CVH also advocates for a gradual increase of money being allocated through PB as residents become increasingly familiarized with the process.

===== Los Angeles =====
As part of a broader platform for pushing greater investment and public housing, in early 2014 the LA Human Right to Housing collective began advocating for the use of PB in the [[Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles]] (HACLA). This was in response to a budget corruption scandal in November 2012 in HACLA.According to the Collective, nearly one-hundred residents mobilized to demand PB at a HACLA Agency Plan hearing in August 2014. In response, HACLA launched a "values driven participatory budgeting process" developed and coordinated by a consultant. This was a six-week process, consisting of "resident consultation" that fed into decisions ultimately made by administration and management. Participatory elements of the process were "a resident survey" and "resident review of site specific budgets." The Collective regarded both the design and distribution of the survey to be unsatisfactory. Coupled with a lack of technical support, any kind of resident-focused collective deliberation or evidence of resident influence on the outcome of the process, the Collective deemed the process "participatory in name only."

To counter this, the Collective sought to scale up their campaign for a "true participatory budgeting" process by initiating a Model PB process. The process included a combination of one-on-one and door-to-door outreach with deliberation through meetings and assemblies of residents. The Model PB process resulted in tenants and the Collective deepening their critique of HACLA's PB "in name only" as well as putting forward a number of recommendations to create a "true PB" process.

==== Youth, School, and College Processes ====

===== Greater Boston Area =====
Since 2014 a youth PB process has operated in the city of Boston. Today the process allows persons aged between 12 and 25 years old to decide how to allocate one million dollars.

In 2013-2014 MIT's International Development Group within the school's Department of Urban Studies and Planning conducted an $8,000 PB process. Voting was not over allocating money to specific project proposals, but rather to determining exact allotments to four broad distinct budget categories: field trips, social events, project funding, and cultural event series. To determine precise allotments, "each participant allocated a percentage value of the $8,000 to each category. The average for each category was taken and a preliminary set of results was disclosed." The MIT intra-departmental process provides an example of how PB can be utilized to not only determine the allocation of funds within a specific budget category, but also to determine how funds are distributed across budget categories.

===== Chicago =====
In Spring 2015 Sullivan High School conducted a $25,000 participatory budgeting process. Seventy percent of the student body voted in the process, with the money allocated towards building a new recreation room.

===== New York =====
Within PBNYC youth participation has been semi-formalized in various forms. This includes the youth-led formation of the District 39 PB Youth Committee. District 3 also possesses a PB Youth Committee December 2015, which works in collaboration with an organization called Friends of the High Line. In his State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that PB would be launched in every public high school. Each participating school will receive $2,000 for students to allocate through PB. PB has also been launched at various colleges in the City University of New York. These have included Queens College, Brooklyn College, City Tech, Hunter College, and the CUNY Graduate Center.

===== Phoenix =====
Ten high schools allocated $55,000 of district-wide funds in Phoenix through PB.

===== San Antonio =====
In 2013 a $25,000 PB process was launched at Palo Alto Community College. Initially this was only open to faculty and staff. In fall 2015 the process was opened to students as well. The 2018 process expanded the pot of funds from $25,000 to $50,000.

===United Kingdom===

PB in the United Kingdom was initially introduced as part of the 'New Labour' Party's decentralization agenda that aimed to empower the local governments in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazel Blears]], the Labour MP, "[...] played a key role in the inclusion of PB on the national policy agenda[...]," pushing for greater community participation and empowerment in the governmental structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this new political ambiance, the British PB, inspired by Porto Alegre's example, gained traction for implementation, especially through the active engagement of local NGO's and community activists, namely the Community Pride Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at PB was initiated as a pilot in the city of [[Bradford]] in 2004, and its "procedural model consists of two main steps: the elaboration of project schemes by local community groups and a decision about these schemes by all involved groups during a public meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradford process, while limited to small funding, helped PB spread to other cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to the bottom-up activism in local communities, Blears's initiative for PB on the national level helped promote its implementation and diffusion more broadly, and by 2011, there were at least 150 recorded cases of PB, albeit being limited to small funding and designated personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "UK style" of PB, as Anja Rocke puts it, "in form of small grant-spending processes with no secured financial basis and organized at the margins of the political system," failed to gain enough momentum to be established nationally as a formal decision-making procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scotland ====
The [[Scottish Government]] has made a commitment to participatory budgeting, saying "We support PB as a tool for community engagement and for developing participatory democracy in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/policies/community-empowerment/participatory-budgeting/|title=Community empowerment: Participatory budgeting - gov.scot|website=beta.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Scottish Government and the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] have agreed that at least 1% of local government budgets will be subject to participatory budgeting by the end of 2021, potentially amounting to £100million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/more-choice-for-communities|title=More choice for communities|website=Scottish Government News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government allocates funding for participatory budgeting through the Community Choices Fund, delivered in partnership between the Government, local authorities, communities and third sector organisations.

===== Support and tools =====
There is a national network to support participatory budgeting called the [https://pbscotland.scot/network PB Scotland Network]. Glasgow Community Planning Partnership has worked with What Works Scotland to develop a toolkit to assess the impact of its PB activities and develop an improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/publications/glasgows-participatory-budgeting-evaluation-toolkit/|title=Glasgow's Participatory Budgeting Evaluation Toolkit {{!}} What Works Scotland|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the national government revised its Local Finance Act to promote citizen participation in the local government budgeting process in response to a few of the local governments that initially took a bottom-up approach in experimenting with forms of PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Soonhee|title=Participatory Governance and Polcy Diffusion in Local Governments in Korea: Implementation of Participatory Budgeting|date=January 2016|publisher=Korea Development institute|location=Sejong-si, Korea|isbn=979-11-5932-106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration invested in the nation-wide promotion of PB system diffusion, and under [[Myung Bak Lee|Myung Bak Lee's]] Administration in 2011, the newly revised Local Finance Act required all local governments to adopt PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

Before the 2011 decree, approximately 45% of local governments had already been utilizing the PB system, and it took 3 years for the remaining municipalities to fulfill the mandate.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; The PB System of [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] served as the benchmark for other local governments' adoption of PB in those years.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; Seoul, city with the world's 4th highest GDP, runs a PB committee of 300 people representing 25 districts. The committee is then split into 11 different budgetary fields such as parks and recreation, culture, environment, and etc. In its first year, Seoul citizens voted and finalized on 223 projects worth 50.3 billion KRW, and most recently in 2017, the PB system finalized 766 projects amounting to 59.3 billion KRW (approximately 55 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=참여예산제|url=http://yesan.seoul.go.kr/intro/index.do|website=서울특별시 시민참여예산|publisher=서울특별시청|accessdate=10 March 2018| language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive study of Korea's PB in 2016 suggests that PB in Korea has allocated most of public budget to the following three areas: land/local development, transportation, and culture and tourism. Transparency in budget documents and information sharing has increased since 2011, and the approval rates by local PB committees averaged to approximately 70%. On the other hand, the study also points out that the lack of citizen capacity, inadequate resources for smaller municipalities, and limited representativeness of vested interests as some of the most unresolved challenges in Korea's PB implementation.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

===India===

India's experience with PB has been limited despite its 74th Constitutional Amendment, which proposes to the state and local governments the formation of ward committees composed of local citizens to direct ward-level budgets.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keruwala|first1=Naim|title=Participatory Budgeting in India-The Pune Experiment|journal=The Budget Bulletin|date=June–August 2013|volume=V|url=http://www.nfi.org.in/sites/default/files/newsletter/THE%20BUDGET%20BULLETIN_1.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such initiative was not implemented, and thus there were only few cities that experimented with PB, which are [[Bangalore]], [[Myso]], [[Pune]], and [[Hiware Bazar]].&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Bangalore was the first to implement PB in India in 2001 with the help of a local NGO. Similarly, Pune was able to adopt PB in 2006 with the help of several local NGOs. Pune's PB system was met with a large response from its local citizens, and multiple online and offline workshops were carried out to foster the implementation&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; As a result, Pune has experienced both increased citizen participation and budget allocation, which are directed primarily towards roads, electricity, slum-improvement, and water shortage.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; Influenced by Pune's PB, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the fifth-most populated city of Maharashtra, also began to adopt the framework soon after.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Hiware Bazar may have served as the most successful example of PB in India. On June 25, 2015, Delhi Deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia presented the Swaraj Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Highlights of Swaraj budget presented by deeputy CM SH Manish Sisodia | url = http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/highlights-of-swaraj-budget-presented-by-deputy-cm-sh-manish-sisodia | publisher = Aam Admi party}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aam Admi Party Swaraj Budget was prepared based on voting from the people of different constituencies. In each constituency three meetings were held; each meeting  was attended by 200–300 residents, and a list of key issues was prepared, which was then voted on to decide the top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times of India | publisher = India Times | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Aam-aadmi-gives-Swaraj-budget-a-thumbs-up/articleshow/46981634.cms | title = Aam Admi gives Swaraj budget a thumbs up}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qk6YyKRRIk0C&amp;pg=PT3 |title=Swaraj |work= Books |isbn=9789350299371 |last1=Kejriwal |first1=Arvind |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/page/goal-of-swaraj|title=Goal of Swaraj | publisher = Aam Aadmi Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the village, once bereft of water, education, and basic needs for life, is now self-sufficient with a high per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Dhara|first1=Sagar|title=Including People in Governance|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/including-people-in-governance/article6483234.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===

For South Africa, the mechanisms for citizen participation is written in its constitution. Each municipality has its budgetary committee formed with representatives from its 'wards' that deal directly with its budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank Group's research lists [[Mangaung]] and [[Ekurhuleni]] municipalities as representative cases to demonstrate the typical PB process in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the process for the council is fixed by the mayor, who sets up certain deadlines for the council to deliberate within.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the municipality is divided geographically into 'wards', and  the public budget is drawn with any desired submission from the community through their ward representatives.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt; The tentatively accumulated budget plan is then publicized so that any citizens or "stakeholders" can make their final inputs, and the final version is submitted to the national and provincial governments for approval.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt;

On a nation-wide level, the South African municipalities, as a result of PB, have witnessed the public budget "shift from infrastructure development to local economic development, a higher priority for citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, PB is being carried out in 284 municipalities, each varying slightly in its process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of transparency for the municipal governments has increased because the sub-organization ward committees are able to maintain consistently ongoing communication with the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the challenges in South African local governance still prevail as a result of the lack of resources and limited capacities assigned to PB. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences also provide immediate obstacles for holistic communications between various wards and social groups within the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The Better Neighbourhoods participatory budgeting project of the wider [[citizen sourcing]] Better Reykjavik project of the City of Reykjavik was established in 2011. Nearly 2 million Euros (300 million ISK) has been allocated each year with over citizen proposed 100 projects funded most years. The project is mostly driven by digital participation with secure electronic voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizens.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Neighbourhoods-Participatory-budgeting-in-Reykjavik-2011-2015.pdf|title=Better Neighborhoods 2011 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Citizens Foundation|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/754a9442-af7b-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2|title=The world watches Reykjavik's digital democracy experiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buenos Aires===
Buenos Aires adopted the PB process in 2001 hoping to emerge a political economy. There were manipulators like people watching the system and third parties forming for or against the PB system. Buenos aires used a system where the communities allocated where the government would take action first by ranking where the cities resources would go. After participation decreased by 50% in the 2005 cycle, PB came to an end and "the new communes" emerged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre a [[World Bank]] paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=5}} What are the insights regarding the opportunities for and barriers to accomplishing the goal of participatory-based budgeting? It takes leadership to flatten the organizational structure and make conscious ethical responsibilities as individuals and as committee members try to achieve the democratic goals means that the press should be present for the public, and yet the presence of the press inhibits the procedural need for robust discussion. Or, while representation is a cornerstone to participatory budgeting, a group being so large has an effect on the efficiency of the group. Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing [[clientelism]]. Other observations include that particular groups are less likely to participate once their demands have been met and that slow progress of public works can frustrate participants.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/24/pitfalls-participatory-budgeting|title=The Pitfalls of Participatory Budgeting|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-12-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pojulu''' (or Pajulu) ethnic groups are of the savanna lands in the [[:Category:White Nile|White Nile Valley]], in the [[:Category:Equatoria|Equatoria]] region of [[South Sudan]]. They are [[Nilotic peoples]] and part of the [[Karo people (East Africa)|Karo people]]&amp;nbsp;— which also includes [[Bari people|Bari]], [[Mundari people|Mundari]], [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], [[Kuku people|Kuku]], and [[Nyangwara]].

The Pojulu differentiate into smaller clans of Nyori, Morsak, Wonduruba, Goduck, Lobora, Moje, Mulusuk, Pirisa, Malari, Mankaro, Sadim, Jomi, Nyiga, Komojok, Limbe, Mundu, Jebele, Maraga and a few other smaller ones. The population of the Pojulu is estimated to be one million.

==Geography==
The majority of the Pojulu population are located in [[Lainya|Lainya county]] of [Yei state] former [[Central Equatoria|Central Equatoria state]], including [[Mukaya Payam]]. The Pojulu are also found in [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]] and [[Yei County|Yei]] counties of the state.  Pojulu people also occupy the area from Lainya to Kagwada, Kopera, Jamara and Mukaya. The centre of Pojulu will be Kenyi Payam from Mundu 20 miles, Mukaya 18 miles, Wonduruba 21 miles, Bereka 15 miles, Lainya 9 miles and from Kagwada 22 miles.

[[Image:Home-Lainya.jpg|thumb|right|Thatched roofed house of the Pojulu, in [[South Sudan]].]]
[[Image:Loka-teak.JPG|thumb|right|Loka [[Plantation Teak]], in the largest teak plantation of Africa.]]
The name Pojulu is derived from several sources. The Pojulu can be differentiated in the way all Bari speakers pronounce words, the way all other Bari speakers say their greetings, and the way each group socialize&amp;nbsp;— such as along the roads from Juba up to Lainya and from Lainya to Bereka and Wonduruba.

The environment in Central Equatoria is typically tropical. There can be arid periods with less rain. The neighbouring tribes are Bari to the east, Nyangwara to the north, Kakwa to the south, Mundu to the west, and Avukaya to the northwest.

==Language==
The Pojulu people speak the [[Kutuk language|Kutuk na Pojulu]] language, as other Karo people, but with particular dialectic variation which highlights the difference between the Pojulu among the Karo. This [[Bari language]] has some distinct variations linked to people's daily activities and traditions that have evolved over time from these experiences.

==History==
There is little knowledge about the origin of the Pojulu as a people, and their relation to the Bari and other Bari-speaking ethnic groups.

According to the 'Toposa Traditional History',&lt;ref&gt;''Toposa Traditional History'' - authors; Allen Lochul and C.G. Peter&lt;/ref&gt; the Bari-speaking people, of whom the Pojulu are an offshoot, are believed to have originated in the Kidepo Valley in the Kapoeta region. These Bari-speaking people were, however, forced out of Kapoeta and moved south and west by the Toposa, who are also believed to have migrated from Masindi port in Uganda. Being strong warriors, the Toposa raided and fought the Bari-speaking groups and took their girls, boys, women, and stock animals.

Therefore, the roots of the Pojulu community were traced through the use of linguistics and oral traditions to Bari ancestors in Kapoeta. The present Pojulu people are therefore pure descendants of in-common Bari ancestors through kinship. The present Toposa live in the Kidepo Valley, where the Pojulu originated. Statistically, the 21st-century Pojulu population is over 1.5 million people (2004 estimate).

In the past, the Pojulu forged a rare alliance with Moro, Mundu against the marauding Azande armies. This cut off the main Azande force and led to the formation of the Makaraka.

===Ancestral dispersion===
The common ancestor of Bari groups was called Julu Lo Jululon. The dispersion of the Bari group from Kapoeta region might have been caused by several factors, which include:
* Tribal wars in Kapoeta
* Drought which made people move about looking for water, food and pasture for their cattle and large tracts of land for agriculture
* Population explosion

This common Julu Lo Jululon ancestor, together with all his people followed the Nile and settled along the Eastern Bank of the White Nile. From here a second dispersion took place possibly due to pressure for more land. It is from here where the Pojulu (are believed to have) declared their independence from the major Bari group, broke away, crossed the Nile westwards and continued their journey up to Gumbiri near the present geographical zone.

In the Gumbiri area, a third or final dispersion of the Pojulu people took place probably due to power struggle or lack of enough agricultural land. Then the Pojulu settled down in their present geographical locations. This was before the European [[Scramble for Africa]].

The pre-history of the genesis of the Pojulu people originating from Kapoeta is illustrated by the similarities in the studies of linguistics and oral histories of the Toposa, Bari and the Pojulu peoples. These three groups have similar words in their languages:

{{Seealso|Ethnic violence in South Sudan#Equatorians-Dinka_fighting|l1=Equatorians-Dinka fighting}}
For most of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]], the fighting was focused in the [[Greater Upper Nile]] region. After the clashes in Juba in 2016, the fighting largely shifted to the previously safe haven of [[Equatoria]], where the bulk of SPLM-IO forces went for shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2016/11/14/who-can-stop-threat-genocide-south-sudan|title=Who can stop the threat of genocide in South Sudan?|date=14 November 2016|publisher=irinnews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts point to both sides targeting civilians on ethnic lines between the Dinka and the dozens of ethnic groups among the Equatorians who are historically in conflict with the Dinka, such as the Karo, who include the [[Bari people|Bari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southsudan-congo-refugees-idUSKBN13Q50M|title=South Sudanese flee as country edges closer to 'genocide'|date=1 December 2016|publisher=reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses report Dinka soldiers threatening villagers that they will kill all [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], another Karo people, for their alleged support to Machar and killing Pojulu people while sparing those who they find can speak [[Dinka language|Dinka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/us-seeks-sanctions-on-south-sudan-rebel-leader-army-chief/2016/11/18/95a75fd4-ae11-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_story.html|title=US seeks sanctions on South Sudan rebel leader, army chief|date=19 November 2016|publisher=washington post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UN investigation said rape was being used a tool of ethnic cleansing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-nations-says-rape-used-as-tool-for-ethnic-cleansing-in-south-sudan/|title=UN:Rape used as a tool of ethnic cleansing in South Sudan|date=2 December 2016|publisher=CBS news}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adama Dieng]], the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, warned of [[genocide]] after visiting areas of fighting in [[Yei River State|Yei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southsudan-uganda-refugees-idUSKBN1441QU|title=Hatred spills beyond South Sudan along with refugees|date=15 December 2016|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
The Pojulu economy is predominantly agrarian. The majority of Pojulu people are peasants practicing mixed farming: subsistence agriculture in which the main crops are [[cassava]], [[sorghum]], [[maize]], [[Sesame|simsim]], [[Peanut|groundnut]], [[wheat]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[cabbage]]s, [[bean]]s, [[onion]]s, [[tomato]]es, ((Okra)), etc. The Pojulu keep [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], few [[pig]]s, [[chicken]], [[ducks]] and [[cattle]] in some suitable areas due to the prevalence of [[tsetse fly]] which rendered cattle herding very difficult.

The Loka [[Plantation Teak]] forest is the largest [[teak]] [[plantation]] in [[Africa]]. The planted forest reserves within the Pojulu area are at Kawale, Lijo, Loka West, and Nuni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciaf.org.uk/where_we_work/africa/sudan/projects_in_sudan/loka_women_s_association sciaf.org.uk  -  Loka Plantation Teak; Loka Women's Association] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090107094204/http://www.sciaf.org.uk/where_we_work/africa/sudan/projects_in_sudan/loka_women_s_association |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agrarian economy==
[[Image:Pojulu Traditional Storage for Cereal Harvest.jpg|thumb|right|Known as GUGU, A storage for cereal crops such as [[maize]], [[Peanut|groundnut]], [[sorghum]], [[cow-peas]], [[beans]], and other general harvest ]]
The Pojulu Economy depends largely on subsistence production. It is an economy which aims to meet the daily food needs of the Pojulu community. Activities range from reliance on animal husbandry to total dependence on crop production. The Pojulu use human labour combined with the most elementary tools locally made. This primitive mode of production has always dominated the lives of the Pojulu.

The Pojulu grow both staple and cash crops. The staple crops are for consumption and include cassava, sesame, maize, beans, and groundnuts. The cash crops include tobacco, cotton, coffee, and timber.

The Pojulu are not sophisticated in agricultural implements. They use local agricultural tools made locally by their own blacksmiths, using scrap iron. The local blacksmiths produce tools such as hoes, sickles, axes, arrows, spears, and knives.

Animal wealth in Pojulu land includes goats, sheep, chickens, and cattle. They are raised for food, marriage dowries, and as 'animal cash crops' earning the Pojulu money to enable them to purchase other goods and services.

;Collective farming
The Pojulu practice "Mole"&amp;nbsp;– a type of collective farming where a group of people—5–10 or more—are called to clear a field for a neighbour or relative in one or two days.  Here, a goat is slaughtered and beer is brewed for these people. This system of farming is advantageous. It clears hectares of land just in a day or so. "Lukonin" is also practiced, where two or more people agree to work in their farms on rotational basis. This system also saves time and effort. Women also do the same during preparation of land for planting and weeding of crops.

;Subsistence agriculture
Past colonial regimes did nothing to improve the Pojulu reliance on subsistence agriculture. Successive Arab governments since [[Sudan]] independence perpetuated this primitive mode of production. The continuous civil wars exacerbated the problems until the 2011 formation of [[South Sudan]]. However, despite the practice of subsistence agriculture, the Pojulu never suffered a major famine. There was self-sufficiency in food production for local consumption in the Pojulu community. This food sufficiency is now sustaining the remnants from the civil wars in the Pojulu land.

;Pojulu chiefs
The Pojulu chiefs play a great role in encouraging agricultural production. In the villages, chiefs pass local orders banning people from coming to the town or local station in the mornings. Bars for "Kwete" can be closed until noon, resulting in morning work at the farms. The chiefs are polygamous. Citizens volunteer to grow food crops for chiefs and their families. Meanwhile, during visits to the villages, the chiefs return food to needy families, a 'Pojulu food relief program.'

==Culture==
Like other communities, the Pojulu have evolved an oral culture expressed in songs, poems, dance, music, folklore, magic.

Pojulu is the name by which this Bari-speaking ethnic community is known. Pojulu society ascribe to certain norms and values. As with other communities, pojulu is a male dominated society. The eldest male member of the family is entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the rest unless he demonstrates incompetence and irresponsibility.

[[Image:Peopel in Lainya County.jpg|thumb|Pojulu from Lainya line up across the road to receive the SPLM delegation from Juba Southern Sudan 2009]]

In most Pojulu areas, the eldest male members are charged with the entire responsibilities of the family or clan and elder daughters are also considered responsible for the well-being of the older people. This is one of the reasons that led Pojulu women taking the role of being good carers. The Pojulu of today is different from the Pojulu of 50 years ago.

===Marriage===
Marriage begins with courtship and once the prospective bride and groom have decided to marry each other, the matter is then reported to both families for endorsement. Pojulu dowry is in the form of goats, cattle and cash money. This is accompanied by celebrations and merriment. The Pojulu dowry is not settled at one go&amp;nbsp;– even if there were prospects for that. The explanation is to maintain links and relationship between the two families, and during the marriage event there is a whole celebration for the whole relatives which includes dancing, drinking, singing and conversations.

The Pojulu specifically marry to produce children. Provision of services by the wife is secondary. If the new wife fails to conceive within a reasonable length of time, this creates worry and disappointment to the two families. Marriage in the Pojulu takes several methods and steps:

;1.1 Mi'ya (Arranged marriage)
This is a marriage arranged by both parents of a girl and parents of a boy. When both families have agreed to the marriage, then the dowry is paid in installments until it is completed.

;1.2 Finding a match
This is normally in social, cultural activities. For example, dances, funerals, marriage ceremonies, schools and/or even at homes. Following this, contacts are initiated and in most cases through associates (friends, relatives and/or parents), love messages are transmitted to both parties.

;1.3 Exchange of visits and presents (Tu'yo)
In this stage, the two families or lovers begin to exchange visits to acquaint themselves and/or study each other. Other visits may be followed by exchange of presents which range from pottery, basketry, handcraft, food items, beer, etc. In some instances, songs and praises are constructed to express the feelings by the two parties.

;1.4 Declaration of marriage (Piya/Tobiya)
In recognition of the above steps, both families—aware of what is happening—begin to make necessary arrangements to have the two parties announce their intentions in the presence of the members family members, friends and wellwishers. This stage is considered the most binding for any meaningful marriage in the Pojulu culture. It is likened to taking an oath. Part of the bride wealth is normally settled, and once accepted the occasion is celebrated with drinks, food and dances lasting for days.

;1.5 Handing over ceremony (Nyomoji)
Following declaration of marriage, the handing over ceremony is performed. This ceremony is prepared well in advance for the bride to be escorted to her new home. It is a commitment of both families, friends and wellwishers. On the side of the bride, the family ensures provision of support for domestic items such as cooking pots, bedding, and other domestic appliances necessary for starting a new home. Drinks are prepared for this function. On the side of the bridegroom, the family also prepares to receive their son's in-laws and the new bride. This occasion in itself is a big celebration characterized by dances and drinking. In performing this function, the balance of the bride wealth may be settled.

Another important feature in this function following the above, a few days later, is empowerment. The active player in this process is normally the mother-in-law through arrangements with the father-in-law of the bride to introduce her to her full responsibilities and to witness the first time the bride eats food prepared by her mother-in-law. This is a long Pojulu tradition that a bride or bridegroom does not eat food in the family where she/he is married to or marrying from until this function is performed. This is believed to be a measure of integrity and respect.

;2. Forced marriage
In this kind of marriage, the boy takes the girl by force. It is a marriage that involves a lot of problems between the two families and may cause tribal or clan fights. However, after a heated debate and amicable discussion, marriage may be agreed upon and dowry is then paid.

;3. Marriage through courtship
As it is briefly mentioned above, this is the normal and civilized method of marriage. Because choice of this marriage is an affair of both the boy and girl. When the relationship between the boy and the girl becomes strong, the girl then reveals it to her parents. The boy and girl are interviewed on whether they love each other and are willing to get married. Then, the parents give their approval or rejection. This is followed by screening of both families to check whether any one family has a social defect or bad social history. Neither the boy nor the girl will eat in either home, nor parents with future in-laws. Marriage is by parental consent and it is considered the most advisable and preferable of all marriages.

;Children
The main aim of the Pojulu marriage is to produce children. It is for this reason that the mothers of the girls are advised to be strict on their girls' behaviors and movement. They are advised and coached well to be good housewives and good future mothers.

;Domestic problems
In a Pojulu family, there can be 'problems' which make lives of a new married woman uncomfortable. The new wife is kept under suspicion throughout her life in the household:
#If the wife takes a long time to conceive or bear a child, she is suspected of being a 'loose woman' and therefore barren.
#During delivery, if labour takes a day or more, the mother is suspected of having committed adultery. She will then be requested to publicly declare the person involved in the adultery.
#If a newly born baby does not breastfeed (rejecting the breast), the mother is also suspected and the marriage is jeopardized and may lead to divorce.
#If the husband  is continuously unhealthy or his health deteriorates, or if he happens to have a wound that does not heal quickly, the wife is suspected, which may result in divorce.

Today, however, as a result of effects of civilization and the influence of religions such as Christianity, some of these 'problems' have been abandoned.

;Birth confinement
Immediately after giving birth, the mother of the newly born child is confined in her hut or room for seven days, but assisted by young children. She will have her meals in the room with the young children while taking care of her new baby. The whole period of her confinement may last 21 days. During this period, other women in the family or co-wives are charged with the responsibility of all the daily services in the house.

;Naming ceremony
The occasion of giving a name to the newly born child is called "Yiji" in the Pojulu. Much food is prepared, e.g. meat, beans, variety of oils, beer, etc. Some people may slaughter a goat because of happiness in a new family member being added to their number.

After the traditions are performed, usually by women, a dance is staged when the women, their husbands and most of the youth in the location join in the dance and drink to the health of the newborn.

===Death===
Death, when it occurs—even in a natural circumstance of disease or old age—is usually attributed to some mishap and to it having been instigated. Family members have their heads shaved throughout the mourning period. Mourning may last up to a month.

In the Pojulu, death is treated with caution and respect for the deceased. A burial is normally done in the morning or evening—in the cooler hours of the day. Before any burial of the dead, maternal uncles have to be consulted and cleared of their requirements. The funerals can be peaceful if the traditional requirements are fulfilled otherwise, abrogation of the traditions/demands causes chaos. Christianity though has had quite an impact so much so that some traditional requirements considered evil in the Church are no longer being practiced. Today, many funerals are conducted in a Christian way.

===Traditional authority===
[[Image:Pojulu Tribe location.png|thumb|right|[[Geographical]] location of the Pojulu Tribe]]
The Pojulu [[tribal chief|chief]] has the role of a political leader with judicial powers. It is hereditary, usually falling to the eldest son of the departed chief. The Pojulu chief is always assisted by a council of elders, who come from different clans or families. The criterion of choosing these people is wisdom, bravery, and experience in matters pertaining to the tribe.

===Spirituality===
The Pojulu, like other Bari-speaking people, believe in a Supreme Being [[God|god (ŋun)]] who is the creator. They also believe in the existence of spirits of the departed ancestors. Many of these beliefs are now fading under the influence of modernity and [[Christianity]].
[https://www.youtube.com/user/Pojulunity#play/all/uploads-all/1/DwYC5Oy0wsc  Choir in Pojulu]

The Pojulu practiced African Traditional Religion before the introduction of Christianity. They practice some form of ancestral spirit worship. They strongly believe in one God. According to the Pojulu, it is He who creates, protects and destroys all mankind, irrespective of race, religion or political orientation. They believe that humankind is subject to the one Supreme power of God.

====Biri religion (1910–1917)====
There was among the Pojulu, a religion known as the Biri religion. This was a cultural import. The Biri religion came to the Pojulu, brought by the Muna Akufi between 1910–1917. In this religion, people were baptized; however, unlike Christianity, in the Biri religion, water is not used in baptism. When [[Christianity]] was introduced, it was accepted without resistance. The first man was baptised by water in 1920, in Lainya County.

Traces of the Biri religion are still known among the Pojulu today in the names of the converts. Because believers of the Biri religion  received names such as Makambili, Kamara, Doromo, Piri-Piri, Kamisa, Maamet, Malangi, etc. The converts became disciples. They were considered holy and they spread the Biri religion to other lands. They  traveled from village to village&amp;nbsp;– converting unbelievers into the Biri religion. This was their fellowship. When the Biri religion died out, it gave way to Christianity which was better able to meet the spiritual and material needs of the believers.

====Islam====
Since the [[Ottoman Empire]], and through the Mahdiya, Islam has little impact on the Pojulu. And during the era of General Ibrahim Abboud (1958–1964), attempts were made to introduce Islam to the Pojulu. These attempts were unsuccessful. Khalwa and Maahads flourished in the major towns and it was in these towns that some Pojulu converted to Islam and adopted Islamic names.

====Christianity====
[[Christianity]] is foreign to the Pojulu; it came to Yei in 1916 and spread throughout Pojulu lands.  In 1929, Nugent School was opened in Loka, and from there Christianity became more widespread.  The African Traditional Religions (ART) prepared some of the Pojulu to practice Christianity.  Christian Pojulus have gathered to create and develop Christian institutions, such as [[St. Peters Yondoru]], and to train Christian leaders.

[[Image:Watching-performance-2.jpg|thumb|right|Pojulu people gather together on [[art]], [[music]] etc.]]

===Education===

[[Education]] to the Pojulu is lifelong. It takes place anywhere in the community, at work and at play and from cradle to the grave. Such education is defined as the "aggregate of all the process by means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes, and other forms of behavior of positive value in the society in which they live". Education includes all the learning experiences that shape one into a person.

:Traditional goals
The goals of Pojulu traditional education include:
#To teach children customs, mores, and traditions in order to preserve the culture and ideals of the Pojulu society.
#To give young people skills and knowledge for making a living as adults. For instance the skills of: gardening, farming, hunting, gathering, fishing, marriage, singing and dancing.
#To preserve the Pojulu traditions, leading a life loyal to the elders, clan, and tribe and to be faithful and respectful to the gods.
#To improve ethical character, training for obedience and self-discipline. The goal is a disciplined individual, in a disciplined family, living in social harmony in a disciplined society.

;Early education
The Pojulu initiated and developed their own indigenous system of education suited to their environment and for their needs. The Pojulu therefore have practiced education since their cultural formation.

The home is the child's first school in the Pojulu society. The fireplace is the classroom. It is here that the foundation should be laid for a life of service. Its principle is to be taught not merely in theory but in practice. They are to shape the whole personality and life of the Pojulu child.

The subject matter taught at home is various and wide. Very early the lesson of helpfulness is taught the child. As soon as strength and reasoning powers are sufficiently developed, they are given duties to perform at home. They are encouraged to help the father and the mother and convenience them first before their own needs, to watch for opportunities, to cheer and assist brothers, sisters, playmates and to show kindness to the aged, the sick, the old and the unfortunate. They are taught to find joy in service and sacrifice for the goods of others and the community at large.

;Teachers
The family circle, the neighbours and the tribal groupings exercised great influence and impact on the growth, development and education of the Pojulu child. This is the principle of communitarians, that the Pojulu child is not left to the parents to bring it up. The community also participates in the development and education of the child. The child is a collective responsibility of the parents, clan and the tribe.

Pojulu indigenous type of education starts at the time the child is born and ends with death. The Pojulu system of education is a participatory, practical system of education. It imparts what the child must know through the family and clan traditions. It is generally an informal education. In this system, there are no buildings, classrooms or schools, only the fireplace, big shady trees, etc., which provide the classrooms. Teachers are available in the person of the father, the mother, grandmother, baby-sitter, brothers and sisters, relatives and the entire community or neighbourhood.

===Indigenous education===

Most skills about knowledge about things and the environment are absorbed by children through observation and initiation of the elders and older peers. Some children learn by apprenticeship. The importance of both parents on the growing and developing child is of great value as they are closest to the child.

Parents and the community teach the children the laws and customs of the clan and tribe, which govern moral code, civic codes, and general rules of etiquette in the community. This category includes the study of civics, sociology and the tribal laws.  The late president of Kenya, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, wrote "when the child has grown beyond childhood, the father takes charge of part of the boy's education, and the mother takes the whole responsibility of the girl's education and a part of the boy's education."

The girls do domestic duties to help their mothers, such as cooking and family care. They also learn preparation of land for planting and weeding of crops. The boys' duties include rearing domestic animals and gathering firewood for cooking and heat. Boys learn about vegetation identifying their types, uses and names—including various trees in the nearby forest. They learn which trees are useful for building houses and grain stores, such as those which resist white ants. They must identify which trees are good for making bows and arrows for weapons in hunting animals.  The boys also learn about the birds: which are edible and/or harmful to crops; and how to trap or hunt them.

The boys and girls learn the plants that provide the Pojulu with [[herbal medicine]]s, such as "Dikori Ti&amp;nbsp;– Melo", in the community medicine tradition.

===Missionary schools===
The first missionaries to enter [[Yei, South Sudan|Yei]] were Reverends Shaw and Gwynne in 1911. However missionary activity did not begin in Yei until 1917 when schools were founded; there  had been a prevalence of sleeping sickness in the area, affecting both the Pojulu and missionaries.
In 1929, missionary work extended to [[Loka]] where Nugent School was opened for boys. This was the only Christian intermediate missionary school  in Pojulu land. Lainya Technical School was also opened around the same time, for training in the trades, such as for carpenters, masons and brick makers, and plumbers.

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Yei]] built the Yei Girls' School in 1940. This school recruited pupils as far as Pojulu land in [[Loka]] and [[Lainya]]. Miss Gilbert became the headmistress of the Yei Girls' School, until retirement in the late 1960s. Pupils were taught in Bangalla, and later in Bari and English.

==Present day==
The long running [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] caused drastic changes in the lives of the Pojulu. Many were displaced and this eroded their social and family fabric. At its formal conclusion in 2005 a separate administrative unit was established separating the Pojulu from the Kakwa and others in Yei River District. In 2011 the Pojulu lands became part of the new nation of [[South Sudan]].

===Diaspora===
The [[diaspora]] of the Pojulu people is highlighted by the move to [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC), [[South Africa]] and [[Egypt]]. Others live in displaced people's camps in [[Juba, Sudan]], [[Khartoum]] and other [[town]]s. Some are now living in the US, UK, Israel, [[Europe]], New Zealand and Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8396">The '''Qiandao Lake incident''' ({{zh|s=千岛湖事件|t=千島湖事件|p=Qiāndǎo hú shìjiàn}}) refers to the 1994 kidnap and murder of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] tourists and local guides and staff in the [[Qiandao Lake]] scenic area, in [[Zhejiang]], [[People's Republic of China]] ("[[China]]"). Insensitive treatment by the local government and police force after the event, including censoring information and unprofessional criminal investigation procedures, led to a public backlash in [[Taiwan]] ("[[Republic of China]]") against the [[Government of China|Chinese government]]. This led to increased support in Taiwan for [[Taiwan independence|independence]].

==Incident==

On March 31, 1994, a ferry named ''Hai Rui'' (海瑞号) was hijacked by three men in Qiandao Lake, located in [[Chun'an County]], [[Hangzhou]], in [[Zhejiang Province]]. The ship ended up on fire, and all 32 people on board at the time were killed, including 24 passengers from [[Taiwan]], along with 6 [[Chinese people|Chinese]] crew and two Chinese tour guides.

The ''Hai Rui'' ferry was supposed to have returned on the night of the 31st. Instead, on the morning of April 1, it was discovered ablaze. The local civilians immediately reported it to the police.  The police did not find any passengers or sailors on the ship initially, and the Chun'an County government organized police, on-duty troops and civilians to search in the Qiandao Lake region, but did not discover any of the missing passengers. After the fire was put out, the police discovered 32 bodies in the lower cabin of the ship.  However, during the investigation of the case, the local police department did not inform  the general public of the progress of the investigation.  This led to the public's belief that the local government was blocking information, concealing the events and controlling the media.

==Investigation==

On April 2, 1994, the [[Hangzhou]] police department arranged medical experts to analyze all the discovered bodies.  On April 4, the families of the victims arrived in Chun'an County from Taiwan. China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) set up receptions in various cities to accommodate the families; at the same time, the Taiwanese [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) requested assistance in getting the families to the scene of the incident, to deal with related issues, but this was refused by ARATS.  On April 6, the [[Zhejiang province|Zhejiang provincial]] police department joined the investigation.

On the same day, the Zhejiang government invited Master Jiyun of the Hangzhou [[Lingyin Temple]] to do the ceremony that release souls from purgatory, but denied the families of the victims to visit the remains of the victims and the request to review the autopsy report. Under the protest of the families, the remains were cremated in [[Tonglu County]] in Hangzhou.  The remains of the victims were given to the families to bury; the ashes of the Taiwanese tourists were given to their family for them to bring back to Taiwan with the assistance of the Taiwanese Changfeng Travel Agency.

The People's Republic of China local government initially reported this as a ship fire, but this statement was strongly opposed by the families of the victims and other Taiwanese people. The foreign media also issued all kinds of reports and speculations.  On April 9, the then president of [[Taiwan]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] publicly criticized the [[Communist Party of China]] as acting "like bandits", and claimed that the case was robbery committed by [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]] soldiers, as had been claimed by Taiwanese intelligence.  After the case was over, some thought that the reason that the provincial government of Zhejiang did not publicize case facts was not to jeopardise the investigation. But, there were other opinions that thought it was essentially censorship.  On April 12, the vice president of the ARATS [[Tang Shubei]] met the deputy general secretary of the SEF [[Shi Qiping]], and proclaimed that the incident was only a ship fire, and stressed that China authorities would deal with the problems created by the incident to their best ability.

However, the Taiwanese side strongly disagreed with the statement by Tang. They believed that China local government initially blocked the information, and then refused to change its attitude. The Taiwanese authority responded to this by announcing "all interflows between the two straights to be temporarily stopped", and halted all tour travels to China starting May 1. The Board of Trade of the Taiwan stopped the discussion on the investment case to the China, and the Board of Education stopped the culture interflow between the two straits.  The travel agencies were also halted from going on tour to the PRC. All the connections between Taiwan and China were nearly completely cut off.

On April 15 the three suspects were arraigned by the court. On April 17, the PRC Zhejiang provincial police department announced that the case had been solved, and that it was a "major robbery, arson and murder case".  Three suspects were arrested. Two of the suspects were military personnel, one being a retired serviceman, another being the brother of an armed police officer. Regardless, the families of the victims questioned the possibility of 32 men subdued by three criminals.  On April 18 the PRC Premier [[Li Peng]] announced talks to explain the case.  On May 8, the Taiwanese SEF organized a group to go to the scene of the incident to comprehend the case.  On June 3, PRC authorities in Hangzhou City announced public prosecution.  On June 10, the common pleas of the Hangzhou City reached the last instance.  During the trial, the ARATS invited the SEF to visit the public prosecution, and contacted the SEF once again before the last instance, but was refused by the SEF. The families of the victims also refused to visit the process of the trial.

On June 12, the verdict was made, and the three suspects Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, Yu Aijun were all charged of [[robbery]] and [[murder]], and were sentenced to death.  On June 19, the three convicted were executed.

==Consequences==
The Chinese government avoided further clarification of several disputed points that the Taiwanese authorities addressed. The Taiwanese [[Mainland Affairs Council]] announced a statement on June 15 that criticized the way the PRC authorities treated the Qiandao Lake Incident, which may lead the case to be unsettled. Because evidence was unclear, information about the case could not be verified and therefore led to speculations and rumors. Eventually, the Qiandao Lake Incident turned from a regular criminal case into a serious political event.

To a greater extent, the Qiandao Lake Incident jeopardized the reconciliation on the relations between Taiwan and China. It was a crucial event that turned the public opinion of Taiwan around on the matters of [[Chinese reunification]]. The percentage of Taiwanese people that supported reunification decreased by a margin of 20% after the incident, while the percentage in support of [[Taiwan independence]] instantly went up by a margin of 10%. Around half the general population supported the present situation between Taiwan and China to be unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;According to the result of [[United Daily News]] public poll in April 1994, the percentage of people who agreed or supported [[Taiwan Independence]] went up by 42%.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the direct consequences of the incident, which displayed the dissatisfaction of the Taiwanese people against the China government.  As a result, Taiwanese tourism in China suffered major setbacks, as the Taiwanese government temporarily halted group tour travel to China after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotel-online.com/Trends/AsiaPacificJournal/TravelBetweenChinaAndTaiwan_1997.html#Fig%202 Total Arrival of Visitors from Taiwan to the Mainland]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randall Brent "Randy" Woodfield''' (born  December 26, 1950) is an [[United States|America]]n [[serial killer]], [[serial rapist|rapist]], [[kidnapping|kidnapper]], and [[robbery|robber]] who was dubbed '''The I-5 Killer''' or '''The I-5 Bandit''' by the media due to the crimes he committed along the [[Interstate 5|Interstate 5 corridor]] running through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]]. Before his capture, the I-5 Killer was suspected of multiple [[sexual assault]]s and [[murder]]s. Though convicted in only one murder, he has been linked to a total of 18, and is suspected of having killed up to 44 people.

A native of Oregon, Woodfield was the third child of a prominent [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] family. He began to exhibit abnormal behaviors during his teenage years, and was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] while still in high school. An athlete for much of his life, Woodfield played as a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Portland State Vikings]], and was drafted by the [[National Football League|NFL]] in 1974 to play for the [[Green Bay Packers]], but was cut from the team during training after a series of indecent exposure arrests.

In 1975, he began a string of robberies and sexual assaults on women in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], which he committed at knifepoint. Between 1980 and 1981, Woodfield committed multiple murders in cities along the I-5 corridor in Washington, Oregon, and California; his earliest-documented murder was that of Cherie Ayers, a former classmate whom he had known since childhood, in December 1980. After committing numerous robberies, sexual assaults, and murders, Woodfield was arrested in March 1981, and convicted in June for the murder of Shari Hull and attempted murder of her co-worker, Beth Wilmot, and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] plus 90 years. In a subsequent trial, he was convicted of [[sodomy]] and improper use of a weapon in a sexual assault case, receiving 35 additional years to his sentence.

Woodfield has never confessed to any of the crimes he has been accused or convicted of. Though he has only been convicted of one murder and one attempted murder, he has been linked via [[DNA]] and other methods to numerous unsolved homicides in the ensuing decades. Authorities have estimated his total number of killings to be as a many as 44, and [[CBS News]] named him one of the deadliest serial killers in American history.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|work=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/americas-deadliest-serial-killers/9/|title=America's Deadliest Serial Killers: Randall Woodfield|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently incarcerated at the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]].

Woodfield was raised in [[Otter Rock, Oregon]], a small seaside town on the central Oregon coast, approximately {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]].&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; Popular among his peers, Woodfield was a [[American football|football]] star at [[Newport High School (Oregon)|Newport High School]].&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; Though his childhood was by all accounts stable, Woodfield began to exhibit sexually [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunction]]al behaviors during junior high school, particularly [[Indecent exposure|exposing]] himself in public.{{sfn|Lachmann|2001|pages=123–4}} While in high school, Woodfield exposed himself to a group of teenage girls on [[Yaquina Bay Bridge]], and was arrested for indecent exposure.&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; His football coaches helped conceal the incident to prevent him from being ousted from the team,&lt;ref name=letters&gt;{{cite web|title=The Serial Killer Letters: A Penetrating Look Inside the Minds of Murderers|url=http://www.charlespresspub.com/woodfield.html|work=Excerpt from ''The Serial Killer Letters''|publisher=The Charles Press, Publishers|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his parents forced him to attend therapy over the incident.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

After graduating high school, Woodfield's criminal record was [[Expungement in the United States|expunged]], and he attended [[Treasure Valley Community College]] in [[Ontario, Oregon]], later transferring to [[Portland State University]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in 1970, where he played for the [[Portland State Vikings]] as a [[wide receiver]].&lt;ref name=eggers&gt;{{cite web|work=Portland Tribune|author=Eggers, Kerry|url=http://portlandtribune.com/pt/12-sports/341440-215721-i-5-killer-played-for-psu-before-taking-dark-turn|title='I-5 Killer' played for PSU before taking dark turn|date=January 24, 2017|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rule|1984|p=304}} At Portland State, he was active in [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], a [[Christianity|Christian]] student group, and lived in an apartment located on the [[South Park Blocks]].&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt;

Gary Hamblet, Woodfield's football coach, recalled: "When he was with me, he was the nicest, most gentlemanly kid I ever knew. He was quiet and polite, hard-working and real coachable. He sucked in everything I tried to coach him."&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; Other teammates and peers of Woodfield recalled him as "soft-spoken" and "kind of a loner" who "didn't have a lot of friends," but noted his athletic capabilities.&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; Despite his thriving in college, Woodfield was arrested on several occasions for petty crimes: first in 1970 for [[vandalism|vandalizing]] the apartment of his ex-girlfriend, and later in 1972 for [[public indecency]]{{sfn|Lamovsky|Rosetti|DeMarco|2007|p=250}} in [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; In 1973, he was arrested again for public indecency in [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]].&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

Woodfield chose to drop out of college three semesters shy of graduating with his [[Bachelor of science|B.S.]] in [[physical education]], and was selected as a wide receiver in the [[1974 NFL Draft]] by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the 17th round (428th pick).{{sfn|Lamovsky|Rosetti|DeMarco|2007|p=250}}&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=November 21, 2016|url=https://www.si.com/longform/true-crime/i-5-killer-green-bay-packers-randall-woodfield/index.html|title=The I-5 Killer|accessdate=February 9, 2018|author=Wertheim, L. John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager [[Dan Devine]]'s last season, but could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster.&lt;ref name=greenbay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20101010/GPG0101/10100630/Serial-killer-Randall-Woodfield-was-with-Green-Bay-Packers-in-1974|author= Walter, Tony|title= Serial killer Randall Woodfield was with Green Bay Packers in 1974|work=[[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holdings|first=H.W.|title=Crime: The Case of the I-5 Killer|journal=20th &amp; 21st Century Crime|date=March 2010|series=U.S. History}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being cut by the Packers, Woodfield played the 1974 season with the semi-pro Manitowoc Chiefs and worked for [[Oshkosh Truck]].&lt;ref name=greenbay/&gt; A similar arrest, in Portland, earned him more suspended time in June 1973. In 1974, after a dozen "flashing" incidents called unwelcome attention to Woodfield, the Packers formally cut him from the [[National Football League|NFL]].{{sfn|Lamovsky|Rosetti|DeMarco|2007|pages=250–1}}

===First crime spree===
Woodfield left [[Wisconsin]] in late 1974 and returned to Portland, disgraced by his failure to maintain his football career.&lt;ref name=cf&gt;{{cite web|work=CrimeFeed|publisher=[[Investigation Discovery]]|url=http://crimefeed.com/2017/06/randall-woodfield-the-green-bay-packer-who-became-the-i-5-serial-killer/|title=Randall Woodfield: The Green Bay Packer Who Became the I-5 Killer|date=June 26, 2017|author=McPadden, Mike|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1975,{{sfn|Lamovsky|Rosetti|DeMarco|2007|p=250}} several Portland women were accosted by a knife-wielding man, forced to perform [[oral sex]] and then robbed of their handbags.&lt;ref name=eggers/&gt; Law enforcement responded to the string of crimes by having female police officers act as [[decoy]]s.&lt;ref name=cf/&gt; On March 3, 1975, Woodfield was arrested after being caught with marked money from one of the undercover officers. Upon interrogation, he confessed to the crimes, blaming poor sexual impulse control, which he claimed was a result of his use of [[steroids]].&lt;ref name=cf/&gt; In April 1975, he pled guilty to reduced charges of second-degree robbery. Woodfield was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was freed on [[parole]] in July 1979, after having served four years.&lt;ref name=cf/&gt;

==Murders and subsequent crimes==
===First murders===
On October 9, 1980, Cherie Ayers, an X-ray technician and former classmate of Woodfield, was raped and murdered in her apartment in the 9000 block of SW Ninth Place in downtown Portland.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Her body was discovered on October 11 by her fiancé; she had been bludgeoned and stabbed repeatedly in the neck.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Ayers, a [[University of Oregon]] graduate, had known Woodfield since second grade, having attended the same schools in Newport.&lt;ref name=ayers&gt;{{cite web|work=The Oregonian|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/beaverton/index.ssf/2006/03/dna_links_i-5_killer_to_1980_s.html|title=DNA links 'I-5 killer' to 1980 slaying|author=Bernstein, Maxine|date=March 1, 2006|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Woodfield's prior four-year imprisonment, he and Ayers had corresponded via letters.&lt;ref name=ayers/&gt; Suspecting Woodfield's involvement, Ayers' family provided his name to law enforcement; he was questioned but refused to sit for a [[polygraph test]].&lt;ref name=ayers/&gt; Homicide detectives found his answers generally "evasive and deceptive" but, because his blood type did not match [[semen]] found in the victim's body, no charges were filed.&lt;ref name=ayers/&gt;

One month later, on the morning of November 27 ([[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]), Woodfield arrived at the north Portland home of Darcey Renee Fix, 22, planning to assault her.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Woodfield had known Fix during college as an ex-girlfriend of one his close friends.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Douglas Keith Altig, 24, was at Fix's home when Woodfield arrived. Both Fix and Altig were subsequently bound and shot to death execution-style in the home, and Fix's .32-caliber revolver was missing from the scene.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Due to his acquaintance with Fix, Woodfield was questioned in the murders, but law enforcement found no concrete evidence pointing to his involvement.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

===I-5 Bandit robberies===
[[File:Randall_Woodfield_1980_composites.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Various composites of Woodfield during his robberies in late 1980 and early 1981]]
After committing the murders of Fix and Altig, Woodfield began a series of robberies throughout the northwest: On December 9, 1980, Woodfield, wearing a fake beard, held up a Vancouver, Washington gas station at gunpoint.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; In [[Eugene, Oregon]] four nights later, on December 13, he raided an ice cream parlor; on December 14, he robbed a drive-in restaurant in [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt; During one of the robberies, Woodfield wore what appeared to be a [[Band-Aid]] or athletic tape across the bridge of his nose, similar to [[nasal strip]]s worn by football players.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; On December 21, Woodfield (again wearing a false beard) accosted a waitress in [[Seattle]], trapping her in a restaurant bathroom and forcing her at gunpoint to [[masturbation|masturbate]] him.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

By January 1981, law enforcement had dubbed the robber the "I-5 Bandit", given his apparent preference for committing crimes along the Interstate 5 corridor. On January 8, he held up the same Vancouver gas station he had robbed in December, this time forcing a female attendant to expose her breasts after he emptied the cash register. Three days later, on January 11, he robbed a market in Eugene. The next day, January 12, he shot and wounded a female grocery clerk at a store in [[Sutherlin, Oregon]].

On January 14, a man matching the description of the I-5 bandit and wearing a false beard [[home invasion|invaded a home]] occupied by two sisters, aged eight and ten; he forced the girls to disrobe and sexually assaulted them. Four days later, in Salem, a man matching the same description entered an office building and sexually abused two women, Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot, after which he killed Hull and wounded Wilmot, leaving her for dead. On January 26 and 29, he traveled to southern Oregon and committed robberies in Eugene, [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] and [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]]. In the latter location, two females, a clerk and customer, were assaulted by the robber.

===Later murders===
On February 3, 1981, the bodies of Donna Eckard, 37, and her 14-year-old daughter were found together in a bed in their home at Mountain Gate, California, north of [[Redding, California|Redding]]. Each had been shot several times in the head. Forensic tests showed that the girl had also been sodomized. The same day in Redding, a female store clerk was kidnapped, raped and sodomized in a holdup. An identical crime was reported in [[Yreka]] on February 4, with the same man robbing an [[Ashland, Oregon]] motel that night. Five days later in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], a man matching the I-5 Bandit's description held up a fabric store, molesting the clerk and her customer before he left. On February 12, 1981, robberies committed by a man matching the I-5 Bandit's description occurred in Vancouver, [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], and [[Bellevue, Washington]]; the Olympia and Bellevue incidents included three sexual assaults.

Upon an impending visit to Portland, Woodfield planned a [[Valentine's Day]] party at the city's downtown [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]], inviting friends and acquaintances from college.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; After no guests came, Woodfield drove to the [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] home of 18-year-old Julie Reitz, whom Woodfield had met while working as a bouncer at The Faucet, a bar in Portland.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; He arrived at her home around 2 a.m. on February 15; around 4 a.m., he raped and then shot Reitz in the head, killing her.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Police investigating the scene determined that Reitz had had a glass of wine with her attacker, and had also begun to prepare coffee: A package of instant coffee was discovered on the kitchen counter, and water in a kettle had been left to completely boil down.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

==Arrest and trials==
By February 28, the investigation was now focused on Woodfield, but by then the I-5 Bandit had struck three more times: in Eugene on February 18 and 21, and with another sexual assault in Corvallis on February 25. Detectives in [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion County]] assembled a call log showing Woodfield had placed calls via [[Telephone card|calling cards]] at [[pay phone]]s near the murder sites around the times they were committed.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

On March 5, 1981, Woodfield was brought into the Salem Police Department for an interrogation after Lisa Garcia positively identified him in a photo lineup.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; His apartment in [[Springfield, Oregon]] was subsequently searched two days later by [[search warrant|warrant]]; inside, law enforcement discovered a spent .32 shell casing inside a racquetball bag, as well as a roll of tape that matched the tape found on the victims.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; On March 7, Woodfield was taken into custody after being positively identified by several Oregon robbery victims.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; On March 16, indictments for murder, rape, sodomy, attempted kidnapping, armed robbery, and illegal possession of firearms were initiated from various jurisdictions in Washington and Oregon.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

In the summer of 1981, Woodfield was tried in Salem for the murder of Hull, as well as charges of sodomy and attempted murder (of Wilmot).&lt;ref name=trial1&gt;National News Briefs. [[United Press International]], October 13, 1981, Tuesday, PM cycle.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmot testified against him in the trial, and was key in the prosecution's conviction.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Chris Van Dyke, son of actor [[Dick Van Dyke]], was the Marion County, Oregon [[District Attorney]] at the time and prosecuted the case.&lt;ref name=cf/&gt; Van Dyke would later characterize Woodfield as "the coldest, most detached defendant I've ever seen."&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; On June 26, 1981, after three-and-a-half hours of deliberation, Woodfield was convicted on all counts and sentenced to [[life in prison]] plus 90 years.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

In October 1981, a second trial was held in Benton County, in which Woodfield received sodomy and weapons charges tied to one of the attacks in a restaurant bathroom.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Prior to this trial, his counsel attempted to move the trial from [[Willamette Valley]]; he felt that, owing to the publicity the case received, Woodfield would not get a fair trial there.&lt;ref name=pretrial&gt;Judge refuses a change of venue for ''I-5 bandit'' suspect. United Press International, September 24, 1981, Thursday, PM cycle.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the case denied counsel's request, along with a request to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] a prosecution witness in an effort to determine if that witness had been influenced by the media coverage.&lt;ref name=pretrial/&gt; Woodfield was convicted by the jury, and had an additional 35 years added to his already-instated sentence.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

Despite the apparent links with countless other crimes and homicides, Woodfield would not be prosecuted for the majority of the crimes he was believed to have committed. Unable to afford multiple trials, the State of Oregon was satisfied with Woodfield's existing life sentence.&lt;ref name=trial1/&gt;

==Post-conviction==
Woodfield is serving his sentences at the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] in Salem.&lt;ref name=injury&gt;Domestic News. [[United Press International]], October 3, 1983, Monday, AM cycle.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1983, he was injured by a fellow inmate during a prison disturbance.&lt;ref name=injury/&gt; In April 1987, Woodfield filed a $12 million [[libel]] suit against author [[Ann Rule]],&lt;ref name=suit&gt;Tims, Dana. Murderer's libel suit dismissed. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', January 18, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] author who had written ''The I-5 Killer''. The account of Woodfield's life and crime spree became a best-selling book in 1984. The Federal Court in Oregon dismissed the lawsuit in January 1988, citing that the statute of limitations on such a lawsuit had been exhausted.&lt;ref name=suit/&gt;

By 1990, after the discovery of more victims, Woodfield was suspected in as many as 44 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Anthony. Book Review: The revenge of the failures with time to kill; 'The Serial Killers' - Colin Wilson &amp; Donald Seaman: W H Allen, 6.99 pounds. ''[[The Independent]]'', December 21, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 and 2006, [[DNA testing]] linked Woodfield to two additional murders in Oregon that occurred from 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Maxine. DNA links 'I-5 killer' to 1980 slaying. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the penitentiary, Woodfield has married three times and [[divorce]]d twice. Some letters he wrote from prison were eventually sold online as a collection titled, ''The Serial Killer Letters'' and published by The Charles Press.&lt;ref name=greenbay/&gt; In one of these letters, he wrote to journalist Jennifer Furio:
{{quote|You only care to know "why murderers strike out in anger or rage"? How should I know? What a question Jenny. Care to write more personally? Share a photo? Talk once by phone? Your choice.&lt;br&gt;Ciao&lt;br&gt;Randall Woodfield&lt;ref name=letters/&gt;}}

==''Modus operandi'' and victim profile==
{{quote box|width=20%|align=right|bgcolor=lavender|quote="He killed and then five weeks later killed again. Then it was three weeks, then two weeks. I believe that it would have soon been every few days. He was like the bogeyman."|source=– Jim Lawrence, cold case detective ([[Portland Police Bureau]])&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;}}
The majority of Woodfield's victims were petite white women in their twenties, many of middle-class backgrounds.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; A great deal of his victims—particularly in instances of robbery and sexual assault—were young employees of restaurants and convenience stores located along Interstate 5, which Woodfield traversed in his 1974 Champagne Edition gold [[Volkswagen Beetle]].{{sfn|Rule|2004|p=110}} In some instances, Woodfield's attacks were undertaken entirely at random, while in others, the murders were incited by rejected sexual advances.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; His level of acquaintance with his victims varied; some he knew personally, while others were complete strangers.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

During his robberies, assaults, and killings, Woodfield typically concealed his identity by wearing a hoodie, a fake beard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Suspected-or-convicted-serial-killers-in-1107863.php|title=Suspected or convicted serial killers in Washington|date=February 19, 2003|accessdate=February 8, 2018|author=Seattle Post-Intelligencer Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most curiously, a strip of athletic tape across his nose.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Police believe Woodfield may have done so to obscure his features and prevent victims from identifying him in a police lineup.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Woodfield's victims were typically killed via gunshot, and his crimes were sexually-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|p=433|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn= 978-0-816-06987-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Lawrence, a detective for Portland's [[cold case]] unit, noted Woodfield's lack of remorse or responsibility in his crimes, saying: "If you’re talking about somebody moving toward some form of rehabilitation, they had to at some point acknowledge they are responsible for their own behaviors. That is not Randy Woodfield."&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Lawrence also noted Woodfield's [[egotism]] during his early interrogations: "When he was interviewed, he'd tell detectives that he'd never rape a girl. He said he didn't have to. They wanted him."&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Ann Rule, who documented Woodfield's crimes in her book ''The I-5 Killer'', suggested that rejection and feelings of inadequacy were factors that drove him to violence, particularly against women.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; She also characterized Woodfield as a "smooth ladies' man" whose good looks and disposition aided his ability to trap victims.{{sfn|Rule|2004|p=109}}

Unlike many serial killers, whose killing patterns are characterized by intervals, or "cooling off periods," Woodfield's murders and other crimes escalated rapidly, increasing in successive frequency.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

==Victims==
Woodfield never confessed to any of the murders of which he has been accused or linked to.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Though convicted only in the murder of Shari Hull, Woodfield has been linked to numerous other murders via [[DNA]] and other methods; [[criminology|criminologists]] and detectives have provided estimated total numbers of killings ranging from 25&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; to as many as 44 unsolved homicides.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Woodfield is also estimated to have committed at least 60 unsolved rapes.&lt;ref name=nyd/&gt; The following is a list of Woodfield's confirmed victims:

===1980===
*&lt;u&gt;October 9&lt;/u&gt;: Cherie Ayers (29): A former classmate of Woodfield's; was found in her Portland home on October 11; was bludgeoned and stabbed multiple times in the neck.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

===Other possible victims===
Retracing Woodfield's movements along Interstate 5, law enforcement have identified at least 25 other potential murders,&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; while other estimations suggest up to 44.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; Notable are [[Murder of Martha Morrison|Martha Morrison]] (17), who disappeared in Eugene, Oregon in September 1974, and was found murdered the following month near Vancouver, Washington; her remains were unidentified until 2015.

During the spring of 1980, Marsha Weatter (19) and Kathy Allen (18) vanished while hitch-hiking from the [[Spokane, Washington]] area to their hometown of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]]. Their bodies were found in May 1981; suspected serial killer Martin Lee Sanders was later connected to their murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Seattle Times|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900506&amp;slug=1070283|title=Montana Convict Faces New Charges|date=May 6, 1990|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2018 the case remains unsolved.

==In popular culture==
In 2011, Woodfield was the subject of a [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television film ''Hunt for the I-5 Killer''. The film was based on the book ''The I-5 Killer'' by Ann Rule. In the film, Woodfield is portrayed by Canadian actor [[Tygh Runyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Radio Times]]|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/qqsgq/hunt-for-the-i-5-killer/|title=Review: Hunt for the I-5 Killer|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[deathcore]] band '''The I-5 Killer''' is named after Woodfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Facebook]]|url=https://www.facebook.com/TI5Kdeathcore/|title=The I-5 Killer|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Reihendorf''''' ("row village", plural: ''Reihendörfer'') or '''''Hufendorf''''' ("oxgang village") is the name used of a particular form of [[linear settlement]] in German-speaking countries that is characterized by rows of houses situated along a linear object such as a riverbank, road, [[valley]], or [[stream]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson (1964), pp. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
''Reihendörfer'' may consist of a one or two rows of houses or farmsteads; the latter being arranged either side of the village street. The farmland associated with each dwelling is adjacent to it, which has the advantage of saving time and reducing the effort involved in transportation. The farm can be worked just outside the farmyard or within it e.g. manure can be readily transported from stall to field and the harvest can be easily brought in to the barns. The farmers also have better oversight of their land.

A ''Reihendorf'' does not usually have [[common land]].

== Types ==
Specific forms of ''Reihendorf'' include the ''[[Straßendorf]]'', ("road village") which is an elongated village that runs along a road, the ''[[Waldhufendorf]]'', typical of forest clearings, the ''[[Marschhufendorf]]'', found in marshland, and the ''[[Hagenhufendorf]]'', which runs along one side of a river.

'''Roberto Heredia Hernández''' (born August 30, 1980)&lt;ref name="espn-profile"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/6356/roberto-hernandez Roberto Hernandez stats], ESPN.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Houston Astros]] and [[Atlanta Braves]].

Hernández was a regular part of the Indians' [[starting pitcher|starting rotation]] for six years under the name of '''Fausto Carmona''', which he had used to obtain a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to pitch in the United States.  After his true name and age were revealed (he had claimed to be three years younger than he is), he missed much of the 2012 season due to lack of a valid visa, followed by a suspension from MLB for [[identity fraud]].  He returned as a regular starting pitcher with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in 2013 and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 2014.  In mid-2014, the Phillies traded him to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Hernández (as Carmona) was signed as an amateur free agent by the [[Cleveland Indians]] on December 28, 2000. In 2003, he compiled a record of 17-4 with a 2.06 ERA in 24 starts for the Class-A [[Lake County Captains]]. This led to him being honored as the Most Outstanding Player of the [[South Atlantic League]], receiving All-Star honors both from the South Atlantic League and for all of Class-A and he was named the Indians' 2003 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the "[[Lou Boudreau]] Award").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/awards/Minor_League_Player_of_the_Year_by_Team.shtml |title=Minor League Player of the Year by Team |publisher=The Baseball Cube |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He split 2004 between the [[Kinston Indians]] of the [[Carolina League]] and the [[Akron Aeros]] of the AA [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]]. Combined, he was 10–10 with a 4.09 ERA in 28 starts.

The following year, 2005, he split between the Aeros and the AAA [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[International League]]. He was 13–9 with a 3.68 ERA in 26 starts.

===Cleveland Indians===

On April 15, 2006, Hernández made his MLB debut when he started the game against the [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Comerica Park]]. He pitched 6 innings giving up one [[earned run]] and [[Strikeout|striking out]] four. He earned the win, which was his only win of the season.

On July 20, 2006, the Indians traded [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Bob Wickman]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]], and the Indians chose Hernández to fill the role. In the span of seven days (from July 30 through August 5), Hernández recorded four [[Loss (baseball)|losses]] and three blown saves for the Indians, including [[walk-off home run|walk-off]] [[home run]]s surrendered to [[Boston Red Sox|Boston's]] [[David Ortiz]] and Detroit's [[Iván Rodríguez]]. Hernández lost the closer's role to [[Tom Mastny]] soon thereafter.

After the closer experiment, Hernández was demoted to the [[Buffalo Bisons]], the Indians' Class [[AAA (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate, where he was placed back in a starter's role. He was promoted to Cleveland again in September, and finished the season as a starter. Hernández ended the 2006 season with a record of 1–10 and a 5.42 ERA.

[[File:Carmona Fausto.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Hernández pitching in his MLB debut]]

In {{mlby|2007}}, Hernández was originally slated to be the Indians' spot starter and to start the season at the team's minor league affiliate, Triple-A [[Buffalo Bisons|Buffalo]]. However, after [[Cliff Lee]] went down with an abdominal strain in [[spring training]] that would force him to miss at least the first three weeks of the season, the Indians gave Hernández the opportunity to start in Lee's place. In his first start of the season on April 13, the [[Chicago White Sox]] battered him for six earned runs in {{frac|4|1|3}} innings.

Hernández quickly rebounded, holding the [[New York Yankees]]' potent offense to just 2 ER in 6 IP in his next start. He received a no decision, however, when [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]] allowed six runs in the ninth inning to give the Yankees the win. Hernández settled into a groove and won his next five starts, allowing just 5 ER over 39 IP. In the streak, Hernández beat two-time [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Johan Santana]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] twice and in one of his starts against the Twins, [[center fielder]] [[Torii Hunter]] was quoted saying, "I can't wait until we face normal pitchers. This guy's sinker is practically unhittable." The first victory came on April 24 in Minnesota, when Hernández allowed just 2 ER over {{frac|7|2|3}} IP. The second win came at home on May 17, when Hernández tossed his first career [[complete game]] [[shutout]], scattering just four [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] along the way.

On July 25, Hernández tossed eight shutout innings against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in a 1–0 Indians win. The victory capped a 5–0 July for Hernández. Hernández went on to go 19–8 with a 3.06 ERA and 215 innings pitched for the 2007 season.

Hernández received serious consideration for the AL Cy Young award, along with teammate [[CC Sabathia]], Boston's [[Josh Beckett]] and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Angels']] [[John Lackey]]. True to his dominant 2007 regular season form, Hernández, in his 1st career postseason game in Game 2 of the 2007 [[American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the Yankees and [[Andy Pettitte]], allowed 1 earned run on 3 hits over 9 innings in an extra-inning win for Cleveland. He finished fourth in the 2007 Cy Young vote.

On October 20, Hernández was battered by the Red Sox in Game 6 of the 2007 [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]], surrendering seven runs in two plus innings. The big blow was J.D. Drew's first inning, two out Grand Slam to center field. He was knocked out of the game in the third inning of the Indians' 12–2 loss to the Sox at [[Fenway Park]].

[[File:Fausto Carmona windup.jpg|220px|thumb|Hernández (Carmona) pitching for the [[2008 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians in 2008]]]]
On April 10, {{mlby|2008}}, the Indians signed Hernández to a four-year $15 million contract extension through 2011 with three individual club options through 2014. If all options had been exercised, Hernández would have made $43 million, with another $5 million available in escalators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080410&amp;content_id=2511589&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle |title=Tribe signs Carmona to long-term deal |accessdate=2009-03-12|last=Castrovince |first=Anthony |date=2008-04-10|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernández started the 2008 season off strong before going down on May 24 with a left hip strain after running to cover [[first base]]. He stayed on the [[disabled list]] for 2 months before making his return to the starting rotation on July 26.

On September 19 against [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]], Hernández hit [[Gary Sheffield]] with a pitch. The two exchanged words as Sheffield walked to first base with his bat tucked under this arm. Before the next pitch, Hernández made a pick-off throw to first base. Sheffield again started exchanging words with Hernández, and this time [[charging the mound|charged the mound]] inducing a [[bench-clearing brawl]]. Hernández was seen landing several punches to Sheffield's head, which left him bloodied. Hernández and Sheffield were both ejected, along with Indians catcher [[Víctor Martínez (baseball)|Víctor Martínez]] and Tigers second baseman [[Plácido Polanco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/gamecenter/recap/MLB_20080919_DET@CLE |title=Indians win with walk-off hit as Hernández, Sheffield brawl |accessdate=2008-09-20 |date=2008-09-19 |publisher=CBSSports.com wire reports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923061656/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/gamecenter/recap/MLB_20080919_DET%40CLE |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernández had a subpar season, starting 24 games for Cleveland, going 5–12 with 6.32 ERA. He struck out 79 batters in 125.1 innings. The Indians finished the year 4th in the AL Central with 65–97 record. Hernández improved dramatically from 2009 and was honored with his 1st All Star selection. He had a 13–14 record with a 3.77 ERA, while striking out 124 batters in 210.1 innings.

On February 28, 2011, Indians Manager [[Manny Acta]] announced that Hernández had been selected as his starter for Cleveland's season opener against the Chicago White Sox. The April 1 start would be his first on opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fausto Carmona to Start Opening Day|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2011/news/story?id=6168694|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of a sellout crowd of 41,721 fans at Cleveland's ballpark [[Progressive Field]], Hernández started the 2011 season for the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago 15, Cleveland 10 Box Score|url=http://content.usatoday.com/sportsdata/baseball/mlb/game/WhiteSox_Indians/2011/04/01|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=Buehrle's 9th opener one to remember|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/3988/buehrles-ninth-opener-was-one-to-remember|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández posted the worst opening day start in Major League history, as he became the first starting pitcher to allow 10 runs in a team's first game.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Jim|title=Carmona posts worst Opening Day start in MLB history, Indians fall to ChiSox|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90043191?Carmona%20posts%20worst%20Opening%20Day%20start%20in%20MLB%20history%2C%20Indians%20fall%20to%20ChiSox|publisher=All Headline News|accessdate=2 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández was the losing pitcher as he threw 88 pitches over 3.0 innings, allowed 11 hits, surrendered 2 [[home run]]s, [[Base on balls|walked]] 1, had 10 [[earned run]]s and left the game with an [[earned run average]] of 30.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chi White Sox 15, Cleveland 10 Box Score|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore;_ylt=AjRMDbfdtol.AkVTMn0PU0W4u7YF?gid=310401105|publisher=Yahoo!

The last pitcher to allow 10-plus runs in an opener was [[Early Wynn]] of the [[Minnesota Twins#Washington Nationals.2FSenators: 1901.E2.80.931960|Washington Senators]] who accomplished the feat on April 19, 1948. In that game Wynn surrendered 12 runs but managed to pitch {{frac|8|1|3}} innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|title=Fausto Carmona Had A Really Bad Day At The Office|url=http://rumorsandrants.com/2011/04/fausto-carmona-had-a-really-bad-day-at-the-office.html|publisher=Rumors &amp; Rants|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2012, Hernández was granted a visa to work in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Caught"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2012/07/cleveland_indians_rhp_roberto.html|title=Cleveland Indians RHP Roberto Hernandez receives U.S. visa; will serve three-week suspension|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=22 July 2012|last=Hoynes|first=Paul|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|publisher=Cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, he began serving a 3-week suspension delivered by the MLB for age and identity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/baseball/mlb/07/21/cleveland-indians-roberto-hernandez-suspended.ap/index.html?sct=mlb_t2_a12|title=Indians:Hernandez gets visa, suspended 3 weeks|agency=AP|work=SportsIllustrated.CNN.com|accessdate=22 July 2012|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he served the suspension, Hernandez was allowed to pitch simulated games and in the minors. He rejoined the Indians on August 11. He started his first game since 2011 on August 15 against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. He ended the season with a 7.53 ERA in {{frac|14|1|3}} innings.

===Tampa Bay Rays===
Hernández was signed by the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] on December 18, 2012 to a 1-year contract. He was named their number 5 starter before the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/rays-sign-hernandez-known-fausto-231128825--mlb.html|title=Rays sign Hernandez, was known as Fausto Carmona|agency=AP|work=sports.yahoo.com|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded his first career win under his real name on April 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/sports/baseball/baseball-roundup.html?_r=0|title=Rays Starter Wins Again, This Time Under Real Name|agency=New York Times|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 30, 2013 Hernandez recorded his first complete game with the Rays, a 5-2 defeat of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] signed Hernández for the 2014 season for $4.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10125937/philadelphia-phillies-ex-cleveland-indians-roberto-hernandez-agree |title=Roberto Hernandez, Phils agree |website=ESPN.com |date=December 12, 2013 |author=Associated Press |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five starts, during which he compiled a 5.81 ERA, he was available to pitch out of the bullpen, as off days meant the Phillies would not need him for over a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salisbury|first=Jim|title=Hernandez could help in Phils' bullpen this week|url=http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/hernandez-could-help-phils-bullpen-week|work=CSNPhilly.com|publisher=Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Phillies analyst [[Ricky Bottalico]] commented, "All in all, I like what I've seen from Roberto Hernandez early in the ball games, but it's seems to be fourth, fifth, sixth innings, you're seeing a laboring guy out there. The one thing he's got to do is relax himself. It seems like he's trying to be a little too fine with his pitches. When you do that as a pitcher and you're not relaxed, you're going to make mistakes ... one thing he can do is take a deep breath. Getting deeper into games is getting tougher and tougher for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/hernandez-could-help-phils-bullpen-week | title=Ricky Bottalico: 'Roberto Hernandez needs to relax' | publisher=Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia | date=April 29, 2014 | people=[[Ricky Bottalico]] | medium=Television broadcast (reproduced online) | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he rebounded, and had totaled 23 appearances (20 starts) with the Phillies, during which he posted an ERA of 3.87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gelb|first1=Matt|title=Phillies trade Roberto Hernandez to Dodgers|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/sports/phillies/Phillies-trade-Roberto-Hernandez-to-Dodgers.html|accessdate=August 9, 2014|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On August 7, 2014, Hernández was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for either two players to be named later or cash considerations (the players turned out to be minor leaguers [[Jesmuel Valentín]] and [[Víctor Arano]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dodgers acquire RHP Hernandez from Phillies|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=11322304|accessdate=August 8, 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first start as a Dodger the following day, allowing two runs in six innings against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_08_08_lanmlb_milmlb_1&amp;mode=recap_away&amp;c_id=la|title=Hernandez solid in debut, but Dodgers fall|first=Ken|last=Gurnick|work=mlb.com|date=August 9, 2014|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández started nine games for the Dodgers, with a 2–3 record and 4.74 ERA.

===Houston Astros===
Hernández signed a minor league contract with the [[Houston Astros]] in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drellich|first1=Evan|title=Astros add Roberto Hernandez to mix for rotation competition|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2015/02/12/astros-sign-pitcher-roberto-hernandez-to-minor-league-deal/|website=blog.chron.com|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was designated for assignment on July 29, 2015 to create room for [[Jed Lowrie]] who was activated from the [[disabled list]]. He was released on August 9.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Hernández signed a minor league contract with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on December 18, 2015, that included an invitation to spring training and a March 28 opt-out. He exercised his March 28 opt-out after learning he would not make the Opening Day roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/03/philip-humber-retire-shane-robinson-roberto-hernandez-opt-out.html|title=Minor MLB Transactions: 3/29/16|last=Todd|first=Jeff|work=mlbtraderumors.com|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had he made the team out of spring training, the contract would have paid Hernández $1.25 million for the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-agree-to-minor-league-deals-with-five-pitchers/|title=Blue Jays agree to minor-league deals with five pitchers|last=Hoad|first=Michael|work=[[Sportsnet]]|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed another minor league contract with the Jays on April 20, and was to report to extended spring training.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://twitter.com/BlueJays/status/722940876637532160|title=Toronto Blue Jays on Twitter|work=[[Twitter]]|date=April 20, 2016|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hernández was assigned to the Triple-A [[Buffalo Bisons]] on April 27, and released on July 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/07/minor-mlb-transactions-7316.html|title=Minor MLB Transactions: 7/3/16|last=Byrne|first=Connor|work=mlbtraderumors.com|date=July 3, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlanta Braves===
On July 15, 2016, Hernández signed a minor league contract with the [[Atlanta Braves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/roster/transactions/2016/07|title=Atlanta Braves Transactions in July 2016|work=MLB.com|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was added to the Braves roster in August, and designated for assignment on August 12 after making two starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/08/braves-designate-roberto-hernandez-for-assignment.html|title=Braves Designate Roberto Hernandez For Assignment|last=Adams|first=Steve|work=mlbtraderumors.com|date=August 12, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pitching style==
Hernández is known for his hard [[Sinker (baseball)|sinker]] and exhibiting good control of his pitches. He did not throw exceptionally hard when he debuted in the [[minor league]]s at age 21, but has since developed a [[fastball]] that can reach 97&amp;nbsp;mph. He also throws a [[slider]] and a [[changeup]], but relies mostly on his hard sinker to get many ground ball outs.

==Name controversy==
In January 2012, Dominican police arrested Hernández after he left the U.S. Consulate, accusing him of using a false identity to obtain a visa. Police reported his real name as '''Roberto Heredia Hernández''', and that he is three years older than he reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7480419/fausto-carmona-cleveland-indians-arrested-accused-using-false-identity Fausto Carmona of Cleveland Indians arrested, accused of using false identity - ESPN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleeman|first=Aaron|title=Fausto Carmona arrested in Dominican Republic for using false identity|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/01/19/report-fausto-carmona-arrested-in-dominican-republic-for-using-false-identity/|newspaper=NBC Sports|date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians placed Hernández on the restricted list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120126&amp;content_id=26476910&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb Cleveland Indians place Fausto Carmona on restricted list | MLB.com: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in both countries received assistance in the case from a woman in the Dominican Republic who claimed she falsified a birth certificate for Hernández in exchange for $26,000, but when Hernández's father failed to pay her, she contacted the authorities. Hernández has stated that Fausto Carmona was his grandfather.&lt;ref name="Caught" /&gt; {{Failed verification|date=December 2016}}

==Notes==
:{{note label|a|a}}Hernandez's reported birth date is currently in question due to suspicions of identity falsification. MLB.com and ESPN.com both list his birth date as August 30, 1980.&lt;ref name="espn-profile" /&gt; While he was known as Fausto Carmona, his birth date was given as December 7, 1983.

Some reports suggest the existence of '''Romani people in Morocco'''.  Thomas (2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domresearchcenter.com/journal/11/domna.html The Dom of North Africa: An Overview ]&lt;/ref&gt; states that "Xoraxane or Muslim Gypsies have been reported in Morocco. It is suspected that Kalo (or Calo) Gypsies from Spain have migrated to Morocco for business reasons. However no government statistics can substantiate this supposition. Similarly, it may be true that French speaking Gypsies or Manouche may have in the past or still today traveled and worked in Morocco but there is no evidence of this at the moment."
Phillips (2001) mentions rather speculatively that "Some Kali or Gitan are probably in Morocco."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=morocco+nawar+gypsies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G4w0VK3ZGNioyATqq4KwAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=morocco%20nawar%20gypsies&amp;f=false Peoples on the Move: Introducing the Nomads of the World. By David J. Phillips]&lt;/ref&gt;  The available reports are not sufficiently precise to confirm the Romani identity or even existence of such groups, but in the event that they exist and are of Romani origin, they would have immigrated to the territory of the present day Morocco ultimately from [[South Asia]], and proximately from [[Spain]] and/or [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berland |first=Joseph C. |date=2004 |title=Customary Strangers: New Perspectives on Peripatetic Peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CAv53wlHfoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=syria+nawar+gypsies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v0pNj8AaZn&amp;sig=k5b8IZoSObUqPHqO2dKY_qWDOHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-rVvUojQKPT54APk24DACA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-89789-771-4 |accessdate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roper Center for Public Opinion Research''' at [[Cornell University]] is one of the world’s leading [[archives]] of [[social science]] data, specializing in data from [[public opinion]] surveys. The Center’s mission is to collect, preserve, and disseminate public opinion data; to serve as a resource to help improve the practice of survey research; and to broaden the understanding of public opinion through the use of survey data in the United States and abroad. Founded in 1947 by [[Elmo Roper]], the Roper Center holds data ranging from the 1930s, when survey research was in its infancy, to the present. Its collection now includes over 22,000 datasets and adds hundreds more each year. In total, the archive contains responses from millions of individuals on a vast range of topics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/dataset-collections/&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the surveys in the Roper Center were conducted on national samples, but there are also some state and local surveys, as well as a number of surveys of special populations of interest. Nearly all of the surveys are based on representative samples drawn according to the best practices of the time. Most of the data are from the United States, but over 100 nations are represented. Since its beginning, the Roper Center has focused on surveys conducted by the news media and commercial polling firms. However, it also holds many academic surveys, including important historical collections from the [[National Opinion Research Center]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/data-providers/norc/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princeton University]]'s Office of Public Opinion Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ropercenter.cornell.edu/office-of-public-opinion-research-collection/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roper Center has a strong presence in the public opinion community and maintains cooperative relationships with other archives around the world. Its board of directors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ropercenter.cornell.edu/about-the-center/board-of-directors/&lt;/ref&gt; contains representatives from both academic and commercial public opinion research. The Roper Center moved from the University of Connecticut to Cornell University in 2015.

'''Ruhrdeutsch (Ruhr German)''' is a German variety of [[Low German]] spoken in the [[Ruhr area]]. Most linguists consider it a [[regiolect]]. Ruhrdeutsch as a concept has to be understood as a group of many differing regional and local variants, based on the different dialects existing in this partly Rhenish, partly Westphalian area before the industrialization.

Through immigration its vocabulary has been influenced by [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish]] to a small extent, although this influence has proved to be smaller than thought.

===Playback singer===
Charan began working as a playback singer in 1997 with "Deepangal pesum" from ''[[Devathai]]'', under [[Ilaiyaraaja]]'s direction. About being the son of an icon, he stated: "my voice sounds so much like appa, people might not want to use a similar voice.

In 2010, he recorded a song on the ''[[Kadhal 2 Kalyanam]]'' soundtrack for [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]] and recorded with his father for the first time in Tamil for the film ''[[Aadukalam]]'',&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; for which they both won the [[Vijay Award for Best Male Playback Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Malathi Rangarajan |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-draws-crowds-and-how/article3542936.ece |title=Cinema draws crowds, and how! |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social protection]]''' is an important state institution, which deals with the population's social protection and realization of people's social rights.

== Introduction ==

State social protection system of the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] is financed by the state budget. The services provided within this institution are free for citizens. Ministry Labour and Social Affairs coordinates the services provision process.

== Social protection system during the First Republic of Armenia ==

The Ministry of Public Assistance was established in November 1918, at the time when the second Government of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] was reorganizing. On April 8, 1919 it was renamed “The Ministry of Labor and Public Assistance”. Until July 5, 1919 the Ministry of Food used to organize food purchasing and distributing works. But, on July 5, 1919 the Ministry of Food being dissolved, its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Labor and Public Assistance. On January 8, 1920 the Ministry was renamed “The Ministry of Reconstruction and Public Assistance”. It comprised the [[Orphanage]], Migration, Labor Organization, Medical and Sanitary, Labor Protection, Architecture and Construction Departments. 
1918–1920 were particularly hard times; the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of 1915]] and lasting wars with the Turks had left behind hundreds of thousands of refugees. Finally, the Armenian people gained the independence they had been dreaming of for ages. The First Republic of Armenia was established, ready to move on and withstand all difficulties. Despite all these hardships, the Ministry of Reconstruction and Public Assistance had representatives both in Georgia and Azerbaijan, making allocations to fulfill the basic needs of the Armenians, living in Georgia and Azerbaijan. One Minister often headed up more than one Ministry at the time since there were problems within the Republic, as well as urgent issues related to borders’ defense, weapon acquisition and foreign relations. In general, the Ministers of those times were literate and highly educated national leaders.

== Social protection system during the Second Republic of Armenia ==

When Armenia became part of the [[Soviet Union]], Bolshevik leaders came to replace those Ministers. They were conceptualized and highly educated national leaders, who afterwards got high-ranking positions but were fusilladed in 1937. 
On December 8, 1920 the Ministry was organized as the Commissariat of Reconstruction and Care. Later, on December 21 it was renamed “People’s Commissariat for Social Security”. On March 12, 1925 it was again renamed and this time bore the name of  “People’s Commissariat of Labor and Social Security”. In 1946, the Ministry for Social Security of the ASSR ([[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]) was once again reorganized. The Ministry consisted of the Pensions and Benefits Department, Job Placement and Household Management, Supervising, Controlling, Medical-Working Expertise, Financial, Planning, Capital Construction and Administrative Departments, Central Accountancy and Individual Pensioners’ Inspectorate.
The Ministry headed the Departments responsible for Pensions and Benefits Calculation and Payout, as well as Republic Centers of Information and Computing,  Boarding Houses for the disabled, the elderly and children, the Experimental-Industrial  Enterprise of Prosthetics and Orthopedics, and the Clinic of Prosthetics and Medical-Working Expertise, the Committees of Republic, Regional and District Medical-Working Expertise, the Deaf and Dump Associations, the Social Security Departments of the Regional and City Soviets of the People’s Deputies.

== Armenia's social protection system after 1990 ==

In 1990, in the post-Soviet period, the RA Ministry for Social Security was reorganized into the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
After the parliamentary elections of 1995, according to the Presidential Decree, the Government structure underwent changes; the Ministry was reorganized into the Ministry of Social Security, Employment, Migration and Refugee Affairs.
In 1996, according to the Presidential Decree, the Government underwent new structural changes. On November 8, 1996 the Ministry was reorganized into the Ministry of Social Security. On February 28, 2000 according to the RA President’s Decree, the Ministry was merged into the Ministry of Health and Social Security. 
On May 20, 2000 according to the RA President’s Decree, the Ministry was separated as the RA Ministry of Social Security. On December 25, 2003 pursuant to the RA President’s Decree, it was renamed the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The first years of these transitional period were incredibly hard ones for the Armenian people. The consequences of the earthquake of 1988 ( it had destroyed the third of the country’s territory and killed about 25 thousands of people) were still vivid, let alone the blockade, the immigration of the displaced persons (DP), the energy crisis, unemployment and so on.

In 1992, it was officially announced that the poverty rate in the Republic reached 94%. It meant that people were desperate, and the country which had just gained independence could not overcome the socio-economic difficulties all alone. The RA Government was implementing economic reforms at the time, the Legislative Field was in the formation process.
Humanitarian aid was of primary importance. The RA President assigned the RA Government to set up a system that would organize the works on addressed distributions of the humanitarian aid. A working group of relevant specialists was formed, a clear set of regulations elaborated, and the “Paros” system realized.
In order to make this system operate, there was formed the Social Services’ Institute within the Ministry of Social Security. It had its own territorial offices contributing to the “Paros” system implementation. The latter came to distinctly specify the poverty rate among needy families as well as regulate the operative and unbiased distribution of the provided humanitarian aid.  
     
Social Services were funded from the State budget. Beneficiary services were provided free of charge. The RA Ministry of Labor and Social Security was in charge of the coordination of those social services, as well as conducted the unified policy, carried out the methodological and organizational assistance.

'''Société Anonyme, Inc.''' was an art organization founded in 1920 by [[Katherine Dreier]], [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The society sponsored lectures, concerts, publications, and exhibitions of modern art, including the International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926. Between 1920 and 1940 they held 80 exhibitions showing mostly [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[abstract art]].

[[Man Ray]] picked the name "[[S.A. (corporation)|Société Anonyme]]", having seen it in French magazines, but knowing little French, assumed it referred to some anonymous society. It actually means "Corporation", but Duchamp thought it a fine name and later while the legal paperwork was being written up the "Inc." was added, making its English translation, "Corporation, Inc.".

The Société's headquarters in New Jersey closed in 1928, but Dreier continued to organize events, and accumulate artwork to add to the Société Anonyme's collection. Dreier donated the collection to the [[Yale University Art Gallery]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yale.edu/sites/default/files/d6_files/imce/CollectionOverview_Dec2012%5B2%5D.pdf Yale University Art Gallery, Collection Overview], December 2012, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1950, the 30th anniversary of the Société Anonyme's first exhibition, Dreier and Duchamp hosted a dinner at the New Haven Lawn Club, where they formally dissolved the organization.

The '''Ulysses Club''' is a club for motorcyclists over age 40 in Australia. A sibling organisation of the same name exists in New Zealand.

==History==
The Ulysses Club was formed for [[motorcyclist]]s aged 40 years and older at the instigation of Stephen Dearnley in [[Sydney]], Australia in December 1983 in reply to a letter in the now defunct ''Bike Australia'' magazine, the [[editor]] being Peter "The Bear" Thoeming. The name ''Ulysses Club'' was the idea of Rob Hall, while the club's motto of "''Grow Old Disgracefully''" was devised by his then-girlfriend Pat Lynch. Peter "The Bear" Thoeming sketched the "old man" logo that is still used by the club in its original hand-sketched form. The inaugural meeting of the club was held in Sydney on 6 December 1983 when the five people present approved a draft [[constitution]] and the ''Ulysses Club'' was duly formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulyssesclub.org/AboutUs/tabid/73/Default.aspx|title=Ulysses - About the Club
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this meeting a draft constitution was adopted, and the three basic principles or purposes of the club were formulated. These principles are:

# To provide ways in which older motorcyclists can get together for companionship and mutual support;
# To show by example that motor cycling can be an enjoyable and practical activity for riders of all ages;
# To draw the attention of public and private institutions to the needs and views of older riders.

These original purposes are entrenched in the club's constitutions and have remained unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
At that initial meeting the five founding members became an interim management committee, until two months later, on 7 February 1984, 11 of the club's total membership of 25 members attended the club's first annual general meeting, formally electing the very first National Committee and adopting the club's constitution.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;(1) - from the Ulysses members handbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'' by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. It tells how the great Greek hero [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], now middle-aged and securely in charge of his kingdom of [[Ithaca]], is getting bored with things around him and longs to go adventuring again with his shipmates of old. It describes very well indeed the sort of person who still has enough spark to go on riding into middle and later years.

It is the largest organisation of its kind with over 138 branches in Australia and it now has branches in Germany, Vietnam (2008), South Africa (1997), Norway&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulyssesclub.no/&lt;/ref&gt;, Zimbabwe, the Netherlands, Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulysses-club.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;, France&lt;ref&gt;http://ulysses-club.fr/index.php/en/&lt;/ref&gt;, Great Britain&lt;ref&gt;http://ulyssesclubgb.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and Cuba, with external members of the Australian club in Italy, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Fiji, China, Austria, Thailand and the United States.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

Membership of the club is open to any person, subject to National Committee approval, who has attained the age of 40 years and who holds a current motorcycle licence.
Additionally, the spouse or regular companion of a member, who has attained the age of 40 years, may also be admitted as a member on application.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;


Membership now stands around 16,000.

==New Zealand==
A number of New Zealanders joined the Ulysses Club in the 1980s, creating an informal "New Zealand branch" with about 100 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growing Old Disgracefully: History of the Ulysses Club in New Zealand 1988-2013|first=Peter|last=Mitchell|date=March 2013|isbn=978-0-473-23039-5|pp=27, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the cost of administering members across the Tasman and sending them the newsletter cost the club more than the membership fees, so in 1988 the Secretary Pete Reynolds visited members in Hawkes Bay and Invercargill and encouraged them to form a New Zealand organisation. By the end of 1988, the New Zealand Ulysses Club has a membership of 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growing Old Disgracefully: History of the Ulysses Club in New Zealand 1988-2013|first=Peter|last=Mitchell|date=March 2013|isbn=978-0-473-23039-5|pp=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2013, the club had 3000 current members in 29 branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growing Old Disgracefully: History of the Ulysses Club in New Zealand 1988-2013|first=Peter|last=Mitchell|date=March 2013|isbn=978-0-473-23039-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual general meeting ==

The club's annual general meeting (AGM) is held each year between 1 January and 30 June. The purpose of the AGM is to affirm minutes of the previous meeting, receive reports, consider the financial statements for the year ending 31 December previous and to elect office bearers.

== ULYSSES CLUB NATIONAL RALLY
 ==

Each year the Ulysses Club National Rally is held in a different location throughout Australia. The locations of the Ulysses Club National Rally are chosen by the National Committee and ratified by the Extended NatCom meeting, usually three years prior to the event being held. The Ulysses Club National Rally event has formal fixtures running for four days of the event, namely the Road Safety Forum on the Thursday, the Extended NatCom meeting held on the Friday, the Grand Parade and Opening / Civic Ceremony on the Saturday morning and the AGM itself on the Saturday afternoon. These are followed by the Saturday night dinner and the Sunday morning church service, and finally the closing ceremony after the church service.
Additional to these fixtures, trade displays, bike test rides, organised rides, and social gatherings have been included in past events by the host committee, starting as early as the Monday preceding the actual meeting weekend, for the benefit and entertainment of visiting members.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

In 2009 the Annual General Meeting was held in [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]], [[New South Wales]] and attracted some 3,500 members to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=3622|title=Ulysses AGM brings 3500 to Penrith City|year=2009|accessdate=12 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003082028/http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=3622|archivedate=3 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], [[Western Australia]] was the scene of the 2010 Annual General Meeting and club members camped at [[Centennial Park, Western Australia|Centennial Oval]] for the week of the event. Approximately 3200 members attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/13/2844991.htm|title=ABC News - 10 metre flames threatening Albany homes|year=2010|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 annual general meeting was held in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New South Wales]] with about 3,000 members participating in the parade through town prior to the meeting commencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/26/3174370.htm?site=newcastle|title=Ulysses Club member parade through Newcastle|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=26 September 2013|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] was selected as the venue for the event with approximately 4,000 members attending and contributing between {{AUD}}5 to 10 million to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/04/03/3469713.htm|title=Ulysses AGM a success|author=Jacinta Allan-Gange|date=3 April 2012|accessdate=26 September 2013|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Bulgaria''' are [[Europe]]an women who live in and are from [[Bulgaria]]. Women's position in Bulgarian society has been influenced by a variety of cultures and ideologies, including
the Byzantine and Ottoman cultures, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, communist ideology, and contemporary globalized Western values.

==Emancipation==
Bulgarian women live in a society that is customarily patriarchal. While Bulgaria is often described as a patriarchal society, women may have substantial authority in household budgeting or agricultural decision making. Both men and women have the right to vote and own property. Despite decades of socialist ideology of gender equality, women are often employed in lower paying jobs, remain responsible for most household chores, and represent more than half the registered unemployed. They also occupy leadership positions less frequently than men. In 1996, fewer than 14 percent of postsocialist parliamentary representatives have been women, and only one in five municipal councilors were women in that year.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Bulgaria.html#ixzz2pkwtYQWf|title=Culture of Bulgaria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|work=everyculture.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, women  represented 20.4% of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting and government==
Limited women's suffrage was first granted in 1937,&lt;ref name="RuizRubio-Marín2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=Blanca Rodriguez|last2=Rubio-Marín|first2=Ruth|title=The Struggle for Female Suffrage in Europe: Voting to Become Citizens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KIMwdbG0EcC&amp;pg=PA330|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn=90-04-22425-4|pages=329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women obtained full voting rights in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/womens_mobilization_for_war_south_east_europe|title=Women's Mobilization for War (South East Europe) - International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|work=1914-1918-online.net|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the communist era nevertheless, civil rights and freedoms for both women and men were merely symbolic, due to the authoritarian nature of the government. As of 2017, there were 23.8% women in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification|work=ipu.org|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Many women entered paid employment during the socialist era, when an ideology of gender equality was promoted, and they made up nearly half the workforce in the late twentieth century. Women are frequently employed as teachers, nurses, pharmacists, sales clerks, and laborers, and less often involved in management, administration, and technical sciences. Women are also largely responsible for household tasks—child care, cooking, cleaning, and shopping. Agricultural labor is divided according to gender, with men working with animals and machinery and women doing more hand labor in crop production, although flexibility exists in response to specific situations.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"/&gt; Despite this, the gender segregation in the workforce is somewhat less pronounced in Bulgaria than in other European countries.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/131128_country-profile_bulgaria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the European average, Bulgarian women have a higher involvement in traditionally male fields such as science, maths, computing and engineering; and a lower involvement in the service field.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; Also, the [[gender pay gap]] (in 2013) is 13.0% in Bulgaria, which is lower than the European Union average of 16.2%.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;
As of 2014, the [[employment rate]] (age 15-64) for women was 58.2% while for men it was 63.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d1/Employment_rates_for_selected_population_groups%2C_2004%E2%80%9314_%28%25%29_YB16.png |format=PDF |title=Employment rates for selected population groups |website=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employment rate for both sexes has been relatively low during the past two decades, due to hardships experienced by the national economy after the fall of the communism. Nevertheless, the exact involvement in the labour force is quite difficult to determine, due to the presence of the unregulated [[informal sector]]. According to World Bank, women in 2014 made up 46.6% of the total labour force, pretty much the same as in 1990 (47.9%).&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian women's strong involvement in the economy can be seen in the fact that almost all employed women work [[full-time]] - the highest percentage among employed women in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=ro&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=2535&amp;furtherNews=yes&lt;/ref&gt; Before the communist era, Bulgaria (like other Eastern European countries) was a largely rural agricultural society, with women being integrated in the rural agricultural work. As such, they occupied a relatively high status in society (although not equal to men). Under the communist regime, the country was industrialized and "modernized", and people came from rural areas to urban areas. The communist new ideology and economy integrated women in paid employment - in the late 1970s, Bulgaria had the highest percentage of working women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/world/europe/08iht-bulgwomen.html&lt;/ref&gt; Women were integrated in almost all fields, including science and medicine, nevertheless they were strictly under the control of the state, were educated to be submissive to the state authorities (who were mostly male), and had very little power of self-expression. The fall of the communist had mixed results for women: while their economic security was affected (although this affected men too - as both men and women lost, in large numbers, their state-guaranteed jobs), women got the newly discovered freedom to open [[business]], freely pursue artistic and cultural activities, and have [[freedom of speech]]. While the newly emerging, 'wild', unrestricted capitalism of the 1990s was often hostile to women, many women have, in fact, succeeded: one-third of company owners and top managers in Bulgaria are women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/12/20111210122330666785.html&lt;/ref&gt; The high involvement of women in business is common to countries in the Eastern European region: "Overall, Eastern Europe continues to top the rankings in gender equality, with 35 percent of senior roles in the region held by women and just 16 percent of businesses with no women in senior management", according to a 2007 study.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neweurope.eu/article/russia-tops-female-business-leaders/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The [[literacy rate]] is slightly lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 98.1% for females, while for males it is 98.7% (aged 15 or older, data from 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illiteracy]] is particularly high among [[Romani people|Roma]] women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/UNICEF_ROE_Roma_Position_Paper_Web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional rights==
The [[Constitution of Bulgaria]] provides for gender equality:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.bg/en/const#&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 6.(1) All persons are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (2) All citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no privileges or restriction of rights on the grounds of race, national or social origin, ethnic self-identity, '''sex''', religion, education, opinion, political affiliation, personal or social status or property status".

==International obligations==
Being part of the [[European Union]] (since 2007), Bulgaria is subject to its [[Directive (European Union)|directives]]. Bulgaria is also a party to [[CEDAW]]. Bulgaria has ratified the [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/ro/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-discrimination laws==
[[Discrimination]] is legally prohibited. The ''Protection Against Discrimination Act'' (2004) is Bulgaria's main anti-discrimination law. At Article 4 it states: "Any direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender, race, nationality, ethnicity, human genome, citizenship, origin, religion or belief, education, convictions, political affiliation, personal or social status, disability, age, sexual orientation,  marital  status,  property  status,  or  on  any  other  grounds established  by  law  or  by  an  international treaty to which the Republic of Bulgaria is a party, shall be banned." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/44ae58d62d5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property inheritance==
Women and men have equal legal rights. Both men and women own property such as land, buildings, and animals, and inheritance is partible (i.e., property is divided among all heirs rather than going to a single heir). In practice, some heirs may be disinherited or may receive more land than their siblings, and daughters traditionally inherited less land than sons. The latter was sometimes explained in terms of the often large [[dowries]] of household goods and sometimes land or livestock that women traditionally took into marriage. Houses were traditionally often inherited by youngest sons, who brought their wives to live in the family home.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"/&gt;

==Reproductive rights and health==
The [[maternal mortality]] rate in Bulgaria is 11 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) in Bulgaria is 1.45 children born/woman (2015 estimates), which is below the [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement rate]], and one of the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion in Bulgaria]] is legal on request during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and at later stages for medical reasons.

==Military==
In terms of military organization, women have historically been known to have been recruited to become soldiers for the Bulgarian army, particularly during critical times.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Marriage and family life==
While [[marriage]] was traditionally very important in Bulgaria, there has been a rapid increase in [[cohabitation|unmarried cohabitation]] after the fall of communism. The transition from communism to market economy had a great impact on the demographic behavior of the population. After the fall of communism, the legal and social pressure to get married has declined, and the population has started to experience new life styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200166754_Contemporary_union_formation_in_Bulgaria_the_emergence_of_cohabitation|title=Contemporary union formation in Bulgaria: the emergence of cohabitation|first=Elena|last=Koytcheva|date=1 July 2005|work=researchgate.net|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, 58.8% of children were born to unmarried mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/sites/default/files/files/pressreleases/Population2014_en_2Y19BGI.pdf |format=PDF |title=POPULATION AND DEMOGRAPHIC PROCESSES IN 2014 : (FINAL DATA) |website=Nsi.bg |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of Bulgarian respondents who agreed with the assertion that "Marriage is an outdated institution" was 27.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en |title=Gesis: Zacat |website=Zacat.gesis.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Family Code came into effect in 2009, modernizing family law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenarova.com/law/Family%20Code.pdf |format=PDF |title=Family Code : Chapter One : General Provisions |date=2009 |website=Kenarova.com |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, Bulgaria has long recognized the equality of men and women in family law. This is explicitly stipulated in the Family Code, Art 2, which defines seven principles of family relations, one of which is "equality between the man and the woman".&lt;ref name="kenarova.com"&gt;http://kenarova.com/law/Family%20Code.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced at Art 13, titled, "Equality between spouses" which  states: "The spouses shall have   equal  rights and obligations in the matrimony."&lt;ref name="kenarova.com"/&gt; Despite legal equality, societal norms of the [[Balkans|Balkan culture]] often consider the wife to be in a position of subordination to the husband.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org"&gt;http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/uploads/bulgaria_domestic_violence_1996.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women==
Bulgaria is part of the [[paradox]] of many Eastern European societies: a long tradition of involvement of women in public working life, and high professional status for women; but at the same time leniency towards [[domestic violence]]. A 1996 report stated that: "Society recognizes women's intellectual abilities. For fifty years now, women constitute half of the labour force in the country. The situation in the family is different. The relationship model is a patriarchal one."&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org"/&gt;
In the 21st century, with the entry in the EU, Bulgaria has revised its policy on family violence, particularly by enacting its first domestic violence law, the 2005 Protection against Domestic Violence Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evaw-global-database.unwomen.org/en/countries/europe/bulgaria/2005/protection-against-domestic-violence-act&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Bulgaria repealed Article 158 of the Penal Code, which stated that a perpetrator  of several sexual offences could escape prosecution by marrying the victim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vks.bg/vks_p04_04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Note'': Article 158 stated "In the cases of Articles 149 - 151 and 153, the perpetrator shall not be punished, or the imposed punishment shall not be served, if prior to the enforcement of the sentence there follows a marriage between the man and the woman."[https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/bgr/1968/criminal_code_html/Bulgaria_Criminal_Code.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Kiribati''' are women who live in or are from the atoll nation of [[Kiribati]]. The role of Kiribati women is described in the publication ''Kiribati, A Situation Analysis of Children, Women and Youth'' (2005) as "largely defined by her age and marital status". Prestige is inherent to the married Kiribati woman, but she is considerably under the authority of her husband.&lt;ref name=Kiribati&gt;{{cite book|title="1.12 The roles of women", ''Kiribati, A Situation Analysis of Children, Women and Youth''|year=2005|publisher=Government of Kiribati, with the assistance of UNICEF|page=20|pages=|url=http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Kiribati_Sitan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Kiribati society ==
In general - and despite the changing trends in Kiribati society - women are often treated as "subordinate to men". By tradition, Kiribati women can inherit and own land. However, they "usually still have less access to modern type of resources". But is a growing number of female Kiribati people who participate in skilled work, professional jobs, and governmental roles. To safeguard the reputation of Kiribati women, traditional restrictions apply, particularly values that are related to chastity. The responsibility of the women of Kiribati in household includes cooking meals, cleaning, infant care and welfare of the family. As figures in a Kiribati village, their social responsibilities and obligations - according to the so-called ''unimane'' - include meeting the ''buknibwai'' or "village shares", composed of sharing portions of "food, money and entertainment-related activities" to other villagers. For the community, women are responsible for producing "cash and traditional goods", and also includes fund-raising activities for the church.&lt;ref name=Kiribati/&gt; 50% if Kiribati's workforce are composed of women.&lt;ref name=UNW&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiribati|url=http://unwomenpacific.org/pages.cfm/strategic-plan/kiribati.html|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kiribati politics, UN Women stated that 4.3% of parliamentary seats are held by female politicians.&lt;ref name=UNW/&gt;

The role of '''women in contemporary [[Turkey]]''' is defined by an ongoing gender equality struggle, contributing elements of which include predicate conditions for EU membership candidacy, prevalent political tides that favour restrictive patriarchal models, and woman's rights activism. Women in Turkey continue to be the victims of rape and [[honor killing]]s; furthermore research by scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sallan Gül | first = Songül | title = The role of the State in protecting women against domestic violence and women's shelters in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 38 | issue =  | pages = 107–116 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2013.01.018 | date = May–June 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2013.01.018 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Henneke | first = J. | title = Combating domestic violence in Turkey | url = https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/9884/1/Hennecke%20%20DV%20thesis.pdf | format = pdf | date = 2008 | publisher = Goeteborgs University | location = Sweden }}&lt;/ref&gt; and government agencies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = West Yorkshire | first = Police | title = Kadin ve kizlara yönelik şiddetten kaçmanin üç adimi | url = http://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/sites/default/files/files/domestic-violence/turkish.pdf | format = pdf | date = | publisher = Home Office | location = United Kingdom }}; this document is in Turkish, use a translator such as Google, if you cannot read Turkish.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate widespread domestic violence in Turkish population. That being said, there are many historical records of brave inspirational Turkish women fighting to make a difference. 

Women in Turkey also face significant disparities in employment, and, in some regions, education. The participation of Turkish women in the labor force is less than half of that of the European Union average and while several campaigns have been successfully undertaken to promote female literacy, there is still a gender gap in secondary education and an increasing gender gap in higher education. There is also widespread occurrence of [[Child marriage in Turkey|childhood marriages in Turkey]], the practice being especially widespread in the eastern and central parts of the country. One should keep in mind this is not the doing of religious beliefs rather it is in part due to certain laws and restrictions. One reason that has decreased women attending University was in correlation to the Hijab ban. There were many religious women that struggled with this law, as they were told to take off their heads scarf in exchanged to attend university and the workplace. In some rural lands like "Rize" women play a big role in being the bread winners. However it is important to consider in some regions, cultures and values are different. A working women doesn't necessarily have to equal a free and successful women.  

Discrimination based on gender is banned by the Turkish constitution. The Turkish feminist movement began in the 19th century during the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]. The ideal of [[gender equality]] was embraced after the declaration of the Republic of Turkey by the administration of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], whose [[Atatürk's reforms|modernizing reforms]] included a ban on [[polygamy]] and the provision of full political rights to Turkish women by 1930.

== History ==
[[File:Latife Hanım.jpg|thumb|[[Latife Uşşaki]] ([[Atatürk]]'s wife)]]
[[File:Safiye Ali.jpg|thumb|[[Safiye Ali]], the first Turkish female doctor.]]
In the course of the 16th and 17th centuries during the [[Sultanate of Women]], women of the [[Imperial Harem]] had extraordinary influence on politics of [[Ottoman Empire]]. Many of the Sultans during this time were minors and it was their [[Valide sultan|mothers]], like [[Kösem Sultan]], or sometimes daughters of the sultan as [[Mihrimah Sultan]],  leaders of the Harem, who effectively ruled the Empire. Most of these women were of slave origin. The period started in 1520 during the reign of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] until 1656, the reign of [[Mehmed IV]].

During the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] in the 19th century, educated women within the elites of Istanbul began to organise themselves as feminists. With the [[Tanzimat]] reforms, improving women's conditions was considered as part of a wider modernisation effort. Ottoman women's movement began to demand rights.&lt;ref name=tanzeur&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women's Movement in Turkey: From Tanzimat towards European Union Membership 1|url=http://sam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ZuhalYesilyurtGunduz2.pdf|author=The Women's Movement in Turkey: From Tanzimat towards European Union Membership 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fought to increase women's access to education and paid work, to abolish polygamy, and the [[peçe]], an Islamic veil. Early feminists published woman magazines in different languages and established different organizations dedicated to the advancement of women.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; The first women's association in Turkey, the [[Ottoman Welfare Organization of Women]], was founded in 1908 and became partially involved in the [[Young Turks]] Movement. Writers and politicians such as [[Fatma Aliye Topuz]], [[Nezihe Muhiddin]] and [[Halide Edip Adıvar]] also joined the movement.&lt;ref name=fem-mov&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Movements in Turkey|url=http://amargigroupistanbul.wordpress.com/feminism-in-turkey/feminist-movements-in-turkey/|author=Charlotte Binder, Natalie Richman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her novels, Halide Edip Adıvar criticised the low social status of Turkish women and what she saw as the lack of interest of most women in changing their situation.

During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], [[Kara Fatma]] a widow proved herself as a successful militia leader.
 
After the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the feminist movement gradually became part of the [[Kemalist ideology|Kemalist]] modernization efforts. [[Polygamy in Turkey|Polygamy]] was banned, divorce and inheritance rights were made equal.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; In the 1930s, Turkey gave full political rights to [[women]], including the right to elect and be elected locally (in 1930) and nationwide (in 1934).&lt;ref name="IHGD"&gt;[http://sorular.rightsagenda.org/soru-cevap/?g=4 Questions and Answers on Women's Right] Turkish, prepared by the Human Rights Agenda Association; accessed on 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There still remained, however, a large discrepancy between formal rights and the social position of women.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; In the 1980s, women's movements became more independent of the efforts to modify the state. After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]], women from both urban and academic milieus began to meet in reading groups and discuss feminist literature together. In these "awareness-raising groups", which were established notably in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, they criticized the standard construction of the family as well as the gender-specific role behavior that was forced on women. Independent feminist women's magazines were founded to expose the frequency of sexual harassment and violence against women.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; In 1987 feminists organized the first public protest against male violence, followed by campaigns against sexual harassment, "purple needle", and campaigns seeking the right of self-determination over the female body. These campaigns arose due to women's wish to reject the traditional patriarchal code of ethics, honor, and religion which left men to decide the fate of the female body. The second wave of the women's movement in Turkey reached a wider and more diverse group of women than the first women's movement.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt;

The acceptance of women's issues as an independent political and planning problem was discussed for the first time in the Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1985–1990), and "the General Directorate for the Status and Problems of Women" was established as a national mechanism in 1990. The General Directorate, which was connected to the Prime Ministry in 1991, has been carrying out its activities under the responsibility of a State Ministry. It conducts a large variety of activities with the objective of protecting women's rights, of strengthening the position of women in social, economic, cultural and political life, and of providing the equal utilization of rights, opportunities and capacities. Since the 1990s, feminist discourse has become institutionalized, with the foundation of women's studies centers and university programs at universities such as [[Marmara University]] or as [[Istanbul University]].&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; In 1993, [[Tansu Çiller]] became the first female Prime Minister of Turkey.

In 2002 the Turkish government reformed Turkish criminal and civil law, and since then, the rights of women and men during marriage, divorce, and any subsequent property rights have all been equalized.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt; A criminal law has been established that deals with the female sexuality as a matter of individual rights, rather than as a matter of family honor. Additions to the Turkish constitution oblige the state to use all the necessary means to promote the equality of the sexes. Family courts were also created, labour laws were instituted to prohibit sexism, and programs were created to educate against domestic violence and to improve access to education for girls.&lt;ref name=fem-mov /&gt;

Turkey is a party to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] since 1985, as well as to its [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Optional Protocol]] since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right of Women, Gender Equality and Struggle with Violence Against Women|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/the-right-of-women_-gender-equality-and-struggle-with-violence-against-women.en.mfa|publisher=Rep. of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish Constitution]] bans any [[discrimination]], state or private, on the grounds of [[sex]]. It is the first country which had a woman as the President of its [[Turkish Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]], [[Tülay Tuğcu]]. In addition, [[Turkish Council of State]], the supreme court for [[administrative law|administrative cases]], also has a woman judge [[Sumru Çörtoğlu]] as its President.

The article 41 of the [[Turkish Constitution]] was revised to read that the family is "based on equality between spouses".&lt;ref name="tk-ds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopvaw.org/turkey.html|title=Turkey|author=|date=|website=stopvaw.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new code also granted women equal rights to property acquired during marriage, which was supposedly meant to give economic value to women’s labor within the family household.&lt;ref name="tk-ds"/&gt;

The minimum age for marriage was also raised to 18 (17 with parental consent).&lt;ref name="tk-ds"/&gt; In cases of forced marriage, women have right to ask an annulment within the first 5 years of marriage.&lt;ref name="tk-ds"/&gt; In 2004, an update to article 10 of the constitution placed the responsibility for establishing gender equality on the state: "men and women have equal rights. The state shall have the obligation to ensure that this equality exists in practice".&lt;ref name="tk-ds"/&gt;

In 2005, the Turkish penal code was changed to criminalize [[marital rape]] and harshen the sentences for those convicted of honor killings, which previously carried reduced sentenced because of "provocation".&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; The Human Rights Directorate reported that the number of honor killings committed in Turkey rose to 220 in 2007, with most of the killings occurring in major cities.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/europe/turkey/women.html|title=In Turkey, Degrees of Change in Women's Rights &amp;ndash; 6 November 2008 - Online NewsHour - PBS|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
[[File:Halide Edib Adıvar b3.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Halide Edip Adıvar]]&lt;br /&gt; [[Turkish literature|Turkish novelist]] and [[feminism|feminist]] political leader.]]
The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of Turkish feminism occurred in the early 20th century, when women's organizations began to demand equality in civic and political rights. During this early period, the women's rights claims overlapped with the Kemalist reform process in the aftermath of the Republic.&lt;ref name="wavesfem"&gt;{{cite web|title=Waves of feminism in Turkey: Kemalist, Islamist andKurdish women’s movements in an era of globalization|url=https://khas.academia.edu/suletoktas/Papers/783269/Waves_of_feminism_in_Turkey_Kemalist_Islamist_and_Kurdish_womens_movements_in_an_era_of_globalization|author=Cagla Diner And Sule Toktas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second wave feminism]] reached Turkey in the 1980s, bringing up issues common to the movement which had emerged in the West in the 1960s, such as the elimination of violence against women, the oppression experienced in the family and the challenge against [[virginity test]]s, then a common practice for women who were about to get married or who had been subjected to sexual assault.&lt;ref name="wavesfem" /&gt;

The rise of a global civil society and the internationalization of women’s organizations and the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] have given women’s organizations the possibility of accessing foreign funds. The number of women’s organizations as well as the projects that these organizations conduct have increased.&lt;ref name="wavesfem" /&gt;

===Political representation===
{{Main article|Women in Turkish politics}}
In 1930s for the first time Turkish women entered politics. The first elected female mayor was [[:tr:Sadiye Hanım|Sadiye Hanım]] (1930). In the elections held on 8 February 1935 18 women entered the parliament. One of them, [[Hatı Çırpan]] was a [[Muhtar (title)|muhtar]] (village head) of a village prior to entrance to parliament. The first female city mayor was [[Müfide İlhan]] in 1950. 
Although representation of women in political and decision making bodies is relatively low, [[Tansu Çiller]] has been Prime Minister between 1993 and 1996. The number of [[Women in Turkish parliament|women in the Turkish parliament]] has increased to 14.3% after the [[Turkish general election, 2011]] (79 individuals in the parliament), most of them are affiliated with the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&amp;ArticleID=76718 |title=Women deputies constitute 14.3 pct of Turkish parliament &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; Worldbulletin News |publisher=Worldbulletin.net |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 the percentage was 10.9 and in 2006 it was 16.3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmkadinhaklari.org/unjp/web/gozlem.aspx?sayfaNo=66 UN Joint Program for the Development of Women and Children's Rights], Turkish: ''Türkiye'de Kadın Olmak''; accessed on 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5.58 percent of mayors are women and in the whole of Turkey there is one governor (among 81) and 14 local governors.&lt;ref name="IHGD" /&gt;

On 2010, the Turkish anti-violence group Mor Cati created a video attempted to raise awareness of violence toward women in a public way. The group placed large posters of women jumping for joy, their arms and legs splayed out beyond the frame's borders, all around Istanbul. The text next to the women reads, "I want to live in freedom." The organization then set up hidden video cameras, which purport to show male passersby kicking and ripping off the cutouts' arms and legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/domestic-violence-against-women-video-turkey/388544/|title=In Turkey, Not Even Posters of Women Are Safe From Violence|first=Olga|last=Khazan|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=45&amp;v=116eJjIxRaI|title=Mor Cati - Domestic violence made visible on the streets / Paper-Plane.fr|first=|last=PaperPlane|date=5 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2013 about 28,000 women were assaulted, according to official figures. Of those, more than 214 were murdered, monitors say, normally by husbands or lovers.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;

On November 2015, Izmir Bar Association’s Women’s Rights and Legal Support Office said that the last decade has not only seen the increase in the numbers of women subject to violence, but that the violence itself has become more intense and barbaric, "bordering on torture.". They also stated that the number of [[femicide]]s in the last few years has ranged between 5,000 and 6,000, adding that the State either cannot or do not disclose exact records, so different platforms try to fill in this gap in terms of adequate data through media monitoring,". The journalist Ceyda Ulukaya, made an interactive ""Femicide Map" of Turkey. The project, supported by the Platform for Independent Journalism, contains detailed data about 1,134 femicide victims between 2010 and 2015, including the victims, the identity of the accused/murderer, the reason and links to newspaper stories about their murders. Both qualitative and quantitative data showed that the majority of the victims were killed by husbands/ex-husbands (608 cases) and boyfriends/ex-boyfriends (161). The most often-cited reason of the murder is that the woman wanted a divorce or refused reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/violence-against-women-in-turkey-increases-both-in-number-and-brutality-91880|title=Violence against women in Turkey increases both in number and brutality|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===

A 2002 study by Ayranci, et al. observed that in Turkey, 36.4% of women complained about physical violence and 71% mentioned physical, psychological or sexual assault during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/290267/Domestic_Violence_against_Women_in_Turkey_Policy_Suggestions_to_Prevent_It|title=Domestic Violence against Women in Turkey: Policy Suggestions to Prevent It|first=Pelin|last=Gul|date=|website=academia.edu|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to report by the Turkish government dating from 2009, 42% of the surveyed women said they had been physically or sexually abused by their husband or partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-24/world/turkey.women.protest_1_progressive-laws-turkish-government-protection-order?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Marchers demand better protection for women in Turkey - CNN|author=|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of them never speaking to anyone about this, and only 8% approach government institutions for support.&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/women/women-in-turkey-the-numbers-are-stacked-against-them-2/|title=Women in Turkey: The Numbers Are Stacked Against Them|author=|date=20 June 2011|website=amnestyusa.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they do approach them, police and gendarmerie sometimes prefer to attempt to "reconcile" the families rather than protecting them.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt; While the rates of violence are particularly high among poor, rural women, one third of the women in the highest economic brackets have also been subject to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;

A 2009 survey conducted by a leading Turkish university stated that some 42 percent of women over age 15 in Turkey and 47 percent of rural women have experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of a husband or partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/04/turkey-women-left-unprotected-violence|title=Turkey: Women Left Unprotected From Violence|author=|date=4 May 2011|website=hrw.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2011, the [[Human Rights Watch]] said in a report that Turkey's flawed family violence protection system leaves women and girls across the country unprotected against domestic abuse. The 58-page report, "‘He Loves You, He Beats You': Family Violence in Turkey and Access to Protection," documents brutal and long-lasting violence against women and girls by husbands, partners, and family members and the survivors' struggle to seek protection.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

In 2012, Turkey was the first country to ratify the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures|title=Full list|author=|date=|website=Treaty Office|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 37% of Turkish women said they had experienced physical or sexual violence - or both - according to an exhaustive 2014 survey of 15,000 households by the country’s family ministry.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews"/&gt;

According to the We Will Stop Women Homicides Platform, 294 women were killed in 2014, and 60% of them perished at the hands of husbands and boyfriends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/turkey-violence-against-women-husbands-speak-out.html|title=No justice for Turkish women who kill in self-defense|author=|date=|website=al-monitor.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2017, [[Habertürk]] reported that the number of [[electronic bracelet]]s given for domestic violence incidents throughout Turkey is only 30, although some 120,000 women are subjected to violence by men every year in the Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/30-electronic-tags-given-for-domestic-violence-cases-in-turkey-120555|title=30 electronic tags given for domestic violence cases in Turkey|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November, 2017, according to a study conducted by a student at [[Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University]], mentioned that 28.5 percent of the respondents said they have witnessed domestic abuse. In the same study 52.9 percent of those who were involved in a relationship said they were subjected to "dating abuse," described in the report as "psychological harassment or physical aggression." The report also revealed that 6.25 percent of victims said they were touched without their consent and 4.54 said they were raped. The study also showed that abusers are overwhelmingly men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/half-of-turkish-students-who-date-are-subjected-to-abuse-study-122413|title=Half of Turkish students who date are subjected to abuse: Study|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 365 women were killed by men in the first 11 months of 2017, according to data compiled by the "We Will Stop Femicide" activist platform based on news reported in the media. The report also stressed that women who are victims of sexual abuse tend to be neglected by their families, which pushes them to undertake independent measures for their self-protection. Among many victimized women, some end up committing suicide. The report stated that in 15 November percent of the women killed were victims of murder for "wanting to get a divorce," 11 percent were killed for "taking decisions about their lives independently," 7 percent were killed for "financial reasons," 4 percent were killed for "turning down [the man’s] reconciliation efforts," and another 4 percent were killed over "debates about their children." Most of the women killed in Turkey in November were aged between 25 and 35, with 75 percent of the women in this age range becoming victims after wanting to get divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/365-women-killed-in-turkey-in-first-11-months-of-2017-report-124209|title=365 women killed in Turkey in first 11 months of 2017: Report|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2017, two men on motorbikes sexually harassed two women, at [[İzmir]]. Then the women asked for help from two police officers in the street, but one of them started beating one of the women, according to the woman's testimony the "officer said the harassers were right because we were ‘dressed inappropriately,’".

===Rape===
According to a study, some commonly-expressed views on rape were given to individuals from various professions, who were asked to agree or disagree; results recorded that 33% of the police officers agreed that "some women deserve rape", 66% of police officers, as well as nearly 50% of other professional groups except the psychologists about 18% and 27% of psychiatrists, suggested that "the physical appearance and behaviors of women tempt men to rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435388/article-1G1-111635867/turkish-university-students-attitudes-toward-rape |title=Turkish university students' attitudes toward rape. &amp;#124; HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Turkish university student [[Özgecan Aslan]] was murdered as she resisted a rape attempt&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Brutal slaying leads to protests over violence against women in Turkey |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-slaying-of-turkish-woman-leads-to-street-protests-over-womens-rights-20150214-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[minibus]] in [[Mersin]].

In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 'the rape and torture of Kurdish prisoners in Turkey are disturbingly commonplace'. According to a report from Amnesty International in 2003, Hamdiye Aslan, who was accused of supporting the Kurdish separatist group, the PKK, had been detained in Mardin Prison, south-east Turkey, for almost three months in which she was reportedly blindfolded, anally raped with a truncheon, threatened and mocked by officers.&lt;ref name =gg&gt;{{cite web|author=Meral Duzgun |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/10/turkey-history-sexual-violence |title=Turkey: a history of sexual violence &amp;#124; Global Development Professionals Network &amp;#124; Guardian Professional |publisher=Theguardian.com |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on cases of sexual abuse in Turkey is often difficult; the issue is still taboo in Turkish culture, as well as the fact that much of Turkish media don't report on such cases as they tarnish the country's modern and secular image. The result of this is that many injustices within Turkey, including systematic rapes carried out in prisons to maintain power over communities, go unheard by the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=gg/&gt;

===Honor killings===
[[File:Latrans-Turkey_location_Southeastern_Anatolia_Region.svg|thumb|[[Southeastern Anatolia Region]], a region of Turkey strongly associated with [[honor killings]]]]
A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]], the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing. The team interviewed 180 perpetrators of honor killings and it also commented that the practice is not related to a feudal societal structure, "there are also perpetrators who are well-educated university graduates. Of all those surveyed perpetrators, 60 percent are either high school or university graduates or at the very least, literate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honor killing perpetrators welcomed by society, study reveals|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=147349&amp;bolum=101|publisher=''[[Today's Zaman]]''|author=Murat Gezer|accessdate=15 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719085429/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=147349&amp;bolum=101 |archivedate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Analysis of Honor Killings in Rural Turkey|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitsream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf|publisher='University of Toronto'|author=AYSAN SEV’ER|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a 16-year-old girl was buried alive by relatives for befriending boys in Southeast Turkey; her corpse was found 40 days after she went missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/Girl+buried+alive+honour+killing+Turkey+Report/2521342/story.html|title=Girl buried alive in honour killing in Turkey: Report| work=AFP | date=4 February 2010 | accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are well documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing.

A June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in [[Istanbul]] alone there was one honor killing every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years.

===Sexual harassment===

In 15 February 2015, a social media campaign started in order to let women share their own sexual harassment stories under the hashtag #sendeanlat (you tell your story too), after a 20-year-old woman was brutally killed in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-women-relate-sexual-harassment-stories-via-social-media--78413 Turkish women relate sexual harassment stories via social media]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 25 February 2015, there were  more than 800,000 tweets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/turkey-sendeanlat-twitter-campaign_n_6699702.html?guccounter=1 Women In Turkey Share Devastating Stories Of Sexual Harassment In #Sendeanlat Twitter Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Turkish model, Didem Soydan, tweeted that she had received abusive text messages, after testifying and giving her cell phone number to police in the case of a woman who was forced into a car after being beaten. In addition, the actress [[Beren Saat]], tweeted her own experiences about the sexual harassment and abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-women-relate-sexual-harassment-stories-via-social-media--78413 Turkish women relate sexual harassment stories via social media]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Turkish actress [[Hande Ataizi]] and a Turkish costume assistant accused the actor [[Talat Bulut]] of sexual harassment. A total of 56 producers and directors in Turkey supported the victims with a written statement. In the statement it mention that: "We know it is hard for a woman to expose harassment and abuse incidents in Turkey". The male actor had rejected the allegations and threatened to launch a countersuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-tv-series-producers-boycott-actor-over-sexual-abuse-allegations-133289 Turkish TV series producers boycott actor over sexual abuse allegations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women’s Shelters===

As of September 2018, there are a total of 132 [[Women's shelter]]s in Turkey. Only the province of [[Bitlis]] does not have a shelter for women. Most of those facilities are run by the Family, Labor and Social Services Ministry while others are operated by municipalities, the Immigration Authority (Göç İdaresi) and the Purple Roof (Mor Çatı), an NGO. According to data from 2016, 102 shelters under the Family Ministry accommodated 29,612 women and 17,956 children. Thirty-three facilities operated by municipalities sheltered 2,088 women and 1,433 children. And 66 women and 23 children were hosted at the shelter run by the NGO.&lt;ref name= "Women_Shelters"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-needs-more-and-better-shelters-for-women-charity-136538 Turkey needs more and better shelters for women: Charity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aslı Elif Sakallı, from the Purple Roof Women’s Shelter Foundation, said that only one or two social workers are employed at shelters that host 25 to 30 women. She also added that  some employees at the shelters who are not conscious about gender equality could make statements such as: “But clearly you deserved this.”&lt;ref name= "Women_Shelters"/&gt;

==Religious officials and women==

In 2017, the [[mufti]] of the [[Kocaeli Province|Kocaeli]]’s [[Gölcük, Kocaeli|Gölcük]] district had likened women without headscarves to products sold at half price.&lt;ref name=hurriyet_06292018&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-mufti-says-women-should-not-see-each-other-naked-while-swimming-133958 Turkish mufti says ‘women should not see each other naked while swimming’]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the mufti of the [[Zonguldak]] said that "women should enter the sea in a way that other women cannot see them.

The gender gap in secondary education (5.3% lower than boys) remained, albeit at much lower levels in comparison to the 2002-2003 educational year (25.8%). However, the gender gap in higher education increased between 2002 and 2012 to 9.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kızların okullaşma oranı erkekleri geçti|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/egitim/25633801.asp|publisher=Hürriyet|accessdate=14 February 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant regional differences still persist, with only 15.9% of girls attending secondary school in the [[Muş Province]] as of 2010, as opposed to 82.4% in the [[Bilecik Province]], the province with the highest percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taslak Ülke Programı Dokümanı- Türkiye|url=http://unicef.deparyazilim.com/files/bilgimerkezi/doc/2011-2015-ulke-programi.pdf|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=14 February 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the provinces with the lowest schooling ratios for girls were [[Bitlis Province|Bitlis]], [[Van Province|Van]] and [[Hakkari Province|Hakkari]], all in southeastern Turkey, while those with the highest ratios were [[Ankara Province|Ankara]], [[İzmir Province|İzmir]] and [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], all in western Turkey. Dropout rates for girls at primary level are higher than boys, especially concentrating at the fifth and sixth years.&lt;ref name=sta&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadınların okuryazarlığı erkeklerden dört kat az|url=http://www.siviltoplumakademisi.org.tr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=716:kadinlarinokuryazarligi&amp;catid=44:son-haberler&amp;Itemid=118|publisher=Civil Society Academy|accessdate=14 February 2015|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily [[Habertürk]] reported on 9 January 2018, that only three state universities in Turkey have women [[Rector (academia)|rectors]], despite women making up 43.58 percent of all academics in the country. According to education specialist Alaaddin Dinçer, the absence of women among universities’ boards of directors is the result of a "consciously made decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/only-three-out-of-111-state-university-rectors-are-women-in-turkey-125478|title=Only three out of 111 state university rectors are women in Turkey|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==

The [[employment rate]] (for ages 15–64), as of 2015, was 30.5% for women, much lower than that of men which was 69.8%.&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"/&gt;
In 2011, out of 26 million employable women, only 5.9 million were in the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkey-needs-more-women-in-business-2011-09-30|title=Hürriyet Daily News|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23.4% of women have either been forced by men to quit their jobs or prevented from working.&lt;ref name="hdn-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=women-murder-victims-increase-snowballing-in-turkey-2011-02-20|title=Hürriyet Daily News|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of women not covered by [[social security]] is 84% in the East and 87% in the Southeast.&lt;ref name="hdn-2"/&gt;

Women’s employment has decreased since 2000 and the participation of women in the workforce lags behind some Islamic countries as well as western countries.&lt;ref name="hdn-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=inequalities-are-deep-in-turkey-and-women-suffer-the-most-2010-07-22|title=Hürriyet Daily News|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for this is the increased migration of rural women, who would otherwise have been employed in the agriculture sector.&lt;ref name="hdn-2"/&gt; Compared to other Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, Turkey is the only one with a diminishing rate of women’s employment.&lt;ref name="hdn-2"/&gt;

According to [[World Bank]], women made up 30.5% of the labor force in 2014 (roughly unchanged from 1990 when they made up 30.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS|title=Labor force, female (% of total labor force) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it is possible that the involvement of women in the labour force is very underestimated, due to women working in the [[informal economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/informal-female-work-turkey-com-201481163535208284.html|title=Turkish women's informal work - a complex story|first=Riada Asimovic|last=Akyol|date=|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the relatively low involvement of women in the workforce compared to other countries, women in Turkey are quite well represented in the business world; for instance the proportion of women in business leadership roles in Turkey is almost twice higher than that of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grantthornton.global/en/press/press-releases-2015/women-in-business-2015/|title=Women in business 2015 results|author=|date=|website=Grant Thornton International Ltd. Home|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2017, Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation (TÜRKONFED) Chairman said that half of the women in Turkey’s labor force are unregistered and that the ratio of unregistered women workers in the country is much higher than that of men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/half-of-women-in-turkish-labor-force-unregistered-121153|title=Half of women in Turkish labor force unregistered|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also, said that Turkey must raise women’s participation in the workforce to ensure sustainable development, adding that Turkey is the only country in [[Europe]] with an employment rate among women lower than 40 percent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As of 2018, just 34% of women in Turkey work, by far the lowest of the 35 industrialised countries of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) where the average is 63%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43197642 Women challenge Turkey traditions for right to work]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 19, 2018, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has fined Turkey 11,000 [[euro]]s over the government-owned electricity distribution company’s refusal to appoint a woman as a security officer on account of her gender. In October 1999 the female applicant, Hülya Ebru Demirel, passed a civil service exam and was informed that she would be appointed as a security officer at the [[Kilis]] branch of the Turkish Electricity Distribution company (TEDAŞ). However, the company refused to appoint her, citing her failure to fulfil the condition for the position to be “a man who has completed military service.” The applicant initially won a discrimination court case against the company in 2001 but that decision was overturned on appeal by the Supreme Administrative Court in December 2002. Demirel’s subsequent appeals were all reported to be unsuccessful, which ultimately led her to lodge an appeal at the ECHR on June 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/euro-court-fines-turkey-over-refusal-to-appoint-woman-as-security-guard-133493 Euro court fines Turkey over refusal to appoint woman as security guard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==

In March 2018, Parliament Speaker [[İsmail Kahraman]] forbid the women of a troupe from being onstage, at a tribute to the anniversary of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] at the [[Turkish Parliament]]. He was offended that actresses playing the mothers of soldiers would be giving guys public hugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/istanbul-film-festival-turkey-censorship-1201957551/ Turkey’s Government Is Censoring the Movies, But the Istanbul Film Festival Is Soldiering On]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
{{see also|Child marriage in Turkey}}
On average, 28% of Turkish women were married before the age of 18. Because of the large regional differences in the incidence of underage marriages, as many as 40~50% are married as minors in some areas, particularly in eastern and [[Central Anatolia]].&lt;ref name=nyt-2011-11-17&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkish Television Takes on Topic of Child Brides|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/world/europe/turkish-television-takes-on-topic-of-child-brides.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|date=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Commission on Equality of Opportunity for Women and Men states that childhood marriages are "widely accepted" by Turkish society.&lt;ref name=nyt-2011-11-17/&gt; A [[bride price]] is still paid in parts of Turkey.&lt;ref name=nyt-2011-11-17/&gt;

In 2016, the governing [[Islamism|Islamist]] conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) sought to introduce legislation which would have made a child rape no longer punishable if the perpetrator would offer to marry his victim; this was withdrawn after a public outcry against what was widely seen as an attempt of "legitimising rape and encouraging child marriage".&lt;ref name=AKP&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and vulnerable people are paying for Turkey’s authoritarianism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/women-vulnerable-turkey-child-rape|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, daily [[Habertürk]] reported that the number of Turkish women illegally seeking [[surrogate mother]]s abroad, especially in countries where the practice is common and legal, such as in Greek Cyprus, Georgia and the United States, or women offering to become surrogates for money has been on the rise. This practice is forbidden by Turkish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/number-of-turkish-women-illegally-seeking-surrogate-mothers-online-abroad-on-rise-report-126825|title=Number of Turkish women illegally seeking surrogate mothers online, abroad on rise: Report|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Underage pregnancy]]===

General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Affairs, mentioned that 2,730 girls younger than 15 years old and 50,848 girls aged between 15 and 17 gave birth in 2001.&lt;ref name ="186 underage pregnant girls treated in Turkey’s western province of Edirne in 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/186-underage-pregnant-girls-treated-in-turkeys-western-province-of-edirne-in-2017-128486|title=186 underage pregnant girls treated in Turkey’s western province of Edirne in 2017|author=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkish Statistical Institute]] (TÜIK) mentioned that 16,396 girls aged between 15 and 17 gave birth across Turkey in 2016, as well as 234 girls younger than 15.&lt;ref name ="186 underage pregnant girls treated in Turkey’s western province of Edirne in 2017"/&gt;

In 2017, officials in Turkey recorded the number of underage pregnancies at 15,216. Istanbul and the [[Gaziantep Province|province of Gaziantep]] topped the list with 1,106.&lt;ref name = "2018-report-underage-pregnancy"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/22-000-teenage-pregnancies-recorded-in-18-months-report-139020 22,000 teenage pregnancies recorded in 18 months: Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, media reports revealed that a single Istanbul hospital had covered up over 100 underage pregnancies in just six months.&lt;ref name ="186 underage pregnant girls treated in Turkey’s western province of Edirne in 2017"/&gt;

In the first half of 2018, there were 625 underage conceptions in Istanbul and 499 in Gaziantep.&lt;ref name = "2018-report-underage-pregnancy"/&gt;

During the 2017 and the first half of the 2018, there were 1,348 underage pregnancies in the [[Adana Province|province of Adana]], 1,005 in the [[Diyarbakır Province|province of Diyarbakır]] and 1,313 in the [[Hatay Province|province of Hatay]].

A 2006 survey by the [[Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation]] estimated the prevalence of hair covering among Turkish women at 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish beauty mag ties Muslim veil to glamour|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5is4od4JJaJenUAvqG9kqXN44DZzA?docId=CNG.da2764e86cb62e559ce333c0ceb4bcc0.491|publisher=AFP (hosted on Google)|accessdate=5 June 2013|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional variations: in 2005, 30% of women in Istanbul covered their hair, while in central and eastern Turkey, women are rarely seen on the streets, and wear headscarves in public.&lt;ref name="KamerlingGustafson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Kamerling|author2=Fred Gustafson|title=Lifting the Veil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ml_JHjX2vFIC&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=5 June 2013|date=May 2012|publisher=Fisher King Press|isbn=978-1-926715-75-9|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 survey found that, compared to a previous study carried out in 1999, the number of women who employ headcoverings had increased in rural areas, but decreased in cities.&lt;ref name=TESEV07&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromm|first=Ali Çarkoğlu, Binnaz Toprak ; translated from Turkish by Çiğdem Aksoy|title=Religion, society and politics in a changing Turkey|year=2007|publisher=TESEV publications|location=Karaköy, İstanbul|isbn=978-975-8112-90-6|pages=27–29|url=http://www.tesev.org.tr/Upload/Publication/b1d06f12-4c13-4e18-a3b3-8c1555d915d7/RSP%20-%20Turkey%2011%202006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the [[Çarşaf]], Turkish version of Arabic [[niqab]], was almost never worn by women in the 18–39 age group.&lt;ref name=TESEV07/&gt;

From 1999 to 2006, women not wearing head coverings in the 25–39 age group rose from 28% to 41.5%, and in the 18–24 group increased from 40.5% to 50.7%.&lt;ref name=TESEV07/&gt; The prevalence also differs by income: in 2006, 37.2% of women in the medium income group were uncovered, compared to 71.2% in the higher income group.&lt;ref name=TESEV07/&gt;

The same survey asked single men whether they would want prospective wives to go covered: 56% responded no, 44% yes.&lt;ref name=TESEV07/&gt; Only 1.1% of covered women said they cover because of their spouses, fiancees or family.

{{see also|Abortion in Turkey}}
Since 1985, Turkish women have the right to freely exercise [[Abortion in Turkey|abortions]] in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and the right to [[Contraception|contraceptive medicine]] paid for by the Social Security. Modifications to the Civil Code in 1926 gave the right to women to initiate and obtain a [[divorce]]; only [[Maltese divorce referendum, 2011|recognized in Malta (a EU country)]] for both men and women in 2011. Turkish prime minister [[Erdoğan]] argued that women should have at least three children.&lt;ref name="amnesty"/&gt;

No gender discrimination exists regarding the laws as well as their practice in the health sector in Turkey.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} On the other hand, prolific pregnancy and birth have a negative health impact on both the mother and the child. With the 1994 World Population and Development Conference, the Ministry of Health adopted a policy change which included the emotional, social and physical health of women and young girls with an integrated approach, rather than only reproductive health and family planning as it did in the past. Another initiative brought onto the agenda by the Ministry of Health after the Beijing Conference, is to ensure the participation of men in reproductive health and family planning.
