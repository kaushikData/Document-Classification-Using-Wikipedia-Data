The '''1994 [[Commonwealth Games]]''' were held in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], in the province of [[British Columbia]] in Canada, from 18 to 28 August 1994.

The XV Commonwealth Games ([[French language|French]]: ''XV&lt;sup&gt;éme&lt;/sup&gt; Jeux du Commonwealth'') marked [[South Africa]]'s return to the Commonwealth Games following the [[apartheid]] era, and over 30 years since the country last competed in the [[1958 Commonwealth Games|Games in 1958]]. [[Namibia]] participated in its first Games after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, and the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] also made their Games debut. It was also [[Hong Kong]]'s last appearance at the Games before the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] from Britain to [[China]].

The official mascot of the Games was an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[killer whale]] named "Klee Wyck".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol21no6/revkleewyck.html&lt;/ref&gt; "Klee Wyck", meaning "the laughing one", was a nickname given to Canadian painter and sculptor [[Emily Carr]] by the [[Ucluelet First Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bcheritage.ca/emilycarrhomework/writing/klee.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten types of sports were featured at the Victoria Games: athletics, [[Aquatic sports|aquatics]], badminton, [[boxing]], cycling, gymnastics, [[Lawn bowling|lawn bowls]], shooting, [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]], and [[wrestling]].

==Host selection==
Three bids for the 1994 Commonwealth Games were submitted. Victoria, New Delhi, and Cardiff were the bidding cities. On 15 September 1988, the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] voted to award Victoria the 1994 Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victoria wins 1994 Games|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19880916&amp;id=0a1UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3003,139394&amp;hl=en|publisher=''[[New Straits Times]]''|date=16 September 1988|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Lightweight Games" ==
Victoria 1994 was considered by many in the Commonwealth movement to be a minimalistic version of the games. After the high memories of [[1990 Commonwealth Games|Auckland's games]] four years previously, many considered Victoria to be a mild let-down. Some facilities were old and decrepit such as [[Victoria Memorial Arena]]. Other venues were temporary; none more so than the large scaffolding-built stands that totally transformed the [[University of Victoria]]'s [[Centennial Stadium]].

Overall the games were successful, proving that smaller cities could manage hosting large events such as the Commonwealth Games.

== Final "Original Games" ==
The 1994 games was the last time team sports were excluded. The [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] deemed the original setup of ten sports to be obsolete. Beginning with the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998 games]], team sports such as [[Rugby sevens]], Basketball, and [[Field hockey]] were added. The decision was taken to encourage more revenue streams from [[Television network|television]] by making the games more attractive to viewing audiences.

== Opening ceremony ==
A simple friendly atmosphere was the theme to the Opening Ceremonies. In the presence of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH Prince Edward]], the Athletes had a long march past to their seated area (an idea created four years previously and emulated since at the [[2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|2014 Games in Glasgow]]). Welcome speeches and flag raisings were followed by a [[Musical Ride|precision horse riding display]] by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. A visual and theatrical display by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Four Nations Tribes]] culminated in a massive [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird symbol]] covering the entire inner field. This was followed by a flypast by the "[[Snowbirds]]" [[History of the Royal Canadian Air Force#Unification and Air Command|Canadian Forces]] [[Aerobatics|aerobatic]] display team.

===Participating teams===

===Calendar===
The following table shows a summary of the competition schedule.
{{1994 Commonwealth Games calendar}}

===Medal table===
This is a full table of the medal count of the 1994 Commonwealth Games. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the [[IOC]], [[IAAF]] and [[BBC]].

This was the first time since the commencement of the British Empire Games (in 1930) that England did not achieve a medal ranking in the top two.

==Boxing committee==
In preparation for 1994 Commonwealth Games, a boxing committee was formed in 1989. The chairperson of the boxing committee was Hassan Sunderani, and the initial members were [[Brian Zelley]], Glyn Jones and Mike Sartori.

In the initial stages, of the committee one of the immediate tasks was to prepare a guide as to what was expected at the Games, and to document some history of [[amateur boxing]] in the [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria area]]. The primary work was done by chairperson Sunderani while the local boxing history was assigned to committee member Zelley, a previous news editor for the British Columbia Amateur Boxing Association in the mid-1980s and a contributor of boxing news to various news outlets in the 1970s and 80s.

The next order of business was to start the process of organising volunteers. The first formal public meeting to begin this process took place in Victoria in the boardroom of the Victoria Commonwealth Games Society on 21 April 1990. The meeting included three of the committee members, a VCHS official, and seven potential volunteers including two former Vancouver Island Amateur Boxing commissioners – Bert Wilkinson and Rick Brough.

The primary decision was to arrange a bigger meeting and consider reviving the Greater Victoria Amateur Boxing Association on a formal or informal basis and to have former experienced persons with some background in the sport of [[amateur boxing]]. That meeting took place on 13 May 1990 with twenty three persons in attendance and was listed as the "Greater Victoria Amateur Boxing Association Founding Meeting", and took place at the Princess Mary restaurant. This would become an important meeting to begin the real work in preparation of volunteers; having a representative attend the [[1990 Goodwill Games|1990 Seattle Goodwill Games]] to observe; and plan and prepare for a test event in 1993. Preliminary coverage of the 13 May meeting included a piece a couple of days earlier titled ''Approaching Games to lift amateur boxing's profile''. The reporter Jeff Rud interviewed Games official John Stothart and boxing committee members Mike Sartori and [[Brian Zelley]].&lt;ref&gt;"Times-Colonist. Jeff Rud, 11 May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 test event was held in August and would include some top Canadian boxers such as [[Dale Brown (boxer)|Dale Brown]] of Calgary. Brown was highlighted in the local paper with the headlines ''Brown building impressive ring career'';&lt;ref&gt;"Times-Colonist", 27 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of the tournament the local newspaper reported ''"Tournament was a perfect dry run" by Jeff Rud, 29 August 1993.''&lt;ref&gt;"Times-Colonist, 29 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim boxing chairman===
During 1991 Hassan Sunderani resigned as the chairman and committee member [[Brian Zelley]] stepped-in for a one-year period as the acting chairman of the committee. During this period, the primary role was to attend Sports Committee meetings&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Commonwealth Games Society, Sports Committee Meetings during 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; while the local boxing community started to organise for potential boxing club activity. In 1992, Sunderani resumed his position and steps were taken to prepare for the pre-Commonwealth Games event in 1993. Also, some new members were appointed to the boxing committee such as Tom Black.&lt;ref&gt;Times-Colonist, 17 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying heats&lt;ref name=" theworldsstrongestman.com "/&gt;==

Qualifying heats in [[World's Strongest Man]] involve a series of six events. The field is divided into groups of six competitors with the top two in each of the groups reaching the ten man final. A win in an event gives a competitor 6 points, second place gets 5, and so on (4,3,2,1). If there is a tie at the end of the qualifier, the competitor with the most individual event wins gets the advantage.

The '''2013 [[South Asian Games]]''', officially the '''XII South Asian Games''', was a scheduled [[multi-sport event]]  to take place in [[Mizoram]] and [[Shillong]], [[India]]. With this edition of the Games, [[India]] becomes the second country to host the Games three times (the previous editions being held in [[Kolkata]] in [[1987 South Asian Games|1987]] and [[Chennai]] in [[1995 South Asian Games|1995]]), after [[Bangladesh]]. It is also the first time that Delhi will host the Games. The Games witnessed a change in the original host country, and faced delays which pushed back the conduct of the Games by several months.

==Host change==

Originally, as per tradition of bringing the Games to each and every country of South Asia, [[Bhutan]] was selected to host the 12th edition of the Games. However, at the 41st [[South Asian Olympic Council]] held at [[Dhaka]] in February 2010, [[Bhutan]] expressed its inability to host the Games. So, to replace Bhutan, Delhi stepped in as host of the Games.&lt;ref name=hsch/&gt; [[Indian Olympic Association]] President [[Suresh Kalmadi]] officially received the SAG flag in Dhaka after the [[2010 South Asian Games|11th edition]] of the Games drew to a close on February 9, 2010.&lt;ref name=hsch/&gt; The Sports Ministry of India said, in an official press statement, that Delhi had been chosen as host so that the sport infrastructure built for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] remains in use.&lt;ref name=hsch/&gt;

==Delay==

Initially, the Games were expected to be held in October, 2012.&lt;ref name=hsch&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/Delhi-to-host-2012-South-Asian-Games/articleshow/5556360.cms

|accessdate=2010-03-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the General Body meeting of the [[Indian Olympic Association]] (IOA) on December 16, 2011, it was decided to postpone the Games to February, 2013. The primary concern highlighted was that the original plan meant that the Games would be held only two months after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], a fact which made athletes uncomfortable. In addition, the Delhi Government had stated that "accommodation would be a problem during October-November".&lt;ref name="Del"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/report/ioa-postpones-south-asian-games/20111216.htm|publisher=Rediff|title=IOA postpones South Asian Games, scraps recent committees|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, the IOA sent letters to all the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) of South Asia, announcing that the Games will be held for eight days beginning from February 13, 2013; further discussions would take place at an all-NOC meeting in [[Moscow]]. President of the [[Nepal Olympic Committee]] Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan also reported about the proposed additions of [[fencing]], [[equestrianism|equestrian]], [[gymnastics]] and the [[triathlon]] to the Games schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=33797 | title=India proposes mid-Feb for hosting South Asian Games | publisher=My Republica | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=April 17, 2012 | author=Khatiwada, Nabin}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013, host city and dates of the games were not yet confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-10-155789-SAG-may-be-shifted-from-India thenews.com.pk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204001557/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-10-155789-SAG-may-be-shifted-from-India |date=2015-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Olympic Committee]] banned the Indian Committee in March for political interference (the national government played a role in Olympic officials' selection). This delayed the event further as the ban was only lifted in May and the possibility of a low-cost edition of the games was raised among ongoing hosting discussions and poor relations with neighboring Pakistan due to the 2013 India–Pakistan border incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/sport-news/31789-athletics-south-asian-games-in-danger.html Athletics: South Asian Games in danger ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621145842/http://sundaytimes.lk/sport-news/31789-athletics-south-asian-games-in-danger.html |date=2013-06-21 }}. ''Sunday Times'' (Sri Lanka). Retrieved on 2013-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

2 years later, on the 11 February 2014, the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided to lift the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian athletes at Sochi 2014 able to compete under own flag after Olympic suspension lifted|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/1018336-indian-athletes-at-sochi-2014-able-to-compete-under-own-flag-after-olympic-suspension-lifted#.UvwO9ksaeME.facebook|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until now, the Indian side competed in Olympic events such as the [[Winter Olympic Games 2010|Winter Olympic Games]] as independent participants.

A year later, on 5 June 2015, the uncertainty over the venue to host the 12th South Asian Games ended with the Sports Ministry and Indian Olympic Association deciding to hold the regional multi-sporting event in [[Guwahati]] and [[Shillong]] in November-December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Uncertainty over SAG ends; Guwahati, Shillong to co-host Games|url = http://zeenews.india.com/sports/others/uncertainty-over-sag-ends-guwahati-shillong-to-co-host-games_1608162.html|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Asian Games to be held from Dec 10-20|url = http://zeenews.india.com/sports/others/south-asian-games-to-be-held-from-dec-10-20_1618814.html|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was postponed even further to a tentative date of February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 12th South Asian Games to be postponed further|url = http://zeenews.india.com/sports/others/12th-south-asian-games-to-be-postponed-further_1626839.html|accessdate = 2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AT&amp;T Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located in the [[South Beach, San Francisco|South Beach]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Since 2000, it has served as the home of the [[San Francisco Giants]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. Originally named '''Pacific Bell Park''', then '''SBC Park''' in 2003 after [[SBC Communications]] acquired [[Pacific Bell]], the stadium was ultimately christened '''AT&amp;T Park''' in 2006, following [[AT&amp;T]]'s buyout of SBC. The park stands along the [[San Francisco Bay]], a segment of which is named [[McCovey Cove]] in honor of former Giants player [[Willie McCovey]].

AT&amp;T Park has also played host to both professional and [[college football|collegiate]] [[American football]] games. The stadium was the home of the [[Foster Farms Bowl]], an annual college postseason [[bowl game]], from its inaugural playing in 2002 until 2013 and also served as the temporary home for the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]]'s football team in 2011. Professionally, AT&amp;T Park was the home of the [[San Francisco Demons]] of the [[XFL]] and the [[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]] of the [[United Football League (2009-)|United Football League]].

The stadium can be reached via San Francisco's [[Muni Metro]]; the [[2nd and King Station]] is directly outside the ballpark.

==History==

===Design and construction===
Originally designed to be a 42,000-seat stadium, there were slight modifications before the final design was complete. When the ballpark was brought to the ballot box in the fall of 1996 for voter approval, the stadium was 15° clockwise from its current position. Also the center-field scoreboard was atop the right-field wall and the Giants Pavilion Building were two separate buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Giants' Grand Designs / Statue of Willie Mays to Grace New Ballpark|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1997-02-25/news/17743059_1_seat-licenses-ballpark-s-chief-architect-scoreboard|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 25, 1997|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Groundbreaking on the ballpark began on December 11, 1997, in the [[Port of San Francisco|industrial waterfront area]] of San Francisco known as [[China basin|China Basin]] in the up-and-coming neighborhoods of [[South Beach, San Francisco|South Beach]] and [[Mission Bay, San Francisco, California|Mission Bay]]. The stadium cost $357 million to build and supplanted the Giants' former home, [[Candlestick Park]], a multi-use stadium in southeastern San Francisco that was also home to the [[National Football League]]'s [[San Francisco 49ers]] until 2014, when they relocated to [[Levi's Stadium]] in [[Santa Clara, California]]. A team of engineers from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] was consulted in the design process of the park, resulting in wind levels that are approximately half those at Candlestick. Fans had shivered through 40 seasons at "The 'Stick" and looked forward to warmer temperatures at the new ballpark.&lt;ref name=uc_davis&gt;{{cite web |title=Engineering: Taking the Wind Out of Baseball|url=http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/win00/News_Baseball.html|work=UC Davis Magazine|accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But because AT&amp;T Park, like its predecessor, is built right on [[San Francisco Bay]], cold summer fog and winter jackets in July are still not unusual at Giants games, despite the higher average temperature.

When it opened on March 31, 2000, the ballpark was the first [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] ballpark built without public funds since the completion of [[Dodger Stadium]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=first_private&gt;{{cite news |title=Privately Built Pacific Bell Park a Curse to Other Teams|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2002/oct/22/privately_built_pacific/|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=October 22, 2002|accessdate=September 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035104/http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2002/oct/22/privately_built_pacific/|archivedate=September 30, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Giants did receive a $10&amp;nbsp;million tax abatement from the city and $80&amp;nbsp;million for upgrades to the local infrastructure (including a connection to the [[Muni Metro]]).&lt;ref name=twins&gt;{{cite web |title=In San Francisco, the Giants Went Private for Their Stadium|first=Jon|last=Gordon|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/05/14_gordonj_sanfranpark/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=May 14, 2004|accessdate=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants have a 66-year lease on the {{convert|12.5|acre|m2|sing=on}} ballpark site, paying $1.2&amp;nbsp;million in rent annually to the San Francisco Port Commission.&lt;ref name=first_private/&gt; The park opened with a [[seating capacity]] of 40,800, but this has increased over time as seats have been added.

[[File:Pbp574.jpg|right|thumb|[[Barry Bonds]] passes [[Harmon Killebrew]] for seventh on the all-time [[home run]] list on May 13, [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]]. Note the sign on the scoreboard saying "Pacific Bell Park".]]
[[Pacific Bell|The Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]], a local telephone company in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], purchased the [[naming rights]] for the park for $50&amp;nbsp;million over 24&amp;nbsp;years in the Winter of 1996.&lt;ref name="SFGate AT&amp;T Park rename"&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Official: SBC Park Becomes AT&amp;T March 1 / S.F.

SBC eventually dropped the Pacific Bell name and reached an agreement with the Giants to change the stadium's name to "SBC Park" on January 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="SFGate AT&amp;T Park rename"/&gt;

After SBC bought [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] on November 18, 2005, the name of the merged company became [[AT&amp;T Inc.]] As a result, the stadium was given its third name in six years: "AT&amp;T Park".&lt;ref name="SFGate AT&amp;T Park rename"/&gt; A few fans still refer to the stadium as "Pac Bell Park", as it was the first name given to the stadium. Others have named the stadium "The Phone Booth" or "Telephone Park", for the constant name changes, while some referred to the stadium as "Some Big Corporation Park" due to the SBC years. Some referred to it as the ballpark to be named later.  Others yet refer to it as "Mays Field" in honor of Giants great Willie Mays or simply "The Bell".&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Gets Wired In San Francisco|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/10/mu1.html|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|last=Swartz|first=Jon|date=10 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also refer to the stadium as "China Basin" or "McCovey Cove" after its location, which would be immune to changes in sponsorship naming.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Features==
[[File:AT&amp;TPark wall.JPG|right|thumb|The 24-foot (7.3 m) high wall in right field]]
The stadium contains 68 luxury suites, 5,200 club seats on the club level, and an additional 1,500 club seats at the field level behind home plate.

On the facing of the upper deck along the left-field line are the retired numbers of [[Bill Terry]], [[Mel Ott]], [[Carl Hubbell]], [[Monte Irvin]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Barry Bonds]], [[Juan Marichal]], [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Willie McCovey]], and [[Gaylord Perry]], as well as the retired uniforms, denoted "NY", of [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] who played or managed in the pre-number era. These two pre-number–era [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers#Retired uniforms|retired uniforms]] are among only six such retired uniforms in all of the Major Leagues.

AT&amp;T Park has a reputation of being a pitcher's park and the most pitcher-friendly ballpark in the National League, because the depth of the outfield limits home runs, according to ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 MLB Park Factors|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor/_/year/2013|work=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN's MLB Park Factors lists AT&amp;T Park as having the fewest home runs per game 6 out of the past 7 years, the one exception coming in 2013, when it was the 3rd lowest.

In 2014, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared the park to be the Most Vegetarian-Friendly MLB ballpark in the country. It held the top spot on the same list in 2011, 2006 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kcra.com/news/att-park-ranked-most-vegetarianfriendly-ballpark-by-peta/26949998#!bfzRaF AT&amp;T Park Ranked Most Vegetarian-Friendly Ballpark by PETA]," KCRA, 14 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right field and McCovey Cove===
{{original research section|date=October 2012}}
The most prominent feature of the ballpark is the right-field wall, which is {{Convert|24|ft|m|1}} high in honor of former Giants [[Willie Mays]], who wore number 24. Because of the proximity to the [[San Francisco Bay]], the right-field [[foul pole]] is only {{Convert|309|ft|m|0}} from home plate. The wall is made of brick, with fenced-off archways opening to the Cove beyond, above which are several rows of arcade seating. The fence angles quickly away from home plate; right-center field extends out to {{Convert|421|ft|m|0}} from home plate. Atop the fence are four pillars with fountains atop. Jets of water burst from the four pillars at the end of the National Anthem and also when the Giants hit a home run or win a game.

[[File:Splash Hit.jpg|left|thumb|The 50 "Splash Hit" counter]]
In the past, rubber chickens put up by fans whenever a Giants player (especially Barry Bonds) was [[Intentional walk|intentionally walked]], would line the foul portion of the wall. The fans would do this to show that the opposing team is "chicken" for not pitching right to the Giants players. In recent seasons, as the team's strength has shifted from hitting to pitching, fans will line up "K" signs with each strikeout by a Giants pitcher. To some seniors, the right field area vaguely suggests the layout at the [[Polo Grounds]]. This deep corner of the ballpark has been dubbed "Death Valley" and "Triples' Alley." Like its Polo Grounds counterpart, it is very difficult to hit a home run to this area, and a batted ball that finds its way into this corner often results in a triple. Triples' Alley is also infamous for bad bounces, most notably when [[Ichiro Suzuki]] hit the first-ever [[inside-the-park home run]] in an [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] by lining the ball off one of the archways and sideways past the outfielders. [[Nate Schierholtz]] performed the same feat in the 2009 season as a pinch hitter. [[Aubrey Huff]] did it again in the 2010 season, as did [[Conor Gillaspie]] in 2011. [[Ángel Pagán]] ended a game in May 2013 with a two-run walk-off inside-the-park home run, the first of its kind at AT&amp;T Park.

Beyond right field is China Basin, a section of [[San Francisco Bay]], which is dubbed [[McCovey Cove]] after famed Giants [[first baseman]] and left-handed slugger [[Willie McCovey]], and into which a number of home runs have been hit on the fly. As of December 1st, 2018, 78 "splash hits" (all by a lefty batter) have been knocked into the Cove by Giants players since the park opened; 35 of those were by Barry Bonds, and the most recent being [[Brandon Belt]] hitting one off [[Tyler Mahle]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on May 15, 2018. These hits are tallied on an electronic counter on the right field wall. Opponents have hit the water on the fly 42 times; [[Todd Hundley]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] was the first visitor to do so on June 30, [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. [[Curtis Granderson]] of the [[New York Mets]], [[Luis Gonzalez (baseball outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Cliff Floyd]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] are the only visiting players to do so twice, while [[Carlos Delgado]] of the [[New York Mets]] has performed the feat three times.  [[Adam LaRoche]] has also hit three splash hits, twice with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and once with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. [[Max Muncy]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] most recently hit one into the water as a visiting player on September 30, 2018 On June 27, 2010, [[David Ortiz]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] became the first [[American League]] player to hit a splash hit. The only other AL players who have done it are [[Mitch Moreland]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] on June 9, 2012 and [[Adam Dunn]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] on August 13, 2014. Barry Bonds is the Giant who has hit the most home runs into "The Cove" as Giants fans call it and is the only one to have had hit 2 splash hits in one game (a feat he accomplished twice).&lt;ref name=splash_hits&gt;{{cite web |title=Splash Hits|url=http://mlb.com/sf/ballpark/splashhits.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the scoreboard in center field there is a pier where ferries can tie up and let off fans right at the park. On game days, fans take to the water of McCovey Cove in boats and even in [[kayak]]s, often with fishing nets in the hope of collecting a home run ball. (This echoes what used to happen during McCovey's playing days. Before Candlestick Park's upper deck was extended, the area behind right field was occupied by three small bleacher sections and a lot of open space. Kids in those bleachers would gather behind the right field fence when "Stretch" would come to the plate.) Just beyond the wall is a public waterfront promenade, where fans can watch three innings of a game through the wall's archways, free of charge, albeit with a somewhat obstructed view. Across the cove from the ballpark is McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring monuments to past Giants legends.

===Rusty, the Coke bottle, and the glove===
When the park opened in 2000, taking residence on the right field wall was ''Rusty'', the Mechanical Man based on a theme of [[Old Navy]] since the wall was sponsored by the company. Rusty was a two-dimensional robotic ballplayer that stood {{Convert|14|ft|m|1}} tall and weighed 5½ tons. The [[Valencia, California]] firm, Technifex, engineered, fabricated and programmed Rusty to appear after major plays, during games, as a fully animated giant 1920's era tin "toy". After technical problems arose with Rusty, it was removed from the ''Old Navy Splash Landing'', though the enclosure that housed him remained for years. In 2006 the Old Navy sponsorship of the wall was terminated and renamed "Levi's Landing". In 2008, the enclosure was removed as that area near the right field foul pole was renovated for a new luxury party suite called the "McCovey Cove Loft".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/15527355/detail.html AT&amp;T Park's new McCovey Cove Loft "Suite Of Dreams Debuts At AT&amp;T Park"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415153134/http://www.ktvu.com/news/15527355/detail.html |date=April 15, 2010 }} March 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AT&amp;T Park - Coke bottle and glove.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Coca-Cola]] bottle and old-fashioned glove]]
Behind the left field bleachers is "The Coca-Cola Fan Lot". The ballpark features an {{convert|80|ft|m|sing=on}} long [[Coca-Cola]] bottle with playground slides that lights up with every Giants home run, and a miniature version of the stadium. "The Coca-Cola Superslide" is popular with children as is with adults, and the terraced levels of the slides are a fun way to catch the game. Bubbles originally accompanied the bottle, but never worked as intended and were removed. If one were viewing the outfield promenade from home plate, directly to the bottle's right is another oversized representation of a ballpark stalwart, the "Giant 1927 Old-Time Four-Fingered Baseball Glove" — this particular one is made of steel and fiberglass. Behind and farther to the left is "The Little Giants Park" – a miniature baseball diamond — sort of a minor league tryout for Pee-Wee Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AT&amp;T Ballpark Attractions|url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/attractions.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the right of the glove sculpture is the elevator and large plaza area for functions and parties to be held during games. It's also the site of "Orlando's", the concessions stand of Giants great [[Orlando Cepeda]]. The signature fare at the stand is the "Caribbean Cha Cha Bowl". Right-center field features a real San Francisco [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] numbered 44 (retired cable car #4, formerly #504) in honor of Giants great [[Willie McCovey]]. Originally, the cable car had a label that stated [[Dodgers–Giants rivalry|"No Dodgers Fans Allowed"]], as well as one end of the car numbered 24 in honor of [[Willie Mays]] and the other end numbered 44 in honor of [[Willie McCovey]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.streetcar.org/cablecars/44-no-44-retiredballpark-maroonlight-blue/&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[fog horn]] — a feature introduced at [[Candlestick Park]] by the current Giants ownership group – was transferred to AT&amp;T and hung underneath the scoreboard. It blows when a Giants player hits a home run or at the conclusion of a Giants win. Continuing right takes one to the promenade above the Cove, so that one can make a completely uninterrupted circuit of the park at that concourse level. Both levels of the concourse, inside the stadium, feature not only concession stands of all sorts, but other attractions as well.

===@Café===
[[File:Lou seal giants mascot.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lou Seal has served as mascot of the San Francisco Giants since 1996.]]
Located behind the centerfield bleachers, the ballpark features the @Café,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome to AT&amp;T Park’s New Social Media Cafe – Home of the Giant Tweetdeck|first=Jeff|last=Elder|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/giants/2013/06/19/welcome-to-att-parks-new-social-media-cafe-home-of-the-giant-tweetdeck/|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social media café, which opened in the 2013 season. The cafe serves Peet's Coffee and features large screens that show off fans' social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which are curated by the Giants organization.

The cafe replaced a team-themed [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] store, where fans could build their own stuffed [[List of Major League Baseball mascots#Mascot store in various ballparks|Giants' mascot]], [[Lou Seal]], or create other Giants-themed stuffed animals.

===Scoreboards===
In addition to the automated scoreboards, which now include a new [[high-definition video]] board by [[Mitsubishi]], the park has enormous, manually operated boards on the right field wall, which display the scores of Major League games played elsewhere. These manual scoreboards are operated by three employees, whose work on game days starts at least two hours before the first pitch. A members-only bar (Gotham Club) is located behind the manual scoreboard, complete with bowling alley and pool tables. Former players and VIPs are the only patrons of this exclusive area.

===Wireless internet===
Starting in 2004, the Giants installed 122 [[Wi-Fi|wireless internet]] access points, covering all concourses and seating areas, creating one of the largest public [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]] in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giants Wi-Fi Network|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/wifi.jsp#wifi|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time.

===Statues===
[[File:AT&amp;T Park, San Francisco at night.jpg|thumb|left|Main entrance with Willie Mays statue and 24 palm trees.]]
Outside the ballpark are six statues, five of which are dedicated to San Francisco Giants all-time greats.

The Willie Mays Statue is located in front of the ballpark entrance at 24 Willie Mays Plaza and is surrounded with 24 palm trees, in honor of his number 24 uniform, retired by the Giants. It was dedicated at noon on March 31, 2000, prior to the opening of the ballpark and was commissioned by Giants Managing Partner [[Peter Magowan]] and his wife Debby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='All Choked Up / Giants Legend Willie Mays Is Moved By Statue of Him for New Ballpark'|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-08-07/news/17729836_1_statue-china-basin-new-stadium|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 7, 1998|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another statue is located at McCovey Point across [[McCovey Cove]], and is dedicated to [[Willie McCovey]]. Around the Willie McCovey Statue are a number of plaques that celebrate the winners of the [[Willie Mac Award]]. The statue is located at China Basin Park next to The Barry Bonds Junior Giants Field, a T-ball park. Also located on the sea wall promenade are plaques showing the [[Opening Day]] roster of every Giants team from 1958 through 1999. Giants fans who contributed funds to China Basin Park, had their own tiles with their own inscriptions set into the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=San Francisco Giants McCovey Point And China Basin Park|url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/mccoveypoint.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third statue, dedicated in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], honors former Giants pitcher [[Juan Marichal]], and is located outside the ballpark at the [[Lefty O'Doul]] Gate entrance. The fourth statue is located at the park's ferry plaza behind center field, also known as Seals Plaza; a statue of a seal bobbing a baseball on its nose honors the memory of the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], the minor league baseball club that played before the arrival of the Giants in 1958.

On September 6, 2008, during a series against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], a fifth statue depicting former Giants great [[Orlando Cepeda]] was dedicated at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. A sixth statue, dedicated on August 13, 2016, honors former Giants pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]] and is also located at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next to the ballpark. All five statues of the Giants Hall of Fame players were created by sculptor [[William Behrends]] of North Carolina.

===Controversial Chevron Banner===
A controversial feature of the ballpark is the long-running Chevron advertisement, located in left field, which features the famous claymation [[Chevron Cars]]. Some fans have criticized the banner since some of the cars actually stick up above the wall, thus altering the dimensions of the field. There have actually been instances where potential over-the-wall catches to take away home runs have been thwarted because of these cars: for example, during Game 3 of the 2016 NLDS against the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Kris Bryant]] hit a ball well into left field. Giants left-fielder [[Gregor Blanco]] attempted to catch the ball but the ball landed on the roof of a Chevron Car, out of his reach: thus the ball counted as a home run &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-the-car-bomb-the-catch-and-a-night-to-remember-20161011-column.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Notable events==

===2000s===
The opening series took place April 11–13, [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]] against the [[2000 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] (the team the Giants faced in their final series at Candlestick Park), and the [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] were swept in three games. In the first game of that series, the Giants lost 6–5, highlighted by three [[home run]]s from the Dodgers' [[Kevin Elster]]. On May 1, 2000, [[Barry Bonds]] became the first player to hit a "splash hit" home run into [[McCovey Cove]].

In just its first few years of existence, the ballpark saw its share of historic events primarily due to veteran Giants outfielder [[Barry Bonds]]. On April 17, [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], Bonds hit his 500th career home run at then-Pacific Bell Park. Later that year, he set the single season home run record when he hit home runs number 71, 72, and 73 over the weekend of October 5 to close the season. On August 9, [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]], Bonds hit his 600th career home run at the park. On April 12, [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004]], Bonds hit career home run 660 at SBC Park to tie Willie Mays for third on the all-time list and on the next night, he hit number 661 to move into sole possession of third place. On September 17, 2004, Bonds hit his 700th career home run at the park to become just the third member of baseball's 700 club. On May 28, [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], Bonds hit his 715th home run at the park to pass [[Babe Ruth]] for second place on the all-time list. On August 7, [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]], Bonds hit his 756th home run, breaking [[Hank Aaron]]'s record.

The park hosted games three through five of the [[2002 World Series]] against the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]], which the Giants lost four games to three. It also hosted the [[2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2007 MLB All-Star Game]], which the [[American League]] won 5–4 over the [[National League]].

On July 10, 2009, the Giants' [[Jonathan Sánchez]] pitched the first no-hitter at AT&amp;T Park.

===2010s===
On October 27 &amp; 28, 2010, the Giants hosted the first two games of the World Series, beating the [[2010 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in both games. They ultimately went on to win the series, their first championship since the team moved to San Francisco in 1958, though the clinching game was played at [[Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]] rather than at AT&amp;T Park.

On [[Matt Cain's perfect game|June 13, 2012]], [[Matt Cain]] threw the 22nd [[perfect game]] in [[MLB]] history — and first in Giants history — against the [[Houston Astros]].

AT&amp;T Park hosted Games 1 and 2 of the [[2012 World Series]] on October 24 and 25. The Giants beat the [[2012 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] twice, 8–3 and 2–0 respectively. The Giants would go on to win the 2012 World Series in a four-game sweep at [[Comerica Park]].

The stadium hosted of the semifinal and final rounds of the [[2013 World Baseball Classic]] on March 17–19.

On July 23, 2013, due to a previous rain-out in Cincinnati, AT&amp;T Park served as the "home" venue of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cincinnati Reds Set to Call San Francisco Home for Game 1 of Doubleheader|first=Mark|last=Sheldon|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130716&amp;content_id=53911254&amp;vkey=news_cin&amp;c_id=cin|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giants manager [[Bruce Bochy]] won his 1,500th career game.

On June 25, 2014 [[Tim Lincecum]] pitched the 3rd no hitter at AT&amp;T Park against the [[San Diego Padres]] in a 4-0 win. It was his 2nd no hitter of his career, with both of them coming against the Padres.

AT&amp;T Park hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[2014 World Series]] on October 24, 25, and 26. The Giants beat the [[2014 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 2 out of the 3 games played at AT&amp;T Park, losing Game 3, 3–2, before winning Games 4 and 5, 11–4 and 5–0 respectively.  They ultimately went on to win the series in seven games, with the clinching game played at [[Kauffman Stadium]] rather than at AT&amp;T Park. As of 2017, the Giants have not hosted a World Series clincher at AT&amp;T Park, but they did host one at [[Candlestick Park]] in {{wsy|1962}}, which was won by the [[1962 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]].

On June 15, 2015, the Giants set a record for most consecutive home losses at AT&amp;T Park at nine straight games with a 5-1 loss to the [[Seattle Mariners]]. This losing streak was the Giants' longest since an 11-game home loss streak at the Polo Grounds in New York in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Giants' home skid nearly a franchise record. ''Sports Xchange'' June 16, 2015 {{cite web|url=http://www.wsbt.com/sports/giants-home-skid-nearly-a-franchise-record/33601768 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617233007/http://www.wsbt.com/sports/giants-home-skid-nearly-a-franchise-record/33601768 |archivedate=2015-06-17 }} Retrieved June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1, 2010 to July 18, 2017, AT&amp;T Park recorded 530 consecutive sellouts, the second longest in Major League history behind [[Fenway Park]]'s 794 consecutive sellouts from 2003–13.

==Non-baseball events==
Giants Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Giants created and headed by longtime team executive [[Patrick J. Gallagher|Pat Gallagher]], brings non-baseball events to AT&amp;T Park on days when the Giants do not play. Prominent among these has been the usage of the stadium for football. It has also hosted a range of other sporting and musical events.

===Football===
The park was home to the [[XFL]]'s [[San Francisco Demons]] in 2001, was the home of the [[East-West Shrine Game]] (until 2006), and was the former home stadium of the [[California Redwoods]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|UFL]] in 2009.

From 2002 to 2013, it has also been home to [[college football]]'s [[Fight Hunger Bowl]], previously the San Francisco Bowl and most recently the Emerald Bowl. In 2011, AT&amp;T Park became the temporary home football stadium for the [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]] while Cal's on-campus stadium, [[California Memorial Stadium]], underwent renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cal Football to Play 2011 Home Season at San Francisco's AT&amp;T Park |url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051010aae.html |publisher=University of California, Berkeley Athletics |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814154433/http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051010aae.html |archivedate=August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T Park also hosted its first high school football game in 2011, the Central Coast Section Division III football championship game between long-time San Francisco rivals [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CCS Division III Title Game Set for AT&amp;T Park|first=Mitch|last=Stephens|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-11-30/sports/30461582_1_ignatius-game-title-game-schools-work|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 4, 2011|quote=This will be the first high school football game played at AT&amp;T (the two schools have played baseball games there as part of the [[Bruce-Mahoney Trophy|Bruce-Mahoney]] series).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soccer===
On February 10, 2006, the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's soccer team]] defeated [[Japan national football team|Japan]] 3–2 at AT&amp;T in a friendly. 

A match of the [[2011 World Football Challenge]] between [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Club America]] was held at AT&amp;T, drawing a crowd of 11,250.

On March 17, 2012, the [[Houston Dynamo]] defeated the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] 1-0 in a regular season [[Major League Soccer]] match at AT&amp;T.

===Rugby===
The stadium hosted the [[2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens]] from July 20 to July 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rwcsevens.com/video/246319|title=USA Rugby set to host RWC Sevens 2018 tournament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
A virtual recreation of the park was created as a gig venue for ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]''.

In the game ''[[Watch Dogs 2]]'', a stadium, called ''Nudle Park'', based on AT&amp;T Park is recreated. Its location is also in [[San Francisco]], and is in the same region.

===In TV===
In summer 2010, the park hosted an audition stop for the 2011 (10th) season of ''[[American Idol]]''.

===Other events===
The stadium hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round from 2003 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross media guide] American Motorcyclist Association&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mavericks, California|Mavericks big-wave surfing contest]] is broadcast live on the giant video display at AT&amp;T Park when the event is held. In 2006, the park hosted [[ICER AIR]] the first stadium big-air ski and snowboard competition to be held in the United States.

[[San Francisco Opera]] partnered with Giants Enterprises to do three broadcasts, most recently ''[[Tosca]]'', in June and September 2009.

In October 2013, rapper [[Kanye West]] rented out the stadium and the scoreboard for a private event, which turned out to be an elaborate [[marriage proposal]] to his girlfriend, reality personality [[Kim Kardashian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kanye's S.F.

The '''Akademos Rally''' is an annual [[car rally]] held in [[Victoria, Australia]], by the [[Melbourne University Car Club]]. The event had its origins in 1961. The name was coined by the then-head of Motorsport in Australia as an amalgam of academic (Akadem) and motorsport (mos).

The event is a round of the [[Victorian Rally Championship]]. The Akademos Rally is a [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]]-permitted event. As of the 2005 event, held in [[Alexandra, Victoria|Alexandra]], the event allows competitors to use [[pacenotes]]. Prior to 2005, the event was run as a "blind" event, where competitors are not allowed to view the course in the preceding six weeks.

[[File:Basketball net.jpg|thumb|Typical professional hoop with backboard]]
[[File:BasketballHoop.jpg|thumb|Typical privately owned basketball hoop with backboard]]
A '''backboard''' is a piece of [[basketball]] equipment. It is a raised vertical board with an attached '''basket''' consisting of a net suspended from a hoop. It is made of a flat, rigid piece of, often [[Plexiglas]] or [[toughened glass|tempered glass]] which also has the properties of [[safety glass]] when [[backboard shattering|accidentally shattered]]. It is usually [[rectangle|rectangular]] as used in [[NBA]], [[NCAA]] and international basketball. In recreational environments, a backboard may be [[oval]] or a [[Hand fan|fan]]-shape, particularly in non-professional games.

The top of the hoop is {{convert|10|ft|cm|0}} above the ground. Regulation backboards are {{convert|72|in|cm|0}} wide by {{convert|42|in|cm}} tall. All basketball rims (hoops) are {{convert|18|in|cm}} in diameter. The inner rectangle on the backboard is {{convert|24|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|18|in|cm}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_1.html Oct 17 2006 4:32AM&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional and most higher college settings, the backboard is part of a portable stanchion that can be moved out of the way in other sports, though in most high schools and examples such as [[Stanford University]]'s [[Maples Pavilion]], backboards are mounted as part of a suspended system using ceiling joists to support the goal and allow them to be put out of the way in the ceiling when not in use.

The first glass backboard was used by the [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball]] team at the [[Men's Gymnasium (Indiana University)|Men's Gymnasium]] at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]].&lt;ref name="Hiner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiner|first=Jason|title=Indiana University Basketball Encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=Sports Publishing|location=United States|isbn=1-58261-655-8|pages=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first few games at their new facility in 1917, spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] was employed to create new backboards that contained {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|-thick|adj=mid}} plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. It was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards.&lt;ref name="Hiner"/&gt;

Professional glass backboards used to break from {{convert|625|lbs|kg}} of force or more. Modern professional and higher-level college play backboards do not have the glass absorbing any weight to avoid breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=rockboy1138|title=Sports Science puts NBA backboards to the test!|date=2009-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1946yBnxl0 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish Baja''' is a [[Rally raid]] event held in the region of [[Aragon]] in northern [[Spain]].

This event was launched in 1983, based on the popularity of the African Adventure rallies, such as the [[Paris Dakar]] and the [[Rallye des Pharaons|Pharaons Rally]]. The event's creators, a group of French and Spanish enthusiasts, chose the desert of [[Monegros]] because of the scenery and availability of service infrastructure in [[Zaragoza]]. The first Baja in Spain was called the '''Baja Montesblancos'''.&lt;ref name=Historia&gt;"[http://www.bajaspain.com/eng/25anys/historia.html Historia]". Baja Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Spanish Baja was cancelled, as it coincided with the Olympic Games in [[Barcelona]]. After this, the Spanish Automobile Federation took over the organisation, and entered it into the [[FIA Cross Country Rally World Cup]].&lt;ref name=Historia /&gt;

'''Máfia do Apito''' (literally ''The Whistle Mafia''), sometimes referred to as the '''Escândalo do Apito''' (''The Whistle Scandal''), was the name given by the [[Brazil]]ian press to the [[association football|football]] [[Match fixing|match-fixing]] scandal reported by [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine on 23 September 2005.

== Overview ==

Some investors, who were not related to any club, bribed referees [[Edílson Pereira de Carvalho]] (a member of the [[FIFA]] referee staff) and Paulo José Danelon to fix results according to what was determined by the betting websites Aebet and Futbet. The investors made a deal with Edílson Pereira de Carvalho to fix the results of the matches refereed by him, and then, the investors made millionaire bets on the betting websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/corrupcaonofutebol/interna/0,,OI681561-EI5477,00.html|title=Corrupção no Futebol - Veja a cronologia do escândalo da arbitragem|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edílson Pereira de Carvalho said that he agreed to receive R$10,000 (US$4,400) to fix the result of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian National Championship]] match between [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]] and [[Figueirense Futebol Clube|Figueirense]], and that he was paid between R$10,000 and R$15,000 per fixed match. Edílson Pereira de Carvalho said he accepted the money to fix the results only because he had a R$30,000 debt.

The eleven Brazilian National Championship matches refereed by Edílson Pereira de Carvalho was made null and void by the [[Supremo Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva|Supreme Court of Sporting Justice]] (STJD), presided by Luiz Zveiter, even though Edílson Pereira de Carvalho assured he did not fix all eleven matches. The Supreme Court decided that all eleven matches needed to be replayed. This decision was not popular among the board of directors and supporters of the harmed clubs. Five clubs, which are [[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]], [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]], [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], Figueirense and [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] appealed the decision,&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/corrupcaonofutebol/interna/0,,OI725598-EI5477,00.html|title=Corrupção no Futebol - Recurso dos 5 clubes será julgado na próxima semana|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the decision was kept.&lt;ref name="kept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro2005/interna/0,,OI779735-EI4847,00.html|title=Série A - STJD mantém decisão de anulação dos jogos|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, Brazilian lawyer Luís Carlos Crema sought a court injunction requesting the cancellation of the decision that annulled the eleven Brazilian National Championship matches, Minister Nancy Andrighi of the Second Section of the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the demand.&lt;ref name="reject"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105124346/http://br.news.yahoo.com/051128/4/zr3f.html Ministra do STJ rejeita ação contra anulação dos jogos - Yahoo!] (Link dead as of January 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, another lawyer, Leandro Konrad Konflanz sought a lawsuit requesting the annulment of the replayed matches. If those matches are annulled, Internacional would win the competition, instead of Corinthians.&lt;ref name="win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internacional.com.br/pagina.php?modulo=3&amp;setor=25&amp;secao=72&amp;arquivo=S&amp;ano_arquivo=2005|title=Internacional - Site oficial|publisher=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was that no club should be announced as champion during the dawn of Sunday, December 5. [[Brazilian Football Confederation|CBF]], ignoring the decision, on December 6, declared Corinthians as the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 2005|2005 Campeonato Brasileiro]] champion.&lt;ref name="champion"&gt;[http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/materias/esportes/2202501-2203000/2202879/2202879_1.xml Tevez conquista o Prêmio Craque Brasileirão 2005 - iG Último Segundo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208063200/http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/materias/esportes/2202501-2203000/2202879/2202879_1.xml |date=December 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Munira Hanna, of the First Civil Court of [[Porto]] Alegre, dispatched a temporary restraining order obligating the CBF to obey that decision.&lt;ref name="obey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro2005/interna/0,,OI786349-EI4847,00.html|title=Série A - Juíza proíbe CBF de proclamar Corinthians campeão|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, FIFA and CBF rules forbid clubs to petition regular courts of justice (courts that are not dedicated to sporting arbitration) when the claim is directly related to a match, as was the case; thus, on December 7, Internacional's chairman, Fernando Carvalho, made a request to lawyer Konflanz to withdraw the lawsuit, which he did on December 9.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro2005/interna/0,,OI787730-EI4847,00.html|title=Série A - Presidente do Inter pede para torcedor retirar ação|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="withdrew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/brasileiro2005/interna/0,,OI790169-EI4847,00.html|title=Série A - Torcedor do Inter retira ação, e Corinthians é campeão|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Brazilian Second Division]] first stage matches were refereed by Paulo José Danelon. These matches were not annulled.

Paulo José Danelon and Edílson Pereira de Carvalho, together, refereed 22 [[Campeonato Paulista|Paulista Championship]] matches. None of these matches has been annulled, including two of them which were initially considered suspected of being fixed. Both suspected matches were refereed by Paulo José Danelon. The [[Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva do Futebol de São Paulo|São Paulo Football Sporting Justice Court]]'s Inquiry Court, after analyzing all the 22 matches, concluded that no matches were fixed, with the exception of the two suspected matches. Even after coming to the conclusion that these two matches were fixed, the São Paulo Football Sporting Justice Court decided that the results should be kept.

Edílson Pereira de Carvalho was banned for life by the STJD's First Disciplinary Commission. Paulo José Danelon was removed from the referee staff of [[Federação Paulista de Futebol|Paulista Football Federation]]. On October 31, 2005, the São Paulo Football Sporting Justice Court's First Disciplinary Commission banned for life both Edilson Pereira de Carvalho and Paulo José Danelon. So, they are prohibited from refereeing Paulista football competitions matches. Both Edílson Pereira de Carvalho and Paulo José Danelon face charges of fraud, conspiracy and crimes against the economy. The entrepreneur Nagib Fayad (nicknamed Gibão), suspected of commanding the gambling ring in [[Piracicaba]] was arrested on September 25.

[[File:Fairfield Stadium, Huntington, W. Va (66551).jpg|thumbnail|left|Postcard showing the stadium]]
'''Fairfield Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Huntington, West Virginia]].  It was primarily used for [[American football|football]], and was the home field of the [[Marshall University]] football team between 1927 and 1990, prior to the opening of [[Joan C. Edwards Stadium]].

== History ==
The original stadium was a red brick structure that featured a grass field circled by a [[cinder]] track and was owned by the city and mostly maintained by community volunteers.  

In 1970, a major renovation project was completed that expanded the [[seating capacity]] by 5,000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;"A University at Last." Marshall University. 1997. 20 Dec. 2006 [http://www.marshall.edu/muhistory/uni/71.htmlx].&lt;/ref&gt; An artificial grass playing surface was installed, and the playing surface was lowered. Along with that, a new press box and locker room for the home team was constructed. The 1970 season ended with the crash of [[Southern Airways Flight 932]] on November 14, which killed all 75 people aboard, including 37 players and six coaches.

The stadium fell into disrepair in the 1970s and 80s.   In 1984 the original 1927 east side was torn down, after being found unsafe, and was replaced by temporary aluminum bleachers.  

For the 1991 season, visiting teams were forced to dress at Fairfield and then ride the team bus more than a mile to and from the new stadium for the game. This is because the Shewey Athletic Center, which houses Joan C. Edwards Stadium's locker rooms, were not completed. (Marshall used facilities in the [[Cam Henderson Center]] near the new stadium). MU soccer, which had played there from the program's founding continued to use the field until 1993 when it too moved to Joan C. Edwards Stadium. Today that program has its own [[soccer specific stadium]], the [[Veterans Memorial Soccer Complex]], on the site of the former [[Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse]].

The stadium was also used by the former Huntington High School and Huntington East High School (the merger of those schools, which is the [[Huntington High School (West Virginia)|current Huntington High]], has its own on-campus stadium).

In addition to high school football, Fairfield was also a regular host for Huntington St. Joseph Central Catholic High School soccer matches and sectional and regional soccer matches.  In 1988 Fairfield Stadium served as the host for the inaugural WVSSAC Boys State Soccer Tournament which was won by Huntington St. Joe.  It continued as host in 1989 until the tournament was moved to Laidley Field in Charleston.

The stadium, which held 18,000, was built in 1927, and demolished in early 2004. For the movie ''[[We Are Marshall]]'', [[Herndon Stadium]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] was used as the stand-in for Fairfield Stadium.

The last scoreboard from Fairfield Stadium was salvaged and put in the parking lot of [[Gino's Pizza and Spaghetti|Gino's Pub and Pizzeria]] on Fifth Avenue across the street from the Veterans Memorial Soccer Complex and a few blocks east of Joan C. Edwards Stadium. The scoreboard is lit up at night and shows the score of the Marshall-Xavier game in 1971, which was Marshall's first win after the plane crash.

The [[Marshall University Forensic Science Center]] complex completed in 1997 incorporates the renovated former football locker room of Fairfield that was used until the completion of [[Joan C. Edwards Stadium]] in 1991. A lone locker with a football jersey, football helmet, and a plaque commemorating the 1970 football team can be found on display in the lobby of the DNA Forensic laboratory.  The remainder of the property is now used by the Erma Byrd Clinic, the primary classroom structure for second year students at the [[Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine]].

'''Frost Arena''' is a [[seating capacity|6,500-seat]] multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Brookings, South Dakota]].  It was built in 1973 and is home to the [[South Dakota State University]] [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits|Jackrabbits]] [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball|men's]] and  [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits women's basketball|women's]] basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams, replacing the Gymnasium-Armory, built in 1918 and nicknamed "The Barn."  It was named after former SDSU basketball coach Reuben B. "Jack" Frost.

The [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball|Jackrabbits men's basketball team]] have enjoyed a tremendous home court advantage at home, compiling a record of 426-127 (.770) through the 2011-12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nmnathletics.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529024833/http://nmnathletics.com/ |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}/pdf8/796346.pdf?ATCLID=921547&amp;SPSID=88453&amp;SPID=7143&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15000&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[South Dakota State Jackrabbits women's basketball|Jackrabbits women's basketball team]] also has enjoyed their home court advantage with a 349-92 home record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gojacks.com/downloads1/362394.pdf?ATCLID=3750178&amp;SPSID=64556&amp;SPID=7144&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15000&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally featuring 9,500 seats, the facility, part of the Stanley J. Marshall HPER Center, now seats 6,500 fans for basketball. The arena's attendance record is for the SDSU-Augustana men's game on February 11, 1989, which attracted 9,456 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nmnathletics.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529024833/http://nmnathletics.com/ |archivedate=2015-05-29 |df= }}/pdf8/796346.pdf?ATCLID=921547&amp;SPSID=88453&amp;SPID=7143&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15000&lt;/ref&gt;  Renovations in 1992 and 2004 eliminated some of the bench seating and installed individual seats in parts of the arena.  In 2005, an updated scoreboard, sound system, and a new arena floor were installed.

In addition to SDSU athletic and school events, Frost Arena has hosted the 2003 NCAA North Central Regional women's basketball tournament, six NCAA North Central Regional men's basketball tournaments, four NCAA Division II Wrestling National Championships, women's WNIT Tournament action in 2007 and 2008, along with numerous concerts and state basketball tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gojacks.com/downloads1/362394.pdf?ATCLID=3750178&amp;SPSID=64556&amp;SPID=7144&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nationally televised game from Frost Arena was February 18, 2012, as the Jackrabbits men's basketball team took on the [[Buffalo Bulls]] on [[ESPNU]].

Designs for a remodel of Frost Arena are in progress.  The remodeled arena is proposed to include suites, premium seating, increased concession areas and more restrooms.  Plans have not yet been finalized, and have not yet been approved by the South Dakota Board of Regents.

[[File:Sepp Blatter (2009).jpg|thumb|right|[[Sepp Blatter]], when president of FIFA, football's world governing body, strongly opposed the "game 39" proposal.]]
'''"Game 39"''' or the '''international round''' was a proposed extra round of matches in the [[Premier League]] to be played at neutral venues outside England.  The top [[association football|football]] league in England, the Premier League is currently played on a [[double round robin]] basis, where each team plays the other 19 [[home and away]], giving a total of 38 games.  The international round was proposed at a meeting of the 20 Premier League clubs on 7 February 2008, with a view to being introduced for the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]], when a new television [[Premier League#Media coverage|broadcasting rights contract]] would be in place.  The proposed start date was later put back to [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]].  The proposal was reportedly endorsed by the chairmen of a number of Premier League clubs.

Game 39 resulted in opposition from several club managers.  The proposal also met with strong condemnation from supporters' organisations, who saw it as solely motivated by money to the detriment of fans.  [[Sepp Blatter]], president of the sport's global governing body at that time, expressed a negative opinion of the proposal and stated that it could affect [[English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup]], and the football authorities in a number of the areas suggested as possible venues for the matches were also opposed. In May 2010, the Premier League said that it was no longer actively considering game 39,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier League rules out revival of 39th-game proposal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/09/premier-league-39th-round|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 January 2013|date=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October 2014 it was said to be re-considering the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Owen|title=Premier League to look again at playing competitive matches abroad|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/07/premier-league-38th-game-overseas-fixtures|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==
The [[Premier League]], the top-level [[association football|football]] league in England, contains 20 member clubs, with each playing the others once at home and once away for a total of 38 games per season.&lt;ref name="tel0208"&gt;
{{cite news
|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/02/08/sfnfro108.xml
|title=Premier League to embark on world tour
|first=David |last=Bond |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal envisaged each team playing one further match, a total of ten extra matches, over one weekend in January.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;  Two matches would be played in each of five cities, one each on Saturday and Sunday.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;   Cities would bid for the right to stage matches, but would not be able to specify which teams would be involved.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;  The matches would be held at staggered start times, with venues in different [[timezone]]s, making it possible in theory to watch live television coverage of all ten.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;   There are conflicting reports about whether the draw for the extra fixtures would be [[seed (sports)|seeded]] or not.&lt;ref name="winter12"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/02/12/sfnfro112.xml |title=Richard Scudamore signals his intent for future |first=Henry |last=Winter |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The week prior to the international round would be free of matches, to allow for travel and [[acclimatisation]].&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;  The week after the international round would see each team face one of the teams which had played at the same foreign venue, to avoid any disadvantage for teams with a longer round-trip.&lt;ref name="winter12"/&gt;  Possible venues suggested for international-round matches were Australia, [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]], and [[North America]].&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;  All are wealthy regions where interest in English football is strong relative to the level of the domestic game.  Venues would have warm, predictable weather, unlike England in January.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;

Premier League chief executive [[Richard Scudamore]] initially said there would not be more than one international round per season, stating "I stress that on my watch, there will be no 40th game. The value [of a 39th game] is in its uniqueness, in that festival weekend, so there's no point in diluting it".&lt;ref name="winter"/&gt; Subsequently, he suggested the initial plan would last six to ten years and might be altered.&lt;ref name="winter11"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/02/11/sfnwin111.xml |title=Richard Scudamore reneges on foreign fixtures |first=Henry  |last=Winter |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Foreshadowing the plan were the [[Premier League Asia Trophy]], started in 2003, and the [[NFL International Series]] [[American football]] game played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;  [[Rod Eddington]] pitched the idea of an international round to the Premier League in autumn 2007.&lt;ref name="mailedd"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Eddington was chairman of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n Major Events Company and a friend of [[Rupert Murdoch]], owner of [[Sky Sports]] and other networks with broadcasting rights to the Premier League.&lt;ref name="murdochman"/&gt;  He suggested his home city of [[Melbourne]] as an inaugural host city.&lt;ref name="mailedd"/&gt;  A presentation to the Premier League's audit-and-remuneration committee was made two weeks before the public announcement.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An initial [[business plan]] predicted extra earnings from the international round of between £40 million and £80 million per year.&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt;

The Premier League put in place a working party to negotiate with the various concerned parties.&lt;ref name="winter12"/&gt;  It initially stated that, to proceed with the plan, it needed the support only of [[the Football Association]] (FA) and the football governing bodies of the countries of the host cities.&lt;ref name="winter11"/&gt;  It attempted to secure the support of the FA for the proposal by promising to rearrange club fixtures for better convenience to players called up to the [[England national football team|England team]].&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Scudamore planned to meet officials from the sport's global governing body, the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA), before its executive committee meeting in [[Zurich]] on 14 March 2008.&lt;ref name="winter11"/&gt;  On 27 February, after several weeks of mostly negative reaction, Scudamore agreed with [[Jérôme Valcke]], general secretary of FIFA, that the meeting would be postponed indefinitely.&lt;ref name="guar27feb"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Premier League presented this as an opportunity to rethink its proposals, and said that it would not proceed without FIFA approval.&lt;ref name="guar27feb"/&gt;

In May 2008, Scudamore told [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] that the proposal was "not over", but that the League would "come up with something that ticks more boxes" by January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2008, Scudamore said that the League had "a whole host of ideas, some more radical than others, but none quite as radical as the original concept".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title= Game 39 on hold |last=Bascombe |first=Chris |date=17 August 2008 |work=[[News of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2008, he said Game 39 was still a possibility,&lt;ref name="sbp" /&gt; although the timing of TV contracts meant it would be in the 2013–14 season at the earliest.&lt;ref name="pp2013"&gt;

==Reactions==

===In England===
[[Image:David Gold.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]], then chairman of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], endorsed the idea.]]
Richard Scudamore defended the plan as consolidating the Premier League's global reputation, saying "if we didn't do it, another sport will come and do it to us".&lt;ref name="tel0208"/&gt; Scudamore said that the chairmen of all 20 Premier League clubs supported the proposal, and disputed claims by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that [[Randy Lerner]] of [[Aston Villa]] and [[Dave Whelan]] of [[Wigan Athletic]] were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=514169&amp;in_page_id=1779 |title=Premier League chairmen are fully behind Gam£ 39, insists under-fire Scudamore |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work=[[Daily Mail]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]], chairman of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], endorsed the plan in part because the larger clubs have in any case already been exploiting foreign markets, with pre-season and even mid-season tours; Game 39 would distribute its revenue among all the clubs.&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt;  On 15 February, [[Liverpool F.C.]] chief executive [[Rick Parry]] stated that the proposal had "never been on Liverpool's club agenda" and acknowledged the concern of the club's fans and manager.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Parry: Game 39 not 'On Liverpool's agenda' |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=508155 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Hayward, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the proposal would destroy the balance of the home-and-away round-robin league.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Football Supporters' Federation]] (FSF) condemned the proposal as being motivated by money, and dubbed it '''Gam£39'''.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It launched a [[petition]], with the support of the ''Daily Mail'', to oppose the "outrageous [[desecration]] of the [[National sport|national game]]". In March 2008, the campaign was ended as the FSF declared the proposal "effectively dead".&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/campaigns/news110endofgame39.php |title=End of Game 39 |publisher=[[Football Supporters' Federation]] |accessdate=2008-06-03 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Many die-hard fans who pride themselves on travelling to all their teams' away matches would have been unable to travel abroad for "Game 39".&lt;ref name="winter"/&gt;  On the other hand, exotic foreign venues would potentially be more appealing destinations for fans than a mundane English city.&lt;ref name="winter12"/&gt;  [[Manager (football)|Manager]]s of Premier League clubs reported to be opposed to or sceptical of the plans included [[Steve Bruce]],&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; [[Roy Hodgson]],&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; [[Gareth Southgate]],&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; and [[Rafael Benítez]].&lt;ref name="bbcfa"/&gt;  [[Alex Ferguson]] criticised the club owners for lack of consultation with managers.&lt;ref name="bbcplat"/&gt;  [[Arsène Wenger]],&lt;ref name="bbcfa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcplat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blatter"/&gt; [[Roy Keane]],&lt;ref name="bbcplat"/&gt; [[Kevin Keegan]],&lt;ref name="bbcplat"/&gt; and [[Avram Grant]]&lt;ref name="blatter"/&gt; supported the proposal.  'Game 39' was also defended as a move to head off plans for a World League involving only elite clubs such as those formerly in the [[G-14]] group.&lt;ref name="winter12"/&gt;

[[Andy Burnham]], the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], cautioned that football should "not forget its roots".&lt;ref name="fans"/&gt; [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]] of the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] expressed concern about increased pressure on players.&lt;ref name="bbcplat"/&gt;  The FA on 15 February expressed "serious reservations" that the proposal might damage [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="bbcfa"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  An FA board meeting on 21 February concluded that the plan was "unsustainable in its current format".&lt;ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since 2013, Relevent Sports has run the [[International Champions Cup]], a series of summer matches between teams from the Premier League and other top European sides, held in overseas markets including Asia and North America.

'''Gill Coliseum''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located on the campus of [[Oregon State University]] (OSU) in [[Corvallis, Oregon]]. Opened {{Years or months ago|1949}} in 1949, the arena has a [[seating capacity]] of 9,604 and is home to the [[Oregon State Beavers]]' basketball, [[Collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], volleyball, and gymnastics teams.&lt;ref name=OSUGN/&gt; It is named after basketball coach [[Slats Gill|Amory T. "Slats" Gill]], who compiled a 599–392 ({{winning percentage|599|392}}) record in 36 seasons—from 1928 to 1964.

The court is named after another OSU coach, [[Ralph Miller]], who led the men's basketball program from 1971 to 1989. The building also houses a [[weight room]], equipment center, [[locker room]]s, and offices for the Oregon State University athletic department and its teams. Inside, on the south wall of Gill Coliseum is a painted [[mural]] of many former Oregon State men's basketball players including [[Gary Payton]], [[Brent Barry]], [[AC Green]], [[Lester Conner]], and [[Steve Johnson (basketball)|Steve Johnson]].

==History==
Prior to the construction of Gill Coliseum, intercollegiate basketball games were hosted in the [[Oregon Agricultural College Gymnasium]],&lt;ref name=old&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 2010|title=Legendary Hoop Star Red Rocha, Tower of the ‘Thrill Kids,’ Dies|journal=Oregon Stater|publisher=OSU Alumni Association|volume=95|issue=2|page=32|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/file_lib/1/28/201004_sports_634055524876424940.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4677959/oregon_agricultural_colleges_new_gym/ OAC's New Gym, Scene of Commencement Activities,"] ''Corvallis Gazette-Times,'' vol. 6, no. 28 (June 4, 1914), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This building continues to stand as the current [[Langton Hall (Oregon State University)|Langton Hall]].&lt;ref name=old/&gt;

Gill Coliseum opened in 1949 and housed the '''Horner Museum''' in the basement until the museum's colsure in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Stuart|title=Presidential tokens stolen from Oregon State University museum returned 50 years later|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/08/presidential_tokens_stolen_fro.html|accessdate=27 August 2014|work=The Oregonian|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility has a [[sports medicine]] center, located on the lower level of the coliseum, that provides injury prevention and rehabilitation services. The center includes cardiovascular equipment and improved training facilities. Part of a $7 million renovation of the arena in 2009 included making Gill compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref name="stater2009"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Fall 2009|title=Barrels of paint for Gill; big plans for the area|journal=Oregon Stater|volume=94|issue=3|pages=48|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/file_lib/1/25/spring09Stater_WEB_4451_633875952129294886.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation also included sandblasting the exterior and applying new paint. New windows were installed on the east and west sides of the coliseum.&lt;ref name="stater2009"/&gt; The court has gone numerous remodels as Oregon State has updated their [[sports marketing|branding]]. Prior to the 2013–14 season, the court was updated to reflect the athletic department's re-branding along with some graphics surrounding the lower seating.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Construction of the '''Sports Performance Center''' ('''SPC''') began in early 2007, and work was completed in spring 2008. The building is located between Gill Coliseum and the [[Tommy Prothro]] Football 
Complex. The SPC houses a practice facility for wrestling and offices for the weight training staff.  The {{Convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building is the home to over $500,000 in training equipment and a 4-lane {{Convert|60|yd|m|adj=on}} sprint track. The four-story facility includes two full-size regulation courts and basketball offices which opened in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oregon State Celebrates Opening of Basketball Practice Facility|first=Lindsay|last=Schnell|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/beavers/index.ssf/2013/06/oregon_state_celebrates_openin.html#incart_m-rpt-2|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, OR|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Length (cricket).svg|thumb|right|325px|A good length ball pitches in the bright green area of the pitch]]
A '''good length ball''' is a type of [[Delivery (cricket)|delivery]] in [[cricket]] that pitches at a distance from the [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] that makes it difficult to score [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. Furthermore, such a delivery is difficult for the batsman to judge whether to play on the [[Back foot contact|back-foot]] or on the [[Front foot contact|front-foot]]. However, the distance from the batsman which is the ideal good length varies depending on how high and fast the ball bounces on a particular pitch. The pace of the bowler is also a factor, as faster bowlers will aim to pitch the ball further away from the batsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/skills/4177344.stm| title = Bowling line and length | publisher = BBC| accessdate = 3 May 2011| date=6 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ibn-e-Qasim Bagh Stadium''', originally known as the '''Old Fort Stadium''', is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Multan]], [[Pakistan]].  It is currently used mostly for [[cricket]] and [[football (soccer)|football]]. It hosted one [[Test cricket|Test Match]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ibn-e-Qasim Bagh Stadium |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/ground/58982.html |work=ESPN Cricinfo |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium holds 18,000 and opened in 1975.

==Etymology==
The stadium is named in honor of [[Imād ad-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Qāsim ath-Thaqafī]] (Arabic: عماد الدين محمد بن القاسم الثقفي; c. 31 December 695 – 18 July 715[citation needed]), an Umayyad general who conquered Sindh and Multan regions along the Indus River (now a part of Pakistan) for the Umayyad Caliphate in eighth century.

==2014 Stampede==
On October 10, 2014, at least seven people died and 40 were injured as a result of a [[2014 Multan stampede|stampede]] at stadium after the speech of cricketer-turned-politician [[Imran Khan]]. The Opposition leader alleged that only two gates of the venue were opened at the end of the rally and the lights were also switched off, but this was later denied by the DCO and local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/773657/pti-multan-administration-trade-blame-after-8-people-killed-in-qasim-bagh-stampede/|title=PTI, Multan administration trade blame after 8 people killed in Qasim Bagh stampede|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Swimming World''''' '''Swimmers of the Year''' is awarded by the American-based ''[[Swimming World]]''. There are seven categories: World Swimmer, American Swimmer, European Swimmer, Pacific Rim Swimmer, World Disabled Swimmer, African Swimmer, and Open Water Swimmer of year. An award for male and female is made for each category.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swimmers of the Year|url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/SwimmersOfTheYear.asp|work=[[Swimming World]]|accessdate=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was inaugurated in 1964, when ''Swimming World'' named [[Don Schollander]] as its World Swimmer of the Year. Two years later, a female category was added, and the awards continued in this format until 1980. The winners were mostly American until the rise of East Germany's women in the 1970s, and 1980 saw the creation of subcategories for American and European swimmers. Following the end of the [[Cold War]], Germany declined following the end of the East's systematic state-sponsored doping program, while Australia's swimming team enjoyed a revival. In December 2013, Swimming World announced a decision to strip the drug-fueled East Germans of all World and European Swimmers of the Year awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsteller|first=Jason|title=Stripped! Swimming World Vacates Awards of GDR Drug-fueled Swimmers|url=https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/stripped-swimming-world-vacates-awards-of-gdr-drug-fueled-swimmers/|work=Swimming World |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Australian swimmers won both awards for World Swimmer of the Year for the first time, and in 1995, a subcategory was inaugurated for [[Asia Pacific|Pacific Rim]] swimmers. A subcategory for disabled swimmers was introduced in 2003, and in the following year, an African award was launched after South Africa became the first country from the continent to win an Olympic relay. In 2005, open water swimming was added to the Olympic program and another category was duly added.

American swimmers have been the most successful in winning awards, with 52 titles, more than three times that of Australia (13). [[Michael Phelps]] of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by [[Katie Ledecky]] of the United States and [[Ian Thorpe]] of Australia with four. Regionally, German, Hungarian and Dutch swimmers have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than three-quarters of the Pacific awards.

The award was inaugurated in 1964, when ''Swimming World'' named [[Don Schollander]] as its World Swimmer of the Year. Two years later, a female category was added. The winners were always American until 1970, and the it was not until 1979 that a non-American male won the award. However, from 1973 until 1989, the rise of East Germany's women saw them win a majority of the awards.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; Following the end of the [[Cold War]], Germany declined following the end of the East's [[Doping in East Germany|systematic state-sponsored doping program]],&lt;ref name=oly1/&gt;&lt;ref name=oly2/&gt; while Australia's swimming team enjoyed a revival in the late 1990s, winning nine awards since 1997, the most by any country in that period.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; However, ''Swimming World'' has since stripped the East Germans of their titles.

United States swimmers have won the title 51 times, followed by Australia (13 times) and East Germany (11 times).&lt;ref name=list/&gt; This ratio is approximately proportional to the amount of gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.&lt;ref name=oly1&gt;{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Swimming's big splash |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/swimming/history/3477381.stm |publisher = BBC Sports |date = 5 July 2004 |accessdate = 8 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oly2&gt;{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Phelps causes biggest splash |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/swimming/3587554.stm |publisher = BBC Sports |date = 21 August 2004 |accessdate = 19 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his win in 2016, [[Michael Phelps]] (USA) now holds the overall record with eight titles. He won in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2016. [[Katie Ledecky]] (USA) is the second most-prolific winner, winning in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. Phelps and Ledecky are the only swimmers to win the award four straight times. [[Ian Thorpe]] (AUS) was honored four times, in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;

Ledecky is the only female swimmer to win the award more than three times. &lt;ref name=list/&gt; Four female swimmers have won three awards: [[Debbie Meyer]] (USA) in 1967, 1968 and 1969, [[Krisztina Egerszegi]] (HUN) in 1991, 1992 and 1995, [[Janet Evans]] (USA) in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and [[Kristin Otto]] (GDR) in 1984, 1986 and 1988. [[Franziska van Almsick]] is the youngest female to have won the award, having turned 15 on 5 April  in the year of her first award. Thorpe is the youngest male recipient, having turned 16 on 13 October in the year of his first award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.&lt;ref name=oly1/&gt;&lt;ref name=oly2/&gt; Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with [[Kristin Otto]] winning three times, before the [[Berlin Wall]] and communism fell. With the end of the state-sponsored doping program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;&lt;ref name=oly1/&gt;&lt;ref name=oly2/&gt; In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by [[Franziska van Almsick]].&lt;ref name=list/&gt; During the 1980s, [[Michael Gross (swimmer)|Michael Gross]] of West Germany, nicknamed ''The Albatross'' in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; ''Swimming World'' has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;

Hungary has won the award 17 times, mainly on the back of its strength in [[medley swimming]]. Breaststrokers [[Ágnes Kovács]] and [[Károly Güttler]], and backstroker [[Sándor Wladár]] were the only Hungarian winners who were not champion medley swimmers. [[Krisztina Egerszegi]] won four awards, the most by a female swimmer, while [[Tamás Darnyi]] claimed three.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;
The Netherlands have won seven awards, through the efforts of [[Inge de Bruijn]] (3) and [[Pieter van den Hoogenband]] (4), who led the sprinting world for women and men at the turn of the century. Russian or Soviet swimmers have won seven awards, all of them male.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;

==Pacific Rim Swimmers of the Year==
[[File:Ian Thorpe with a smile.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Thorpe]], who has been the male World swimmer of the year four times &amp; Pacific Rim Swimmer of the Year on six occasions|alt=Ian Thorpe]]
[[File:Kitajima.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kosuke Kitajima]] has been the Pacific Rim Swimmer of the Year four times.|alt=Kosuke Kitajima]]

The ''Pacific Rim'' award was introduced in 1995, the year after two Australian swimmers—[[Kieren Perkins]] and [[Samantha Riley]]—became the first two Pacific Rim swimmers to be named as ''World Swimmer of the Year''. It has subsequently been dominated by Australian swimmers, who have won 24 of the 32 awards given. [[Ian Thorpe]] won six awards (five consecutively) and [[Susie O'Neill]] has won four (three consecutively). Australia’s success has been built on female butterfliers (O’Neill and [[Petria Thomas]]), female breaststrokers (Riley and [[Leisel Jones]]), and male freestylers (Thorpe, [[Grant Hackett]] and [[Michael Klim]]). The men's awards have been dominated by Asian swimmers since 2006. [[Kosuke Kitajima]] (Japan) was the first non-Australian swimmer to win the award more than once (in 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2010).&lt;ref name="r"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rice on top of world again|first=Nicole|last=Jeffery|date=27 November 2008|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24712268-2722,00.html|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=26 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202105402/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24712268-2722,00.html|archive-date=2 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; He was followed by [[Sun Yang]] of China who won three awards (in 2011, 2012, and 2013).

==African Swimmers of the Year==
[[File:Oussama Mellouli 1.jpg|thumb|right|Oussama Mellouli in action. He was the first African male to win an individual Olympic gold medal.|alt=Oussama Mellouli doing the breaststroke]]
The ''African'' award was introduced in 2004,&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; the year in which [[South Africa at the 2004 Summer Olympics|South Africa]] won the men's 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay at the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. Although [[Joan Harrison (swimmer)|Joan Harrison]] ([[Swimming at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]) and [[Penny Heyns]] ([[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]) had won individual gold medals for South Africa, the 2004 victory was the first time that an African relay team won a medal, indicating their increasing depth. In the same Olympics, [[Zimbabwe at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Zimbabwe]]'s [[Kirsty Coventry]]'s won three medals, including one gold, making her the first African swimmer outside of South Africa to stand on the podium.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;&lt;ref name=search&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic medal winners|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=26 March 2009}} &lt;br/&gt;''Results classification: "By individual" → Competition gender: Select all → Medal: Select all → Continents and nations: "Africa" → Sports and events: "Swimming" → Search ↵''&lt;/ref&gt; Coventry has won the female award nine times. South African [[Chad le Clos]] won five men's awards in a row, and South African sprinter [[Roland Schoeman]] four,&lt;ref name=list/&gt; and in total South African swimmers have claimed twelve awards. In 2008, [[Ous Mellouli]] of Tunisia broke the South African and Zimbabwean duopoly after becoming the first African male to win an individual Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref name=list/&gt;&lt;ref name=search/&gt;

The '''Mussabini Medal''' was a sports award recognising the [[coach (sport)|coaches]] of [[United Kingdom|British]] sports people and teams, named after [[Sam Mussabini]].&lt;ref name=Ind10Dec2000/&gt; Mussabini, who died in 1927, is considered to be the first professional (paid) coach in sport, breaking the occupation's amateur (voluntary) [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] roots. Introduced in 1998, it was awarded annually as part of the UK Coaching Awards organised by sports coach UK (the National Coaching Foundation) until 2007, when the 2008 awards categories onwards were renamed and expanded as part of the launch of the UK Coaching Framework.&lt;ref name=2008Awards&gt;{{cite web

The Mussabini Medal celebrated "the contribution of coaches of UK performers who have achieved outstanding success on the world stage."&lt;ref name=UKSport27Sep2001/&gt; Along with the Mussabini Medal, there also existed '''The Dyson Award''', for "individuals who have made a sustained and significant contribution to the development and management of coaching and individual coaches in the UK".&lt;ref name=UKSport27Sep2001/&gt; This award was named after [[Geoff Dyson]], the first chief national athletics coach, who died in 1981.&lt;ref name=Ind10Dec2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=EnglandAthletics2008/&gt;

The Mussabini Medal was introduced in conjunction with the launch of the Coaching Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=Ind13Dec1998/&gt; The medal and associated awards were launched to raise the profile of coaches, and increase the financial backing to enhance the profession, still seen at the time as a largely amateur vocation in spite of Mussabini's pioneering example.&lt;ref name=Ind13Dec1998/&gt; Speaking at the inaugural presentation the patron of the Foundation the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] stated that "Coaching and the work of individual coaches lies at the heart of sport, Yet all too often the role and contribution of the coach remains unrecognised and unacknowledged".&lt;ref name=Ind13Dec1998/&gt;

The Mussabini Medal was awarded to solely British coaches in the first two years, with 2000 being the first time foreign coaches of British athletes were recognised.&lt;ref name=Ind10Dec2000/&gt;

The '''Team classification in the Giro d'Italia''', also known as the '''Trofeo Fast Team''', is a prize that is contested in the [[Giro d'Italia]]. It has been awarded since the race's inception. In more recent editions the classification is calculated by adding up the top three riders' times from each team, and then the team with the lowest total time is the leader of the classification. In case of a tie, the teams are separated by the sum of the places obtained by their three best riders at the finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=/features/2008/giro_classifications08 |title=www.cyclingnews.com presents the 91st Giro d'Italia |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the first team received a bonus of €500, the second a premium of 300 euros and last a premium of 100 euros. A total of 18,900 euros has been awarded for this award during the race (21 steps).
