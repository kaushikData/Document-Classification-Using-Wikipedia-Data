'''A cappella''' ({{IPA-it|a kkapˈpɛlla|pron}}; Italian for "in the manner of the chapel")&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; music is specifically group or solo singing without [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[accompaniment]], or a piece intended to be performed in this way. It contrasts with [[cantata]], which is usually accompanied singing. The term "a cappella" was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt; The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for [[alla breve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious origins==
A cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Christian music were originally a cappella,{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used. [By definition, Christianity began with the New Testament.]|date=November 2013}} and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.

===Christian===
The [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by [[Josquin des Prez]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument&lt;!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--&gt; would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ "doubling" some or all of the voices.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.

Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Schütz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Byzantine Rite====
In the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, "The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found."&lt;ref name=Ware&gt;{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''a cappella'' behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorovïye kontsertï'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.

====Opposition to instruments in worship====
Present-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Doukhobor]]s the [[Byzantine Rite]] and the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.

Opponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%2013:15;%20James%205:13;&amp;version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.&lt;ref name=kurfees&gt;{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.&lt;ref name=McKinnon&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bales&gt;{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group="nb"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in "Christianity". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (ca 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.

The first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.&lt;ref&gt;American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Instruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546),&lt;ref name=M&amp;S&gt;{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1894|p=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564)&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791).&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1844|p=684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as "a cow bell in a concert".&lt;ref name=ferg&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|2004|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', the heroine, [[Jeanie Deans]], a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):
:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acceptance of instruments in worship====
Those who do not adhere to the [[regulative principle]] of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.

Those who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (AD 33 to 180).&lt;ref name=McKinnon2&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.&lt;ref name=McKinnon3&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.
*Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard playing religious music. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.&lt;ref name=McKinnon3/&gt; Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is believed that "the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=52, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern opponents of instruments typically do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,{{refn|group="nb"|Rather than calling the use of instruments "evil", modern opposition typically uses terms like "unspiritual"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an Old Testament "shadow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|Lewis|West|1984|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} who argued that God had allowed David the "evil" of using musical instruments in praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Old Testament teaches that God specifically asked for musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern concern is for worship based on the New Testament.

Since "a cappella" singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Zwingli was destroying organs in Switzerland&amp;nbsp;– Luther called him a fanatic&amp;nbsp;– the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Holiness Churches]] such as the [[Free Methodist Church]] opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955.

===Jewish===
While worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25–29:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.&lt;ref name="Shircago"&gt;{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that "silent singing" (without even vocal chords) was better still.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}). The [[shofar]] is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1967|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only used from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Elul]] through the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The shofar is used by itself, without any vocal accompaniment, and is limited to a very strictly defined set of sounds and specific places in the synagogue service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alleman|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, silver [[trumpet]]s, as described in {{bibleverse|Numbers|10:1-10}}, have been made in recent years and used in prayer services at the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/silver-trumpets-pierce-the-heavens-in-prayer-rally-opposite-temple-mount/2016/03/23/ |title=Silver Trumpets Pierce the Heavens in Prayer Rally Opposite Temple Mount |date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=December 2, 2017 |website=JewishPress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:The Hullabahoos.jpg|thumb|The Hullabahoos, an ''a cappella'' group at the [[University of Virginia]], were featured in the movie ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'']]
Peter Christian Lutkin, dean of the [[Bienen School of Music|Northwestern University School of Music]], helped popularize a cappella music in the United States by founding the Northwestern A Cappella Choir in 1906. The A Cappella Choir was "the first permanent organization of its kind in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wittman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Camp|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''a cappella'' tradition was begun  in 1911 by [[F. Melius Christiansen]], a music faculty member at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name='Norwegian Americans'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Norwegian Americans |encyclopedia=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life |edition=3rd |pages=477–481 |volume=2 |section=Americas |location=Farmington Hills, Michigan |publisher=Gale |year=2017 |via=[[Minneapolis Community &amp; Technical College]] Library |access-date=September 24, 2018 |url=http://link.galegroup.com.mctproxy.mnpals.net/apps/doc/CX3648200207/GVRL?u{{=}}mnaminncom&amp;amp;sid{{=}}GVRL&amp;amp;xid{{=}}cecfcc81 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Olaf Choir|St. Olaf College Choir]] was established as an outgrowth of the local [[St. John's Lutheran Church (Northfield, Minnesota)|St. John's Lutheran Church]], where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed, at least partially, of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus. The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] (Moorhead, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] (Rock Island, Illinois), [[Wartburg College]] (Waverly, Iowa), [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] (Decorah, Iowa), [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] (St. Peter, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and [[Augsburg University]] (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend, intonation, phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Movements in modern a cappella over the past century include [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] and [[doo wop]]. The [[Barbershop Harmony Society]], [[Sweet Adelines International]], and Harmony Inc. host educational events including Harmony University, Directors University, and the International Educational Symposium, and international contests and conventions, recognizing international champion [[List of chorus champions by year|choruses]] and [[List of quartet champions by year|quartets]].

Many a cappella groups can be found in high schools and colleges. There are amateur Barbershop Harmony Society and professional groups that sing a cappella exclusively. Although a cappella is technically defined as singing without instrumental accompaniment, some groups use their voices to emulate instruments; others are more traditional and focus on harmonizing. A cappella styles range from gospel music to contemporary to barbershop quartets and choruses.

The [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]] (CASA) is a membership option for former students, whose funds support hosted competitions and events.

A cappella music was popularized between the late 2000s and the early to mid-2010s with media hits such as the 2009–2014 TV show ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' and the musical comedy film series ''[[Pitch Perfect]]''.

===Recording artists===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
In [[Number-one hits of 1943 (United States)|July 1943]], as a result of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group ''The Song Spinners'' had a best-seller with "Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer". In the 1950s, several recording groups, notably [[The Hi-Los]] and the [[Four Freshmen]], introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The [[King's Singers]] are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s. Frank Zappa loves Doo wop and A cappella, so Zappa released [[The Persuasions]]' first album from his label in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trunkworthy.com/the-persuasions-frank-zappas-pitch-perfect-gift-to-a-cappella-harmony/ |publisher=Trunkworthy |access-date=December 2, 2017 |title=The Persuasions: Frank Zappa's Pitch Perfect Gift To A Cappella Harmony }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, an a cappella group known as [[The Flying Pickets]] had a Christmas 'number one' in the UK with a cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s (known in the US as [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]]) "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]". A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[All-4-One]], [[The Nylons]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[*NSYNC]].{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Contemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add [[vocal percussion]] or [[beatboxing]] to create a pop/rock/gospel sound, in some cases very similar to bands with instruments. Examples of such professional groups include [[Straight No Chaser (group)|Straight No Chaser]], [[Pentatonix]], [[The House Jacks]], [[Rockapella]], [[Mosaic (vocal band)|Mosaic]], [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] and [[M-pact]]. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are [[Take 6]], [[Glad (band)|Glad]] and [[Acappella (group)|Acappella]]. Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] accompaniment.

A cappella can also describe the isolated vocal track(s) from a [[multitrack recording]] that originally included instrumentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These vocal tracks may be [[remix]]ed or put onto vinyl records for DJs, or released to the public so that fans can remix them. One such example is the a cappella release of [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|Black Album]]'', which [[Danger Mouse (artist)|Danger Mouse]] mixed with [[The Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' to create ''[[The Grey Album]]''.

On their 1966 album titled ''Album'', Peter, Paul and Mary included the song "Norman Normal." All the sounds on that song, both vocals and instruments, were created by Paul's voice, with no actual instruments used.&lt;ref&gt;Stookey, Paul. Liner Notes. ''The Peter, Paul, and Mary Album''. Warner Bros Record, 1966. Vinyl.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an artist by the name [[Smooth McGroove]] rose to prominence with his style of a cappella music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futter|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his a cappella covers of [[video game]] music tracks on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilliard|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, an a cappella version of Jerusalem by multi-instrumentalist [[Jacob Collier]] was selected for [[Beats Electronics|Beats by Dre]] "The Game Starts Here"  for the [[England at the Rugby World Cup|England Rugby World Cup]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/england-rugby-captain-stars-beats-dre-campaign/1364614|title=England rugby captain stars in Beats By Dre campaign|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-gOvn67d_8|title=Jerusalem – Jacob Collier (Soundtrack for Beats by Dre: "The Game Starts Here")|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
A cappella has been used as the sole orchestration for original works of [[musical theatre]] that have had commercial runs [[Off-Broadway]] (theatres in New York City with 99 to 500 seats) only four times. The first was Avenue X which opened on 28 January 1994 and ran for 77 performances. It was produced by [[Playwrights Horizons]] with book by John Jiler, music and lyrics by Ray Leslee. The musical style of the show's score was primarily [[Doo-Wop]] as the plot revolved around Doo-Wop group singers of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[The Kinsey Sicks]], produced and starred in the critically acclaimed [[off-Broadway]] hit, "DRAGAPELLA! Starring the Kinsey Sicks" at New York's legendary [[Studio 54]]. That production received a nomination for a [[Lucille Lortel]] award as Best Musical and a Drama Desk nomination for Best Lyrics. It was directed by Glenn Casale with original music and lyrics by Ben Schatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The a cappella musical [[Perfect Harmony (musical)|Perfect Harmony]], a comedy about two high school a cappella groups vying to win the National championship, made its Off Broadway debut at Theatre Row's Acorn Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City in October, 2010 after a successful out-of-town run at the Stoneham Theatre, in Stoneham, Massachusetts. Perfect Harmony features the hit music of The Jackson 5, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Marvin Gaye, Scandal, Tiffany, The Romantics, The Pretenders, The Temptations, The Contours, The Commodores, Tommy James &amp; the Shondells and The Partridge Family, and has been compared to a cross between [[Altar Boyz]] and [[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkle|Bacalzo|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth a cappella musical to appear Off-Broadway, In Transit, premiered 5 October 2010 and was produced by [[Primary Stages]] with book, music, and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth. Set primarily in the New York City subway system its score features an eclectic mix of musical genres (including jazz, hip hop, Latin, rock, and country). In Transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character. Beat boxer and actor [[Chesney Snow]] performed this role for the 2010 Primary Stages production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the show's website, it is scheduled to reopen for an open-ended commercial run in the Fall of 2011. In 2011, the production received four Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Musical, Outer Critics Circle and Drama League nominations, as well as five Drama Desk nominations including Outstanding Musical and won for Outstanding Ensemble Performance.

In December 2016, In Transit became the first a cappella musical on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/in-transit-new-a-cappella-musical-opens-on-broadway |magazine=[[Playbill]] |date=December 11, 2016 |access-date=December 2, 2017 |first=Andrew |last=Gans |title=In Transit, New A Cappella Musical, Opens on Broadway |quote=In Transit, Broadway's first a cappella musical, officially opens December 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbershop style===
{{main|Barbershop music}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[Barbershop music]] is one of several uniquely American art forms. The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest documented quartets all began in [[barber]] shops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] (BHS). Today the BHS has about 22,000 members in approximately 800 chapters across the United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lakegeorgeexaminer.com/barbershop-harmony-society-keep-whole-world-singing-lake-george/ |newspaper=The Lake George Examiner |date=April 19, 2017 |access-date=December 2, 2017 |title=Barbershop Harmony Society to 'keep the whole world singing' in Lake George |first=Gillian |last=Burdett |quote=the Society has 22,000 members }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnecd.com/blog/36/finding-harmony-in-nashville |publisher=Tennessee Department of Economic &amp; Community Development |date=July 13, 2015 |access-date=December 2, 2017 |website=tnecd.com |quote=800 chapters across the U.S. and Canada |title=Finding Harmony in Nashville }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the barbershop style has spread around the world with organizations in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbershop.org/about-us/affiliates/ |title=Barbershop is universal; here are the contacts for our official affiliates |access-date=December 2, 2017 |publisher=Barbershop Harmony Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barbershop Harmony Society provides a highly organized competition structure for a cappella quartets and choruses singing in the barbershop style.

In 1945, the first formal women's barbershop organization, Sweet Adelines, was formed. In 1953, Sweet Adelines became an international organization, although it didn't change its name to [[Sweet Adelines International]] until 1991. The membership of nearly 25,000 women, all singing in English, includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses.

In 1959, a second women's barbershop organization started as a break off from Sweet Adelines due to ideological differences. Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.

===Amateur and high school===
The popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as ''Glee'' and ''Pitch Perfect''. High school groups have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group.

==In other countries==

===Pakistan===
The musical show ''Strepsils Stereo'' is credited for introducing the art of a cappella in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1178175|title=Strepsils Stereo brings A Capella to Pakistan for the first time|work=Dawn|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
Composer [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] became the first [[Sri Lanka]]n to write a cappella pieces for [[SATB]] choirs. He wrote "The Princes of the Lost Tribe" and "Ancient Queen of Somawathee" for Menaka De Shabandu and Bridget Halpe's choirs, respectively, based on historical incidents in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chanmugam|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perera|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice Print is also a professional a cappella music group in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.music.lk/showcase.php?search_keyword=voice+print&amp;button=Search|title=Searching for Songs and Music Videos - voice print|last=|first=|date=2016-10-04|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004185445/http://www.music.lk/showcase.php?search_keyword=voice+print&amp;button=Search|archive-date=2016-10-04|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
The European a cappella tradition is especially strong in the countries around the Baltic and perhaps most so in Sweden as described by [[Richard Sparks]] in his doctoral thesis ''The Swedish Choral Miracle'' in 2000.&lt;ref name="SCM"&gt;{{harvnb|Sparks|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish a cappella choirs have over the last 25 years won around 25% of the annual prestigious [[European Grand Prix for Choral Singing|European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (EGP)]] that despite its name is open to choirs from all over the world (see list of laureates in the Wikipedia article on the EGP competition).

The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition, an unsusually large proportion of the populations (5% is often cited) regularly sing in choirs, the Swedish choral director [[Eric Ericson]] had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world, and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools (''music schools'') with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day, a system that started with [[Adolf Fredrik's Music School]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1939 but has spread over the country.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Oxfordalternotives.jpg|thumb|[[The Oxford Alternotives]], the oldest a cappella group at the University of Oxford in the UK]]

[[File:University of Exeter's Sweet Nothings.jpg|thumb|The Sweet Nothings are one of the University of Exeter's eight a cappella groups. They are one of the oldest and most successful girl groups in the UK]]
A cappella has gained attention in the UK in recent years, with many groups forming at British universities by students seeking an alternative singing pursuit to traditional choral and chapel singing. This movement has been bolstered by organisations such as [[The Voice Festival UK]].

==Collegiate==
{{main|Collegiate a cappella|List of collegiate a cappella groups|List of collegiate a cappella groups in the UK}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://issuu.com/tcdigitalrepository/docs/2014spring |magazine=Trinity Reporter |date=Spring 2014 |page=18 |access-date=December 21, 2017 |title=Perfect Harmony |via=issu.com |quote=founded in the 19th century |first=Jim H. |last=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=RPI glee club founding year not specified}} However the longest continuously-singing group is probably [[The Whiffenpoofs]] of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formed in 1909 and once included [[Cole Porter]] as a member.&lt;ref name=Yale /&gt; Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s [[The Colgate Thirteen|The Colgate 13]] (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946), [[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[University of Maine]] Maine Steiners (1958), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of [[Brown University]] (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).

All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/"[[beatboxing]]". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]]. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. [[Mira Sorvino]] is an alumna of [[the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones]] of [[Harvard College]], where she had the solo on [[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]] by [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]].

A cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was [[Penn Masala]], founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the [[University of Maryland]], formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the "Anahat" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts "Sa Re Ga Ma Pella", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.

Jewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.

Each year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&amp;nbsp;– which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&amp;nbsp;– and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, "BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488–502|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=February 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emulating instruments==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
In addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, "[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.

The [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s "[[Don't Stop Believin']]", [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[God Only Knows]]" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]".

Christian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song "Plead the Fifth" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''. The group recorded lead singer [[Matt Thiessen]] making drum noises and played them with an electronic drum machine to record the song.

An '''academy''' ([[Attic Greek]]: Ἀκαδήμεια; [[Koine Greek]] Ἀκαδημία) is an institution of [[secondary education]], [[higher education|higher learning]], research, or honorary membership.
The term '''academia''' refers to the worldwide human group composed of professors and researchers at institutes of higher learning.

The name traces back to [[Plato]]'s school of [[philosophy]], founded approximately 385 BC at [[Akademia]], a [[sanctuary]] of [[Athena]], the goddess of [[wisdom]] and [[Skills|skill]], north of [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[Greece]].

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the ''Academy'' in [[ancient Greece]], which derives from the [[Athenian]] [[hero]], ''[[Akademos]]''. Outside the city walls of [[Athens]], the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] was made famous by [[Plato]] as a center of learning. The sacred space, dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, [[Athena]], had formerly been an [[olive]] [[Grove (nature)|grove]], hence the expression "the groves of Academe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|academe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these gardens, the philosopher [[Plato]] conversed with followers. Plato developed his sessions into a method of teaching philosophy and in 387 BC, established what is known today as the [[Old Academy]].

By extension ''academia'' has come to mean the cultural accumulation of [[knowledge]], its development and transmission across generations and its practitioners and transmitters. In the 17th century, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[France|French]] scholars used the term to describe types of institutions of higher learning.

==Origins==
===The original Academy===
[[File:Raffael 058.jpg|thumb|''[[The School of Athens]]'', fresco by [[Raphael]] (1509–1510), of an idealized academy]]
{{main article|Platonic Academy}}
Before ''Akademia'' was a school, and even before [[Cimon]] enclosed its precincts with a wall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] ''Life of Cimon'' 13.8&lt;/ref&gt; it contained a sacred grove of olive trees dedicated to [[Athena]], the goddess of [[wisdom]], outside the city walls of ancient [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] ii:34&lt;/ref&gt; The archaic name for the site was ''Hekademia'', which by classical times evolved into ''Akademia'' and was explained, at least as early as the beginning of the 6th century BC, by linking it to an Athenian [[Greek hero cult|hero]], a legendary "[[Akademos]]". The site of ''Akademia'' was sacred to [[Athena]] and other immortals.

Plato's immediate successors as "scholarch" of ''Akademia'' were [[Speusippus]] (347–339 BC), [[Xenocrates]] (339–314 BC), [[Polemon (scholarch)|Polemon]] (314–269 BC), [[Crates of Athens|Crates]] (ca. 269–266 BC), and [[Arcesilaus]] (ca. 266–240 BC). Later scholarchs include [[Lacydes of Cyrene]], [[Carneades]], [[Clitomachus (philosopher)|Clitomachus]], and [[Philo of Larissa]] ("the last undisputed head of the Academy").&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd ed. (1996), s.v. "Philon of Larissa."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the table in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521250285 The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy] (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable members of ''Akademia'' include [[Aristotle]], [[Heraclides Ponticus]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], [[Philip of Opus]], [[Crantor]], and [[Antiochus of Ascalon]].

===The Neoplatonic Academy of Late Antiquity===
{{further|End of Hellenic Religion}}

After a lapse during the early Roman occupation, ''Akademia'' was refounded&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, "The last days of the Academy at Athens," in ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society'' vol 195 (n.s. 15), 1969, pp 7–29.&lt;/ref&gt; as a new institution of some outstanding Platonists of late antiquity who called themselves "successors" (''[[diadochus (disambiguation)|diadochoi]]'', but of Plato) and presented themselves as an  uninterrupted tradition reaching back to Plato.  However, there cannot have actually been any geographical, institutional, economic or [[personal continuity]] with the original Academy in the new organizational entity.&lt;ref name="bechtle"&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-04-19.html Gerald Bechtle, Bryn Mawr Classical Review of Rainer Thiel, ''Simplikios und das Ende der neuplatonischen Schule in Athen''. Stuttgart, 1999] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20050313013529/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-04-19.html |date=2005-03-13 }} (in English).&lt;/ref&gt;

The last "Greek" philosophers of the revived ''Akademia'' in the 6th century were drawn from various parts of the [[Hellenistic]] cultural world and suggest the broad [[syncretism]] of the common culture (see ''[[koine]]''): Five of the seven ''Akademia'' philosophers mentioned by Agathias were [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] in their cultural origin: Hermias and Diogenes (both from Phoenicia), Isidorus of Gaza, [[Damascius]] of Syria, [[Iamblichus]] of Coele-Syria and perhaps even [[Simplicius of Cilicia]].&lt;ref name="bechtle"/&gt;

The [[Byzantine Empire|emperor]] [[Justinian I|Justinian]] closed the school in AD 529, a date that is often cited as the end of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. According to the sole witness, the historian [[Agathias]], its remaining members looked for protection under the rule of [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] king [[Khosrau I of Persia|Khosrau I]] in his capital at [[Ctesiphon]], carrying with them precious scrolls of literature and philosophy, and to a lesser degree of science. After a peace treaty between the Persian and the Byzantine empire in 532 guaranteed their personal security (an early document in the history of [[freedom of religion]]), some members found sanctuary in the [[paganism|pagan]] stronghold of [[Harran]], near [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. One of the last leading figures of this group was Simplicius, a pupil of Damascius, the last head of the Athenian school.

It has been speculated that ''Akademia'' did not altogether disappear.&lt;ref name="bechtle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sorabji11"&gt;Richard Sorabji, (2005), ''The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200–600 AD: Psychology (with Ethics and Religion)'', page 11. Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; After his exile, Simplicius (and perhaps some others), may have travelled to [[Harran]], near [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. From there, the students of an Academy-in-exile could have survived into the 9th century, long enough to facilitate the Arabic revival of the Neoplatonist commentary tradition in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="sorabji11"/&gt;

===Ancient world===
{{main|Ancient higher-learning institutions}}

====Greece and early Europe====
{{Main|Academy}}
In ancient Greece, after the establishment of the original Academy, [[Plato]]'s colleagues and pupils developed spin-offs of his method. [[Arcesilaus]], a Greek student of Plato established the [[Middle Academy]]. [[Carneades]], another student, established the [[New Academy]]. In 335 BC, [[Aristotle]] refined the method with his own theories and established the [[Lyceum]] in another gymnasium.

====Africa====
The [[library of Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] was frequented by [[intellectual]]s from Africa, Europe and Asia studying various aspects of philosophy, language and mathematics.

The [[University of Timbuktu]] was a medieval university in [[Timbuktu]], present-day [[Mali]], which comprised three schools: the Mosque of Djinguereber, the Mosque of Sidi Yahya, and the Mosque of Sankore. During its zenith, the university had an average attendance of around 25,000 students within a city of around 100,000 people.

====China====
In China a higher education institution [[Shang Xiang]] was founded by [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] in the [[Youyu]] era before the 21st century BC. The Imperial Central Academy at [[Nanjing]], founded in 258, was a result of the evolution of Shang Xiang and it became the first comprehensive institution combining education and research and was divided into five faculties in 470, which later became [[Nanjing University]].

In the 8th century another kind of institution of learning emerged, named [[Shuyuan]], which were generally privately owned. There were thousands of Shuyuan recorded in ancient times. The degrees from them varied from one to another and those advanced Shuyuan such as [[Bailudong Shuyuan]] and [[Yuelu Shuyuan]] can be classified as higher institutions of learning.

====India====
[[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]] or [[Taxila (ancient)|Takshashila]], in ancient [[Hindustan|India]], modern-day [[Pakistan]], was an early centre of learning, near present-day [[Islamabad]] in the city of [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]. It is considered as one of the ancient universities of the world. According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002): ''Education in Ancient India'', Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-12556-6}}, p. 141: {{quote|We have to be extremely cautious in dealing with the literary evidence, because much of the information offered in the secondary literature on Taxila is derived from the Jataka prose that was only fixed in Ceylon several hundred years after the events that it purports to describe, probably some time after Buddhaghosa, i.e. around A.D. 500.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="Britannica Education"&gt;"History of Education", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002): ''Education in Ancient India'', Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-12556-6}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Takshashila is described in some detail in later [[Jataka tales|Jātaka]] tales, written in [[Sri Lanka]] around the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 1975:81&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the 5th century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous [[treatise]] [[Arthashastra]] ([[Sanskrit]] for The knowledge of [[Economics]]) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya),&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 Kautilya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 |date=2008-01-10 }}  Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]&lt;ref&gt;Radhakumud Mookerji (1941; 1960; reprint 1989). ''Chandragupta Maurya and His Times'' (p. 17). Motilal Banarsidass Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-0405-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ayurvedic]] healer [[Charaka]] studied at Taxila.&lt;ref name=Mookerji&gt;Radha Kumud Mookerji (2nd ed. 1951; reprint 1989). ''Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist'' (p. 478-489). Motilal Banarsidass Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-0423-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The [[Vedas]] and the [[Eighteen Arts]], which included skills such as [[archery]], [[hunting]], and [[elephant]] lore, were taught, in addition to its [[law school]], [[medical school]], and school of [[military science]].&lt;ref name=Mookerji/&gt;

It survived until 1197 when it was set upon, destroyed and burnt by the marauding forces of [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji]]. It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war.&lt;ref name="Nalanda University, as described by the dean of Yale school of management"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09garten.htm OpEd in New York Times: Nalanda University]&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, perhaps a first for an educational institution, housing 10,000 students in the university’s heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors.&lt;ref name="Nalanda"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |title=Official website of Nalanda University |access-date=2018-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100842/http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |archive-date=2012-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nalanda University attracted pupils and scholars from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey.

====Islamic world====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
{{Main|Islamic Golden Age#Education}}
Founded in [[Fes]], [[University of Al-Karaouine]] in the 9th century and in [[Cairo]], [[Al-Azhar University]] in the 10th century, and in [[Mali]], the [[University of Timbuktu]] in about 1100. [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]] in [[Baghdad]], Iraq was established in 1227 as a [[madrasah]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|al-Mustansir]]. Its library had an initial collection of 80,000 volumes, given by the Caliph. The collection was said to have grown to 400,000 volumes.

===Medieval Europe===
{{Main|Medieval university}}
In [[Europe]], the academy dates to the ancient Greeks and Romans in the pre-Christian era. Newer universities were founded in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the European institution of academia took shape. Monks and priests moved out of monasteries to [[cathedral|cathedral cities]] and other towns where they opened the first schools dedicated to advanced study.

The most notable of these new schools were in [[Bologna]], [[Salamanca]], [[Paris]], [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], while others were opened throughout Europe.

The seven [[liberal arts]] — the [[trivium (education)|Trivium]] ([[Grammar]], [[Rhetoric]], and [[Logic]]), and the [[Quadrivium]] ([[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Music]], and [[Astronomy]]) — had been codified in [[late antiquity]]. This was the basis of the curriculum in Europe until newly available Arabic texts and the works of Aristotle became more available in Europe in the 12th century.

It remained in place even after the new scholasticism of the [[School of Chartres]] and the encyclopedic work of [[Thomas Aquinas]], until the humanism of the 15th and 16th centuries opened new studies of arts and sciences.

==Renaissance academies in Italy==
With the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist revival]] that accompanied the revival of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist studies]], ''accademia'' took on newly vivid connotations.

===15th-century ''accademie''===
During the [[Florentine Renaissance]], [[Cosimo de' Medici]] took a personal interest in the new [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] that he determined to re-establish in 1439, centered on the marvellous promise shown by the young [[Marsilio Ficino]]. Cosimo had been inspired by the arrival at the otherwise ineffective [[Council of Florence]] of [[Gemistos Plethon]], who seemed a dazzling figure to the Florentine intellectuals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1462 Cosimo gave Ficino a villa at [[Careggi]] for the Academy's use, situated where Cosimo could see it from his own villa, and drop by for visits.  The academy remained a wholly informal group, but one which had a great influence on [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

{{main article|Roman academies}}
In Rome, after unity was restored following the [[Western Schism]], humanist circles, cultivating philosophy and searching out and sharing ancient texts tended to gather where there was access to a library. The [[Vatican Library]] was not coordinated until 1475 and was never catalogued or widely accessible: not all popes looked with satisfaction at gatherings of unsupervised intellectuals. At the head of this movement for renewal in Rome was [[Cardinal Bessarion]], whose house from the mid-century was the centre of a flourishing academy of Neoplatonic philosophy and a varied intellectual culture. His valuable Greek as well as Latin library (eventually bequeathed to the city of [[Venice]] after he withdrew from Rome) was at the disposal of the academicians. Bessarion, in the latter years of his life, retired from Rome to [[Ravenna]], but he left behind him ardent adherents of the classic philosophy.

The next generation of humanists were bolder admirers of pagan culture, especially in the highly personal academy of [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponius Leto]], the natural son of a nobleman of the [[Sanseverino]] family, born in [[Calabria]] but known by his academic name, who devoted his energies to the enthusiastic study of classical antiquity, and attracted a great number of disciples and admirers. He was a worshipper not merely of the literary and artistic form, but also of the ideas and spirit of classic paganism, which made him appear a condemner of [[Christianity]] and an enemy of the Church. In his academy every member assumed a classical name. Its principal members were humanists, like Bessarion's protégé [[Giovanni Antonio Campani]] (Campanus), [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the papal librarian, and [[Filippo Buonaccorsi]], and young visitors who received polish in the academic circle, like [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]] of Bologna who took the [[New Learning]] to the [[University of Paris]], to the discomfiture of his friend [[Erasmus]]. In their self-confidence, these first intellectual [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] compromised themselves politically, at a time when Rome was full of conspiracies fomented by the Roman barons and the neighbouring princes: [[Pope Paul II|Paul II]] (1464–71) caused [[Julius Pomponius Laetus|Pomponio]] and the leaders of the academy to be arrested on charges of irreligion, immorality, and conspiracy against the [[Pope]]. The prisoners begged so earnestly for mercy, and with such protestations of repentance, that they were pardoned. The Letonian academy, however, collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Pastor]], ''History of the Popes, ii, 2, gives an unsympathetic account.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Naples, the ''[[Quattrocento]]'' academy founded by [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso of Aragon]] and guided by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli]] was the ''Porticus Antoniana'', later known as the ''[[Accademia Pontaniana]]'', after [[Giovanni Pontano]].

===16th-century literary-aesthetic academies===
The 16th century saw at Rome a great increase of literary and aesthetic academies, more or less inspired by the Renaissance, all of which assumed, as was the fashion, odd and fantastic names. We learn from various sources the names of many such institutes; as a rule, they soon perished and left no trace. In the 1520s came the ''[[Accademia degli Intronati]]'', for the encouragement of theatrical representations. There were also the Academy of the "[[Vignaiuoli]]", or "[[Vinegrowers]]" (1530), and the ''{{illm|Accademia della Virtù|it}}'' (1542), founded by [[Claudio Tolomei]] under the patronage of Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici]]. These were followed by a new academy in the "[[Orti]]" or [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] gardens. There were also the academies of the "[[Intrepidi]]" (1560), the "[[Animosi]]" (1576), and the "[[Illuminati (Roman)|Illuminati]]" (1598); this last, founded by the [[Marchesa Isabella Aldobrandini Pallavicino]]. Towards the middle of the 16th century there were also the Academy of the "[[Notti Vaticane]]", or "[[Vatican Nights]]", founded by [[Saint|St]]. [[Charles Borromeo]]; an "Accademia di [[Diritto]] civile e canonico", and another of the university scholars and students of philosophy ([[Accademia Eustachiana]]). As a rule these academies, all very much alike, were merely circles of friends or clients gathered around a learned man or wealthy patron, and were dedicated to literary pastimes rather than methodical study. They fitted in, nevertheless, with the general situation and were in their own way one element of the historical development. Despite their empirical and fugitive character, they helped to keep up the general esteem for literary and other studies. Cardinals, prelates, and the clergy in general were most favourable to this movement, and assisted it by patronage and collaboration.

In Florence, the Medici again took the lead in establishing the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno]] in 1563, the first of the more formally organised art academies that gradually displaced the medieval artists' [[guild]]s, usually known as the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], as the bodies responsible for training and often regulating artists, a change with great implications for the development of art, leading to the styles known as [[Academic art]].  The private [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] set up later in the century in [[Bologna]] by the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers was also extremely influential, and with the [[Accademia di San Luca]] of Rome (founded 1593) helped to confirm the use of the term for these institutions.

==17th- and 18th-century academies in Europe==
Gradually academies began to specialize on particular topics (arts, language, sciences) and began to be founded and funded by the kings and other sovereigns (few republics had an academy). And, mainly, since 17th century academies spread throughout Europe.

===Literary-philosophical academies=== &lt;!-- courtesy note: [Draft:]Lumières links here --&gt;
In the 17th century the tradition of literary-philosophical academies, as circles of friends gathering around learned patrons, was continued in Italy; the "[[Umoristi]]" (1611), the "[[Fantastici]] (1625), and the "[[Ordinati]]", founded by [[Cardinal Dati]] and [[Giulio Strozzi]]. About 1700 were founded the academies of the "[[Infecondi]]", the "[[Occulti]]", the "[[Deboli]]", the "[[Aborigini]]", the "[[Immobili]]", the "[[Accademia Esquilina]]", and others. During the 18th century many Italian cities established similar philosophical and scientific academies. In the first half of the 19th century some of these became the [[National Academy|national academies]] of pre-unitarian states: the Academy of [[Accesi]] became the [[Panomitan Academy of Buon Gusto]] ([[Trento]]); the Academy of [[Timidi]] became the Royal Academy of [[Mantua]]; the [[Accademia dei Ricovrati]] became the [[Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science]] ([[Padova]]); the Academy of [[Dissonanti]] became the Royal Academy of [[Modena]] and the Academy of [[Oscuri]] became the Royal Academy of [[Lucca]].

===Academies of the arts===
The [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris, established by the monarchy in 1648 (later renamed) was the most significant of the artistic academies, running the famous [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] exhibitions from 1725.  Artistic academies were established all over Europe by the end of the 18th century, and many, like the [[Akademie der Künste]] in Berlin (founded 1696), the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]  in Madrid (founded 1744), the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]  in Saint Petersburg (1757), the [[Royal Academy]] in London (1768) and the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera]] in Milan (1776) still run art schools and hold large exhibitions, although their influence on taste greatly declined from the late 19th century.

A fundamental feature of academic discipline in the artistic academies was regular practice in making accurate drawings from antiquities, or from casts of antiquities, on the one hand, and on the other, in deriving inspiration from the other fount, the human form. Students assembled in sessions [[Figure drawing|drawing the draped and undraped human form]], and such drawings, which survive in the tens of thousands from the 17th through the 19th century, are termed '''''académies''''' in French.

Similar institutions were often established for other arts: Rome had the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia|Accademia di Santa Cecilia]] for music from 1585; Paris had the [[Académie Royale de Musique]] from 1669 and the [[Académie Royale d'Architecture]] from 1671.

===Linguistic academies===
{{main article|List of language regulators}}
The [[Accademia degli Infiammati]] of [[Padova]] and the Accademia degli Umidi, soon renamed the [[Accademia Fiorentina]], of [[Florence]] were both founded in 1540, and were both initially concerned with the proper basis for literary use of the ''volgare'', or [[vernacular language]] of Italy, which would later become the [[Italian language]]. In 1582 five Florentine literati gathered and founded the [[Accademia della Crusca]] to demonstrate and conserve the beauty of the Florentine vernacular tongue, modelled upon the authors of the Trecento. The main instrument to do so was the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]''. The Crusca long remained a private institution, criticizing and opposing the official Accademia Fiorentina.

The first institution inspired by the Crusca was the [[Fruitbearing Society]] for German language, which existed from 1617 to 1680.

The Crusca inspired [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] to found in 1634 the analogous [[Académie française]] with the task of acting as an official authority on the [[French language]], charged with publishing the official dictionary of that language. The following year the Académie received letters patent from the king Louis XIII as the only recognized academy for French language.

In its turn the state established Académie was the model for the [[Real Academia Española]] (founded in 1713) and the [[Swedish Academy]] (1786), which are the ruling bodies of their respective languages and editors of major dictionaries. It also was the model for the [[Russian Academy]], founded in 1783, which afterwards merged into the Russian Academy of Sciences.

===Academies of sciences===
{{main article|Academy of Sciences}}

After the short-lived [[Academia Secretorum Naturae]] of Naples, the first academy exclusively devoted to sciences was the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] founded in 1603 in Rome, particularly focused on natural sciences.
In 1657 some students of [[Galileo]] founded the [[Accademia del Cimento]] (Academy of Experiment) in [[Florence]], focused on physics and astronomy. The foundation of Academy was funded by [[Leopoldo de' Medici|Prince Leopoldo]] and [[Rulers of Tuscany|Grand Duke]] [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]]. This academy lasted after few decades.

In 1652 was founded the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Academia Naturae Curiosorum]] by four physicians.&lt;ref&gt;As for instance in the monumental ''A History of Magic and Experimental Science'' by [[Lynn Thorndike]] (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8zF_ESLDd0C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22Academy+of+the+Curious+as+to+Nature%22+inauthor:Thorndike&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Academy%20of%20the%20Curious%20as%20to%20Nature%22%20inauthor%3AThorndike&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1677, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], recognised the society and in 1687 he gave it the epithet ''Leopoldina'', with which is internationally famous.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.leopoldina-halle.de/broscheng.pdf Self-produced overview of the Leopoldina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014914/http://www.leopoldina-halle.de/broscheng.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} (accessed May 27, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;7–8; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.groschenheft.de/aus_leopoldina.htm Groschenheft magazine on the Leopoldina's anniversary (German)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311200937/http://www.groschenheft.de/aus_leopoldina.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }} (accessed May 27, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
So, it became the academy of sciences for the whole [[Holy Roman Empire]].

On 28 November 1660, a group of scientists from and influenced by the Invisible College (gathering approximately since 1645) met at Gresham College and announced the formation of a "College for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning", which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments. In 1662 [[Charles II of England]]  signed a  [[Royal Charter]] which created the "Royal Society of London", then "Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge".

In 1666 [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] gathered a small group of scholars to found a scientific society in Paris. The first 30 years of the Academy's existence were relatively informal, since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution.  In contrast to [[Royal Society]], the Academy was founded as an organ of government. In 1699, [[Louis XIV]] gave the Academy its first rules and named it [[Académie des sciences|Académie royale des sciences]].

Although Prussia was a member of Holy Roman Empire, in 1700 [[Prince-elector]] [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] of [[Brandenburg]] founded its own [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] upon the advice of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was appointed president.

During the 18th century many European kings followed and founded their own academy of sciences: in 1714 the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna]], in 1724 the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in 1731 the [[Royal Dublin Society]], in 1735 in [[Grand duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], in 1739 the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], in 1742 the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]], in 1751 the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]], in 1754 in [[Erfurt]], in 1759 the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], in 1763  the [[Academia Theodoro-Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], in 1779 the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], in 1783 the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], in 1782 the [[Accademia dei Quaranta]] in Rome, in 1784 in [[Turin]].

This kind of academy lost importance after the university reform begun with the foundation of the [[University of Berlin]], when universities were provided with laboratories and clinics, and were charged with doing experimental research.

===Academic societies===
{{Main|Learned society}}

Academic societies or [[learned society|learned societies]] began as groups of academics who worked together or presented their work to each other. These informal groups later became organized and in many cases state-approved. Membership was restricted, usually requiring approval of the current members and often total membership was limited to a specific number. The [[Royal Society]] founded in 1660 was the first such academy. The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] was begun in 1780 by many of the same people prominent in the [[American Revolution]]. Academic societies served both as a forum to present and publish academic work, the role now served by academic publishing, and as a means to sponsor research and support academics, a role they still serve. Membership in academic societies is still a matter of prestige in modern academia.

===Military academies===
At first such institutions only trained the [[Artillery]] and [[Military Engineering]] officers, like the ''Aula da Artilharia'' (founded in 1641) and the ''Aula de Fortificação'' (1647) in Lisbon, the [[Military Academy of Modena|Real Accademia di Savoia]] in Turin (opened in 1678), the [[Soviet military academies|Imperial Artillery Military Academy]] of Saint Petersburg (1698), the  [[Royal Military Academy Woolwich]] (1741), the ''Real Colegio de Artilleria'' in Segovia (1764).

Starting at the end of the 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire, France, Poland and Denmark, many [[Knight academy|Knight academies]] were established to prepare the aristocratic youth for state and military service. Many of them lately turned into [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], but some of them were transformed into true military academies.

The [[Royal Danish Military Academy]] began to educate all [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] for the [[Royal Danish Army]] by request of [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV]] in 1713.

The [[École Militaire]] was founded by [[Louis XV of France]] in 1750 with the  aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor families. The construction began in 1752, but the school did not open until 1760.

The [[Theresian Military Academy]] was founded on 14 December 1751 by [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Per year the Academy accepted 100 noblemen and 100 commoners to start their education there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/karriere/offizier/geschichte.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806051814/http://www.bmlv.gv.at/karriere/offizier/geschichte.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}, Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These were the model for the subsequent military academies throughout Europe, like the ''Reale Accademia Militare'' of Naples in 1787 and the [[Military Academy Karlberg]] in 1792.

==Modern use of the term ''academy''==
[[File:Athens academy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The modern [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], next to the [[University of Athens]] and the National Library forming 'the Trilogy', designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkel's]] Danish pupil [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen|Theofil Hansen]], 1885, in [[Ionic order|Greek Ionic]], academically correct even to the polychrome sculpture.]]

The term is used widely today to refer to anything from schools to [[Learned society|learned societies]] to [[Funding agency|funding agencies]] to private industry associations.

[[National academies]] are bodies for scientists, artists or writers that are usually state-funded and often are given the role of controlling much of the state funding for research into their areas, or other forms of funding.  Some use different terms in their name – the British [[Royal Society]] for example.  The membership typically comprises distinguished individuals in the relevant field, who may be elected by the other members, or appointed by the government.  They are essentially not schools or colleges, though some may operate teaching arms.  The [[Académie Française]] was the most influential pattern for these. Finland even has two separate "academies": [[Academy of Finland]] is a government-run funding agency, Suomalainen tiedeakatemia is a learned society.

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], which presents the annual [[Academy Awards]], is an example of a purely industry body using the name.  College-type specialized academies include the [[Royal Academy of Music]] of the [[United Kingdom]]; the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; the [[United States Naval Academy]]; [[United States Air Force Academy]]; and the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]]. In emulation of the military academies, police in the United States are trained in [[Police academy|police academies]].

Because of the tradition of intellectual brilliance associated with this institution, many groups have chosen to use the word "academy" in their name, especially specialized tertiary educational institutions.  In the early 19th century "academy" took the connotations that "[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]" was acquiring in German-speaking lands, of school that was less advanced than a college (for which it might prepare students) but considerably more than elementary. Early American examples are the prestigious preparatory schools of [[Phillips Andover Academy]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Deerfield Academy]].  In England, "academy" had a specialized meaning for schools, but the [[Edinburgh Academy]] was more like the American examples.  Academy was also used very loosely for various commercial training schools for dancing and the like.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] organized public subscription performances of his music in Vienna in the 1780s and 1790s, he called the [[concert]]s "academies". This usage in musical terms survives in the concert orchestra [[Academy of St Martin in the Fields]] and in the [[Brixton Academy]], a concert hall in Brixton, South London.

Academies proliferated in the 20th century until even a three-week series of lectures and discussions would be termed an "academy". In addition, the generic term "the academy" is sometimes used to refer to all of academia, which is sometimes considered a global successor to the Academy of [[Athens]].

===French regional academies overseeing education===
[[File:French academies map.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A map outlining the academies overseeing education in France.]]

In France, regional academic councils called academies are responsible for supervising all aspects of education in their region. The academy regions are similar to, but not identical to, the standard French administrative regions. the rector of each academy is a revocable nominee of the Ministry of Education. These academies' main responsibility is overseeing primary and secondary education, but public universities are  in some respects also answerable to the academy for their region. However, French private universities are independent of the state and therefore independent of the regional academies.

===Russian research academies===
In [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]] the term "academy", or [[Academy of Sciences]] was reserved to denote a state research establishment, see [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The latter one still exists in [[Russia]], although other types of academies (study and honorary) appeared as well.

===English school types===

====[[Tertiary education]]====
{{main article|Dissenting academies}}
From the mid-seventeenth to the 19th centuries, educational institutions in [[England]] run by [[nonconformist]] groups that did not agree with the [[Church of England]] teachings were collectively known as "[[dissenting academies|the dissenting academies]]". As a place at an English public school or university generally required conformity to the Church of England, these institutions provided an alternative for those with different religious views and formed a significant part of [[education in England|England’s educational system]].

[[University College London]] (UCL) was founded in 1826 as the first publicly funded English university to admit anyone regardless of religious adherence; and the [[Test and Corporation Acts]], which had imposed a wide range of restrictions on citizens who were not in conformity to the Church of England, were abolished shortly afterwards, by the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829.

====[[Primary education|Primary]] and [[secondary education]]====
{{main article|Academy (English school)}}
In 2000, a form of "independent state schools", called "[[Academy (English school)|academies]]", were introduced in [[England]]. They have been compared to US [[charter school]]s.&lt;ref name="smithers"&gt;Rebecca Smithers, ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 6, 2005, [http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1522109,00.html "Hedge fund charity plans city academies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202165655/http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0%2C5500%2C1522109%2C00.html |date=2006-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are directly funded from central government rather than through local councils, and are partly privately sponsored. Often the sponsors are from business, but some are sponsored by universities and charities. These schools have greater autonomy than schools run by the local councils. They are usually a type of secondary school, but some are "all through" schools with an integral primary school.  Some of the early ones were briefly known as "city academies"—the first such school opening on 10 September 2002 at the [[Business Academy Bexley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2249188.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Education – Academy opens doors to the future|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628210928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2249188.stm|archivedate=28 June 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's Speech, which followed the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], included proposals for a bill to allow the Secretary of State for Education to approve schools, both Primary and Secondary, that have been graded "outstanding" by [[Ofsted]], to become academies. This will be through a simplified streamlined process which will not require the sponsors to provide capital funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/academieshl.html|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217031235/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/academieshl.html|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the UK government began forcing some schools which had been graded satisfactory or lower into becoming academies, unilaterally removing existing governing bodies and head teachers in some cases. An example was Downhills Primary School in Haringey, where the head teacher refused to turn the school into an academy. OFSTED were called in to assess the school, failed it, and both the head and the governing body were removed and replaced with a Government-appointed board despite opposition from the school and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17385311|title=BBC News – Academy row school governors sacked by Michael Gove|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17385311|archivedate=13 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9592486.Protesting_parents__disgusted__with_Downhills_governors__removal/|title=Protesting parents 'disgusted' with Downhills governors' removal|author=David Hardiman|work=Haringey Independent|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074454/http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9592486.Protesting_parents__disgusted__with_Downhills_governors__removal/|archivedate=23 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|History of higher education in the United States}}

Prior to the twentieth century, education was not as carefully structured in the United States as it is in the twenty-first. There was not a rigid division between high school and colleges. In many cases, educational records were not kept nor diplomas issued.

A reference to academia, in the United States, is to post-secondary education, especially the most elite or liberal arts part of it. However, an academy was what later became known as a high school. Some older high schools, such as [[Corning Free Academy]], retained the term in their names (Corning Free Academy, demoted to a [[middle school]], closed in 2014). However, the [[United States Military Academy]] is a college. A number of colleges began as (high school) academies.

Academia began to splinter from its [[Christianity|Christian]] roots in 18th-century colonial [[United States|America]]. In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the Academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the College and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. Today, it is known as the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. For the first time, academia was established as a [[secular]] institution. For the most part, church-based dogmatic points of view were no longer thrust upon students in the examination of their subjects of study. Points of view became more varied as students were free to wander in thought without having to add religious dimensions to their conclusions.

In 1819, Thomas Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]] and developed the standards used today in organizing colleges and universities across the globe. The curriculum was taken from the traditional liberal arts, classical [[humanism]] and the values introduced with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Jefferson offered his students something new: the freedom to chart their own courses of study rather than mandate a fixed curriculum for all students. Religious colleges and universities followed suit.

The Academy movement in the U.S. in the early 19th century arose from a public sense that education in the classic disciplines needed to be extended into the new territories and states that were being formed in the [[Old Northwest]], in western [[New York State]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]]. Dozens of academies were founded in the area, supported by private donations.

===Germany===
During [[the Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th-century Europe, the academy started to change in Europe. In the beginning of the 19th century [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] not only published his philosophical paper ''On the Limits of State Action'', but also directed the educational system in [[Prussia]] for a short time. He introduced an academic system that was much more accessible to the lower classes. [[Humboldt's Ideal]] was an education based on individuality, creativity, wholeness, and versatility. Many continental European universities are still rooted in these ideas (or at least pay lip-service to them). They are, however, in contradiction to today's massive trend of specialization in academia.

==Academic personnel==
{{main|Faculty (academic staff)}}
{{main listing|Academic ranks}}
{{see also|Academic administration}}

An ''academic'' is a person who works as a teacher or researcher at a [[university]] or other higher education institution.
An academic usually holds an [[postgraduate education|advanced degree]].
The term ''scholar'' is sometimes used with equivalent meaning to that of ''academic'' and describes in general those who attain mastery in a research discipline. It has wider application, with it also being used to describe those whose occupation was researched prior to organized higher education.

Academic administrators such as [[Chancellor (education)#University president|university presidents]] are not typically included in this use of the term ''academic'', although many administrators hold advanced degrees and pursue scholarly research and writing while also tending to their administrative duties.

In the [[Academic ranks in the United States|United States]], the term academic is approximately synonymous with that of the job title [[professor]] although in recent decades a growing number of institutions include [[librarian]]s in the category of "academic staff."
In the [[Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], various titles of [[list of academic ranks|academic rank]] are used, typically [[research associate]], [[research fellow]] (also senior research fellow and principal research fellow), [[lecturer]] (also senior lecturer and principal lecturer), [[reader (academic rank)|reader]], and [[professor]]. The colloquial term [[University don|don]] is sometimes substituted for teaching staff at Oxford and Cambridge.{{or?|date=May 2018}}

==Structure==
Academia is usually conceived of as divided into ''[[academic discipline|disciplines]]'' or ''fields'' of study. These have their roots in the subjects of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], which provided the model for scholastic thought in the first [[Medieval university|universities in medieval Europe]].

The disciplines have been much revised, and many new disciplines have become more specialized, researching smaller and smaller areas. Because of this, ''[[Inter-disciplinary|interdisciplinary]]'' research is often prized in today's academy, though it can also be made difficult both by practical matters of administration and funding and by differing research methods of different disciplines. In fact, many new fields of study have initially been conceived as interdisciplinary, and later become specialized disciplines in their own right – a recent example is [[cognitive science]].

Most academic institutions reflect the divide of the disciplines in their [[academic administration|administrative]] structure, being divided internally into ''departments'' or ''programs'' in various fields of study. Each department is typically administered and funded separately by the academic institution, though there may be some overlap and [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members, research and administrative staff may in some cases be shared among departments. In addition, academic institutions generally have an overall administrative structure (usually including a [[University president|president]] and several [[dean (education)|deans]]) which is controlled by no single department, discipline, or field of thought. Also, the [[tenure]] system, a major component of academic employment and research in the US, serves to ensure that academia is relatively protected from political and financial pressures on thought.

===Qualifications===
{{Main|Academic degree}}

The degree awarded for completed study is the primary academic qualification. Typically these are, in order of completion, [[associate's degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] (awarded for completion of [[undergraduate]] study), [[master's degree]], and [[doctorate]] (awarded after [[graduate school|graduate]] or [[postgraduate]] study). These are only currently being standardized in Europe as part of the [[Bologna process]], as many different degrees and standards of time to reach each are currently awarded in different countries in Europe. In most fields the majority of academic researchers and teachers have doctorates or other terminal degrees, though in some [[Professional studies|professional]] and creative fields it is common for scholars and teachers to have only master's degrees.

===Academic conferences===
{{Main|Academic conference}}
Closely related to academic publishing is the practice of bringing a number of intellectuals in a field to give talks on their research at an academic conference, often allowing for a wider audience to be exposed to their ideas.

===Conflicting goals===
Within academia, diverse constituent groups have diverse, and sometimes conflicting, goals. In the contemporary academy several of these conflicts are widely distributed and common. A salient example of conflict is that between the goal to improve teaching quality and the goal to reduce costs. The conflicting goals of professional education programs and general education advocates currently are playing out in the negotiation over accreditation standards.

====Practice and theory====
Putting theory into practice can result in a gap between what is learned in academic settings and how that learning is manifested in practical settings. This is addressed in a number of professional schools such as [[teacher education|education]] and [[social work]], which require students to participate in practica for credit. Students are taught to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Not everyone agrees on the value of theory as opposed to practice. Academics are sometimes criticized as lacking practical experience and thus too insulated from the 'real world.' Academic insularity is colloquially criticized as being "[[ivory tower]]"; when used pejoratively, this term is criticized as [[anti-intellectualism]].

To address this split, there is a growing body of [[practice research]], such as the [[practice-based research network]] (PBRN) within clinical [[medical research]]. [[Arts]] and [[humanities]] departments debate how to define this emerging research phenomenon. There are a variety of contested models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based and practice through research), for example, [[screen media practice research]].

====Town and gown====
{{Main|Town and gown}}
Universities are often culturally distinct from the towns or cities where they reside. In some cases this leads to discomfort or outright conflict between local residents and members of the university over political, economic, or other issues. Some localities in the Northeastern United States, for instance, have tried to block students from registering to vote as local residents—instead encouraging them to vote by absentee ballot at their primary residence—in order to retain control of local politics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Other issues can include deep cultural and class divisions between local residents and university students. The film ''[[Breaking Away]]'' dramatizes such a conflict.

====Commerce and scholarship====
The goals of research for profit and for the sake of knowledge often conflict to some degree.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Academic publishing==
{{Main|Academic publishing}}

===History of academic journals===
Among the earliest [[research journal]]s were the Proceedings of Meetings of the [[Royal Society]] in the 17th century. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial, and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an [[anagram]], reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] used this approach. However, this method did not work well. [[Robert K. Merton]], a sociologist, found that 92 percent of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72 percent in the 18th century, 59 percent by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33 percent by the first half of the 20th century. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals.

The Royal Society was steadfast in its unpopular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence. Many of the experiments were ones that we would not recognize as scientific today—nor were the questions they answered. For example, when the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was admitted as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on June 5, 1661, he presented the Society with a vial of powdered "[[unicorn]] horn". It was a well-accepted 'fact' that a circle of unicorn's horn would act as an invisible cage for any [[spider]]. [[Robert Hooke]], the chief experimenter of the Royal Society, emptied the Duke's vial into a circle on a table and dropped a spider in the centre of the circle. The spider promptly walked out of the circle and off the table. In its day, this was cutting-edge research.

===Current status and development===
Research journals have been so successful that the number of journals and of papers has proliferated over the past few decades, and the credo of the modern academic has become "[[publish or perish]]". Except for generalist journals such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' or ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the topics covered in any single journal have tended to be narrow, and readership and citation have declined. A variety of methods for reviewing submissions exist. The most common involves initial approval by the journal, [[peer review]] by two or three researchers working in similar or closely related subjects who recommend approval or rejection as well as request error correction, clarification or additions before publishing. Controversial topics may receive additional levels of review. Journals have developed a hierarchy, partly based on reputation but also on the strictness of the review policy. More prestigious journals are more likely to receive and publish more important work. Submitters try to submit their work to the most prestigious journal likely to publish it to bolster their reputation and [[curriculum vitae]].

[[Andrew Odlyzko]], an [[academician]] with a large number of published research papers, has argued that research journals will evolve into something akin to [[Internet]] forums over the coming decade, by extending the interactivity of current Internet [[preprint]]s. This change may open them up to a wider range of ideas, some more developed than others. Whether this will be a positive evolution remains to be seen. Some claim that forums, like markets, tend to thrive or fail based on their ability to attract talent. Some believe that highly restrictive and tightly monitored forums may be the least likely to thrive.

==Academic dress==
{{Main|Academic dress}}

Gowns have been associated with academia since the birth of the university in the 14th and 15th centuries, perhaps because most early scholars were [[priest]]s or church officials. Over time, the gowns worn by degree-holders have become standardized to some extent, although traditions in individual countries and even institutions have established a diverse range of gown styles, and some have ended the custom entirely, even for graduation ceremonies.

At some universities, such as the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], undergraduates may be required to wear gowns on formal occasions and on graduation. Undergraduate gowns are usually a shortened version of a bachelor's gown. At other universities, for example, outside the UK or U.S., the custom is entirely absent. Students at the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto wear gowns to formal dinner, debates, to student government, and to many other places.

In general, in the U.S. and UK recipients of a bachelor's degree are entitled to wear a simple full-length robe without adornment and a [[mortarboard]] cap with a tassel. In addition, holders of a bachelor's degree may be entitled to wear a ceremonial hood at some schools. In the U.S., bachelor's hoods are rarely seen. Bachelor's hoods are generally smaller versions of those worn by recipients of master's and doctoral degrees.

Recipients of a master's degree in the U.S. or UK wear a similar cap and gown but closed sleeves with slits, and usually receive a ceremonial hood that hangs down the back of the gown. In the U.S. the hood is traditionally edged with a silk or velvet strip displaying the disciplinary color, and is lined with the university's colors.

According to The American Council on Education “six-year specialist degrees ([[Educational Specialist|Ed.S.]], etc.) and other degrees that are intermediate between the master's and the doctor's degree may have hoods specially designed (1) intermediate in length between the master's and doctor's hood, (2) with a four-inch velvet border (also intermediate between the widths of the borders of master's and doctor's hoods), and (3) with color distributed in the usual fashion and according to the usual rules. Cap tassels should be uniformly black.”&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=10625#6-year |title=Six-Year Specialist Degrees |accessdate=2006-12-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206113630/http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=10625 |archivedate=6 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients of a doctoral degree tend to have the most elaborate academic dress, and hence there is the greatest diversity at this level. In the U.S., doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by master's graduates, with the addition of velvet stripes across the sleeves and running down the front of the gown which may be tinted with the disciplinary color for the degree received. Holders of a doctoral degree may be entitled or obliged to wear ''scarlet'' (a special gown in scarlet) on high days and special occasions. While some doctoral graduates wear the mortarboard cap traditional to the lower degree levels, most wear a cap or ''Tudor bonnet'' that resembles a [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]], from which a colored tassel is suspended.

In modern times in the U.S. and UK, gowns are normally only worn at graduation ceremonies, although some colleges still demand the wearing of academic dress on formal occasions (official banquets and other similar affairs). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was more common to see the dress worn in the classroom, a practice which has now all but disappeared. Two notable exceptions are [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and a society at [[Sewanee, The University of the South|Sewanee]], where students are required to wear formal academic dress in the examination room.

'''Alfred Tarski''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑr|s|k|i}}; January 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; October 26, 1983), born '''Alfred Teitelbaum''',&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Tarski "Alfred Tarski"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfred Tarski"&gt;School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tarski.html "Alfred Tarski"], ''School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Oxford Reference, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803102144812 "Alfred Tarski"], ''Oxford Reference''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Polish-American&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0186.xml |title=Alfred Tarski - Philosophy - Oxford Bibliographies |last=Gomez-Torrente |first=Mario |date=March 27, 2014 |website=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[logic]]ian and [[mathematician]]&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/ "Alfred Tarski"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Polish-Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref name="Alfred Tarski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt; Educated in Poland at the [[University of Warsaw]], and a member of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school|Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] and the [[Warsaw school of mathematics]], he immigrated to the United States in 1939 where he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Tarski taught and carried out research in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1942 until his death in 1983.&lt;ref name=FefA&gt;[[#FefA|Feferman A.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific author best known for his work on [[model theory]], [[metamathematics]], and [[algebraic logic]], he also contributed to [[abstract algebra]], [[topology]], [[geometry]], [[measure theory]], [[mathematical logic]], [[set theory]], and [[analytic philosophy]].

His biographers Anita and [[Solomon Feferman]] state that, "Along with his contemporary, [[Kurt Gödel]], he changed the face of logic in the twentieth century, especially through his work on the concept of [[truth]] and the theory of models."&lt;ref name=FFintro&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alfred Tarski was born '''Alfred Teitelbaum''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] spelling: "Tajtelbaum"), to parents who were [[Polish Jews]] in comfortable circumstances relative to other Jews in the overall region. He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's ''Szkoła Mazowiecka''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1918 intending to study [[biology]].&lt;ref name="Feferman &amp; Feferman, p.26"&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] and [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Leśniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.&lt;ref name="Feferman &amp; Feferman, p.26"/&gt;  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], and became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Leśniewski's supervision. Tarski and Leśniewski soon grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński|Kotarbiński]], which was reciprocated.

In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to "Tarski".&lt;!--Unsourced: (Years later, Alfred met another Alfred Tarski in northern California.)--&gt; The Tarski brothers also converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic." Anita Burdman Feferman, Solomon Feferman, ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' (2004), page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the University, and served as Łukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.januszkorczak.ca/bulletins/Bulletin%20%235.pdf|title=The Newsletter of the Janusz Korczak Association of Canada|id=Number 5|date=September 2007|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who married the mathematician [[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht]].&lt;ref&gt;Feferman &amp; Feferman (2004), pp. 239–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at [[Lwów University]], but on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s recommendation it was awarded to [[Leon Chwistek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Tarski visited the [[University of Vienna]], lectured to [[Karl Menger]]'s colloquium, and met [[Kurt Gödel]]. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the [[Unity of Science]] movement, an outgrowth of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at [[Poznań University]] but the chair was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at [[Harvard University]]. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the [[Nazi]] threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.

Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), [[City College of New York]] (1940), and thanks to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1942), where he again met Gödel. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], Chap. 5, pp. 124-149&lt;/ref&gt; Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00159&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|title=Alfred Tarski, Mathematics: Berkeley|author1=Robert Vaught|author2=John Addison|author3=Benson Mates|author4=Julia Robinson |year=1985|publisher=University of California (System) Academic Senate|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an awesome and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians, noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits/Tarski.html Obituary in ''Times'', reproduced here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative — sometimes working all night with a colleague — and was very fastidious about priority.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Moore, "Alfred Tarski" in ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women — in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fef|Feferman]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of [[Andrzej Mostowski]], [[Bjarni Jónsson]], [[Julia Robinson]], [[Robert Vaught]], [[Solomon Feferman]], [[Richard Montague]], James Donald Monk, [[Haim Gaifman]], Donald Pigozzi and [[Roger Maddux]], as well as [[Chen Chung Chang]] and [[Jerome Keisler]], authors of ''Model Theory'' (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.C., and Keisler, H.J., 1973. ''Model Theory''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.  American Elsevier, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a classic text in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=studentlist&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 385-386&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, [[Dana Scott]], and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time.&lt;ref name=studentlist/&gt;

Tarski lectured at [[University College, London]] (1950, 1966), the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris (1955), the [[Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science]] in Berkeley (1958&amp;ndash;60), the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1967), and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] (1974&amp;ndash;75). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003268 |title=Alfred Tarski (1902 - 1983) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; received [[honorary degree]]s from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from [[Marseilles]]' [[Paul Cézanne University]] in 1977 and from the [[University of Calgary]], as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1944&amp;ndash;46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956&amp;ndash;57. He was also an honorary editor of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tarski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematician==
Tarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see "Interludes I&amp;ndash;VI" in Feferman and Feferman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on [[set theory]], a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and [[Stefan Banach]] proved that, if one accepts the [[Axiom of Choice]], a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].

In ''A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry'', Tarski showed, by the method of [[quantifier elimination]], that the [[first-order theory]] of the [[real number]]s under addition and multiplication is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because [[Alonzo Church]] proved in 1936 that [[Peano arithmetic]] (the theory  of [[natural number]]s) is ''not'' decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. In his 1953 ''Undecidable theories'', Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s, are all undecidable. The theory of [[Abelian group]]s is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.

In the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school [[geometry]]. Using some ideas of [[Mario Pieri]], in 1926 Tarski devised an original [[axiomatization]] for plane [[Euclidean geometry]], one considerably more concise than [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]]. [[Tarski's axioms]] form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are [[Point (geometry)|points]], and having only two primitive [[finitary relation|relations]]. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.

In 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean [[solid geometry]] could be recast as a first-order theory whose individuals are ''spheres'' (a [[primitive notion]]), a single primitive binary relation "is contained in", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment [[partial order|partially orders]] the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of [[mereology]] far easier to exposit than [[Lesniewski]]'s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.

''Cardinal Algebras'' studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of [[cardinal number]]s. ''Ordinal Algebras'' sets out an algebra for the additive theory of [[order type]]s. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.

In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on [[binary relation]]s, which began the work on [[relation algebra]] and its [[metamathematics]] that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of [[Roger Lyndon]]) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most [[axiomatic set theory]] and [[Peano arithmetic]]. For an introduction to [[relation algebra]], see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised [[cylindric algebra]]s, which are to [[first-order logic]] what the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is to classical [[sentential logic]]. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).

==Logician==
Tarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time &amp;mdash; along with Aristotle, [[Gottlob Frege]], and Kurt Gödel.&lt;ref name=FFintro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaught"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|publisher=ASL|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869–882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002–2006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Of these four, he was by far the most prolific author. MORE THAN ARISTOTLE???  PROVIDE Reference! --&gt; However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for [[Logic of relatives|Charles Sanders Peirce]], particularly for his pioneering work in the [[Finitary relation|logic of relations]].

Tarski produced axioms for ''logical consequence'', and worked on [[deductive system]]s, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Sinaceur"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinaceur|first=Hourya|title=Alfred Tarski: Semantic Shift, Heuristic Shift in Metamathematics|journal=Synthese|publisher=Springer Verlag|volume=126|issue=1–2|pages=49–65|issn=0039-7857|doi=10.1023/A:1005268531418|year=2001|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01119489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tarski's 1936 article "On the concept of logical consequence" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences''.

Tarski's 1969 "Truth and proof" considered both [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.

==Truth in formalized languages==
{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}
In 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled "Pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych",&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, "POJĘCIE PRAWDY W JĘZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933. [http://www.archiwum.wfis.uw.edu.pl/bibfis/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:a-tarski-pojcie-prawdy-w-jzykach-nauk-dedukcyjnych&amp;catid=56:marginalia&amp;Itemid=106 (Text in Polish in the Digital Library WFISUW-IFISPAN-PTF)].&lt;/ref&gt; setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages. The 1935 German translation was titled "Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen", "The concept of truth in formalized languages", sometimes shortened to "Wahrheitsbegriff". An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics''. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century [[analytic philosophy]], a contribution to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semantics]], and the [[philosophy of language]]. For a brief discussion of its content, see [[Convention T]] (and also [[T-schema]]).

Some recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a [[correspondence theory of truth]]. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:

: "p" is true [[if and only if]] p.

(where p is the proposition expressed by "p")

The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white&lt;/blockquote&gt;

as expressing merely a [[deflationary theory of truth]] or as embodying [[truth]] as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.

==Logical consequence==
In 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. &lt;!-- (First appearance in English?) --&gt; A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).

This publication set out the modern [[model theory|model-theoretic]] definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different [[cardinal number|cardinalities]]). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. [[John Etchemendy]] stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Etchemendy|first=John|title=The Concept of Logical Consequence|publisher=Stanford CA: CSLI Publications|year=1999|isbn=1-57586-194-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. "What are Logical Notions?" can thus be viewed as continuing "On the Concept of Logical Consequence".

==Work on logical notions==
Another theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his "What are Logical Notions?" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; it was edited without his direct involvement by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. It became the most cited paper in the journal ''History and Philosophy of Logic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=thpl20#.UkH58D_-kQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls "notions") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the [[Erlangen programme]] of the German 19th century Mathematician, [[Felix Klein]]. Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.

That program classified the various types of geometry ([[Euclidean geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[topology]], etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, "rotate 30 degrees" and  "magnify by a factor of 2" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.

As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a [[polygon]] from an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.

Tarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations ([[automorphism]]s) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the [[universe of discourse]] of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the [[truth value]] True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:

# ''[[Truth-function]]s'': All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all ''n''-ary truth-functions for finite ''n''. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)
# ''Individuals'': No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.
# ''Predicates'':
#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension
#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension
#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs &lt;''a'',''a''&gt; in its extension, where ''a'' is a member of the domain
#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs &lt;''a'',''b''&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are distinct members of the domain
#* ''n''-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[negation]] (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)
# ''[[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifiers]]'': Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as "Exactly four", "Finitely many", "Uncountably many", and "Between four and 9 million", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gy'', "More(''x, y'')", which says "More things have ''F'' than have ''G''."
# ''Set-Theoretic relations'': Relations such as [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)|union]] applied to [[subset]]s of the domain are logical in the present sense.
# ''Set membership'': Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of [[type theory]], but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].
# ''Logical notions of higher order'': While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.

In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).

Solomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary [[homomorphism]]s. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.

McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. "Arbitrarily" includes a countable infinity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19183">'''Artificial skin''' is a [[collagen]] scaffold that induces regeneration of [[skin]] in mammals such as humans. The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive [[burn]]s. It was later discovered that treatment of deep skin wounds in adult animals and humans with this scaffold induces regeneration of the [[dermis]]. It has been developed commercially under the name IntegraTM and is used in massively burned patients, during [[plastic surgery]] of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds.

Alternatively, the term “artificial skin” sometimes is used to refer to skin-like tissue grown in a laboratory, although this technology is still quite a way away from being viable for use in the medical field. 'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible [[semiconductor]] materials that can sense touch for those with [[prosthetic limbs]], (also experimental).

==Background==
The skin is the largest [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahiya|first=R. S.|title=Robotic Tactile Sensing|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-0578-4|page=265|url=https://www.springer.com/engineering/robotics/book/978-94-007-0578-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis and the fat layer, also called the hypodermis.  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin that keeps vital fluids in and harmful bacteria out of the body.  The dermis is the inner layer of skin that contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, oil, and sweat glands.&lt;ref&gt;. http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Apg-Ban/Artificial-Skin.html&lt;/ref&gt; Severe damage to large areas of skin exposes the human organism to [[dehydration]] and [[infection]]s that can result in death.

Traditional ways of dealing with large losses of skin have been to use skin grafts from the patient (autografts) or from an unrelated donor or a cadaver. The former approach has the disadvantage that there may not be enough skin available, while the latter suffers from the possibility of [[transplant rejection|rejection]] or infection.
Until the late twentieth century, skin grafts were constructed from the patient's own skin.  This became a problem when skin had been damaged extensively, making it impossible to treat severely injured patients entirely with autografts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/artificial-skin-2 |title=How is artificial skin made?: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regenerated skin: discovery and clinical use ==
A process for inducing regeneration in skin was invented by Dr. Ioannis V. Yannas (then an assistant professor in the Fibers and Polymers Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]) and Dr. John F. Burke (then chief of staff at Shriners Burns Institute in Boston, Massachusetts). Their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure. Several kinds of grafts made of synthetic and natural polymers were prepared and tested in a guinea pig animal model. By the late 1970s it was evident that the original objective was not reached. Instead, these experimental grafts typically did not affect the speed of wound closure. In one case, however, a particular type of collagen graft led to significant delay of wound closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Use of artificial skin in wound management| author=I.V. Yannas | journal= The Surgical Wound | editor= Dineen | date= 1981 | pages=170–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful study of histology samples revealed that grafts that delayed wound closure induced the synthesis of new dermis de novo at the injury site, instead of forming scar, which is the normal outcome of the spontaneous wound healing response. This was the first demonstration of regeneration of a tissue (dermis) that does not regenerate by itself in the adult mammal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Design of an artificial skin I.

Several patents were granted to MIT for the creation of collagen-based grafts that can induce dermis regeneration. U.S. Pat. 4,418,691 (December 6, 1983) was cited by the National Inventors Hall of Fame as the key patent describing the invention of a process for regenerated skin (Inductees Natl Inventors Hall of Fame, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ioannis Yannas to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame | url=http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/ioannis-yannas-to-be-inducted-national-inventors-hall-of-fame-0203}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These patents were translated later into a commercial product (IntegraTM) by Integra LifeSciences Corp., a company founded in 1993. IntegraTM grafts received FDA approval in 1996 and since then are being applied worldwide to treat patients who are in need of new skin to treat massive burns, those undergoing plastic surgery of the skin, and patients with chronic skin wounds as well as others who suffer from certain forms of skin cancer. 
In clinical practice, a thin graft sheet manufactured from the active collagen scaffold is placed on the injury site, which is then covered with a thin sheet of silicone elastomer that protects the wound site from bacterial infection and dehydration. The graft can be seeded with autologous cells (keratinocytes) in order to accelerate wound closure, however the presence of these cells is not required for regenerating the dermis.&lt;ref name="Yannas et al. 1989"/&gt; Grafting skin wounds with IntegraTM leads to the synthesis of normal vascularized and innervated dermis de novo, followed by re-epithelization and formation of epidermis. Although early versions of the scaffold were not capable of regenerating hair follicles and sweat glands, later developments by S.T Boyce and coworkers led to solution of this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Characterization of hair follicle development in engineered skin substitutes |author1=P. Sriwiriyanont |author2=K.A. Lynch |author3=K.L. McFarland |author4=D.M. Supp |author5=S.T.

The mechanism of regeneration using an active collagen scaffold has been largely clarified. The scaffold retains regenerative activity provided that it has been prepared with appropriate levels of the specific surface (pore size in range 20-125&amp;nbsp;µm), degradation rate  (degradation half-life 14 ± 7 days) and surface chemical features (ligand densities for integrins α1β1 and α2β1 must exceed approximately 200 μΜ α1β1 and α2β1 ligands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= C In Situ Quantification of Surface Chemistry in Porous Collagen Biomaterials |author1=D.S.

==Further research==
Research is continually being done on artificial skin. Newer technologies, such as an [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] [[spray-on skin]] produced by [[Avita Medical]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Technology Review]]|title=Spraying on Skin Cells to Heal Burns|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/23876/|date=November 5, 2009|first=Lauren|last=Gravitz|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being tested in efforts to accelerate [[healing]] and minimize scarring.

The [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology is working towards a fully [[automation|automated]] process for producing artificial skin. Their goal is a simple two-layer skin without blood vessels that can be used to study how skin interacts with consumer products, such as creams and medicines. They hope to eventually produce more complex skin that can be used in transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|authorlink=Fraunhofer Society|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518102959.htm|title=Artificial Skin Manufactured In Fully Automated Process|work=[[Science Daily]]|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanna Wendt, and a team of her colleagues in the Department of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical School Hannover Germany, have found a method for creating artificial skin using [[spider silk]]. Before this, however, artificial skin was grown using materials like [[collagen]].  These materials did not seem strong enough. Instead, Wendt and her team turned to spider silk, which is known to be 5 times stronger than [[Kevlar]].  The silk is harvested by “milking” the silk glands of golden orb web spiders. The silk was spooled as it was harvested, and then it was woven into a rectangular steel frame. The steel frame was 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and the resulting weave was easy to handle or sterilize.  Human skin cells were added to the meshwork silk and were found to flourish under an environment providing nutrients, warmth and air. However at this time, using spider silk to grow artificial skin in mass quantities is not practical because of the tedious process of harvesting spider silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/artificial-skin-spider-silk-110810.html |title=Artificial Skin Made From Spider Silk : Discovery News |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2011-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian researchers are currently searching for a new, innovative way to produce artificial skin.  This would produce artificial skin quicker, and in a more efficient way.  The skin produced would only be 1 millimeter thick and would only be used to rebuild the epidermis.  They can also make the skin 1.5 millimeters thick, which would allow the dermis to repair itself if needed.  This would require [[bone marrow]] from a donation or from the patient's body.  The bone marrow would be used as a “seed," and would be placed in the grafts to mimic the dermis.  This has been tested on animals and has been proven to work with animal skin.
Professor Maitz said, “In Australia, someone with a full-thickness burn to up to 80 per cent of their body surface area has every prospect of surviving the injury...

Another form of “artificial skin” has been created out of flexible [[semiconductor]] materials that can sense touch for those with [[prosthetic limbs]].&lt;ref name="Robotic Tactile Sensing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Julie | last = Steenhuysen | title = Artificial "skin" materials can sense pressure | date = 12 September 2010| publisher = Yahoo News | url = http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/100912/tecnology/ctech_us_skin_artificial | work = Reuters | accessdate = 14 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100916083357/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/100912/tecnology/ctech_us_skin_artificial| archivedate= 16 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artificial skin is anticipated to augment [[robotics]] in conducting rudimentary jobs that would be considered delicate and require sensitive “touch”.&lt;ref name="Robotic Tactile Sensing"&gt;[https://www.springer.com/engineering/robotics/book/978-94-007-0578-4 Robotic Tactile Sensing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dahiya"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/early/2010/04/14/jn.01007.2009.abstract | title=Probing with and into Fingerprints | date=14 April 2010 | last=Dahiya | first=Ravinder | author2=Monica Gori | journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | doi=10.1152/jn.01007.2009 | pmid=20393056 | volume=104 | issue=1 | pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists found that by applying a layer of rubber with two parallel electrodes that stored electrical charges inside of the artificial skin, tiny amounts of pressure could be detected.

However, the film is so small that when pressure is applied to the skin, the molecules have nowhere to move and become entangled. The molecules also fail to return to their original shape when the pressure is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/09/13/new.artificial.skin.could.make.prosthetic.limbs.and.robots.more.sensitive |title=New artificial skin could make prosthetic limbs and robots more sensitive |publisher=e!

The '''Bell-boy Jacket''' is modeled on uniforms traditionally worn by hotel [[bell-boy]]s and [[Courier|messenger]]s, consisting of a very fitted waist-length jacket and a band collar, often double-breasted and trimmed with fancy braid or piping, and rows of close-set brass buttons. The cuffs of the jacket often have similar decoration. The style is based on 19th-century military dress uniforms and drummer boys.

'''William Melvin Hicks'''&lt;ref name=officialbio /&gt; (December 16, 1961 – February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian, [[social criticism|social critic]], [[Satire|satirist]] and musician. His material, encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy, was controversial, and often steeped in [[black comedy|dark comedy]].

At the age of 16, while still in high school, he began performing at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in [[Houston]], Texas. During the 1980s, he toured the United States extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances; but it was in the UK that he amassed a significant fan base, filling large venues during his 1991 tour.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career | title = Bill Hicks Personal Life and Career | publisher = Bestcomedyonline.net | accessdate = August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also achieved a modicum of recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.

Hicks died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 26, 1994, in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], at the age of 32. In subsequent years his work gained a significant measure of acclaim in creative circles—particularly after a series of posthumous album releases—and he developed a substantial cult following. In 2007 he was voted sixth on [[Channel 4]]'s list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics,&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and rose to number four on the 2010 list.&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2010. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him thirteenth on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time]. Rollingstone.com, retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hicks was born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], the son of James Melvin "Jim" Hicks (1923–2006) and Mary Reese Hicks, the younger sibling of Lynn and Steve. The family lived in Florida, [[Alabama]], and [[New Jersey]] before settling in [[Houston]], Texas, when Bill was seven.&lt;ref name="Bill Hicks 2004"&gt;''Bill Hicks: Love All the People'' (Robinson Publishing, 2005), {{ISBN|978-1-84529-111-2}}, '''page #s?'''&lt;/ref&gt; He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating [[Woody Allen]] and [[Richard Pryor]], and writing routines with his friend Dwight Slade. At school he began performing comedy, mostly derivations of Woody Allen material, for his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks (Personal Life, Career)|url=http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career?iframe=true&amp;width=95%&amp;height=95%|publisher=bestcomedyonline|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At home, he would write his own one-liners and slide them under the bedroom door of his brother Steve, the only family member Bill respected, for his critical analysis. "Keep it up", Steve told him. "You're really good at this."&lt;ref&gt;True, C. ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story''. London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 2002. {{ISBN|0380803771}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Hicks began to mock his family's [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] religious beliefs. "We were Yuppie Baptists," he joked to the ''[[Houston Post]]'' in 1987. "We worried about things like, 'If you scratch your neighbor's Subaru, should you leave a note?'"&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father: {{quote|The elder Hicks would say, "I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God." And Bill would counter, "No it's not, Dad." "Well, I believe that it is." "Well," Bill replied, "you know, some people believe that they're Napoleon. That's fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but don't share them like they're the truth."&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hicks did not, however, reject spiritual ideology itself, and throughout his life he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] and other forms of spirituality. Over one [[Thanksgiving]] weekend he took Hicks and Dwight to a TM residence course in [[Galveston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = True | first= Cynthia |year =2002 | title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Paperbacks]] |isbn = 0380803771 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxa5uj95B84C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=bill+hicks+transcendental+meditation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QS8dUq_PG6iusATA1oHoBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bill%20hicks%20transcendental%20meditation&amp;f=false 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a [[psychoanalyst]] at age 17. According to Hicks, after the first group session the analyst took him aside and told him, "You can continue coming if you want to, but it's them, not you."&lt;ref name="Bill Hicks 2004" /&gt;

==Career==

===Beginnings===
Hicks was associated with the [[Texas Outlaw Comics]] group developed at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in Houston in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="wati1991"&gt;Staff report (April 18, 1991). 'Texas outlaw' fires from the lip. ''[[Washington Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas, Directors (2009). ''[[American: The Bill Hicks Story]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===California and New York===
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |title=Bill Hicks |first=Paul |last=Outhwaite |publisher=Bill Hicks family official site |accessdate=2014-04-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OgPQmr8H?url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However his career received another upturn in 1987, when he appeared on [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s ''Young Comedians Special''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arp|first1=Robert|title=The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game (Popular Culture and Philosophy #83)|date=2014|publisher=Open Court Pub Co|isbn=978-0812698541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|title=Bio|url=http://www.billhicks.com/bio.html|website=Arizona Bay Production Company, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the album ''Relentless'', he jokes that he quit using drugs because "once you've been taken aboard a [[UFO]], it's kind of hard to top that", although in his performances, he continued to extol the virtues of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and [[psilocybin mushroom|psychedelic mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sane Man'' and ''Rant in E Minor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually fell back to [[chain smoking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-hicks-mn0000077267/biography |title=Bill Hicks &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theme that would figure heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.

In 1988, Hicks signed on with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strongman|first1=Phil|title=Bill Hicks: 25 years on from the cult comedian's big break • The Register|url=https://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/19/feature_comedy_bill_hicks/|website=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the track "Modern Bummer" of his 1990 album ''[[Dangerous (Bill Hicks album)|Dangerous]]'', Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1989, he released his first video, ''Sane Man''; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-06-02/bill-hicks-sane-man/ |title=Bill Hicks ... Sane Man | first= Ken| last= Lieck | work=[[Austin Chronicle]] |date=June 2, 2000 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early fame===
[[File:Bill Hicks at the Laff Stop in Austin, Texas, 1991.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Hicks at the [[Laff Stop]] in Austin, Texas, 1991]]
In 1990, Hicks released his first album, ''Dangerous'', performed on the [[HBO]] special ''One Night Stand,'' and performed at [[Montreal]]'s ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' festival.&lt;ref name=official /&gt; He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London's West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks|url=http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|publisher=icomedytv|accessdate=July 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703084554/http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he returned to ''Just for Laughs'' and filmed his second video, ''Relentless.''

Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the ''Marble Head Johnson'' album in 1992 collaborating with Houston high school friend [[Kevin Booth]] and Austin Texas drummer Pat Brown. During the same year he toured the UK, where he recorded the ''Revelations'' video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billhicks.com/ |title=Flash Intro Page |publisher= Bill Hicks family official site |date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Channel 4]]. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, "It's Just a Ride." Also in that tour he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD entitled, ''Salvation.'' Hicks was voted "Hot Standup Comic" by ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone magazine]]'' in 1993. He moved to Los Angeles in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Hicks and Tool===
[[Progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a [[contact lens]] he had lost. Thousands of people complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html | title = It's Only a Ride: Bill Hicks Question &amp; Answer with Kevin Booth | publisher= FadeToBlack.com | author = Interview with Kevin Booth|accessdate = March 3, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050829101024/http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html |archivedate = August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Tool felt that they and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".&lt;ref name="austinkeenanhicks"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&amp;id=May_1997--The_Austin_Chronicle.html| title = Another Dead Hero

Both the [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] casing of the ''Ænima'' album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "[[Ænema]]" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's ''[[Arizona Bay]]'' album, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean. ''Ænima''{{'}}s final track, "[[Third Eye (song)|Third Eye]]" contains samples from Hicks's ''Dangerous'' and ''Relentless'' albums.&lt;ref name="austinkeenanhicks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ucdadvocate.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=f13de017-3fd8-4f74-9abd-9f3f54482961

An alternate version of the ''Ænima'' artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him "Another Dead Hero," and mentions of Hicks are found both in the [[liner notes]] and on the record.

===Censorship and aftermath===
In 1984, Hicks was invited to appear on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. [[NBC]] had a policy that no handicapped jokes could be aired on the show, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as "wheelchair."{{citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=Quotations must be verifiably attributed to a reliable source per MOS:QUOTE}}

On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on [[CBS]], where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast: until that point the only occasion where a comedian's entire routine was cut after taping.&lt;ref name=Lahr&gt;{{Cite news| authorlink = John Lahr|first = John|last= Lahr| title = The Goat Boy Rises| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all | work = [[The New Yorker]]|date=November 1, 1993| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430075226/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all | archivedate= April 30, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks' stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman's producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion]] movement, was unsuitable for broadcast.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way Hicks had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again.&lt;ref name= Lahr/&gt; Hicks was actively undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final Late Show appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman and most others outside of Hicks' immediate family, and died less than four months later.&lt;ref&gt;''True'', 2002, pp. 193–214)&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman finally aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. "It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill," he said, after the set aired, "because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Korn|first=Steven|title=David Letterman Airs the 'Lost' Bill Hicks Routine |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/02/03/david-letterman/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Letterman&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crosbie |first=Lynn |title=The Globe Review Column; Pop Rocks; A Pop-Culture Epiphany; David Letterman's Apology to Mary Hicks |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=February 3, 2009 |page=R1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Denis Leary===
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian [[Denis Leary]]. But in 1993, Hicks was angered by Leary's album ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'', which featured lines and subject matter similar to Hicks' routine.&lt;ref name="Outhwaite"&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt; Outhwaite, Paul (November 2003). One Consciousness: An Analysis of Bill Hicks's Comedy, 3rd edition, D.M. Productions. {{ISBN|0-9537461-3-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'' by [[Cynthia True]], upon hearing the album Bill was furious. "All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."&lt;ref name = "oouuos"/&gt; The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution| first=Kevin |last=Booth |first2= Michael|last2= Bertin| year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks's material as well as his persona and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archivedate = June 7, 2007| title = Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief

}}. .&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]] of Denis Leary, comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Roasting a Comic They Turn Up the Flames Gently| work=Boston Globe| url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archivedate=August 11, 2003| date=August 10, 2003| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding plagiarism is also mentioned in ''American Scream'':

{{quote|text=Leary was in Montreal hosting the "Nasty Show" at Club Soda, and Colleen [McGarr?] was coordinating the talent so she stood backstage and overheard Leary doing material incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial [[Jim Fixx]] joke: "[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens." When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks's material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word, and briskly left the dressing room.&lt;ref name = "oouuos"&gt;{{Cite book| first = Cynthia|last= True| title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story| year=2002| publisher=Harper Paperbacks| isbn=0-380-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Material and style==
Hicks's performance style was seen as a play on his audience's emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the [[existential]] nature of "accepted truth." One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (in order to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):
{{quote|Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ''[[Revelations (Bill Hicks)|Revelations]]'', London, 1993. The extract is part of the concluding track to the album, called "It's Just a Ride", in which he essentially outlines his world view.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American philosopher and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologist]] [[Terence McKenna]] was a frequent source of Hicks' most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; he infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna's "Stoned Ape" model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.&lt;ref name="McKenna2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKenna|first1=Terrence|title=Terrence Mckenna – The stoned ape theory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StonedApe1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks – The stoned ape- theory in 3 minutes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hreGAxAjt1c|website=YouTube.com|publisher=Anders Jacobsson|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |first= Bill |last= Hicks |authorlink= Bill Hicks |year= 1997 |origyear= November 1992 – December 1993 |title= [[Rant in E-Minor]] (CD and MP3) |time= 0:58 |chapter= Pt. 1: Ch. 2: Gifts of Forgiveness |at= Track 8 |publisher= [[Rykodisc]] |oclc= 38306915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Hicks's most quoted lines was delivered during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg ''I'm Sorry, Folks''). After a [[heckler]] repeatedly shouted "[[Free Bird#Legacy|Free Bird]]", Hicks screamed that "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!" Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased [[genocide]] against the whole of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;True, Cynthia, ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'', Pan Macmillan, 2008, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hound, Rufus, ''Stand-Up Put-Downs'', Random House, 2011, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hicks's routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a [[BBC]] interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals "to everyone", he said that such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, "We don't come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, "Gee, where do you go to think? I'll meet you there!" When asked whether there was a "half way" point between audience expectations and his own, he said: "but my way ''is'' half-way between, I mean, this is a night-club, and, you know, these are adults, and what do you expect?"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Bill, ''Love All the People: Letters, Lyrics, Routines'', Hachette UK, 2009, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks often discussed popular [[conspiracy theories]] in his performances, most notably the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He mocked the [[Warren Report]] and the official version of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as a "lone nut assassin." He also questioned the guilt of [[David Koresh]] and the [[Branch Davidian]] compound during the [[Waco Siege]]. Hicks would end some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock "assassination" of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.

==Cancer diagnosis==
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] that had spread to his liver.&lt;ref name="hicks-lastword"&gt;{{cite web| first = Bill|last= Hicks| title = Last Word| url = http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html| publisher= Bill Hicks| work=Bill Hicks family official site | accessdate = June 5, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070521205803/http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html |archivedate = May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He started receiving weekly [[chemotherapy]], while still touring and also recording his album, ''Arizona Bay'', with Booth. He was also working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, entitled ''Counts of the Netherworld'' for Channel 4 at the time of his death. The budget and concept had been approved, and a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was filmed. The ''Counts of the Netherworld'' pilot was shown at the various Tenth Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. After being diagnosed with cancer, Hicks would often joke that any given performance could be his last; the public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at [[Caroline's]] in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents' house in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas, shortly thereafter. He called his friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html|title=Bio|publisher=Arizona Production Company, Inc.|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks died from the effects of pancreatic cancer on Saturday, February 26, 1994 in Little Rock at the age of 32.&lt;ref name="bbc-tenyearson"&gt;{{Cite news

In early 1995 his family released a brief essay that Hicks had written a week prior to his death:

{{quote|text=I was born William Melvin Hicks on December 16, 1961 in Valdosta, Georgia. Ugh. Melvin Hicks from Georgia. Yee Har! I already had gotten off to life on the wrong foot. I was always "awake," I guess you'd say. Some part of me clamoring for new insights and new ways to make the world a better place. All of this came out years down the line, in my multitude of creative interests that are the tools I now bring to the Party. Writing, acting, music, comedy. A deep love of literature and books. Thank God for all the artists who've helped me. I'd read these words and off I went – dreaming my own imaginative dreams. Exercising them at will, eventually to form bands, comedy, more bands, movies, anything creative. This is the coin of the realm I use in my words – Vision. On June 16, 1993 I was diagnosed with having "liver cancer that had spread from the pancreas." One of life's weirdest and worst jokes imaginable. I'd been making such progress recently in my attitude, my career and realizing my dreams that it just stood me on my head for a while. "Why me!?" I would cry out, and "Why now!?" Well, I know now there may never be any answers to those particular questions, but maybe in telling a little about myself, we can find some other answers to other questions. That might help our way down our own particular paths, towards realizing my dream of New Hope and New Happiness. Amen. I left in love, in laughter, and in truth and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.&lt;ref name = "hicks-lastword"/&gt;}}

==Legacy==
His albums ''Arizona Bay'' and ''[[Rant in E-Minor]]'' were released posthumously in 1997 on the Voices imprint of the [[Rykodisc]] label. ''Dangerous'' and ''[[Relentless (Bill Hicks album)|Relentless]]'' were re-released simultaneously.

In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, comedians and comedy insiders voted Hicks 13th on their list of "The Top 20 Greatest Comedy Acts Ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's outlaw comic|url=http://socialistworker.org/print/2011/07/25/americas-outlaw-comic|work=Socialist Worker|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" (2004), Hicks was ranked 19th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comedy Central|title=Comedy Central 100 Greatest Standups of all Time|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|accessdate=2013-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125061218/http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time|archive-date=November 25, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, he was voted sixth on Britain's Channel 4 list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics, and rose to number four on the 2010 list.&lt;ref name="Channel 4"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups | title = 100 Greatest Comedy Stand-ups vote from channel4.com | publisher = Channel 4 | accessdate = March 19, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100115143332/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-stand-ups/ | archive-date = January 15, 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees have incorporated Hicks's words, image, and attitude into their own creations. By means of [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], fragments of his rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of [[Super Furry Animals]]' "[[The Man Don't Give a Fuck]]" and [[Adam Freeland]]'s "[[We Want Your Soul]]". His influence on the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] is well documented as he is sampled at the beginning of their song "[[Third Eye (song)|Third Eye]]"; he "appears" on the [[Fila Brazillia]] album ''[[Maim That Tune]]'' (1995) and on [[SPA (band)|SPA's]] eponymously entitled album ''[[SPA (album)|SPA]]'' (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; the British band [[Radiohead]]'s second album ''[[The Bends]]'' (1995) is also dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00206-radiohead-part-2-by-andrew-mueller |title=Radiohead Part II: On The Road With The Mercury Prize Nominees|last=Mueller |first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Mueller|date=July 24, 2008|work=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; American indie rock band [[Built to Spill]]'s song "Planting Seeds" on its 2009 album ''[[There Is No Enemy]]'' alludes to Hicks's routine on advertising and marketing, which appears on the performance film ''Bill Hicks: Revelations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bould|first=Chris|title=Bill Hicks: Revelations|date=September 14, 1993|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152183/|accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer/songwriter [[Tom Waits]] listed ''Rant in E-Minor'' as one of his 20 most cherished albums of all time.&lt;ref name="guardian-tomwaits"&gt;{{Cite news| date = March 20, 2005| authorlink = Tom Waits|last=Waits|first=Tom| title = What the stars are listening to: 'It's perfect madness'| url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/20/popandrock1| quote = Bill Hicks, blowtorch, excavator, truthsayer and brain specialist, like a reverend waving a gun around.| work = The Observer| publisher = The Guardian

The British actor [[Chas Early]] portrayed Hicks in the one-man stage show ''Bill Hicks: Slight Return'', which premiered in 2004. The show was co-written by [[Chas Early]] and [[Richard Hurst]], and imagined Hicks's view of the world 10 years after his death.

Hicks is mentioned in the 1999 British film ''[[Human Traffic]]''. In the movie, the young and hip club-going protagonist, "Jip" praises Hicks as an alternative thinker, and explains that he needs to get a regular infusion of Hicks's insights. Before leaving his house to start on the movie's main adventure, Jip states: "...first a daily injection of the late prophet Bill Hicks... just to remind me not to take life too seriously." He then watches a clip of one of Hicks's rants about drugs, and how they had never affected him badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=human-traffic|title=Human Traffic (1999) Movie Script – SS|author=|date=|website=Springfield!

On February 25, 2004, British [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Stephen Pound]] tabled an [[early day motion]] entitled "Anniversary of the Death of Bill Hicks" (EDM 678 of the 2003–04 session), the text of which reads:
{{quote|text=That this [[British House of Commons|House]] notes with sadness the 10th anniversary of the death of Bill Hicks, on 26th February 1994, at the age of {{sic|33}}; recalls his assertion that his words would be a bullet in the heart of consumerism, capitalism and the [[American Dream]]; and mourns the passing of one of the few people who may be mentioned as being worth of inclusion with [[Lenny Bruce]] in any list of unflinching and painfully honest political philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2003-04/678 | title=Anniversary of the death of Bill Hicks | publisher=Parliamentary Information Management Services | accessdate=March 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Counselor Education''' is a field focused on the preparation of students to professionally apply the theory and principles of guidance and counseling for the personal, social, educational, and vocational development of others.&lt;ref&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88130&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of counselor education is the training and preparation of professional counselors; this includes recruiting and training the future generations of academic professionals who will teach the curriculum of counseling theory and practice.  

In order to acquire licensure, counselors are generally required to complete an accredited graduate program along with a minimum number of documented hours in supervised clinical fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinecounselingprograms.com/become-a-counselor/&lt;/ref&gt; Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Rehabilitation Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The National Council on Rehabilitation Education.

Scholarship within counselor education centers on the training and education of master's or doctoral-level counseling graduate students, novel applications of counseling theory including competencies across cultural groups, and best practice guidelines in both academic and clinical or applied settings. Counselor educators as a professional group are trained in multiple methodological approaches to research including both qualitative and quantitative methods.

'''Damin''' ''(Demiin'' in the practical orthography of Lardil) was a [[sacred language|ceremonial language]] [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] used by the advanced initiated men of the aboriginal [[Lardil language|Lardil]] (''Leerdil'' in the practical orthography) and the [[Yangkaal language|Yangkaal]] peoples of Australia. Both inhabit islands in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], the Lardil on [[Mornington Island]], the largest island of the Wesley Group, and the Yangkaal on the Forsyth Islands. Their languages belong to the same [[language family|family]], the [[Tankic languages]]. Lardil is the most divergent of the Tankic languages, while the others are mutually comprehensible with Yangkaal.

The Lardil word ''Demiin'' can be translated as ''being silent''.

== Ceremonies ==

The Lardil had two initiation ceremonies for men, namely ''[[luruku ceremony|luruku]]'', which involved [[circumcision]], and ''[[warama ceremony|warama]]'', which involved [[penile subincision]]. There were no ceremonies for women, although women did play an important role in these ceremonies, especially in the luruku ceremony.

It is sometimes said that Damin was a secret language, but this is misleading since there was no attempt to prevent the uninitiated members of the Leerdil tribe from overhearing it. However it was taught during the ''warama'' ceremony and, therefore, in isolation from the uninitiated. At least one elder is known, who, though not having been subincised, had an excellent command of Damin, but this seems to have been a unique case.

Damin lexical words were organised into semantic fields and shouted out to the initiate in a single session. As each word was announced, a second speaker gave its Lardil equivalent. However, it normally took several sessions before a novice mastered the basics and could use Damin openly in the community. One speaker did claim to have learned to speak Damin in a single session, but on the other hand two senior ''warama'' men admitted that they lacked a firm command of the register.

Once Damin had been learned, the speakers were known as ''Demiinkurlda'' ("Damin possessors"). They spoke the register particularly in ritual contexts, but also in everyday secular life, when foraging, sitting about gossiping, and the like.

== Linguistic features ==

Damin is the only [[click consonant|click]] language outside [[Africa]].

Damin had a much more restricted and generic lexicon than everyday language. With only about 150 lexical roots, each word in Damin stood for several words of Lardil or Yangkaal. It had only two pronouns (''n!a'' "me" (ego) and ''n!u'' "not me" (alter)), for example, compared to Lardil's nineteen, and had an [[antonym]]ic prefix ''kuri-'' (''jijuu'' "small", ''kurijijuu'' "large").

Grammatically, the Damin registers of the Lardil and Yangkaal use all the grammatical morphology of those languages, and so therefore are broadly similar, though it does not employ the phonologically conditioned alternations of that morphology.

===Phonology===
Damin words have three of [[Lardil language|Lardil]]'s four pairs of vowels, {{IPA|[a, aː, i, iː, u, uː]}}; the fourth, {{IPA|[ə, əː]}}, occurs in grammatical suffixes. Vowel length is not contrastive, but depends on the preceding consonant. Damin uses only some of the ([[pulmonic egressive|pulmonic]]) consonants of everyday Lardil, but they are augmented by four other [[airstream mechanism]]s: [[lingual ingressive]] (the nasal clicks), [[glottalic egressive]] (a velar ejective), [[pulmonic ingressive]] (an indrawn lateral fricative), and [[lingual egressive]] (a bilabial 'spurt'). Even some of the pulmonic egressive consonants are exotic for the Australian context: fricatives, voiceless nasals, and bilabial trills.  The consonants of Damin, in the practical orthography and [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents, are:&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hale and David Nash, 1997. Lardil and Damin Phonotactics, pp.247-259 in ''Boundary Rider: Essays in honour of Geoffrey O'Grady,'' ed. by [[Darrell Tryon]] &amp; Michael Walsh. Pacific Linguistics C-136.&lt;br&gt;The IPA is not clear. For example, ''jj'' is described as alternatively a voiced fricative, but transcribed as a voiceless fricative {{IPA|[ʆ]}}, an obsolete variant of {{IPA|[ɕ]}}. Other transcriptions are apparently wrong, such as transcribing supposedly apical ''rn!'' as laminal {{IPA|[ⁿǂ]}}. ''p' ''has dual transcriptions {{IPA|[pʼ, ʘ↑]}}, suggesting it might be pronounced as either an ejective or a spurt, though this is not mentioned in the text.&lt;/ref&gt;

§ These sounds are found in standard Lardil, but not in Damin, apart from grammatical words and suffixes.

''L*'' is described as "ingressive with egressive glottalic release".

There is no alveolar&amp;ndash;retroflex distinction in Damin, with the possible exception of the clicks. (This distinction is neutralized word-initially in Lardil, as it is in most Australian languages.) However, Hale notes that the Damin alveolar and retroflex clicks (found in the pronouns ''n!aa, n!uu'' and in ''rn!aa, rn!ii'' respectively) might be in complementary distribution, and it is not clear that they are distinct sounds.

Some of the consonants listed above only occur in clusters. {{IPA|/n̺/}} only occurs as a coda. A derivational rule seems to be to pronounce all onset nasals as clicks; it is likely that {{IPA|/ŋ/}} is not a click because a [[velar click]] in the straightforward sense is not possible.

====Phonotactics====
Damin consonant clusters at the beginning of a word are ''p'ny'' {{IPA|[ʘ↑n̠ʲ]}}, ''p'ng'' {{IPA|[ʘ↑ŋ]}}, ''fny'' {{IPA|[ɸn̠ʲ]}}, ''fng'' {{IPA|[ɸŋ]}}, ''fy'' {{IPA|[ɸj]}}, ''prpry'' {{IPA|[ʙ\ʙj]}}, ''thrr'' {{IPA|[t̻ɾ]}}. Words in normal Lardil may not begin with a cluster. However, Lardil has several clusters in the middle of words, and many of these are not found in Damin words, as Damin only allows ''n'' {{IPA|[n̺]}} and ''rr'' {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in a syllable coda. (The attested stem
medial Damin clusters are ''rrd, rrth, rrk, rrb, jb'' (Hale &amp; Nash 1997: 255), though ''j'' of ''jb'' is supposedly not allowed in that position. Other clusters, such as nasal&amp;ndash;stop, are produced by Lardil grammatical suffixes.)

Hale &amp; Nash posit that Damin syllables (not counting codas) may only be CVV or CCV. Purported CV syllables are restricted to C = {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, {{IPA|[ŋ̊]}}, {{IPA|[ɬ↓ʔ]}}, suggesting that these are underlyingly iterated consonants. Hale suggests they might be ''k2, ng2, l2'' {{IPA|/kk, ŋŋ, ll/}} (rather as {{IPA|[ɕ]}} is a realization of ''j2'' {{IPA|/t̠ʲt̠ʲ/}}) and also that ''thrr'' {{IPA|[t̻ɾ]}} might be ''d2'' {{IPA|/t̺t̺/}}. (Note that transcription of vowel length is inconsistent, and the vocabulary given above does not follow these patterns.)

No consonant occurs before all three vowels.&lt;ref&gt;unless the retroflex click is an allophone of the alveolar click&lt;/ref&gt; Known sequences are as follows. Note however that with only 150 roots in Damin, and several consonants and consonant clusters attested from only a single root, there are certain to be accidental gaps in this list.

====Samples and vocabulary====
Damin is spoken by replacing the lexical roots of ordinary Lardil with Damin words. Apart from a leveling of grammatical allomorphs, the grammar remains the same. For example,

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Ordinary Lardil
|ngithun||dunji-kan||ngawa||waang-kur||werneng-kiyath-ur.
|-
!gloss
|my||wife's.younger.brother-{{sc|gen}}&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of glossing abbreviations]] to explain abbreviations in small caps.&lt;/ref&gt;||dog||go-{{sc|fut}}||food-{{sc|go-fut}}
|-
!translation
|colspan=5| My brother-in-law's dog is going to go hunting.
|-
!Damin
|n!aa||n!2a-kan||nh!2u||tiitith-ur||m!ii-ngkiyath-ur.
|}

Some vocabulary:&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Nash 1997: 248&amp;ndash;249&lt;/ref&gt;
:''n!aa'' 'ego', ''n!uu'' 'alter'
:''kaa'' 'now', ''kaawi'' 'not now'
:''l*i(i)'' 'bony fish', ''thii'' 'elasmobranch'
:''ngaajpu'' 'human', ''wuujpu'' 'animal', ''wiijpu'' 'wood' (incl. woody plants), ''kuujpu'' 'stone'
:''m!ii'' 'vegetable food', ''wii'' 'meat/food',&lt;ref&gt;more generally, any amorphous food; also food in the abstract&lt;/ref&gt; ''n!2u'' 'liquid', ''thuu'' 'sea mammal', ''thuuwu'' 'land mammal'
:''didi'' 'harm (affect harmfully)', ''diidi'' 'act', ''kuudi'' 'see', ''kuuku'' 'hear, feel', ''yiidi'' 'be (in a place)', ''wiiwi'' 'burn', ''wiidi'' 'spear', ''ngaa'' 'die, decay', ''fyuu'' 'fall; the cardinal directions'
:''n!aa thuuku'' 'point on body', ''wii'' 'surface on body', ''nguu'' 'head', ''k'uu'' 'eye', ''nguuwii'' 'hand, foot'
:''thuuku'' 'one, another; place', ''kurrijpi'' 'two; hither, close; short'

Antonymic derivation with ''kurri-'':
:''j2iwu'' 'small', ''kurrij2iwu'' 'large'
:''thuuku'' 'one', ''kurrithuuku'' 'many'
:''kurrijpi'' 'short', ''kurrikurrijpi'' 'long'
:''kawukawu'' 'light', ''kurrikawukawu'' 'heavy'

Specific reference requires paraphrasing. For example, a sandpiper is called a 'person-burning creature' (''ngaajpu wiiwi-n wuujpu'' human burn-{{sc|nom}} animal) in reference to its role as a character in the Rainbow Serpent Story, while a wooden axe is 'wood that (negatively) affects honey' (''m!iwu didi-i-n wiijpu'' honey affect-{{sc|pass-nom}} wood'')

There is some suggestion of internal morphology or compounding, as suggested by the patterns in the word list above. For example, ''m!iwu'' '(native) beehive, honey' and ''wum!i'' 'sp. mud crab' may derive from ''m!ii'' 'food' and ''wuu'' 'mud shell clam'.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

==The origin of Damin ==

The origin of Damin is unclear. The Lardil and the Yangkaal say that Damin was created by a mythological figure in [[Dreamtime]]. Hale and colleagues believe that it was invented by Lardil elders; it has several aspects found in [[language game]]s around the world, such as turning nasal occlusives such as ''m'' and ''n'' into [[nasal click]]s, doubling consonants, and the like. Evans and colleagues, after studying the mythology of both tribes, speculate that it was the Yangkaal elders who invented Damin and passed it to the Lardil.

==Current situation==
The cultural traditions of the Lardil and Yangkaal have been in decline for several decades, and the Lardil and Yangkaal languages are nearly extinct. The last ''warama'' ceremony was held in the 1950s, so nowadays Damin is no longer in use by either the Yangkaal or the Lardil. However, recently a revival of cultural traditions has begun, and ''luruku'' has been celebrated. It remains to be seen whether ''warama'' ceremonies will also be reactivated.

[[File:Melkor and Sauron.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Depiction of the Dark Lord, [[Morgoth]] (left), and [[Sauron]]]]
In fiction, '''Dark Lord''' (or '''Evil Overlord''') is often used to refer to a powerful [[villain]] or [[antagonist]] with evil [[henchman|henchmen]]. In particular, it is used as a moniker in fictional worlds where it is thought that pronouncing the villain's real name will bring bad luck or represents a bad omen. Such a villain usually seeks to rule or destroy the people around them (such as Voldemort in Harry Potter, Sauron in Lord of the Rings etc)

==In religion==
In a religious context, Dark Lord usually means [[Satan]] or other similar entities who hold power over lesser fiendish creatures and seek to disrupt the comfort and lives of people. 

==In fiction==
===Literature===
In [[fantasy]] novels, Dark Lords have become something of a [[cliché]] stemming from the success of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in which the main antagonist, [[Sauron]], is often referred to as the "Dark Lord". On occasion, the people of [[Gondor]] in [[Middle-earth]] refer to Sauron as "The Enemy" or "The Nameless Enemy" despite knowing his real name; arguably starting the practice of avoiding pronouncing a Dark Lord's actual name. In fact the name Sauron, meaning the Abhorred, itself is already a mockery of his actual name given him by his enemies,  with  his original name being Mairon, the Admirable. He was known by this name before joining Morgoth's forces,  and continued calling himself Mairon. In [[Tolkien's legendarium]], Sauron is the second Dark Lord; he was the lieutenant of the first Dark Lord, [[Morgoth]] (also a title or epithet meaning "dark enemy"), until the latter's defeat. Morgoth's original name was Melkor (''he who arises in might'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Silmarillion'', J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the example of Sauron, Dark Lords in fantasy are always depicted as immensely powerful and implacably [[evil]] creatures with a great desire for power. One example of a powerful Dark Lord in the world of literature is the Dark Wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] from [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels, earning his place as a Dark Lord having surpassed the magical abilities of any other dark wizard before him, thus he is considered not a Dark Wizard but the first and only Dark Lord within the Harry Potter franchise, being so powerful and evil that his enemies even dreaded to speak his name. Dark Lords have a negative effect in their worlds, throwing them into ruin and despair. Sauron, for example, turned [[Mordor]] into a "wasteland where the very air saps one's will". He planned to do the same to all of Middle-earth. Dark Lords have mostly been male, with few exceptions such as the [[White Witch]] from ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', who casts the world into an eternal winter but never Christmas.

===Film===
Dark Lord characters do not often engage in direct conflict with protagonists. They are dark [[Deity|god]]s, [[demon]]s or rulers of lands who exist in other [[dimension]]s, and/or maintain a dark, inaccessible fortress. They rely on a vast network of minions, often with an extremely hierarchical structure. In ''[[Star Wars]]'', "Dark Lord" is a rank achieved by those who become [[Sith|Sith Lords]] as in the "Dark Lord of the Sith". The most recognized Dark Lords of Star Wars are [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]], [[Darth Maul]], [[Count Dooku|Darth Tyranus]] and [[Darth Vader]].

===Internet===
The frequency in which the Dark Lord cliche occurs spawned the [[Evil Overlord List]], a website satirizing the mistakes of Dark Lords and major villains. Frequently, antagonists in fiction will display numerous Dark Lord mannerisms while belonging to another genre of the fictional villain, and some pertain to more than one genre. An example is [[Davros]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', whose position as the creator of the [[Dalek]]s and later ruler of their empire marks him both as a Dark Lord and a [[mad scientist]].

===Comics===
In comics, villains are usually considered Dark Lords either by the format of the story in which the villain appears or because of the villain’s [[modus operandi]]. For example, [[Ming the Merciless]], [[Thanos]] and [[Darkseid]] are alien despots and could fall under the category of alien invaders. However, they exist within stories of such operatic nature, with elements of swashbuckling adventure and mythological analogy, that they are considered specifically to be Dark Lords. Alternatively, comic book villains [[Kingpin (comics)|The Kingpin]] and the 1990-era [[Lex Luthor]] could be considered modern-day versions of a Dark Lord, but more closely fall under the categories of a crime lord or a mad scientist, respectively. This is mostly due to these characters traditionally seeking a public identity as a businessman or a philanthropist, while keeping their criminal activities secret. This is at odds with one of the hallmarks of a Dark Lord, which is that they act from or deliberately seek out a position of legal authority, albeit often self-appointed, and even their most nefarious deeds are often performed publicly.

===Television===
A recent example can be found on the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', where the title "The Dark One" identifies someone with prolific magical powers whose life and powers are bound to a dagger bearing their name as an inscription. Whoever possesses the dagger can control the Dark One, but if they kill the Dark One with it, they become the new Dark One themselves. In this series, the first Dark One was Nimue the lover of Merlin. For 1000 years the Dark Ones have terrorized the people of the enchanted forest leading up to the current Dark One, Rumplestiltskin/[[Mr. Gold]].

===Video games===
Many fantasy games, as well as some of the science fiction genre, feature a Dark Lord who rules over one faction in the game. While this character is often the antagonist and final boss, some RPGs, such as [[Dark Souls]], allows the player to earn this title for themselves. As this would often make the player character be in-charge of the game's hordes of enemies the moniker is usually granted at one of multiple endings. In order to make sequel games, this is often considered the non-canon ending, as in [[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]], but some games, like [[Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain]], use this ending to turn the powered up anti-hero into the series' new antagonist.

==Notable examples==

* [[Arawn Death-Lord]] from ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]''
* Black Doom from ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]''
* Dark Lord from ''[[Flint the Time Detective]]''

{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{History of India}}}}
The '''Durrani dynasty''' ({{lang-ps|د درانيانو کورنۍ}}) was founded in 1747 by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]. He united the different [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribes and created the [[Durrani Empire]] with his [[Baloch people|Baloch]] allies,&lt;ref name="Naseer Dashti 280"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naseer Dashti|title=The Baloch and Balochistan: A Historical Account from the Beginning to the Fall of the Baloch State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0Jg3q33mkgC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=8 October 2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-5897-5|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; which at its peak included the modern-day Afghanistan, [[Pakistan]], as well as some parts of northeastern [[Iran]], eastern [[Turkmenistan]], and northwestern [[India]] including the [[Kashmir]] region.&lt;ref name="Naseer Dashti 280"/&gt;
The [[Durrani]]s were replaced by the [[Barakzai dynasty]] during the early half of the 19th century.

Ahmad Shah and his descendants were from the [[Sadduzai]] line of the Durranis (formerly known as ''Abdalis''), making them the second Pashtun rulers of Kandahar after the [[Hotak dynasty]].&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; The Durranis were very notable in the second half of the 18th century mainly due to the leadership of Ahmad Shah Durrani.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

==Start of the dynasty==
{{stack|[[File:Portrait of Ahmad Shah Durrani.jpg|thumb|upright|Ahmad Shah Durrani founder of Durrani dynasty]] }}
{{Main|Ahmad Shah Durrani}}
[[Nader Shah]]'s rule ended in June 1747 after being murdered by his [[Persian people|Persian]] soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Afghans |last1=Vogelsang |first1=Willem |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=|isbn=978-0-631-19841-3|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1747, when the chiefs of the Afghans met at a [[loya jirga]] (grand council) in Kandahar to select a new ruler for the Abdali confederation, the young 25-year-old Ahmad Khan was chosen. Despite being younger than other claimants, Ahmad Khan had several overriding factors in his favour:
*He was a direct descendant of Asadullah Khan, patriarch of the Sadozai clan, the most prominent tribe amongst the Pashtun people at the time;
*He was unquestionably a charismatic leader and seasoned warrior who had at his disposal a trained, mobile force of 4,000 loyal cavalrymen;&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/21396/The-Durrani-dynasty |title=The Durrani dynasty |accessdate=2010-08-25 |work=Louis Dupree, Nancy Hatch Dupree and others |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Not least, he possessed a substantial part of Nadir Shah's treasury, including the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond.
One of Ahmad Khan's first acts as chief was to adopt the title ''[[Padshah]] durr-i durrān'' (King, "pearl of the age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Afghans |last1=Vogelsang |first1=Willem |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=|isbn=978-0-631-19841-3|page=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "pearl of pearls").&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; The name may have been suggested, as some claim, from a dream, or as others claim, from the pearl earrings worn by the royal guard of Nadir Shah. The Abdali Pashtuns were known thereafter as the Durrani, and the name of the Abdali confederation was changed to Durrani.

Ahmad Shah began his campaign by capturing [[Ghazni]] from the [[Ghilji]] Pashtuns, and then wresting Kabul from the local ruler. In 1749, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh Province|Sindh]], the [[Punjab region]] and the important trans [[Indus River]] to Ahmad Shah in order to save his capital from Afghan attack. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah turned westward to take possession of [[Herat Province|Herat]], which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shahrukh Afshar|Shah Rukh of Persia]]. Herat fell to Ahmad after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict, as did [[Mashad]] (in present-day Iran). Ahmad Shah next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah invaded the remnants of the Mughal Empire a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the Punjab and Kashmir regions. Then, early in 1757, he sacked [[Delhi]], but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]] to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left [[Hindustan]] (India) to return to Afghanistan.

Alarmed by the expansion of China's [[Qing Dynasty]] up to the western border of Kazakhstan, Ahmad Shah attempted to rally neighbouring Muslim khanates and the Kazakhs to unite and attack China, ostensibly to liberate its western Muslim subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Holy war in China: the Muslim rebellion and state in Chinese Central Asia, 1864–1877 |last1=Kim |first1=Ho-dong |authorlink=|volume=|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press |location=|isbn=978-0-8047-4884-1 |page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to [[Kokand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire and the Khanate: a political history of Qing relations with Khoqand c. 1760–1860 |last1=Newby |first1=Laura J. |authorlink=|volume=|year=2005|publisher=BRILL |location=|isbn=978-90-04-14550-4 |page=34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah lacked sufficient resources to do anything except to send envoys to Beijing for unsuccessful talks.

===Forming a nation and start of struggles with warring neighbours===

The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], who died in 1707; In 1751–52, ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and [[Mughals]], when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]].&lt;ref name="Panipat"&gt;Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.&lt;ref name=K.RoyIHB&gt;{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80–1 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] declared a [[jihad]] (or Islamic holy war) against the Marathas, and warriors from various Pashtun tribes and 25,000 [[Baloch people|Baloch]] warriors joined his army under the command of [[Khan of Kalat]] Mir [[Noori Naseer Khan Baloch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uob.edu.pk/journals/TREATY%20OF%20KALAT%201758%20BETWEEN%20QANDHAR%20AND%20KALAT%20AND%20ITS%20IMPACTS.pdf Treaty of Kalat between Balochistan and Afghanistan in 1758]&lt;/ref&gt; Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the [[Afghans]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of [[northern India]]. The [[Third Battle of Panipat]] (January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely [[Hinduism|Hindu]] armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising [[Sikh]] [[misls]]. There were rebellions in the north in the region of [[Bukhara]].
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.]]
The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah. The Durrani was the second largest Islamic empire in the world, behind the [[Ottoman Empire]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bijanomrani.com/?p=afgan_search_unit Afghanistan and the Search for Unity]" [[Bijan Omrani|Omrani, Bijan]], published in ''Asian Affairs'', Volume 38, Issue 2, 2007, pp. 145–157.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. He assaulted Lahore and, after taking their holy city of [[Amritsar]], massacred thousands of Sikh inhabitants, destroying their revered [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]]. Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again and rebuilt their holy city of Amritsar. Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed.

In early 1771, ten years after the collapse of Maratha supremacy in north India in the Third Battle of Panipat, [[Marathas]] under [[Mahadji Shinde]] recaptured Delhi and restored the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] to the throne in 1772. Ahmad Shah also faced other rebellions in the north, and eventually he and the Uzbek Emir of [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]] agreed that the Amu Darya would mark the division of their lands. Ahmad Shah retired to his home in the mountains east of Kandahar, where he died on 14 April 1773.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside Afghanistan: end of the Taliban era? |last1=Reddy |first1=L.

By the time of Ahmad Shah's ascendancy, the Pashtuns included many groups whose origins were obscure; most were believed to have descended from ancient [[Aryan]] tribes. They had in common, however, their [[Pashto language]]. To the east, the [[Wazir (Tribe)|Waziris]] and their close relatives, the [[Mahsud]]s, had lived in the hills of the central [[Sulaiman Mountains]] since the 14th century. By the end of the 16th century and the final [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] invasions, tribes such as the [[Shinwari tribe|Shinwaris]], [[Yousafzai|Yusufzais]], and [[Mohmand]]s had moved from the upper [[Kabul River]] Valley into the valleys and plains west, north, and northeast of [[Peshawar]]. The Afridis had long been established in the hills and mountain ranges south of the [[Khyber Pass]]. By the end of the 18th century, the Durranis had blanketed the area west and north of [[Kandahar Province]].&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

The main cause of the decline of the Durrani dynasty was the loss of thousands of battle hardened troops against the Marathas and relentless efforts of the Sikhs. Though Afghans defeated the Marathas decisively at the Third Battle of Panipat, there was a great loss of Durrani Empire's military power in the entire struggle. The Sikh [[misl]]s, after suffering at the hands of the Afghans initially, took an advantage of loosening Durrani control over Punjab due to weakening of power in the struggle against Marathas, rose into rebellion and eventually united under Ranjit Singh. They were able to re-capture Amritsar (1802), Ludhiana (1806), Multan, Kashmir, Ladakh, Peshawar, the Khyber Pass and Lahore. By the time Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire died, the Sikhs had taken Kashmir and the whole Punjab from the Afghans.

The 1837 [[Battle of Jamrud]] became the last confrontation between the Afghans and the Sikhs. [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] led an attack on the Sikhs in which he killed Sikh Commander [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] before returning to [[Kabul]].

| 1747–1772

During the war between [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and the Afghans, his father and grandfather were both killed in a battle, and the young Ahmad Khan fled south to take refuge in [[Old Kandahar|Kandahar]] with the [[Ghilji]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fall of the Mughal Empire, Volume 1, by Sir [[Jadunath Sarkar]] (1964), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; During his teenage years, Ahmad Khan and his elder brother, Zulfikar Khan, were imprisoned by [[Hussain Hotaki]], the last Ghilji ruler of the [[Hotaki dynasty]]. In 1738, during the [[Siege of Kandahar]], Ahmad Khan was released by [[Nader Shah]] of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and made to lead 4,000 Abdali soldiers. This was due to Ahmad Khan's family background and the fact that he and Nader Shah were both from the historical Khorasan region.
|-
| [[Timur Shah Durrani]]
| 1772–1793
| Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to insurgency. He proved an ineffectual ruler, during his reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani Empire.
|-
| [[Zaman Shah Durrani]]
| 1793–1801
| After the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the intervention of outside forces.

The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] became particularly troublesome, and after several unsuccessful efforts to subdue them, Zaman Shah made the mistake of appointing a forceful young Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], as his governor of the Punjab region. This "one-eyed" warrior would later become an implacable enemy of Pashtun rulers in Afghanistan.

Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.
|-
| [[Mahmud Shah Durrani]]
| 1801–1803
| Zeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by Shuja Shah.
|-
| [[Shuja Shah Durrani]]
| 1803–1809
| Yet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On 7 June 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a European power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839–1842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.
|-
| Mahmud Shah Durrani
| 1809–1818 (second reign)
| Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].
|-
| [[Ali Shah Durrani]]
| 1818–1819
| Ali Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818–19.
|-
| [[Ayub Shah Durrani]]
| 1819–1823
| Ayub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.
|-
| Shuja Shah Durrani
| 1839–1842 (second reign)
| He was declared as Amir with help and support from the British but was deposed by [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] in 1842.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3682">'''Elastic scoring''' is a style of [[orchestration]] or music [[arrangement]] that was first used by the Australian [[composer]] [[Percy Grainger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Bird|title=Percy Grainger|page=224|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|origyear=1982|edition=2nd illustrated, revised|isbn=0-19-816652-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
This technique of orchestration is used to provide composers with the option of allowing a diverse group of voices or instrumentalists the ability to perform their music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11596 ""Grainger, Percy."] by [[Malcolm Gillies]] and David Pear, [[Grove Music Online]] {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this is when a composer or arranger provides extra [[sheet music]] parts so a [[flute]] quartet (four flutes) can play the same piece as a group comprising two flutes, alto flute and [[bass flute]], resulting a choir-like sound. In other words, a subtle re-engineering of the original work.

This technique involves making extra and/or interchangeable musical parts which provide substitutions for more or fewer musicians depending on what is required for an individual performance. This also allows a musical work to be played in smaller communities where the required instruments may not always be available.

One of the main tenets of elastic scoring is that the new arrangement preserve as much as possible the original [[Interval (music)|interval]] relationship (to the closest [[octave]]) between notes while not being overly concerned with [[timbre]] (tone colour) or number of instruments. Timbre is the [[aspect of music]] varied most through changing instrument or number of instruments.

==Techniques==
Besides providing alternative instrumentation in the form of sheet music parts, the elastic scoring concept allows three subsets of scoring music.

===Lateral scoring===
Lateral scoring can be said to have occurred when a piece of music is set for one or more instruments from the original number of instruments. An example of this is if a piece of music set for flute and piano is re-scored for [[clarinet]] and piano. In this instance, the intervallic relationships remain the same, but the tone colour has changed.

===Expansion scoring===
Expansion scoring is a style of arranging or orchestration that lets composers and arrangers enlarge the original work from a smaller score to a larger one. An example of this is when a [[string quartet]] is expanded to become a piece for [[string orchestra]].

===Contraction scoring===
Contraction scoring lets composers and arrangers reduce the original work from a larger score to a smaller score, such as when an orchestral work is reduced to [[piano]] part. The resulting piano score is more commonly known as a [[reduction (music)|piano reduction]].

==Composers/Arrangers who use elastic scoring==

The '''flag of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos vėliava}}) consists of a horizontal [[Triband (flag)|tricolor]] of [[yellow]], [[green]], and [[red]]. It was adopted on 25 April 1918 during [[Lithuania]]'s first period of independence (in the 20th century) from 1918 to 1940, which ceased with the occupation first by Soviet Russia and Lithuania's annexation into the [[Soviet Union]], and then by [[Nazi Germany]] (1941–1944). During the post-World War II Soviet occupation, from 1945 until 1989, the [[Flag of the Lithuanian SSR|Soviet Lithuanian flag]] consisted first of a generic red [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with the name of the republic, then changed to the red flag with [[white]] and green bars at the bottom. 

The flag was then re-adopted on 20 March 1989, almost a year before the [[Act of March 11|re-establishment of Lithuania's independence]] and almost three years before the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. The last alteration to the current flag occurred in 2004, when the [[aspect ratio]] changed from 1:2 to 3:5.

== History ==
[[File:Alex K Grundwald flags 1410-03.svg|thumb|Battle flag with the [[Vytis]], 1410, reconstruction]]
[[File:Flag of Lithuania 1918-1940.svg|thumb|National flag (1918–1940)]]

=== Historical state flag ===
The earliest known flags with a Lithuanian identity were recorded in the 15th-century ''[[Banderia Prutenorum]]'', written by [[Jan Długosz]]. At the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, two distinct flags were present. The majority of the 40 regiments carried a red banner depicting a [[Pahonia|mounted knight in pursuit]]. This flag, known as the ''[[Vytis]]'', would eventually be used as the Lithuanian war flag, and again in 2004 as the state flag. 
The remainder of the regiments carried a red banner displaying the [[Columns of Gediminas]]. Those that bore the Vytis, also known as the [[Coat of arms of Pogoń Litewska|Pahonia]], were armies from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while those who bore the Columns of Gediminas were from [[Nobility in Lithuania|noble families]] of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when it [[Partitions of Poland|was annexed by the Russian Empire]], the Grand Duchy of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www3.lrs.lt/home/w5_viewer/statiniai/seimu_istorija/w5_show-p_r=4056&amp;p_d=49324&amp;p_k=2.html Seimas of Lithuania - History of the National Flag]. Retrieved 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of modern flag ===
The birth of the yellow, green, and red tricolor occurred during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life to the idea of the tricolor was the [[Flag of France|French]] blue, white, and red flag adopted after the [[French Revolution]]. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green, and red flag was a green, white, and red flag used to represent [[Lithuania Minor]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

It is not known who originally suggested the yellow, green, and red colors, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and [[national costume|traditional dress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/56_12_37.pdf Lithuanian folk textile arts]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as the flag of the Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by [[Jonas Basanavičius]], was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Communism|Communist]] causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.&lt;ref name="rimsa"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edmundas |last=Rimša |title=Heraldry: Past to Present |year=2005 |publisher=Versus aureus |location=Vilnius |isbn=9955-601-73-6 |pages=82–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the national flag occurred again in 1917 during the [[Vilnius Conference]]. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist [[Antanas Žmuidzinavičius]] decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates did not like the design as it was too dark and gloomy.&lt;ref name="rimsa"/&gt; Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/flitauen.htm |title=National Flagge des Litauen |accessdate=14 April 2005 |author=Volker Preuß|author2= |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On 19 April 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the [[Council of Lithuania]]. The flag was supposed to be a tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle.&lt;ref name="rimsa"/&gt; The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 [[Constitution of Lithuania]] did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag.&lt;ref name="rimsa"/&gt; Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered [[Gold (colour)|gold]] an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green, and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.

=== Soviet period ===
[[File:Flag of Lithuanian SSR (1940-1953).svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Flag of the Lithuanian SSR]] (1940-1941, 1944–1953)]]
[[File:Flag of Lithuanian SSR.svg|thumb|Flag of the Lithuanian SSR (1953–1988)]]
[[File:Flag of Lithuanian SSR (back).svg|thumb|Back view of the LTSR flag.]]
During [[World War II]], Lithuania was [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied by the Soviet Union]] (1940–1941, 1944–1990) and [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]] (1941–1944). The use of the national flag during this period was prohibited and prosecuted. Two flags were used during the period of Soviet occupation (1944–1989): immediately after the war, the flag consisted of a red field, golden [[hammer and sickle]] with the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] characters ''LIETUVOS TSR'' (Lithuanian SSR in the [[Lithuanian language]]) above them in gold [[sans-serif]] lettering.&lt;ref name=rimsa/&gt; That flag was replaced in 1953 by the last flag used by the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]—a red flag, with the hammer and sickle and star in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist]].

=== Restoration of modern flag ===

[[File:Flag of Lithuania on top of Vilnius Castle Complex.JPG|thumb|Flag of Lithuania on top of Vilnius Castle Complex]]
During 1988, when the Lithuanian [[Singing Revolution|movement towards independence]] was gaining strength, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR|Lithuanian Supreme Soviet]] again recognized the tricolor as the national flag&lt;!-- , formally defining the colors a year later, at which point the tricolor replaced the Soviet Lithuanian flag --&gt;, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Lithuanian SSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tar.tic.lt/Default.aspx?id=2&amp;item=results&amp;aktoid=25FBD656-DD1F-4D7F-8414-C1AA0F35D0F3 18 November 1988 Law of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic № XI-2660 "On amendments to the articles 168 and 169 of the Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801024049/http://tar.tic.lt/Default.aspx?id=2&amp;item=results&amp;aktoid=25FBD656-DD1F-4D7F-8414-C1AA0F35D0F3 |date=1 August 2013 }} {{lt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was defined as rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of [[Flags of the Soviet Republics|Soviet flags]]). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litlex.lt/Litlex/eng/Frames/Laws/Documents/131.HTM|title=The Provisional Basic Law of the Republic of Lithuania|author=[[Vytautas Landsbergis|Landsbergis, Vytautas]]|publisher=Litlex|date=11 March 1990|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence from the Soviet Union, the tricolor flag was written into the new [[Constitution of Lithuania]], which was adopted by a [[Lithuanian constitutional referendum, 1992|referendum in 1992]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This constitution has not specified the flag aspect ratio and therefore it remained 1:2 until 2004, when 1991 law "On the national flag and other flags" was revised by 8 July 2004 law no. IX-2331, making the flag ratio 3:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/lt_leg.html|author=Gutterman, Dov|title=Lithuania&amp;nbsp;— Flag Legislation|publisher=FlagSpot|date=2 August 2008|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and symbolism ==
Passed on 26 June 1991, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian State Flag (Law No. I-1497) governs the design, sizes and use of the state flag. The law was amended on 8 July 2004, (Law No. IX-2331) with the most notable changes including the switching of the national flag ratio from 1:2 to 3:5 and the official adoption of a historical flag as the state (government) flag. The amendment came into force on 1 September 2004, after it was approved by [[President of Lithuania|President]] [[Valdas Adamkus]].&lt;ref name="flaglaw"&gt;Seimas of Lithuania [https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/en/legalAct/TAR.07CAE5E6C2B3/TAIS_442341 Republic of Lithuania Law on the National Flag and Other Flags, No. I-1497 (e-tar.lt)]. Passed on 26 June 1991. Amended through 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The yellow in the flag is meant to symbolize the sun and prosperity, the green is for the forests, the countryside, liberty, and hope, and the red represents the blood and bravery of those who have died for Lithuania.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The proper colors of both the national and state flag are made according to the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], specifically Pantone textile-paper (TP). The ratio of both the national and state flag must be 3:5, with the standard flag size to be {{convert|1.0|by|1.7|m|ft}}. Different sizes of the flag can be created, but they must conform to the color codes and ratio requirements set in the law.&lt;ref name="flaglaw" /&gt; The official Pantone colors have been published since 2004; the list below shows the official colors and their suggested equivalents:

== State (historical) flag ==
[[File:Lithuania and historical Vytis flags during EuroBasket 2011.jpg|thumb|State flag (upper) and the national flag, displayed by the [[Lithuania men's national basketball team|Lithuanian basketball]] fans in [[EuroBasket 2011|2011]].]]

In 2004, along with the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a state flag was adopted. This flag displays the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag is the same as that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the ''historical national (armorial) flag'' in law,&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(2) Law No. I-1497, as amended&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by [[Česlovas Juršėnas]], the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by [[Edmundas Rimša]], the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of [[Mindaugas]] in 1253. The designer of the State (historic) flag and coat of arms was [[Arvydas Každailis]].&lt;ref name="stateflag"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/home/w5_viewer/statiniai/seimu_istorija/w5_show-p_r=4056&amp;p_d=17268&amp;p_k=1.html Seimas of Lithuania - Symbols - Historic flag]. Retrieved 14 December 2006, translated on 15 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this flag was used during the [[Battle of Grunwald]], and has served as the government flag for [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]] from 1922 until 1939.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including [[Finland]], [[Spain]], [[Venezuela]], [[Germany]] and [[Thailand]], have an official national flag for civilian use and a [[state flag]] for government use.

Under the National Flag Law, the state flag is permanently hoisted at three locations: the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania]], [[Trakai Island Castle]], and the grounds of the [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]] in [[Kaunas]]. In addition, the flag is hoisted at the following locations on these days:&lt;ref name="stateflag"/&gt;

* 16 February&amp;nbsp;– next to the [[House of the Signatories]], on [[Pilies Street]] in Vilnius
* 11 March&amp;nbsp;– next to [[Seimas Palace]]
* 6 July&amp;nbsp;– next to the [[Presidential Palace, Vilnius]]
* 15 July&amp;nbsp;– next to the Ministry of Defense
* 25 October&amp;nbsp;– next to the Seimas Palace, the Presidential Palace, and the [[Gediminas Avenue|Gedimino 11]] building that houses the Government of Lithuania

== Flag protocol ==
[[File:House of Signatories.jpg|thumb|Flags hoisted on the [[House of the Signatories]] on 16 February 2007.]]

The flag can be flown vertically or horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe must be at top; when flown vertically, the yellow stripe must be facing Left with the red stripe facing Right. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.&lt;ref name="flaglaw" /&gt;

For [[mourning]] activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as [[half-staff]]ing, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a [[funeral]] ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]], and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.&lt;ref name="flaglaw" /&gt;

When flying the Lithuanian flag with other flags, the following is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of the [[European Union]], international [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], the presidential standard, military and government standards, [[Counties of Lithuania|county]] flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the [[Lithuanian language]]. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The [[European flag|European Union flag]] has been hoisted since Lithuania became a member of the organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the [[Flag of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|flag of NATO]] can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the [[Flag of Estonia|flags of Estonia]] and [[Flag of Latvia|Latvia]] during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three [[Baltic states]]. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.&lt;ref name="flaglaw" /&gt;

=== National flag days ===
As part of the flag protocol, the daily display of the Lithuanian flag is encouraged, but is strongly encouraged or legally required on the following days:&lt;ref name="flaglaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dayslt"&gt;{{lt icon}} [http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=279613 Seimas of Lithuania - Flag Days of Lithuania]. Passed in 2004. Retrieved 15 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these days, the flag is flown at [[Elections in Lithuania|election]] polling sites.

A [[naval ensign]] has been used by Lithuania starting in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2.&lt;ref name="naval"&gt;[[Flags of the World]]. [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/lt-nav.html Lithuania - Naval Flags].

Retrieved 13 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maritime flag|naval jack]] is identical to the historical state flag of Lithuania. A masthead pennant have been adopted by the [[Lithuanian Naval Force|Lithuanian Navy]] to use on their ships.&lt;ref name="naval"/&gt;

The [[President of Lithuania]] was officially given a standard by the [[Seimas]] in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania charged in the center on a single-color background.&lt;ref&gt;Article 7(3), Law I-56, as amended&lt;/ref&gt; Under state law, the background color is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/en/legalAct/TAR.438A78A26F38/TAIS_331601 LAW ON THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT - No. I-56, as amended (e-tar.lt)]. Passed 26 January 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each county of Lithuania has adopted a flag, each of them conforming to a pattern: a blue rectangle, with ten instances of the Cross of [[Vytis]] ([[cross of Lorraine|double cross]] [[or (heraldry)|or]]) appearing in gold, acts as a fringe to the central feature of the flag, which is chosen by the county itself. Most of the central designs were adapted from the counties' coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/lithuania_flag.html Vexillology of Lithuania]. Vexilla Mundi.

The '''Flag of Nigeria''' between 1914 and 1960 was a British [[blue ensign]] with a green [[Star of David]] surrounding a [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor Crown]] (later changed to a [[St Edward's Crown]] in 1953)&lt;ref name=crw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ng-gb.html |title=Colonial Nigeria (1901–1960) |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the white word "Nigeria" under it on a red disc. It was adopted by the [[Colonial Nigeria|Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]] following the amalgamation of the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] and [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]].

== History ==
The colonial flag of Nigeria was adopted in 1914 following the amalgamation of Southern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria. It was first suggested by the first [[Governor-General of Nigeria]], [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Sir Frederick Lugard]] as a symbol of the unification of Nigeria and because of the [[Seal of Solomon]] which was associated with the native [[Igbo Jews]].&lt;ref name=kuti&gt;{{cite book | first =Majemite | last =Jaboro  | title =The Ikoyi Prison Narratives: The Spiritualism and Political Philosophy of Fela Kuti| publisher = Lulu.com |location= | volume =   | year = 2012 | isbn =1105945146  | pages =16–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Star of David had already been in use in Nigeria during the British rule because of the Igbo Jews and indeed featured on coins of the [[British West African pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Chinazor | last =Onianwah  | title =It Takes A Village To Name A Child: Celebrating The Bestowment of Ancestry, Faith, Identity and the Legacy of African Roots of Biblical Hebrews | publisher = Chinazor Onianwah |location= | volume =   | year = 2015 | isbn =  | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed in the 1917 discovery of a bronze Star of David attributed to the Igbo Jews in [[Aguleri]].&lt;ref name=igbo&gt;{{cite book | first =Odi | last =Moghalu  | title =Igbo-Israel: A Comparison of Igbo and Ancient Israel’s Culture| publisher = Xlibris Corporation |location= | volume =   | year = 2015 | isbn =1514403439  | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewigbo.com/archeological1.html |title=Archeological |publisher=Hebrew Igbo |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crest on the flag was also used on the flag of the Governor-General of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=aku&gt;{{cite book | first =Goodwin | last =Akubu  | title =Cow Without Tail | publisher = Dorrance Publishing  |location= | volume =   | year = 2013 | isbn = 1434915395 | page =82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the Governor of Nigeria (1914–1952).svg|thumb|upright=1|Flag of the Governor-General of Nigeria]]
The flag was not universally accepted. Some native Nigerians, including [[Fela Kuti]], refused to salute the flag despite it being mandated in schools.&lt;ref name=kuti /&gt; In 1956, some [[Nigerian Muslims]] burned the Nigerian blue ensign at [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]], because of the Jewish Star of David on it.&lt;ref name=igbo /&gt;&lt;ref name=aku /&gt; In 1959, prior to [[Nigerian Independence]] a competition to design a new flag was held with [[Taiwo Akinkunmi]] designing the new [[flag of Nigeria]] which replaced blue ensign in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/my-nigeria/2015/09/nigerian-flag-150901092231928.html |title=I remember the day I designed the Nigerian flag |publisher=Al Jazeera |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaelic diaspora''' would be understood as referring to the [[Gaels|Gaelic-speaking]] parts of either the [[Irish diaspora]] or the [[Scottish diaspora]].

The use of the term "diaspora" in relation to the Gaelic languages is arguably not appropriate as it suggests that Gaelic speakers and people interested in Gaelic outside Scotland have Highland or Scottish ancestry. Research shows that this assumption is inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacCaluim,  Research on Language Policy and Planning, Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Resultantly, many New Zealand women who might otherwise have been sentenced to penal servitude or [[capital punishment in New Zealand]] had their sentences commuted to the lesser charge of "concealment of birth" under the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1867]]. However, this relative leniency only extended to mothers of concealed or hidden infants who subsequently died. Fathers, grandparents and "baby farmers" like [[Minnie Dean]], the only woman to be executed in New Zealand history and [[Daniel Cooper (murderer)|Daniel Cooper]] in the 1920s, were viewed as more culpable for the death of such infants.

==Background: Infant Mortality in late 19th-century New Zealand==
In a recent volume on childbirth, pregnancy, infant mortality and infanticide in 19th-century New Zealand, Alison Clarke &lt;ref&gt;"She has no Baby Now to Call Her Mother: Infant Death" in A.Clarke: ''Born to a Changing World: Childbirth in Nineteenth Century New Zealand:'' Wellington: Bridget Williams Books: 2012&lt;/ref&gt; places the deaths of newborn infants in colonial era 19th-century New Zealand in historical context. Over the four decades (1861-1899) for which statistical evidence is available, an estimated cumulative 53,000 such infants perished in New Zealand. Early New Zealand colonial statistics show that from 1872, more than one thousand infants or small toddlers died each year from maladies and environmental factors summarized below, peaking at 1995 such fatalities in 1883, although in 1872 (1941 deaths), 1875 (1816 deaths), 1886 (1889 deaths), and 1899 (1806 deaths), more than one thousand eight hundred infants died.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistics of the Colony of New Zealand: 1861-1899'': Wellington: Government Printing Office: 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

If the afflicted child was less than one month old at their time of death, there may have been premature birth. Without the complex life support technology available in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, this would often prove fatal due to the lack of sufficient infant respiratory development.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Alison Clarke: ''Born to a Changing World: Childbirth in Nineteenth Century New Zealand:'' Wellington: Bridget Williams Books: 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}} Other than that, newborn infants might also perish from sharing beds with their parents, who might roll over and smother them inadvertently during sleep; negligent parental [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] abuse and impaired standards of care; administration of alcohol to prevent infant cries; and the associated use of soporific drugs such as [[laudanum]] and [[chlorodyne]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|227}} In the case of [[prostitute]]s and single pregnant women, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] might be passed on to their newborn infants during prenatal development,&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|83}} while inadequately warm clothing might affect mortality for the newborn infants of the poor.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|109}} Infant malnutrition might occur due to lack of awareness of the benefits of [[breastfeeding]] for infants,&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|122}} as well as the absence of medical treatment for conditions such as [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[whooping cough]], [[diphtheria]], [[diarrhoea]], [[enteritis]], [[gastritis]], [[ileus]], inherited [[syphilis]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|224}}

==Maori Infanticide? Cautionary notes==
In the case of Maori infants, detailed statistics about infant health and mortality are not as readily available, due to their presence in remote and isolated rural dwellings inaccessible through roading and civic transport. Furthermore, there are social policy considerations that need to be considered, as British [[colonialism]] distorted social relationships that may have either hampered or facilitated infanticide in the Maori context.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|215}}&lt;ref&gt;Ian Pool: ''Te Iwi Maori: A New Zealand Population: Past, Present and Projected:'' Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1991: 47, 100&lt;/ref&gt; Given the ravages of higher incidence of poor housing, sanitation, malnutrition and infectious diseases, overall 19th-century Maori infant mortality was probably higher than those of European counterparts, however.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|224}} Against infanticide, however, large family (whanau) structures were often available to care for any such child. While there are accounts of apparent infanticide, they often seem to be second-hand information from pakeha [[Church of England]] missionaries. These noted that female infanticide seemed to be prevalent in the context of [[slavery]], cross-cultural relationships and other such inhospitable grounds. Intertribal warfare was also a factor that militated against female infant survival, given the prospect that surviving male children could then become warriors for the defence of a particular iwi (tribal community and social network). However, it is highly probable that the advent of colonialism and introduction of European transport and weapons technology affected the severity and scale of prior tribal conflicts, so this may not reflect an accurate prognosis of Maori infanticide. As time went on, many Maori adopted Christian religious beliefs due to missionary efforts and this reduced the incidence of [[slavery]], [[cannibalism]] and [[homicide]] amongst such Maori communities, although it also returned even during the early 20th century during times of economic hardship.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|229}} In short, it is hard to assess the frequency and prevalence of Maori infanticide and its permissibility during the 19th century.

==Legal context==
Altogether, Clarke identifies 98 cases of deliberate or intentional infant death that resulted in legal proceedings. Of these, 94 were undertaken against the mother of the deceased infant, while fourteen of these were also undertaken against the baby's father, grandparents or friends of the mother who had assisted in the birth and its concealment. Four involved the father of the deceased infant and another individual, often a grandparent. Usually, if the birth had been concealed, the maximum penalty was two years imprisonment, and as Bronwyn Dalley notes, women could often plead mitigating circumstances through male sexual coercion (a "seduction" narrative), although this was not always successful. Some women were convicted of infanticide or manslaughter in this context, although many others were acquitted. Men could not similarly plead "seduction" or the trauma of unassisted childbirth in this context; as witnessed by the case of William Henry Woodgate, who committed [[incest]] with his niece that subsequently resulted in her pregnancy and childbirth, leading to the killing of the newborn and his subsequent execution for murder in 1877.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

Originally, concealment arose in 17th century Anglo-Scottish law and sought to punish secret illegitimate pregnancies and childbirths in which mothers hid the bodies of the infants after birth or stillbirth.  As noted above, not all mothers were successful in pleading concealment- the cases of [[Phoebe Veitch]] and [[Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan]] stand out as exceptions to this general rule, although the defense was usually effective when it came to mitigated imprisonment or even acquittal, in some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|232}} Throughout the British Empire in the 1890s, concern arose over the negligent standards of "care" offered by baby farmers. [[Minnie Dean]] and others may have been viewed as equivalents to [[John and Sarah Makin]] and [[Frances Lydia Alice Knorr]] in adjacent [[New South Wales]] in Australia, or [[Amelia Dyer]] in the United Kingdom, who were her historical contemporaries. Such trials also built up a volume of relevant case law within imperial jurisdictions.

==History==

In 1869, Annie Bates had been domestic servant for a [[Greymouth]] merchant and his family on the South Island's [[West Coast Region|West Coast]]. Her employer, William Coates, spotted the body of a newborn infant in the lavatory, with the subsequent revelation of the decomposed body of a female infant. Bates confessed to the apparent concealment of the infant when she was apprehended, but held that it had been stillborn when she gave birth alongside the [[Grey River]] adjacent to the town. Mary Ann Swift, a dancer at the Greenstone Pub, argued that had not been the case when she appeared as witness for the prosecution in this case, but her opinion was dismissed. She was found not guilty of either murder, manslaughter or concealment by the subsequent jury when the case came to trial.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Times:'' 14.01.1870&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Mary Ann Spendlove, concealment was judged to have occurred and she was acquitted of murder in 1871, and subsequently sentenced to two years imprisonment on the lesser charge. Spendlove had cast her baby's body adrift in Nelson Harbour in 1866. The infant had been conceived during an extramarital affair while her husband was absent. She claimed that the infant was premature, but medical examination demonstrated that it was, in fact, a fully developed infant, had been born alive and died of suffocation. Alison Clark argues that one of the reasons that she was not treated as leniently as some of the other women cited in this section was that as a married woman, Spendlove "should have known better."&lt;ref&gt;''Nelson Examiner:'' 07.02.1872&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Galway]] in [[Ireland]], Bridget Gee (1845-?) was initially described as a "good industrious girl and of a kind disposition" by her employer, Mrs Elizabeth Aikman, while employed as a maidservant at [[Dunedin]]'s Glasgow Hotel. However, in June 1871, she gave birth and then concealed the body of her newborn infant beneath her mattress. Although she claimed that the death of the infant was accidental, the infant had suffered concussion to the head, fractures and lost blood through laceration, possibly caused by scissors or a stay. Although Gee was not found guilty of manslaughter or murder, she was found guilty of concealment. Her lawyer, [[Robert Stout]], claimed that the injuries to the dead infant were likely to have been accidental, and the Crown Prosecutor, Bryan Haggit, concurred. Gee was suspected of brutally killing her child and was not acquitted of concealment, however.&lt;ref&gt;''Otago Witness:'' 23.09.1871&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Margaret Collins (1854-?) was [[illiterate]] and had no family available in New Zealand to assist her covert pregnancy and childbirth, thus leading to her slashing her newborn baby's throat and hiding the body under her mattress in [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] in 1875. However, she was found guilty of manslaughter, given the nature of her infant's fatal injuries, although only sentenced to two months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Star:'' 15.04.1875&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, [[Auckland]] mother Rosina Smith initially fostered out her newborn infant, but then absconded with the two-month-old baby, before burying him in a market garden in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]], an Auckland suburb. The presiding judge in that case, Chief Justice James Prendergast, suggested three options to the jurors- they could either find Smith guilty of [[murder]], [[manslaughter]] or [[insanity]]. The jury found the latter verdict was the case, although this was an unusual outcome, as courts usually did not find that mothers were mentally ill when they killed their newborn babies in this context &lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald:'' 08.10.1884&lt;/ref&gt; However, at least three other women may have had diagnosable mental health concerns by current medical standards, given Clarke's assessment of newspaper accounts and court documents.

In 1878, Margaret Wilson gave birth to a daughter at [[Timaru]]'s Benevolent Society, an emergency housing facility for indigent women, their infants and children, but the baby only survived for three months before it was strangled. When Wilson appeared before the New Zealand Supreme Court, it was apparent that she was unfit to face charges of [[murder]] in the context of her daughter's death. She was admitted to the [[Sunnyside Hospital]] in [[Christchurch]] and custodial staff testified that she was unable to comprehend what was said to her, was violent and had to be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;''Timaru Herald:'' 15.06.1878&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanny Bonnington (1868-?) was a [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] domestic servant who gave birth at sixteen in secret in 1884, and threw the dead body of her infant down an ablutionary facility. Postmortem medical investigation revealed that it had been alive at its birth and had several stab wounds, although death might also have occurred from haemorrhaging from an umbilical cord in this situation. Doctor Thomas Porter noted that Bonnington appeared to be experiencing what might be defined today as [[post-partum depression]], as had one of the defendant's sisters after her pregnancy and childbirth. Her grandfather also experienced what might be diagnosed as [[Alzheimer's disease]] in contemporary medical practise. Bonnington was found not guilty of concealment through reason of insanity at the time of birth and although held for three months doing kitchen work at the [[Wellington]] Lunatic Asylum, she was subsequently released and returned to [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]. Justice William Richmond commented that in such instances, judges and juries were often swayed by the 'seduction narrative' and held the man who had impregnated such women more culpable than the "abandoned" and isolated single women who gave often traumatic birth without the attendance of family or doctors in the new colony, so they would not convict a young woman of infanticide, murder or manslaughter in this context.&lt;ref&gt;''Marlborough Express:'' 21.10.1884&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Heads/Edwards was servant to a [[Dunedin]] bank clerk and his family. In 1889, while boarding with a labourer's wife, this young woman gave birth and concealed the body of the infant in that woman's wardrobe. It was unclear whether the infant had been born alive or not in this instance and she was acquitted of concealment of birth. She had been "seduced" and then had been left indigent. As with Bonnington's case, a ''Tuapeka Times'' journalist referred to Heads/Edward's 'seduction" and argued that the man who had abandoned her was "truly" responsible for this tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Tuapeka Times:'' 31.08.1889&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, however, the balance of evidence pointed otherwise. In 1881, Dunedin coroner Thomas Morland Hocken advised against keeping an infant in bed with its parents, as there could be problems with respiratory distress if the sleeping parents rolled over and inadvertently suffocated the baby in question. However, in the case of Mary Ann Weston, there were grounds to suspect that the death of the infant may have been deliberate, as Dunedin's Industrial School [[orphanage]] had taken her two earlier children into custodial care, and Weston was drinking heavily. The coronial inquest jury found Weston had a manslaughter case to answer, but Weston was later acquitted of manslaughter in the Dunedin Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Otago Witness:'' 31 December 1881: 10 January 1882&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular perceptions==
In 1895, Edward Tregear, a civil servant and local intellectual, suggested to [[Wellington]]'s ''Evening Post'' newspaper that New Zealand society was responsible for the spate of infanticides in recent years of colonial history. He was referring to the contemporary case of Mary Davis (1889), in which that [[Wellington]] domestic servant had given birth secretly, and as with Margaret Heads/Edwards had concealed the baby's body in her wardrobe. Davis had tied but not cut the infant's [[umbilical cord]], and was acquitted of both murder and concealment of birth in the local Magistrate's Court. Tregear advocated for parenting education in this context&lt;ref&gt;E.Tregear: Letters to the Editor: ''Evening Post:'' 29.10.1895; 13.11.1895; 18.11.1895; 19.11.1895&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SwissKeroseneLamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Swiss flat-wick kerosene lamp. The knob protruding to the right adjusts the wick, and hence the flame size.]]

A '''kerosene lamp''' (also known as a '''paraffin lamp''' in some countries) is a type of [[lighting]] device that uses [[kerosene]] (paraffin) as a [[fuel]]. Invented by the [[Poles|Polish]] pharmacist [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] in 1853, kerosene lamps have a [[Candle wick|wick]] or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held [[lantern]]s may be used for portable lighting. Like [[oil lamp]]s, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without [[rural electrification]], in [[electrification|electrified]] areas during [[power outage]]s, at [[campsite]]s, and on [[boat]]s. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.

Pressurized kerosene lamps have a [[gasification|gas generator]] and [[gas mantle]]; these are known as [[Petromax]], [[Tilley lamp]]s, or [[Coleman Lantern|Coleman]] lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate. A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas generator. Vapor from the gas generator burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat to the gas generator.

The first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by [[History of Iran|Persian]] alchemist [[al-Razi]] (Rhazes) in 9th century [[Baghdad]], who referred to it as the "naffatah" in his ''Kitab al-Asrar'' (''Book of Secrets'').&lt;ref&gt;Zayn Bilkadi ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), "The Oil Weapons", ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846 [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] invented a substitute for [[whale oil]] for lighting, distilled from coal. Later made from petroleum, kerosene became a popular lighting fuel. Modern and most popular versions of the kerosene lamp were later constructed by Polish inventor and pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz. 

Kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia, where electricity is not distributed or is too costly. Kerosene lamps consume an estimated 77 billion litres of fuel per year, equivalent to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Bolay, Alexandre Schmid, Gabriela Tejada ''Technologies and Innovations for Development: Scientific Cooperation for a Sustainable Future'', Springer, 2012
{{ISBN|2-8178-0267-5}} page 308.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to annual U.S. jet-fuel consumption of 76 billion litres per year.&lt;ref&gt;^ Energy Information Administration.

== Types ==

=== Flat-wick lamp ===
[[File:Railway Lamp.jpg|thumb|NZR lamp on the Weka Pass Railway]]
A flat-wick lamp is a simple type of [[kerosene]] lamp, which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by [[capillary action]]. If this type of lamp is broken, it can easily start a fire. A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the lamp burner attached. Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced [[Chimney#Chimney draught or draft|draft]]. The glass chimney needs a "throat", or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete [[combustion]] of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light, which is brighter than an open flame would produce.

The lamp burner has a flat wick, usually made of [[cotton]]. The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner.  Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed metal [[sprocket]] bearing against the wick.  If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube, the lamp will produce [[smoke]] and [[soot]] (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow [[flame]].  As the kerosene burns, [[capillary action]] in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below, and hot air exits above.

This type of lamp was very widely used by railways, both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals, due to its reliability.  At a time when there were few competing light sources at night outside major towns, the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal.

=== Central-draft (tubular round wick) lamp ===
{{Main article|Argand lamp}}
[[File:Idealbrenner.JPG|thumb|"Central-draught" tubular-wick kerosene lamp]]

A central-draught lamp, or [[Argand lamp]], works in the same manner as the flat-wick lamp. The burner is equipped with a tall glass chimney, of around {{convert|12|in}} tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of [[cotton]], that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a "carrier", which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the "central draft" or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of [[fire]] and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.

=== Mantle lamp ===
{{Main article|Gas mantle}}
[[File:Sumburgh Lighthouse Lamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 85&amp;nbsp;mm Chance Brothers ''Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation'', which produced the light for the [[Sumburgh Head Lighthouse|Sumburgh Head lighthouse]] until 1976. The lamp (made around 1914) burned vaporized [[kerosene]] (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a [[denatured alcohol]] (methylated spirit) burner to light. When lit, some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a [[Bunsen burner]] to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so.  This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The "white sock" is in fact an unburnt mantle, on which the vapor burned.]]

A variation on the "central-draught" lamp is the mantle lamp. The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner.  The mantle typically contains [[thorium]] or other [[rare-earth]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]; on first use the cloth burns away, and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides, leaving a very fragile structure, which [[incandescence|incandesces]] (glows brightly) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame. Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps, produce a whiter light and generate more [[heat]]. Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp, but slower than a center-draught round-wick, as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle, rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself.

Mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade, and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather. Mantle lamps, because of the higher [[temperature]] at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished.  Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high, the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot. A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough, the soot itself can ignite, and a "runaway lamp" condition can result.

One popular model of mantle lamp uses only a wick and is unpressurized.

Pressurized mantle lamps contain a gas generator and require preheating the generator before lighting.  An air pump is used to deliver fuel under pressure to the gas generator.

Large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in [[lighthouse]] beacons for navigation of ships, brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Noble ''Lighthouses &amp; Keepers: The U.S. Lighthouse Service and Its Legacy'', Naval Institute Press, 2004 {{ISBN|1-59114-626-7}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kerosene lantern ===

A kerosene lantern, also known as a "barn lantern" or "hurricane lantern", is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet-metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast. Both hot-blast and cold-blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead-flame lamps, as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tubular Oil Lanterns&amp;nbsp;— Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |publisher=W. T. Kirkman Lanterns, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192016/http://www.lanterns.us/faqs.htm |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest portable kerosene "glass globe" lanterns, of the 1850s and 1860s, were of the dead-flame type, meaning that it had an open wick, but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney.  This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame.

Later lanterns, such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns, took this airflow control even further by partially enclosing the wick in a "deflector" or "burner cone" and channeling the airflow through that restricted area, creating a brighter and even more stable flame.

The hot-blast design, also known as a "tubular lantern" due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John Irwin and patented on January 12, 1868. The hot-blast design collected hot air from above the globe and fed it through metal side tubes to the burner, to make the flame burn brighter.

The cold-blast design is similar to the hot-blast, except that cold fresh air is drawn in from around the top of the globe and is then fed though the metal side tubes to the flame, making it burn brighter. This design produces a brighter light than the hot-blast design, because the fresh air that is fed to the flame has plenty of oxygen to support the combustion process.

== Fuels ==
Generic lamp oil is available clear or in a choice of several colors and in scented and unscented forms. Although more expensive, lamp oil is highly refined and burns more cleanly and with less odor than kerosene. "Lamp oil" must not be liquid paraffin{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. "Water-clear" K-1 kerosene is the next grade of preferred fuel for kerosene wick lamps. In some locations "[[Kerosene#Red Kerosene|red kerosene]]" is sold, which is dyed red and is slightly less expensive than K-1 kerosene, as no [[Fuel tax|motor-fuel taxes]] are collected on it. Red kerosene is not recommended because the dye will gradually clog the lantern wick, causing odor and reduced performance. "Klean-Heat" brand is another highly refined, cleaner-burning, nicer-smelling{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} kerosene substitute sold at many [[hardware store]]s during winter. Citronella-scented lamp oil containing [[citronella oil|lemongrass oil]] is sold for its [[insect repellent]] properties. Citronella fuels should only be used outdoors. Liquid paraffin-based "lamp oil" should only be used in round-wick lamps with a wick diameter of less than {{convert|5/8|in}}. Used in larger wicks, this fuel causes the wicks to clog.{{fact|date=December 2015}}

Flat-wick kerosene lamps should only be operated with kerosene, lamp oil or Klean-Heat, but alternative fuels can be used in an emergency. Such fuels may produce additional smoke and odor and may not be usable indoors. [[Tractor vaporizing oil]] is made from kerosene with some additive to make a [[motor fuel]] for tractors. No. 1 [[diesel fuel]] (also called winter diesel) is about the same as [[kerosene]] but with the additives to make it a [[motor fuel]]. [[Jet fuel|Jet A]] jet-engine fuel is essentially kerosene with a few additives. [[RP-1]] (Rocket Propellant-1) is a highly refined form of kerosene outwardly similar to jet fuel, used as rocket fuel.

Round-wick center-draft lamps must only burn either Klean-Heat or low-odor mineral spirits.

Any liquid with a low [[flash point]] presents a high risk of fire or explosion if used in a kerosene wick lamp. Such liquids are dangerous and should not be used in a kerosene lamp or lantern. Examples include:
* [[charcoal lighter fluid]],
* [[gasoline]] ([[petrol]]),
* [[naphtha]], [[white gas]] or [[Coleman fuel]],
* mineral spirits, paint thinner, [[white spirit]] (Stoddard solvent),
* other hydrocarbon solvents such as [[turpentine]], [[benzene]], [[xylene]], [[toluene]], [[acetone]], [[camphene]], lacquer thinner,
* [[denatured alcohol]].

Contamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences.  Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires. Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.galcit.caltech.edu/EDL/publications/reprints/KeroseneLampCookstove.pdf Joseph E. Shepherd, Frank A. Perez, ''Kerosene Lamps and Cookstoves&amp;nbsp;— the Hazards of Gasoline Contamination'' 2007 retrieved 2012 Feb 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==
Flat-wick lamps have the lowest light output, center-draft round-wick lamps have 3–4 times the output of flat-wick lamps, and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]]. A kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day consumes about 3 litres of kerosene per month.&lt;ref&gt;Narasimha Desirazu Rao ''Distributional Impacts of Energy Policies in India: Implications for Equity'' Stanford University, 2011 page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kolpos''' (Greek: κόλποις κόλπον κόλπῳ, a gulf, bay or creek) is the ''blousing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/blouse |title=Definition of the verb ''blouse'' by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[peplos]], [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] or [[tunic]] in Ancient Greek clothing, whereby excess length of the material hangs folded over a [[Zone (vestment)|zone]] (a narrow girdle).

The fabric of the garment was typically cut longer than the shoulder-to-floor measurement of the women or man wearing it. The excess length was dealt with at the waist (creating the kolpos) and optionally the top edge (creating the apoptygma). To create the kolpos, a zone was tied around the body below the breast (high-girdled) or at the waist (low-girdled) and excess fabric was pulled up over it. The fabric fell over the girdle so as to hide it, and was often pulled longer in back than in front. This fold was the kolpos. A second (visible) zone could be tied over the kolpos to redefine the waist, high or low. This might be hidden again by the apoptygma, the loose, folded down top of the peplos.

'''LaVeyan Satanism''' is a [[religion]] founded in 1966 by the American [[occultism|occultist]] and author [[Anton LaVey|Anton Szandor LaVey]]. Scholars of religion have classified it as a [[new religious movement]] and a form of [[Western esotericism]]. It is one of several different movements that describe themselves as forms of [[Satanism]].

LaVey established LaVeyan Satanism in the U.S. state of [[California]] through the founding of his [[Church of Satan]] on [[Walpurgisnacht]] of 1966, which he proclaimed to be "the Year One", ''Anno Satanas''—the first year of the "Age of Satan". His ideas were heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Ayn Rand]]. The church grew under LaVey's leadership, with regional ''[[Grotto (Satanism)|grottos]]'' being founded across the United States. A number of these seceded from the church to form independent Satanic organizations during the early 1970s. In 1975, LaVey abolished the grotto system, after which Satanism became a far less organized movement, although remained greatly influenced by LaVey's writings. In coming years, members of the church left it to establish their own organisations, also following LaVeyan Satanism, among them John Dewey Allee's First Church of Satan and [[Karla LaVey]]'s [[First Satanic Church]].

The religion's doctrines are codified in LaVey's book, ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''. The religion is [[materialist]], rejecting the existence of supernatural beings, [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-soul dualism]], and [[Afterlife|life after death]]. Practitioners do not believe that [[Satan]] literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype representing [[pride]], [[wiktionary:carnal|carnality]], and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. He is also embraced as a symbol of defiance against [[Abrahamic religions]] which LaVeyans criticize for suppressing humanity's natural instincts and encouraging irrationality. The religion propagates a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] worldview, seeing mankind as animals existing in an [[amorality|amoral]] universe. It promotes a philosophy based on [[individualism]] and [[rational egoism|egoism]], coupled with [[Social Darwinism]] and [[anti-egalitarianism]]. 

LaVeyan Satanism involves the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], which encompasses two distinct forms; [[greater and lesser magic]]. Greater magic is a form of [[ritual]] practice and is meant as [[psychodramatic]] [[catharsis]] to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes, including ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' ([[hate]]), and ''sex'' ([[lust]]).  Lesser magic is the practice of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] by means of [[applied psychology]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] (or [[Deception|"wile and guile"]]) to bend an individual or situation to one's will.

LaVeyan Satanism &amp;ndash; which is also sometimes termed "Modern Satanism"{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=83|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2013|2p=124}} and "Rational Satanism"{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2009|1p=224|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2013|2p=123}} &amp;ndash; is classified by scholars of [[religious studies]] as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013||p=81}} When used, "Rational Satanism" is often employed to distinguish the approach of the LaVeyan Satanists from the "Esoteric Satanism" embraced by groups like the [[Temple of Set]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1y=2012|1p=370|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95}} A number of religious studies scholars have also described it as a form of "self-religion" or "self-spirituality",{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=290|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=82|3a1=Petersen|3y=2009|3pp=224&amp;ndash;225|4a1=Schipper|4y=2010|4p=108|5a1=Faxneld|5a2=Petersen|5y=2013|5p=79}} with religious studies scholar Amina Olander Lap arguing that it should be seen as being both part of the "prosperity wing" of the self-spirituality [[New Age]] movement and a form of the [[Human Potential Movement]].{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=84}} Conversely, the scholar of Satanism Jesper Aa.

The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine described LaVeyan Satanism as having "both elitist and anarchist elements", also citing one occult bookshop owner who referred to the church's approach as "anarchistic hedonism".{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In their study of Satanism, the [[religious studies]] scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], and Jesper Aa. Petersen suggested that LaVey viewed his religion as "an antinomian self-religion for productive misfits, with a cynically [[carnivalesque]] take on life, and no supernaturalism".{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=70}} The sociologist of religion [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] even described LaVeyan Satanism as "a blend of Epicureanism and Ayn Rand's philosophy, flavored with a pinch of ritual magic."{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}} The historian of religion [[Mattias Gardell]] described LaVey's as "a rational ideology of egoistic hedonism and self-preservation",{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=288}} while [[Nevill Drury]] characterised LaVeyan Satanism as "a religion of self-indulgence".{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=188}} It has also been described as an "institutionalism of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] self-interest".{{sfn|Taub|Nelson|1993|p=528}}

The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them "Devil worshipers".&lt;ref name=Stop&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2014/11/07/the-church-of-satan-wants-you-to-stop-calling-these-devil-worshipping-alleged-murderers-satanists/|title=The Church of Satan wants you to stop calling these 'devil worshiping' alleged murderers Satanists |date=7 November 2014 |website=The Washington Post |last=Ohlheiser |first=Abby |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Church leader [[Blanche Barton]] described Satanism as "an alignment, a lifestyle".{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=99}} LaVey and the church espoused the view that "Satanists are born, not made";{{sfn|Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology|Petersen|2009|p=9}} that they are outsiders by their nature, living as they see fit,{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=129}} who are self-realized in a religion which appeals to the would-be Satanist's nature, leading them to realize they are Satanists through finding a belief system that is in line with their own perspective and lifestyle.{{sfn|Satanism Today|Lewis|2001|p=330}}

==Belief==

===''The Satanic Bible''===
{{main|The Satanic Bible}}

''The Satanic Bible'' has been in print since 1969 and has been translated into various languages.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=85}} Lewis argued that although LaVeyan Satanists do not treat ''The Satanic Bible'' as a sacred text in the way many other religious groups treat their holy texts, it nevertheless is "treated as an authoritative document which effectively ''functions'' as scripture within the Satanic community".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}} In particular, Lewis highlighted that many Satanists &amp;ndash; both members of the Church of Satan and other groups &amp;ndash; quote from it either to legitimize their own position or to de-legitimize the positions of others in a debate.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=2, 13}} Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey's work as influential.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=317}}

Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to ''The Satanic Bible'', with 20 per cent of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning ''The Satanic Bible'' directly as influencing their conversion.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=117}} For members of the church, the book is said to serve not only as a compendium of ideas but also to judge the authenticity of someone's claim to be a Satanist.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=115}} LaVey's writings have been described as "cornerstones" within the church and its teachings,{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=114}} and have been supplemented with the writings of its later High Priest, Gilmore, namely his book, ''[[The Satanic Scriptures]]''.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=114}}

''The Satanic Bible'' has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 116}} The book contains the core principles of Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p = 105}} On their website, the Church of Satan urge anyone seeking to learn about LaVeyan Satanism to read ''The Satanic Bible'', stating that doing so is "tantamount to understanding at least the basics of Satanism".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=12}} Petersen noted that it is "in many ways ''the'' central text of the Satanic milieu",{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=232}} with Lap similarly testifying to its dominant position within the wider Satanic movement.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=85}} [[David G. Bromley]] calls it "[[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]" and "the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology."{{sfn|Bromley|2005|pp=8127–8128}} [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] says that Satanists use LaVey's writings "as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos." He also states: "With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey's ''Satanic Bible'' promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace."{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=6530}}

===Atheism and Satan===

LaVey was an [[atheism|atheist]], rejecting the existence of all gods.&lt;ref name=DwD&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ozy.com/true-story/my-dinner-with-the-devil/71233/|title=My Dinner With The Devil |date=7 September 2016 |website=OZY |last=Robinson |first=Eugene |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, LaVey and his Church do not espouse a belief in [[Satan]] as an entity who literally exists,{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} and LaVey did not encourage the worship of Satan as a deity.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Instead, the use of Satan as a central figure is intentionally symbolic.{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=430}} LaVey sought to cement his belief system within the [[secularism|secularist]] world-view that derived from [[natural science]], thus providing him with an atheistic basis with which to criticize Christianity and other supernaturalist beliefs.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=Petersen|2y=2005|2p=434}} He legitimized his religion by highlighting what he claimed was its rational nature, contrasting this with what he saw as the supernaturalist irrationality of established religions.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} He defined Satanism as "a secular philosophy of rationalism and self-preservation (natural law, animal state), giftwrapping these ideas in religious trappings to add to their appeal."{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=336}} In this way, LaVeyan Satanism has been described as an "antireligious religion" by van Luijk.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=328}} LaVey did not believe in any [[afterlife]].{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2011|p=198}}

Instead of worshiping the Devil as a real figure, the image of Satan is embraced because of its association with social non-conformity and rebellion against the dominant system.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1995|1p=290|2a1=La Fontaine|2y=1999|2p=97}} LaVey embraced the iconography of Satan and the label of "Satanist" because it shocked people into thinking,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001a|1p=17|2a1=Gallagher|2y=2006|2p=165}} and when asked about his religion, stated that "the reason it's called Satanism is because it's fun, it's accurate and it's productive".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} 

LaVey also conceptualised Satan as a symbol of the individual's own vitality,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=107}} thus representing an autonomous power within,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=106}} and a representation of personal liberty and individualism.{{sfn|Cavaglion|Sela-Shayovitz|2005|p=255}} Throughout ''The Satanic Bible'', the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true "self"—a projection of his or her own personality—not an external deity.{{sfn|Wright|1993|p=143}} In works like ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey often uses the terms "god" and "Satan" interchangeably, viewing both as personifications of human nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Muzzatti|2y=2005|2p=874}}

Despite his professed atheism, some passages of LaVey's writings left room for a literal interpretation of Satan, and some members of his Church understood the Devil as an entity that really existed.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=348}} It is possible that LaVey left some ambivalence in his writings so as not to drive away those Church members who were theistic Satanists.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=355}}
Both LaVey's writings and the publications of the church continue to refer to Satan as if he were a real being, in doing so seeking to reinforce the Satanist's self-interest.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=291}}

LaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith,{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} It views Christianity &amp;ndash; alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as [[humanism]] and [[liberal democracy]] &amp;ndash; as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, herd behavior, and irrationality.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=80}} LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the spiritual.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=50}}

===Human nature and society===

LaVeyan Satanism has been characterised as belonging to the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] rather than to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=326}} The historian of Satanism Ruben van Luijk characterised it as a form of "anarchism of the Right".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=374}} LaVey was anti-egalitarian and elitist, believing in the fundamental inequality of different human beings.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=366}} His philosophy was [[Social Darwinist]] in basis,{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=95|3a1=van Luijk|3y=2016|3p=367}} having been influenced by the writings of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Ayn Rand]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Petersen|2y=2005|2p=447|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=95}} LaVey stated that his Satanism was "just Ayn Rand's philosophy with ceremony and ritual added".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001a|1p=18|2a1=Lewis|2y=2002|2p=9}} Characterising LaVey as a Nietzschean, the religious studies scholar Asbjørn Dyrendal nevertheless thought that LaVey's "personal synthesis seems decidedly his own creation, even though the different ingredients going into it are at times very visible."{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=370}} Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in ''The Book of Satan'', where LaVey uses portions of Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'', though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}

For LaVey, the human being was explicitly viewed as an animal,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=74|4a1=Lap|4y=2013|4p=94}} who thus has no purpose other than [[survival of the fittest]], and who therefore exists in an [[amorality|amoral]] context.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} He believed that in adopting a philosophical belief in its own superiority above that of the other animals, humankind has become "the most vicious animal of all".{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} For LaVey, non-human animals and children represent an ideal, "the purest form of carnal existence", because they have not been indoctrinated with Christian or other religious concepts of guilt and shame.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=95}} His ethical views focused around placing oneself and one's family before others, minding one's own business, and &amp;ndash; for men &amp;ndash; behaving like a [[gentleman]].{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} In responding to threats and harm, he promoted a policy of ''[[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]'', for instance reversing a Biblical Christian teaching by stating that "if a man smite thee on the one cheek, ''smash'' him on the other."{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} 

LaVeyan Satanism places great emphasis on the role of [[liberty]] and personal freedom.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=322}} LaVey believed that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting what he called the "colorless existence" that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2013|p=129}} He rejected [[consumerism]] and what he called the "death cult" of [[fashion]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=374}} He praised the human [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=92}} He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2011|p=198}} and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=94}} Accordingly, he praised the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] as virtues which were beneficial for the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Schipper|2y=2010|2p=107}}

Similarly, LaVey criticized the negative and restrictive attitude to sexuality present in many religions, instead supporting any sexual acts that take place between consenting adults.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=91|3a1=Faxneld|3a2=Petersen|3y=2014|3p=168|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=321}} His Church welcomed homosexual members from its earliest years,{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} and he also endorsed celibacy for those who were [[asexuality|asexual]].{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=168}} He sought to discourage negative feelings of guilt arising from sexual acts such as masturbation and fetishes,{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=91}} and believed that rejecting these sexual inhibitions and guilt would result in a happier and healthier society.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=169}} Discussing women, LaVey argued that they should use sex as a tool to manipulate men, in order to advance their own personal power.{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2014|p=170}} Conversely, non-consensual sexual relations, such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]], were denounced by LaVey and his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=288|2a1=Maxwell-Stuart|2y=2011|2p=198}}

LaVey believed in the imminent demise of Christianity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=357}} In addition, he believed that society would enter an Age of Satan, in which a generation living in accordance with LaVeyan principles would come to power.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=379}}
LaVey supported [[eugenics]] and expected it to become a necessity in the future, when it would be used to breed an elite who reflected LaVey's "Satanic" principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=95|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=376}} In his view, this elite would be "superior people" who displayed the "Satanic" qualities of creativity and nonconformity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He regarded these traits as capable of hereditary transmission, and made the claim that "Satanists are born, not made".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=376}} He believed that the elite should be siphoned off from the rest of the human "herd", with the latter being forced into ghettoes, ideally "space ghettoes" located on other planets.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=375}}
The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in a LaVeyan magazine, ''The Black Flame'', in which one writer described "a true Satanic society" as one in which the population consists of "free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' them or telling them what they can and cannot do."{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} This rebellious approach conflicts with LaVey's firm beliefs in observing the [[rule of law]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} Although personally neither a [[fascism|fascist]] nor [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=373}} LaVey was on good terms with various neo-Nazi and other right-wing groups operating in the United States.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=368}}

===Magic===
{{main|Greater and lesser magic}}

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|LaVey's understanding of magic was influenced by the British occultist Aleister Crowley ]]

Although LaVey's ideas were largely shaped around a secular and scientific world-view, he also expressed a belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1pp=3–4|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=336}} Rather than characterising magic as a [[supernatural]] phenomenon, LaVey expressed the view that it was a part of the natural world thus far undiscovered by scientists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|pp=3–4}} Outlined in ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey defined magic as "the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable",{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=288&amp;ndash;289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2p=95|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=96|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=342}} a definition that reflects the influence of the British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=342}} Although he never explained exactly how he believed that this magical process worked,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} LaVey stated that magicians could successfully utilise this magical force through intensely imagining their desired goal and thus directing the force of their own willpower toward it.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=4|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=339}} He emphasised the idea that magical forces could be manipulated through "purely emotional" rather than intellectual acts.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} 

This practice puts LaVeyan Satanism within a wider tradition of 'high magic' or ceremonial magic,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=339}} and has also been compared with [[Christian Science]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} LaVey adopted beliefs and ideas from older magicians but consciously de-Christianised and Satanised them for his own purposes.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=337}}
In presenting himself as applying a scientific perspective on magic, LaVey was likely influenced by Crowley, who had also presented his approach to magic in the same way.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=376}} However, in contrast to many older ceremonial magicians, LaVey denied that there was any division between [[black magic]] and [[white magic]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2p=377|3a1=Dyrendal|3a2=Petersen|3a3=Lewis|3y=2016|3p=86}} attributing this dichotomy purely to the "smug hypocrisy and self-deceit" of those who called themselves "white magicians".{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|p=377}} He similarly differed from many older magicians who emphasised magic as a practice designed to bring about personal transformation and transcendence; rather, for LaVey magic was employer for material gain, personal influence, to harm enemies, and to gain success in love and sex.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=336–337}}

LaVey defined his system of magic as [[greater and lesser magic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Petersen|2y=2012|2pp=95–96|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=97|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=86}} Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: ''compassion'' ([[love]]), ''destruction'' (hate), and ''sex'' (lust).{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=86}} The space in which a ritual is performed is known as an "intellectual decompression chamber",{{sfn|The Invention of Satanism Dyrendal, Petersen|2016|page=89}} where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. This magic could then be employed to ensure sexual gratification, material gain, personal success, or to curse one's enemies.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=289}} LaVey also wrote of "the balance factor", insisting that any magical aims should be realistic.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=98}} These rituals are often considered to be magical acts,{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to aid one's selfish ends.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=98–99}}

Lesser magic, also referred to an "everyday" or "situational" magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology. LaVey defined it as "wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create change in accordance with one's will."{{sfn|Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, Volume 6: The Twentieth Century|Blecourt, Hutton, Fontaine|1999|p=91}} LaVey wrote that a key concept in lesser magic is the “command to look”, which can be accomplished by utilizing elements of “sex, sentiment, and wonder”,{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen|p=418}} in addition to the utilization of looks, body language, scents,{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|page=97}} color, patters, and odor.{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2014|p=90}} This system encourages a form of manipulative role-play, wherein the practitioner may alter several elements of their physical appearance in order to aid them in seducing or "bewitching" on object of desire.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}}

LaVey developed “The Synthesizer Clock”, the purpose of which is to divide humans into distinct groups of people based primarily on body shape and personality traits.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The synthesizer is modeled as a clock, and based on concepts of [[somatotypes]].{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Petersen|2010|p=67}} The clock is intended to aid a witch in identifying themselves, subsequently aiding in utilizing the “attraction of opposites” to “spellbind” the witch's object of desire by assuming the opposite role.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} The successful application of lesser magic is said to be built upon one's understanding of their place on the clock.{{sfn|Sexuality and New Religious Movements|Lewis, Bogdan|2014|p=}} Upon finding your position on the clock, you are encouraged to adapt it as seen fit, and perfect your type by harmonizing its element for better success.{{sfn|The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity|Faxneld, Petersen|2013|p=97}} Dyrendal referred to LaVey's techniques as “[[Erving Goffman]] meets [[William Mortensen]]”.{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|Lewis, Petersen|2014|page=418}} Drawing insights from psychology, biology, and sociology,{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|p=89}} Petersen noted that lesser magic combines occult and “rejected sciences of body analysis [and] temperaments.”{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|Lewis, Hammer|2010|p=68}}

==Basic tenets==

The "central convictions" of LaVeyan Satanism are formulated into three lists, which are regularly reproduced within the Church of Satan's written material.{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=431}}

===The Nine Satanic Statements===
[[File:Brimstone.gif|thumb|right|150px|The [[alchemical symbol]] for [[Sulfur]], as it appears in ''The Satanic Bible'' above the Nine Satanic Statements.]]
''The Nine Satanic Statements'' are a set of nine assertions made by LaVey in the introductory chapters of ''The Satanic Bible''. They are considered a touchstone of contemporary organized Satanism that constitute, in effect, brief aphorisms that capture Satanic philosophy.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=192}} The first three statements touch on “indulgence”, “vital existence” and “undefiled wisdom” which presents a positive view of the Satanist as a carnal, physical and pragmatic being, where enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, combining elements of Darwinism and Epicureanism. Statement four, five and six deal in matters of ethics, through “kindness to those who deserve it”, “vengeance” and “responsibility to the responsible”, painting a harsh picture of society and human relations by emphasizing justice rather than love. Statements seven, eight and nine reject the dignity of man, sin and the Christian church. Humans are characterized as “just another animal”, traditional “sins” are promoted as means for gratification, and religion as mere business. The adversarial and [[Antinomy|antinomian]] aspect of Satan takes precedence in support of statements four through nine, with non-conformity being presented as a core ideal.{{sfn|Petersen|2011|pp=159-160}}

# Satan represents [[Pleasure|indulgence]] instead of [[abstinence]].
# Satan represents [[Self-preservation|vital existence]] instead of [[Delusion|spiritual pipe dreams]].

# Satan represents [[Unconditional love#Conditional love|kindness to those who deserve it]], instead of [[Unconditional love|love wasted on ingrates]].
# Satan represents [[Revenge|vengeance]] instead of [[turning the other cheek]].
# Satan represents [[Accountability|responsibility to the responsible]] instead of concern for [[Victim playing|psychic vampires]].
# Satan represents man as just another animal who, because of his "[[Anthropocentrism|divine spiritual and intellectual development]]", has become the [[Human–wildlife conflict|most vicious animal of all]].
# Satan represents all of the [[Seven deadly sins|so-called sins]], as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.
# Satan has been the best friend the [[Christian Church|Church]] has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years.&lt;/small&gt;{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2003|1pp=191&amp;ndash;192|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=71|3a1=Van Luijk|3y=2016|3p=297}}

===The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth===

# Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.
# Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
# When in another's lair, show them respect or else do not go there.
# If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat them cruelly and without mercy.
# Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
# Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.
# Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.
# Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.
# Do not harm little children.
# Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.
# When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask them to stop. If they do not stop, destroy them.{{sfn|Drury|2003|pp=192&amp;ndash;193}}

==Rites and practices==

===Rituals and ceremonies===

LaVey emphasized that in his tradition, Satanic rites came in two forms, neither of which were acts of worship; in his terminology, "rituals" were intended to bring about change, whereas "ceremonies" celebrated a particular occasion.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=98|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=97}} These rituals were often considered to be magical acts,{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to aid one's selfish ends.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} Much of LaVeyan ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=98–99}} In ''The Satanic Bible'', LaVey described three types of ritual in his religion: sex rituals designed to attract the desired romantic or sexual partner, compassionate rituals with the intent of helping people (including oneself), and destructive magic which seeks to do harm to others.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} In designing these rituals, LaVey drew upon a variety of older sources, with scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld noting that LaVey "assembled rituals from a hodgepodge of historical sources, literary as well as esoteric".{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=88}}

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|left|[[Eliphas Levi]]'s image of [[Baphomet]] is embraced by LaVeyan Satanists as a symbol of duality, fertility, and the "powers of darkness", serving as the namesake of their primary insignia, [[The Sigil of Baphomet]].]]

LaVey described a number of rituals in his book, ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''; these are "dramatic performances" with specific instructions surrounding the clothing to be worn, the music to be used, and the actions to be taken.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} This attention to detail in the design of the rituals was intentional, with their pageantry and theatricality intending to engage the participants' senses and aesthetic sensibilities at various levels and enhancing the participants' willpower for magical ends.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|pp=97, 98}} LaVey prescribed that male participants should wear black robes, while older women should wear black, and other women should dress attractively in order to stimulate sexual feelings among many of the men.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} All participants are instructed to wear amulets of either the upturned pentagram or the image of [[Baphomet]].{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}}

According to LaVey's instructions, on the altar is to be placed an image of Baphomet. This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the "Elixir of Life", a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an [[aspergillum]], a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}} Although alcohol was consumed in the church's rites, [[drunkenness]] was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}

LaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=98}}
In some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman's body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}} In contrast to longstanding stereotypes about Satanists, there is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=337}} Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=97|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=338}} Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=97}}

LaVey also developed his own [[Black Mass]], which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2012|1pp=96&amp;ndash;97|2a1=Faxneld|2y=2013|2p=76|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=98}} He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of the French fiction writers [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=86}} LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=106&amp;ndash;107}} For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the "Call to Cthulhu" which drew upon the stories of the alien god [[Cthulhu]] authored by American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft's fictional "Old Ones".{{sfn|Petersen|2012|p=106}}

===Holidays===
{{main|Satanic holidays}}

LaVey and the Church of Satan deemed an individual's birthday to be the most important day of the year.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=50|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Lap|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=330}} [[Walpurgisnacht]] (April 30) is celebrated as the date on which LaVey founded his Church.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1pp=50&amp;ndash;51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}} A third annual festival is [[Halloween]], which also has associations with magic and dark entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=51|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=288}}

===Symbolism===
[[Image:SamaelLilithGoatPentagram.png|thumb|right|The Sigil of Baphomet]]
As a symbol of his Satanic church, LaVey adopted the upturned five-pointed pentagram.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} The upturned pentagram had previously been used by the French occultist [[Eliphas Lévi]], and had been adopted by his disciple, [[Stanislas de Guaita]], who merged it with a goat's head in his 1897 book, ''Key of Black Magic''.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=26}} In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the "satanic" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=20}} LaVey learned of this variant of the symbol after it had been reproduced on the front cover of Maurice Bessy's [[coffee table book]], ''Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural''.{{sfnm|1a1=Medway|1y=2001|1p=26|2a1=Lewis|2y=2001b|2p=20}} Feeling that this symbol embodied his philosophy, LaVey decided to adopt it for his Church.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}} In its formative years, the church utilized this image on its membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}}

During the writing of ''The Satanic Bible'', it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the church. LaVey created a new version of Guaita's image, one which was geometrically precise, with two perfect circles surrounding the pentagram, the goat head redrawn, and the Hebrew lettering altered to look more serpentine.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} LaVey had this design copyrighted to the church,{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=21}} claiming authorship under the pseudonym of "Hugo Zorilla".{{sfn|Partridge|2005|p=376}} In doing so, the symbol &amp;ndash; which came to be known as the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2001b|1p=20|2a1=Partridge|2y=2005|2p=376}} &amp;ndash; came to be closely associated with Satanism in the public imagination.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=20}}

==History==

===Origins: 1966–72===
Although there were forms of religious Satanism that predated the creation of LaVeyan Satanism—namely those propounded by [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]] and [[Ben Kadosh]]—these had no unbroken lineage of succession to LaVey's form.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=75}} For this reason, the sociologist of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] stated that "with few exceptions, LaVey is at the origins of all contemporary Satanism".{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=299}} Similarly, the historian Ruben van Luijk claimed that the creation of LaVeyan Satanism marked "the actual beginning of Satanism as a religion such as it is practiced in the world today".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}}

After he came to public attention, LaVey shielded much of his early life in secrecy, and little is known about it for certain.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=295}} He had been born in [[Chicago]] as Howard Stanton Levey in either March or April 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=51|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=300}} He was of mixed Ukrainian, Russian, and German ancestry.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=51}} He claimed to have worked in the [[circus]] and [[carnival]] in the years following the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} and in later years, he also alleged that he worked at the San Francisco Orchestra, although this never existed.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=301}} He also claimed to have had a relationship with a young [[Marilyn Monroe]], although this too was untrue.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=300–301}} 

By the 1960s he was living at 6114 California Street in San Francisco, a house that he had inherited from his parents.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=294, 296}} He took an interest in occultism and amassed a large collection of books on the subject.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} At some point between 1957 and 1960 he began hosting classes at his house every Friday in which lectures on occultism and other subjects were given.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} Among the topics covered were [[freak]]s, [[extra-sensory perception]], [[Spiritualism]], [[cannibalism]], and historical methods of [[torture]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} An informal group established around these lectures, which came to be known as the Magic Circle.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=52|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=296}} Among those affiliated with this gathering were the filmmaker and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] occultist [[Kenneth Anger]],{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} and the anthropologist [[Michael Harner]], who later established the [[core shamanism]] movement.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}}

LaVey likely began preparations for the formation of his [[Church of Satan]] in either 1965 or early 1966,{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=52}} and it was officially founded on [[Walpurgisnacht]] 1966.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=285|3a1=Baddeley|3y=2010|3p=71|4a1=Dyrendal|4a2=Lewis|4a3=Petersen|4y=2016|4p=52}} He then declared that 1966 marked Year One of the new Satanic era.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=297}} It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan,{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the church represented "the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent satanic discourse".{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=81}} Its early members were the attendees of LaVey's Magic Circle, although it soon began attracting new recruits.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} Many of these individuals were sadomasochists or homosexuals, attracted by the LaVeyan openness to different sexual practices.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=346}} LaVey had painted his house black,{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} with it becoming known as "the [[Black House (Church of Satan)|Black House]]",{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2005|1p=428|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2pp=66, 71|3a1=Dyrendal|3a2=Lewis|3a3=Petersen|3y=2016|3p=53}} and it was here that weekly rituals were held every Friday night.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=53}} 

LaVey played up to his Satanic associations by growing a pointed beard and wearing a black cloak and inverted pentagram.{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=188}} He added to his eccentric persona by obtaining unusual pets, including a lion that was kept caged in his back garden.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=296}} Describing himself as the "High Priest of Satan",{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=197}} LaVey defined his position within the church as "monarchical in nature, papal in degree and absolute in power".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} He led the churches' governing Council of Nine,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} and implemented a system of five initiatory levels that the LaVeyan Satanist could advance through by demonstrating their knowledge of LaVeyan philosophy and their personal accomplishments in life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} These were known as Apprentice Satanist I°, Witch or Warlock II°, Priest or Priestess of Mendes III°, Magister IV°, and Magus V°.{{sfn|Drury|2003|p=197}}

The church experienced its "golden age" from 1966 to 1972, when it had a strong media presence.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=136}}  In February 1967, LaVey held a much publicized Satanic wedding, which was followed by the Satanic baptism of his daughter Zeena in May, and then a Satanic funeral in December.{{sfnm|1a1=Petersen|1y=2005|1p=438|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=71|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=309|4a1=van Luijk|4y=2016|4p=297}} Another publicity-attracting event was the "Topless Witch Revue", a nightclub show held on San Francisco's North Beach; the use of topless women to attract attention alienated a number of the church's early members.{{sfnm|1a1=Dyrendal|1a2=Lewis|1a3=Petersen|1y=2016|1p=54|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=346}} Through these and other activities, he soon attracted international media attention, being dubbed "the Black Pope".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=71}} He also attracted a number of celebrities to join his Church, most notably [[Sammy Davis Junior]] and [[Jayne Mansfield]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=286|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72|3a1=Schipper|3y=2010|3pp=105&amp;ndash;106}} LaVey also established branches of the church, known as ''grottos'', in various parts of the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=74}} He may have chosen the term ''grotto'' over ''[[coven]]'' because the latter term had come to be used by practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of [[Wicca]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} These included the Babylon Grotto in [[Detroit]], the Stygian Grotto in [[Dayton]], and the Lilith Grotto in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=74}} In 1971, a Dutch follower of LaVey's, Maarten Lamers, established his own Kerk van Satan grotto in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=519|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=344–345}}

As a result of the success of the film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' and the concomitant growth of interest in Satanism, an editor at [[Avon Books]], Peter Mayer, approached LaVey and commissioned him to write a book, which became ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=72}} While part of the text was LaVey's original writing, other sections of the book consisted of direct quotations from [[Arthur Desmond]]'s right-wing tract ''[[Might is Right]]'' and the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]'s version of [[John Dee]]'s ''Enochian Keys''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=315}} There is evidence that LaVey was inspired by the writings of the American philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]; and while accusations that he plagiarized her work in ''The Satanic Bible'' have been denied by one author, {{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=9}} Chris Mathews stated that "LaVey stole selectively and edited lightly" and that his "Satanism at times closely parallels Ayn Rand's [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Chris. ''Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture'', Praeger Publishers, 2009, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''The Satanic Bible'' served to present LaVey's ideas to a far wider audience than they had previously had.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=72}} In 1972, he published a sequel, ''The Satanic Rituals''.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=298}} 

LaVey's Church emerged at a point in American history when Christianity was on the decline as many of the nation's youth broke away from their parental faith and explored alternative systems of religiosity.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=298}} The milieu in which LaVey's Church was operating was dominated by the [[counterculture of the 1960s]]; his Church reflected some of its concerns &amp;ndash; free love, alternative religions, freedom from church and state &amp;ndash; but ran contrary to some of the counterculture's other main themes, such as peace and love, compassion, and the use of mind-altering drugs.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=295|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=298}} He expressed condemnation of the [[hippies]]; in one ritual he hung an image of [[Timothy Leary]] upside down while stamping on a tablet of [[LSD]].{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=299}}

===Later development: 1972&amp;ndash;present===

[[File:Karla LaVey.jpg|right|thumb|Karla LaVey, founder of the First Satanic Church, in 2012]]

LaVey ceased conducting group rituals and workshops in his home in 1972.{{sfnm|1a1=Lap|1y=2013|1p=84|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=345}}
In 1973, church leaders in Michigan, Ohio, and Florida split to form their own Church of Satanic Brotherhood, however this disbanded in 1974 when one of its founders publicly converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=7}} Subsequently, Church members based in Kentucky and Indiana left to found the [[Ordo Templi Satanis]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=7}} In 1975, LaVey disbanded all grottos, leaving the organisation as a membership-based group that existed largely on paper.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Lap|2y=2013|2p=84|3a1=Introvigne|3y=2016|3p=518}} He claimed that this had been necessary because the grottos had come to be dominated by social misfits who had not benefitted the church as a whole.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} In a private letter, he expressed frustration that despite growing church membership, "brain surgeons and Congressmen are still in short supply".{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=346–347}} He also announced that thenceforth all higher degrees in the church would be awarded in exchange for contributions of cash, real estate, or valuable art.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2003|1p=193|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=347}} Dissatisfied with these actions, in 1975, the high-ranking Church member Michael Aquino left to found his own Satanic organisation, the [[Temple of Set]],{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2003|1pp=193&amp;ndash;194|2a1=Gallagher|2y=2006|2p=160|3a1=Schipper|3y=2010|3p=105}} which differed from LaVey's Church by adopting a belief that Satan literally existed.{{sfn|Schipper|2010|p=109}} According to Lap, from this point on Satanism became a "splintered and disorganized movement".{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=84}}

Between the abolition of the grotto system in 1975 and the establishment of the [[internet]] in the mid-1990s, ''The Satanic Bible'' remained the primary means of propagating Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}} During this period, a decentralized, anarchistic movement of Satanists developed that was shaped by many of the central themes that had pervaded LaVey's thought and which was expressed in ''The Satanic Bible''.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}} Lewis argued that in this community, ''The Satanic Bible'' served as a "quasi-scripture" because these independent Satanists were able to adopt certain ideas from the book while merging them with ideas and practices drawn from elsewhere.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=4}}

During the late 1980s, LaVey returned to the limelight, giving media interviews, attracting further celebrities, and reinstating the grotto system.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} In 1984 he separated from his wife, Diane Hegarty, and began a relationship with Blanche Barton,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=512–513}} who was his personal assistant.{{sfn|Lewis|2001b|p=51}} In 1988 Hegarty brought a court case against LaVey, claiming that he she owned half of the church and LaVey's Black House. The court found in Hegarty's favour, after which LaVey immediately declared bankruptcy.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=377–378}} In May 1992, the ex-couple reached a settlement. The Black House was sold to a wealthy friend, the property developer Donald Werby, who agreed to allow LaVey to continue living at the residence for free.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=378}} Also in 1992, LaVey published his first book in twenty years, ''The Devil's Notebook''.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}} This was followed by the posthumous ''Satan Speaks'' in 1998, which included a foreword from the rock singer [[Marilyn Manson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2p=516}} who was a priest in the church.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=384}}

In his final years, LaVey suffered from a heart condition, displayed increasing paranoia, and died in October 1997.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|2p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2pp=378–379}} In November, the church announced that it would subsequently be run by two High Priestesses of joint rank, Barton and LaVey's daughter [[Karla LaVey]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=516}} That same year, the church established an official website.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=140}} Barton attempted to purchase the Black House from Werby, but was unable to raise sufficient funds; the building had fallen into disrepair and was demolished in 2001, subsequently being replaced with an apartment block.{{sfnm|1a1=Introvigne|1y=2016|1p=516|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} A disagreement subsequently emerged between Barton and Karla, resulting in an agreement that Barton would retain legal ownership of the name and organization of the church while LaVey's personal belongings and copyrights would be distributed among his three children, Karla, Zeena, and Satan Xerxes.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Introvigne|2y=2016|2pp=516–517}} Barton stood down as High Priestess in 2002, although continued to chair the church's Council of Nine.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}} The headquarters of the church were then moved from San Francisco to New York, where [[Peter H. Gilmore]] was appointed the church's High Priest, and his wife Peggy Nadramia as its High Priestess.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}}

[[File:Peter H Gilmore 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan]]

After LaVey's death, conflict over the nature of Satanism intensified within the Satanic community.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=139}} At Halloween 1999 Karla established the [[First Satanic Church]], which uses its website to promote the idea that it represents a direct continuation of the original Church of Satan as founded by Anton LaVey.{{sfnm|1a1=Gallagher|1y=2006|1p=162|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} Other LaVeyan groups appeared elsewhere in the United States. An early member of the Church of Satan, John Dewey Allee, established his own First Church of Satan, claiming allegiance to LaVey's original teachings and professing that LaVey himself had deviated from them in later life.{{sfn|Gallagher|2006|p=162}} In 1986, Paul Douglas Valentine founded the New York City-based [[World Church of Satanic Liberation]], having recruited many of its members through [[Herman Slater]]'s Magickal Childe esoteric store. Its membership remained small and it was discontinued in 2011.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=517}} In 1991, the Embassy of Lucifer was established by the Canadian [[Tsirk Susuej]], which was influenced by LaVeyan teachings but held that Satan was a real entity.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}} Splinter groups from Susuej's organisation included the Embassy of Satan in [[Stewart, British Columbia]], and the Luciferian Light Group in [[Baltimore]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=518}} 

LaVeyan groups also cropped up elsewhere in the world, with a particular concentration in Scandinavia; most of these Scandinavian groups either split from the Church of Satan or never affiliated with it.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} These included the Svenska Satanistkyrkan and the Det Norske Sataniske Samfunn,{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} as well as the Prometheus Grotten of the Church of Satan which was established in Denmark in 1997 but which officially seceded in 2000.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=520}} A Satanic Church was also established in [[Estonia]] based on the LaVeyan model; it later renamed itself the [[Order of the Black Widow]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|pp=519–520}}

The Church of Satan became increasingly doctrinally-rigid and focused on maintaining the purity of LaVeyan Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} The church's increased emphasis on their role as the bearer of LaVey's legacy was partly a response to the growth in non-LaVeyan Satanists.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} Some Church members &amp;ndash; including Gilmore{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=140}} &amp;ndash; claimed that only they were the "real" Satanists and that those belonging to different Satanic traditions were "pseudo" Satanists.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=van Luijk|2y=2016|2p=380}} After examining many of these claims on the church's website, Lewis concluded that it was "''obsessed'' with shoring up its own legitimacy by attacking the heretics, especially those who criticize LaVey".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=7}} Meanwhile, the church experienced an exodus of its membership in the 2000s, with many of these individuals establishing new groups online.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=139}} Although the church's public face had performed little ceremonial activity since the early 1970s, in June 2006 they held a Satanic 'High Mass' in Los Angeles to mark the church's fortieth birthday.{{sfn|Petersen|2012|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}}

==Demographics==

Membership levels of the Church of Satan are hard to determine, as the organisation has not released such information.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=287|2a1=Petersen|2y=2005|2p=430}} During its early years, the church claimed a membership of around 10,000, although defectors subsequently claimed that the number was only in the hundreds.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=344}} Membership was largely, although not exclusively, white.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|pp=369–370}} LaVey recognised this, suggesting that the church appealed particularly to white Americans because they lacked the strong sense of ethnic identity displayed by African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=370}} The historian of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]] suggested that it had never had more than 1000 or 2000 members at its height, but that LaVeyan ideas had had a far greater influence through LaVey's books.{{sfn|Introvigne|2016|p=320}} Membership is gained by paying $225 and filling out a registration statement,{{sfn|Petersen|2005|p=430}} and thus initiates are bestowed with lifetime memberships and not charged annual fees.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=287}}

La Fontaine thought it likely that the easy availability of LaVey's writings would have encouraged the creation of various Satanic groups that were independent of the Church of Satan itself.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In ''The Black Flame'', a number of groups affiliated with the church have been mentioned, most of which are based in the United States and Canada although two groups were cited as having existed in New Zealand.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}} In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] noted that, to his surprise, his findings "consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey's influence on modern Satanism".{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=5}} "Reflecting the dominant influence of Anton LaVey's thought", Lewis noted that the majority of those whom he examined were atheists or agnostics, with 60% of respondents viewing Satanism as a symbol rather than a real entity.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=11}} 20% of his respondents described ''The Satanic Bible'' as the most important factor that attracted them to Satanism.{{sfn|Lewis|2001a|p=15}} Elsewhere, Lewis noted that few Satanists who weren't members of the Church of Satan would regard themselves as "orthodox LaVeyans".{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=2}}
 
Examining the number of LaVeyan Satanists in Britain, in 1995 the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that the Church of Satan had no organized presence in the country.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} He noted that LaVey's writings were widely accessible in British bookshops,{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}} and La Fontaine suggested that there may have been individual Church members within the country.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=100}}

'''Latin lover''' is a stereotypical [[stock character]], part of the [[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]. It appeared for the first time in [[Hollywood]] movies of the 1920s and, for the most part, lost popularity during World War II.&lt;ref name="FE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Filmska enciklopedija, Vol. II, page 20-21|date=1990|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]], [[Zagreb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

The Latin lover was the first male acting type in the history of filmmaking whose behavior and destiny are set through his love relations with a woman, hence ‘lover’ though, as the type was depicted in the beginning, the term ‘seducer’ would be more suitable.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt; Major characteristics describing the type include:

* appearance; he is always handsome or, for the reigning standard of the period, different or atypically looking.
* behavior; the way he conquers women, using focused, sharp glare, and certain mannerism characterized by outbursts of passion, dancing, etc.
* type of roles; he is usually a romantic, exotic hero and foreigner, mostly a historical person or [[character (arts)|character in literature]], often a victim of an intrigue which insinuates the doomed affair.
* [[genre]]; mostly [[melodrama]]s, and if it happens to be some other type of a movie, it must have melodramatic overtones.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

When he appeared, the Latin lover was opposed to the absolutely dominant type of male character in Hollywood at the time, a man of action, who represented a fighter for justice, freedom or some other cause. At the same time, the Latin lover was the first distinct non-American type. It was the result of several factors: crisis of faith in the supremacy of a male as a consequence of the horrors of World War I, growing female emancipation but also Hollywood’s effort to conquer the film markets of Europe, whose audience was deemed more refined at the time. Due to the non-American attributes of the type and a fact that a noticeable number of European actors moved their careers to Hollywood, some film historians, like [[Enno Patalas]], prefer the term ‘stranger’ instead of a ‘lover’.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

== Origin ==

Because of the American idea what a Latin lover should look like (dark hair, darker complexion), initial representatives of the type were indeed of Latin American or Mediterranean origin. Most popular among the first were Italian-born [[Rudolph Valentino]] and [[Ramon Novarro]], born in [[Mexico]]. Director [[George Fitzmaurice]], who directed Valentino in several of his movies, was very important for the launching of Latin lover character. Valentino is universally considered as the supreme representative of the type in the film history. Symbol of what lover should be and look like in the 1920s, his enormous popularity was enhanced by the unusual personal life and a fact that he was the first male star whose private life was compared to the characters he played. Building of the Valentino myth was sealed with his premature death at the age of 31. They were followed by other typecast actors like [[Ricardo Cortez]], [[Antonio Moreno]], [[Gilbert Roland]], [[Rod La Rocque]] and [[Adolphe Menjou]], the first who brought a certain measure of cynicism to the type.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

As the Latin lovers rapidly gained popularity with the audience, the ‘non-Latin’ characteristics increased, so the variations of the type developed, which made the use of ‘stranger’ instead of ‘lover’ more acceptable. In Great Britain, the originator was [[Ivor Novello]] and [[Ronald Colman]] added the [[Englishness]], creating the type of an English gentleman. [[Mitteleuropa|Central European]] and local German flavors were presented by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Conrad Veidt]], respectively, while very popular French exemplar was [[Ivan Mosjoukine]].&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

When it comes to the American actors in the later silent period, almost without any competition from other fellow actors, the type was embodied by [[John Barrymore]] and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. In the sound period, most popular American actors of the type were [[William Powell]], [[Fredric March]], [[Melvyn Douglas]] and commercially extremely successful [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Tyrone Power]]. ‘French lover cliché’ type was created by [[Charles Boyer]], while popular British actors, prior to the World War II, include [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard]], [[Robert Donat]], [[David Niven]] and [[James Mason]]. Britons in general added much more realism to the type, while Mason represented a bit of a ‘sadistic’ derivative. [[Massimo Girotti]] was Italian version.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

Though actors like [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Anthony Quinn]] are sometimes placed in this category,&lt;ref name=orlando&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-05-10/news/0205090402_1_latin-lovers-italian-gigolo-swarthy | author = Deborah Hornblow | title = Why The Latin Lover Is Hollywood's Type | date = 10 May 2002 | publisher = [[Orlando Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite book | title = Hollywood's Latin Lovers: Latino, Italian and French Men Who Make the Screen Smolder | date = 1998 | author = Victoria Thomas | publisher = ''Angel City Press'' | isbn = 978-18-8331-841-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they actually belonged to the adventurer or the [[swashbuckler]] type.&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;

== After World War II ==

Outbreak of the war made the type look totally obsolete, so after the war ended only rare actors appeared in the type, and even then, only for the short period of their careers: [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Gérard Philipe]] in the late 1940s, [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Rossano Brazzi]] in the 1950s and [[Omar Sharif]] in the late 1960s. [[Marcello Mastroianni]] did some type acting but also very effectively evoked and parodied it in several roles, while only partially it was represented by [[Robert Redford]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Michael York]] in the 1970s. Still, the type survived through the 1980s in the cinema of South America&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt; and was revived to some extent in the 1990s with [[Antonio Banderas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/stereotypes-latinos| title=Antonio Banderas, The Latin Lover, &amp; Other Latin Stereotypes| author=Viviana Ojeda| date=August 10, 2016| website=Odyssey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite book | title = Hollywood: Cultural dimensions: ideology, identity and cultural industry studies | date = 2004 | author = Thomas Schatz | publisher = ''[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]'' | isbn = 0415281318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Latin lovers of the world cinema, partially or through their whole careers, include [[Warner Baxter]], [[Ivan Petrovich]], [[Pierre Blanchard]], [[George Raft]],  [[Cesar Romero]], [[Fernando Lamas]], [[Ricardo Montalban]], [[John Gavin]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]],&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndn&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hollywood-latin-lovers-long-lurid-history-article-1.1612214 | author = Robert Dominguez | title = Hollywood’s Latin Lovers have a long and lurid history | date = 12 February 2014 | publisher = [[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Paul Belmondo]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[John Travolta]], [[Andy Garcia]]&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;, [[Olivier Martinez]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vogue.it/en/uomo-vogue/look-of-the-day/2011/05/olivier-martinez?refresh_ce= | author = Camilla Piccitto | title = Olivier Martinez - The cool look of a modern Casanova | date = 16 May 2011 | publisher = [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent Perez]].&lt;ref name=orlando/&gt;

In time, the term spread to other arts, like the music, with typical representatives being father and son [[Julio Iglesias]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]].&lt;ref name=ndn/&gt;

'''Latticework''' is an [[openwork]] framework consisting of a criss-crossed pattern of strips of building material, typically [[wood]] or [[metal]]. The design is created by crossing the strips to form a grid or weave.&lt;ref name=ching&gt;

Latticework in stone or wood from the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] is also called '''transenna''' (plural '''transenne''').

In [[India]], the house of a rich or noble person may be built with a ''baramdah'' or [[verandah]] surrounding every level leading to the living area. The upper floors often have balconies overlooking the street that are shielded by latticed screens carved in stone called [[jali]]s which keep the area cool and give privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">A '''Christian dance company''' is a [[dance company]] usually specializing in [[ballet]] that uses dance as a [[Christian ministry|ministry]] to reach out to non-Christians, strengthen the [[faith]] of [[Christians]], and to bring joy to poor countries or devastated areas.

Christian dance companies perform, and up to the time of the performance usually participate in [[missionary]] style work in the area they have traveled to, engaging in activities such as feeding the homeless or building housing in rural areas.

This page is a '''list of cities and venues that have hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]''', one or more times. Future venues are shown in ''italics''. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]], the host city has customarily been in the winner country of the previous year. [[Eurovision Song Contest#Host country|There have been exceptions]], however, when certain issues have prevented the winner from hosting the following year's contest. Hosting then passed to the country that had come second, or to another country that agreed to host. Such events occurred in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|1960]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history#By_year The history of the Eurovision Song Contest - By year] Official Eurovision Website History. Accessed May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

With 6 contests, [[Dublin]] is the city that has hosted the most frequently. It is followed by [[London]] and [[Luxembourg_(city)|Luxembourg]] (4 contests each), and [[Copenhagen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/event/melodigrandprix/koebenhavn-bliver-vaert-internationalt-melodi-grand-prix|title=København bliver vært for internationalt Melodi Grand Prix|work=DR|access-date=2017-05-08|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stockholm]] (3 contests each).

[[Croatia]] is the only country to have hosted the contest, without winning directly.

==Host City Insignia==
[[File:ESC Host City Insignia.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Host City Insignia on display inside the [[Rathaus,_Vienna|Rathaus]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in May 2015. ]]
'''Host City Insignia''' is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the Helsinki Senate Square attached to the key ring. The idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] and [[EBU]] in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: "Eurovision Song Contest Host City", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers. The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI Team and the ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Badzic|first1=Milenko|title=Host City Insignia Exchange &amp; Semi-Final Allocation Draw|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&amp;type=Press|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327081350/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&amp;type=Press|archivedate=27 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martial temples''', ({{zh|c=武庙|p=wǔmiào}}), also translated as '''military temples''' or '''warrior temples''', are Chinese temples dedicated to worshiping outstanding military leaders and strategists (excluding kings and emperors). They were often built by the governments as the counterpart of civil temples (''wenmiao'') or [[Temple of Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWvfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Civil-Military Relations in Chinese History: From Ancient China to the Communist Takeover|editor=Kai Filipiak |page=134 |isbn=9781317573449 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1N5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Global and Regional in China’s Nation-Formation |author= Prasenjit Duara |page=87 |isbn=9781134015306|publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples that worshiped both civil and military gods are called [[Wenwu temple]] (''wenwumiao'').

Martial temples originated from China in 731 BC, initially for worshiping 11 strategists, among whom [[Jiang Ziya]] was the dominant figure. The rest of the 10 strategists with comparatively inferior status were called ''Shizhe'' (十哲), which means "Ten Wise Men", among whom [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] had the highest status, only below [[Jiang Ziya]]. It was supposed to be worshipped in spring and autumn, and the formality would be similar to the worshiping of the [[Temple of Confucius]]. 

The people being worshipped in the temple however changed in subsequent periods of history. In Qing Dynasty, [[Guan Yu]] (as Guandi or Wudi, the God of War) became the major god in the Martial Temple. Offerings may be made to Guandi on the 15th day or the second month and the 13th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rY4gBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Guandi |title=Gods &amp; Goddesses of Ancient China|editor= Trenton Campbell |publisher=Rosen Education Service |isbn=9781622753949}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Republic of China established in 1912, the government promoted the joint worshiping of [[Guan Yu]] and [[Yue Fei]], the latter was considered a [[folk hero|national hero]] in defending Southern Song Dynasty from the invasion of Jurchen Jin. 24 other strategists in the history were also worshiped along Guan Yu and Yue Fei, but with lower status. After the People's Republic of China established in 1949, the government no longer officially promoted Martial Temple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20488">[[File:Hierarchical Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|right|280px|Adapted from the Hierarchical Model of Collins and Quillian (1969)]]

The '''mental lexicon''' is defined as a mental dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=R.S|title=Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, and Evolution|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental lexicon is a construct used in [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, [[Mental representation|representations]]. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct.

The mental lexicon differs from the [[lexicon]] in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the [[dual-coding theory]], [[Chomsky]]'s [[Universal grammar|nativist theory]], as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon.

Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima,|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time.|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology|year=2010|volume=25|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation.&lt;ref name=jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Nan|title=Lexical Representation and Development in a Second Language|journal=Applied Linguistics|year=2000|volume=21|pages=47–77|doi=10.1093/applin/21.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inquiry==
Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental "dictionary", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Jean"&gt;{{cite book | author = Aitchison, Jean | title = Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as [[slips of the tongue]], which showed that replacing words such as ''anecdote'' for ''antidote''.&lt;ref name = "Jean"/&gt;

Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful.&lt;ref name = "CLA"&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Linguistic Analysis (5th Custom Edition for U of A) | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | location = Toronto, ON | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a [[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]  task.&lt;ref name="CLA"/&gt;

'''Lexical Decision Tasks''' have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Gerry|title=The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198523777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more "active" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word "bread" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word "butter". Since the word "bread" had activated all related words, including "butter", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon.&lt;ref name=altman /&gt; By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words.

==Theories and perspectives==
Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words "in some sort of dictionary."&lt;ref name="Access"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Accessing the Mental Lexicon | url = http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090807014649/http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | archivedate = 2009-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another states that the mental lexicon is "a collection of highly complex neural circuits".&lt;ref name = "Access"/&gt; The latter, '''Semantic Network Theory''', proposes the idea of ''spreading activation'', which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Kenneth|author2=Chambers|title=Lexical Access and Naming Time|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=627–635|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(73)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marslen-Wilson|first=William|title=Functional Parallelism in Spoken Word-Recognition|journal=Cognition|date=March 1987|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=71–102|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Priming''' is a term used in Lexical Decision Tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word "activation" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread "primed" butter to be retrieved quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traxler|first=Matthew|title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405198621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Neighborhood Effects''' refer to the activation of all similar "neighbors" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word "game" has the neighbors "came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave," giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of "game". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Sally|title=Frequency and Neighborhood Effects on Lexical Access: Activation or Search?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1989|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.5.802|pages=802–814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Frequency Effects''' suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task.&lt;ref name="Access"/&gt;

==Development==

=== First language development ===
[[File:Chart updated.jpg|thumb|Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.]]One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;

The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., ''mama, daddy, dog'').&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt; [[Fast mapping]] is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heibeck|first=Tracy|author2=Ellen M. Markman|title=Word Learning in Children: An Examination of Fast Mapping|journal=Child Development|year=1987|volume=58|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.2307/1130543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that, despite the [[fast mapping]] hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= G.A |year= 1986|title= Dictionaries in the mind |journal= Language and Cognitive Processes |volume= 1|issue=3 |pages=171–185 |doi=10.1080/01690968608407059}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;{{Clear}}

As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the [[lexeme]] and the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]].&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt; The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levelt | first=Willem| authorlink = Willem Levelt | title=Accessing Words in Speech Production: Stages, Processes and Representations|journal=Cognition|year=1992|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90038-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops.&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt;

[[File:Structure of a lexical entry.png|thumb|The Internal Structure of a Lexical Entry (adapted from [[Willem Levelt|Levelt]] 1989).]]

=== Bilingual development ===

The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons.&lt;ref name=bia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|title=Reshaping the Mind: The Benefits of Bilingualism|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=229–235|doi=10.1037/a0025406|pmc=4341987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years.&lt;ref name=bia /&gt;

==Brain==
Studies have shown that the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulvermüller, F. | title = Nouns and verbs in the intact brain: Evidence from event-related potentials and high-frequency cortical responses | journal = Tübingen: Oxford Journals | volume = 9 | pages = 497–506 | year = 1999 | doi=10.1093/cercor/9.5.497}} http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain:

# '''Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH):''' this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adorni, R. |author2=Proverbio, A. | title = New insights into name category-related effects: is the age of acquisition a possible factor? | journal = Milan: BioMed Central | volume = 5 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmc=2726156 | pmid=19640289 | doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Domain-Specific Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;
# '''Sensory/Functional Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;

==Impaired access ==

[[Anomic aphasia]], [[aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia|expressive]] + [[receptive aphasia]]) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can all affect recalling or retrieving words.  Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people,&lt;ref name = "Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-therapy-on-video.com/receptiveaphasia.html |title=Improving Receptive Aphasia: Your Source of Information and solutions |publisher=Speech-therapy-on-video.com |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt;

Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders.&lt;ref name = "Diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldiseases.org/what-is-a-dysnomia/ |title=What Is A Dysnomia? |publisher=Alldiseases.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of [[nonce words]].&lt;ref name = "Diseases"/&gt;

Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Harry A | title = Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language  | chapter =  Alzheimer's Disease | pages = 19–22| location = Oxford, UK: Elsevier Ltd | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"/&gt; Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.

== Shrinking ==

The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their "mental dictionary" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time |year=2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==

===Storage of acronyms===

As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brysbaert|first=M|author2=S Speybroeck |author3=D Vanderelst |title=Is there room for the BBC in the mental lexicon? On the recognition of acronyms.|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=1832–1842|doi=10.1080/17470210802585471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongolic languages''' are a group of languages spoken in [[East Asia|East]]-[[Central Asia|Central]] Asia, mostly in [[Mongolia]] and surrounding areas plus in [[Kalmykia]]. The best-known member of this language family, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], is the primary language of most of the residents of [[Mongolia]] and the Mongolian residents of [[Inner Mongolia]], with an estimated 5.7+ million speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Svantesson|Tsendina|Karlsson|Franzén|2005||p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest relatives of the Mongolic languages appear to be the extinct [[Khitan language|Khitan]]&lt;ref name=Janhunen/&gt; and [[Tuyuhun language|Tuyuhun]] languages. Some linguists have grouped Mongolic with [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], and possibly [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] as part of the controversial [[Altaic languages|Altaic family]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvcoltxt|Starostin|Dybo|Mudrak|2003}}; contra e.g. {{harvcoltxt|Vovin|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[Mongolian language#Linguistic history|Historical Mongolic]]:
* [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]] (depending on classification spoken from the 13th century until the early 15th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Rybatzki|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; or late 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Poppe|1964|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;; given the almost entire lack of written sources for the period in between, an exact cutoff point cannot be established)
* [[Classical Mongolian language|Classical Mongolian]], from approximately 1700 to 1900

Contemporary Mongolic:
* [[Daur language|Daur]] - 96,000 speakers
* Central Mongolic
** [[Khamnigan Mongol|Khamnigan]] - 2,000 speakers
** [[Buryat language|Buryat]] - 330,000 speakers
** [[Mongolian language|Khalkha]] - 5.2 million speakers
** [[Ordos Mongolian|Ordos]] - 123,000 speakers
** [[Oirat language|Oirat]] (including [[Kalmyk Oirat|Kalmyk]]) - 360,000 speakers
* Southern Mongolic (part of a Gansu–Qinghai [[Sprachbund]])
** [[Eastern Yugur language|Shira Yugur]] - 4,000 speakers
** Shirongolic
*** [[Monguor language|Monguor]] - 150,000 speakers
*** [[Bonan language|Bonan]] - 6,000 speakers
*** [[Santa language|Santa]] (Dongxiang) - 200,000 speakers
*** [[Kangjia language|Kangjia]] - 1,000 speakers
* [[Moghol language|Moghol]] 200 speakers

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2007) identifies the extinct Tabγač or [[Tuoba language]] as a Mongolic language.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2007. ‘Once again on the Tabγač language.’ Mongolian Studies XXIX: 191-206.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chen (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Sanping 2005. Turkic or Proto-Mongolian? A Note on the Tuoba Language. Central Asiatic Journal 49.2: 161-73.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Tuoba (Tabγač) was a [[Turkic language]].

The classification and numbers of speakers above follow Janhunen (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Janhunen|2006|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for Southern Mongolic, which follows Nugteren (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nugteren|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another classificational approach,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sečenbaγatur et al. (2005:193–194)&lt;/ref&gt; there is a tendency to call Central Mongolian a language consisting of Mongolian proper, Oirat and Buryat, while Ordos (and implicitly also Khamnigan) is seen as a variety of Mongolian proper. Within Mongolian proper, they then draw a distinction between Khalkha on the one hand and [[Southern Mongolian]] (containing everything else) on the other hand. A less common subdivision of Central Mongolic is to divide it into a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk), and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Luvsanvandan|1959}} quoted from Sečenbaγatur et al. (2005:167–168)&lt;/ref&gt; The broader delimitation of Mongolian may be based on [[mutual intelligibility]], but an analysis based on a [[Phylogenetic tree#Limitations|tree diagram]] such as the one above faces other problems because of the close contacts between, for example, Buryat and Khalkha Mongols during history, thus creating or preserving a [[dialect continuum]]. Another problem lies in the sheer comparability of terminology, as Western linguists use ''language'' and ''dialect'', while Mongolian linguists use the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimmian]] trichotomy ''language'' (kele), ''dialect'' (nutuγ-un ayalγu) and ''Mundart'' (aman ayalγu).

==Pre-Proto-Mongolic==
Pre-Proto-Mongolic is the name for the stage of Mongolic that precedes Proto-Mongolic. Proto-Mongolic can be clearly identified chronologically with the language spoken by the Mongols during Genghis Khan's early expansion in the 1200-1210s. Pre-Proto-Mongolic by contrast is a continuum that stretches back indefinitely in time. It is divided into ''Early Pre-Proto-Mongolic'' and ''Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic''. Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic refers to the Mongolic spoken a few centuries before Proto-Mongolic by the Mongols and neighboring tribes like the Merkits and Keraits. Certain archaic words and features in Written Mongol go back past Proto-Mongolic to Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic (Janhunen 2006). In the case of Early Pre-Proto-Mongolic certain loanwords in the Mongolic languages point to early contact with Oghur (Bulgharic) Turkic also known as r-Turkic. These loanwords precede Common Turkic (z-Turkic) loanwords and include Mongolic ''ikere'' (twins) from Bulgharic ''ikir'' (versus Common Turkic ''ekiz''), ''hüker'' (ox) from Bulgharic ''hekür'' (Common Turkic ''öküz''), ''jer'' (weapon) from Bulgharic ''jer'' (Common Turkic ''yäz''), ''biragu'' (calf) versus Common Turkic ''buzagu'' and ''siri-'' (to smelt ore) versus Common Turkic ''siz-'' (to melt). These are thought to have been borrowed from Oghur Turkic during the time of the Xiongnu. Subsequent Turkic people in Mongolia all spoke forms of Common Turkic (z-Turkic) as opposed to Oghur (Bulgharic) Turkic which withdrew to the west in the 4th century. The Chuvash language spoken by 1 million people in European Russia is the only living representative of Oghur Turkic which split from Common Turkic around the 1st century CE. Words in Mongolic like ''dayir'' (brown, Common Turkic ''yagiz'') and ''nidurga'' (fist, Common Turkic ''yudruk'') with initial *d and *n versus Common Turkic *y are sufficiently archaic to indicate loans from an earlier stage of Oghur (Proto-Bulgharic) since Chuvash and Common Turkic do not differ in these features despite differing fundamentally in rhotacism-lambdacism (Janhunen 2006). Oghur tribes lived in the Mongolian borderlands before the 5th century and provided Oghur loanwords to Early Pre-Proto-Mongolic before Common Turkic loanwords.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=31}}

==Proto-Mongolic==
{{see also|Proto-Mongolic language|Middle Mongol language}}

'''Proto-Mongolic''', the ancestor language of the modern Mongolic languages, is very close to Middle Mongol, the language spoken at the time of [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongol Empire]]. Most features of modern Mongolic languages can thus be reconstructed from Middle Mongol. An exception would be the voice suffix like -caga- 'do together', which can be reconstructed from the modern languages but is not attested in Middle Mongol.

One can speculate that the languages of [[Donghu people|Donghu]], [[Wuhuan]], and [[Xianbei]] might be related to Proto-Mongolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Andrews|1999|p=72}}, "[...] believed that at least some of their constituent tribes spoke a Mongolian language, though there is still some argument that a particular variety of Turkic may have been spoken among them."&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Tuoba|Tabghach]], the language of the founders of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty for which the surviving evidence is very sparse, and Khitan, for which evidence exists that is written in the two [[Khitan scripts]] which have as yet not been fully deciphered, a direct affiliation to Mongolic can now be taken to be most likely or even demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;see Vovin 2007 for Tabghach and Janhunen 2012 for Khitan&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{vanchor|Para-Mongolic}}==
The extinct [[Khitan language]] is a "Para-Mongolic" language, meaning that it is related to the Mongolic languages as a [[sister group]], rather than as a direct descendant of Proto-Mongolic.&lt;ref name=Janhunen/&gt;

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2015) identifies the extinct [[Tuyuhun language]] as yet another Para-Mongolic language.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/24403941/Some_notes_on_the_Tuyuhun_%E5%90%90%E8%B0%B7%E6%B8%BE_language_in_the_footsteps_of_Paul_Pelliot Some notes on the Tuyuhun (吐谷渾) language: in the footsteps of Paul Pelliot].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12135">'''Musical acoustics''' or '''music acoustics''' is a branch of [[acoustics]] concerned with researching and describing the [[physics]] of [[music]] – how [[sound]]s are employed to make music. Examples of areas of study are the function of [[musical instruments]], the [[human voice]] (the physics of [[Interpersonal communication|speech]] and [[singing]]), computer analysis of [[melody]], and in the clinical use of music in [[music therapy]].

*[[Range (music)|Frequency range of music]]
*[[Frequency analysis]]
*Computer [[Musical analysis|analysis]] of musical structure
*[[Sound synthesis|Synthesis]] of musical sounds

==Physical aspects==

[[Image:Spectrogram showing shared partials.png|frame|A spectrogram of a violin playing a note and then a perfect fifth above it. The shared partials are highlighted by the white dashes.]]
Whenever two different pitches are played at the same time, their sound waves interact with each other – the highs and lows in the air pressure reinforce each other to produce a different sound wave. Any repeating sound wave that is not a sine wave can be modeled by many different sine waves of the appropriate frequencies and amplitudes (a [[frequency spectrum]]). In [[human]]s the [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] apparatus (composed of the [[ear]]s and [[brain]]) can usually isolate these tones and hear them distinctly. When two or more tones are played at once, a variation of air pressure at the ear "contains" the pitches of each, and the ear and/or brain isolate and decode them into distinct tones.

When the original sound sources are perfectly periodic, the [[Musical note|note]] consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] and the [[harmonic]]s, [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partial]]s, or [[overtone]]s. The sounds have [[harmonic]] [[frequency spectrum|frequency spectra]]. The lowest frequency present is the fundamental, and is the frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency for the total wave to be exactly the same each cycle. Real instruments are close to periodic, but the frequencies of the overtones are slightly imperfect, so the shape of the wave changes slightly over time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Subjective aspects==

Variations in [[air]] [[pressure]] against the [[ear]] drum, and the subsequent physical and neurological processing and interpretation, give rise to the subjective experience called ''[[sound]]''. Most sound that people recognize as [[music]]al is dominated by [[Periodic function|periodic]] or regular vibrations rather than non-periodic ones; that is, musical sounds typically have a [[definite pitch]]).  The transmission of these variations through air is via a sound [[wave]]. In a very simple case, the sound of a [[sine wave]], which is considered the most basic model of a sound waveform, causes the air pressure to increase and decrease in a regular fashion, and is heard as a very pure tone. Pure tones can be produced by [[tuning fork]]s or [[whistling]]. The rate at which the air pressure oscillates is the [[frequency]] of the tone, which is measured in oscillations per second, called [[hertz]]. Frequency is the primary determinant of the perceived [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Frequency of musical instruments can change with altitude due to changes in air pressure.

==Pitch ranges of musical instruments==

{{Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges}}

== Harmonics, partials, and overtones ==

[[Image:Moodswingerscale.svg|thumb|250px|[[Scale of harmonics]]]]

The [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] is the frequency at which the entire wave vibrates. Overtones are other sinusoidal components present at frequencies above the fundamental. All of the frequency components that make up the total waveform, including the fundamental and the overtones, are called [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partial]]s. Together they form the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]].

Overtones that are perfect integer multiples of the fundamental are called [[harmonic]]s. When an overtone is near to being harmonic, but not exact, it is sometimes called a harmonic partial, although they are often referred to simply as harmonics. Sometimes overtones are created that are not anywhere near a harmonic, and are just called partials or inharmonic overtones.

The fundamental frequency is considered the ''first harmonic'' and the ''first partial.''  The numbering of the partials and harmonics is then usually the same; the second partial is the second harmonic, etc.  But if there are inharmonic partials, the numbering no longer coincides. Overtones are numbered as they appear ''above'' the fundamental. So strictly speaking, the ''first'' overtone is the ''second'' partial (and usually the ''second'' harmonic). As this can result in confusion, only harmonics are usually referred to by their numbers, and overtones and partials are described by their relationships to those harmonics.

== Harmonics and non-linearities ==

[[Image:Symmetric_and_asymmetric_waveforms.svg|thumb|A symmetric and asymmetric waveform. The red (upper) wave contains only the fundamental and odd harmonics; the green (lower) wave contains the fundamental and even harmonics.]]

When a periodic wave is composed of a fundamental and only odd harmonics (f, 3f, 5f, 7f, ...), the summed wave is ''half-wave [[symmetric]]''; it can be inverted and phase shifted and be exactly the same.  If the wave has any even harmonics (0f, 2f, 4f, 6f, ...), it is asymmetrical; the top half is not a mirror image of the bottom.

Conversely, a system that changes the shape of the wave (beyond simple scaling or shifting) creates additional harmonics ([[harmonic distortion]]). This is called a ''[[non-linear]] system''. If it affects the wave symmetrically, the harmonics produced are all odd. If it affects the harmonics asymmetrically, at least one even harmonic is produced (and probably also odd harmonics).

==Harmony==

{{Main|Harmony}}

If two notes are simultaneously played, with frequency [[ratio]]s that are simple fractions (e.g. 2/1, 3/2 or 5/4), the composite wave is still periodic, with a short period—and the combination sounds [[consonance and dissonance|consonant]]. For instance, a note vibrating at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz and a note vibrating at 300&amp;nbsp;Hz (a [[perfect fifth]], or 3/2 ratio, above 200&amp;nbsp;Hz) add together to make a wave that repeats at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz: every 1/100 of a second, the 300&amp;nbsp;Hz wave repeats three times and the 200&amp;nbsp;Hz wave repeats twice. Note that the total wave repeats at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, but there is no actual 100&amp;nbsp;Hz sinusoidal component.

Additionally, the two notes have many of the same partials. For instance, a note with a fundamental frequency of 200&amp;nbsp;Hz has harmonics at: :(200,) 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, …

A note with fundamental frequency of 300&amp;nbsp;Hz has harmonics at: :(300,) 600, 900, 1200, 1500, … 
The two notes share harmonics at 600 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, and more coincide further up the series.

The combination of composite waves with short fundamental frequencies and shared or closely related partials is what causes the sensation of harmony. When two frequencies are near to a simple fraction, but not exact, the composite wave cycles slowly enough to hear the cancellation of the waves as a steady pulsing instead of a tone. This is called [[beat (acoustics)|beating]], and is considered unpleasant, or [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]].

The frequency of beating is calculated as the difference between the frequencies of the two notes. For the example above, |200&amp;nbsp;Hz - 300&amp;nbsp;Hz| = 100&amp;nbsp;Hz. As another example, a combination of 3425&amp;nbsp;Hz and 3426&amp;nbsp;Hz would beat once per second (|3425&amp;nbsp;Hz - 3426&amp;nbsp;Hz| = 1&amp;nbsp;Hz).  This follows from [[modulation]] theory.

The difference between consonance and dissonance is not clearly defined, but the higher the beat frequency, the more likely the interval is dissonant. [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] proposed that maximum dissonance would arise between two pure tones when the beat rate is roughly 35&amp;nbsp;Hz. [http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Music829B/roughness.html]

==Scales==

{{Main|Musical scale}}

The material of a musical composition is usually taken from a collection of pitches known as a [[Musical scale|scale]]. Because most people cannot adequately determine [[Absolute pitch|absolute]] frequencies, the identity of a scale lies in the ratios of frequencies between its tones (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]).

{{Main|Just intonation}}

The [[diatonic scale]] appears in writing throughout history, consisting of seven tones in each [[octave]]. In [[just intonation]] the diatonic scale may be easily constructed using the three simplest intervals within the octave, the [[perfect fifth]] (3/2), [[perfect fourth]] (4/3), and the [[major third]] (5/4).&lt;!-- Though many musicians know that the diatonic scale is Tone Tone Semi-Tone Tone Tone Tone Semi-Tone. Present the relation-ship of tones and semi-tones... we should add this here along with our sources for the preceding section (user:CyclePat) --&gt; As forms of the fifth and third are naturally present in the [[overtone series]] of harmonic resonators, this is a very simple process.

The following table shows the ratios between the frequencies of all the notes of the just [[major scale]] and the fixed frequency of the first note of the scale.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! C !! D !! E !! F !! G !! A !! B !! C
|-
| 1 || 9/8 || 5/4 || 4/3 || 3/2 || 5/3 || 15/8 || 2
|}

There are other scales available through just intonation, for example the [[minor scale]]. Scales that do not adhere to just intonation, and instead have their intervals adjusted to meet other needs are called [[Musical temperament|''temperaments'']], of which [[equal temperament]] is the most used. Temperaments, though they obscure the acoustical purity of just intervals, often have desirable properties, such as a closed [[circle of fifths]].

==Background==

The creation of Oral History of American Music was a result of [[musicology|musicologist]] Vivian Perlis's research on the life of American composer [[Charles Ives]], for which she interviewed sixty individuals who had known him personally. During the course of the interviews, Perlis recognized the need for a larger project that would collect and preserve the oral history of American composers, and began the OHAM project in 1969 with that intent.&lt;ref name="Musicworks"&gt;{{cite journal|title=In the Voice of the Artist: An Interview with Vivian Perlis|journal=Musicworks|date=Autumn 1991|issue=51|pages=22–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perlis's interviews with friends, family and colleagues of Ives became OHAM's initial collection, and were later used in her 1974 book, ''Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Dale|title=Saving a Spoken Soundscape|publisher=New Haven Register|date=February 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she received the [[American Musicological Society]]'s Otto Kinkeldey Award—the first time it had been awarded either to a woman or for work on American music.&lt;ref name="Kinkeldey Winners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Otto Kinkeldey Award Winners|url=http://www.ams-net.org/awards/kinkeldeywinners.php|website=American Musicological Society|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Perlis's biography of Ives, the project's collection played an instrumental role in a number of other historical works: ''A Good Dissonance Like a Man'', a documentary film about Ives;&lt;ref name=Newsletter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John J.|title=Oral History, American Music Celebrates 10th Birthday|journal=New England Association for Oral History Newsletter|date=Fall 1981|volume=6|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Copland]]'s two-volume autobiography ''Copland: 1900 through 1942'' and ''Copland: Since 1943'', co-written with Perlis;&lt;ref name=Alumni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Sharon|title=Let's Talk Music|journal=Yale Alumni Magazine|date=May 1991|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book ''Composers' Voices from Ives to Ellington'', co-written by Perlis and [[Libby Van Cleve]].&lt;ref name="NYT Wise"/&gt; Perlis served as the project's director until she retired in 2010 and was succeeded by its current director, Van Cleve.&lt;ref name="YSM Retirement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivian Perlis announces retirement from Oral History of American Music project|url=http://music.yale.edu/2010/07/27/vivian-perlis-announces-retirement-from-oral-history-of-american-music-project/|website=Yale School of Music Website|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHAM expanded through interviews conducted by Perlis, Van Cleve and others, as well as by acquisitions of recordings from scholars, radio producers, and concert presenters. Its largest component today is the Major Figures in American Music series, which primarily documents classical composers at varying stages in their careers. OHAM also holds five series of extensive interviews centered around specific persons and topics.&lt;ref name="OHAM More About"/&gt;

Grants to preserve and digitize OHAM's recordings have come from the [[Grammy Foundation]],&lt;ref name="GRAMMY"&gt;{{cite web|title=GRAMMY Foundation Grant Recipients|url=https://www.grammy.org/grammy-foundation/grants/past-recipients|website=GRAMMY.org|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation,&lt;ref name="Delmas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Library Program Grants, 1993–2015|url=http://delmas.org/grants/past-grants/research-library-grants/|website=The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]],&lt;ref name="NEH1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RO-*1335-80|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-20497-83|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEH3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Details|url=https://securegrants.neh.gov/PublicQuery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=RC-21182-87|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Save America's Treasures]] initiative.&lt;ref name="Save America's Treasures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Save America's Treasure Awards 1999–2010 by State|url=http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/SAT%20Awards%201999-2010%20Table_2.pdf|publisher=Save America's Treasures|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Aaron Copland]] Fund for Music donated $500,000 to establish an endowment fund for the organization.&lt;ref name="YaleNews Copland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale's Oral History of American Music Project Receives Endowment Support from the Aaron Copland Fund for Music|url=http://news.yale.edu/2009/12/03/yale-s-oral-history-american-music-project-receives-endowment-support-aaron-copland-fund-|website=YaleNews|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''ordinal numbers''' (or '''ordinal numerals''') are words representing position or rank in a [[sequential]] order; the order may be of size, importance, chronology, and so on (e.g., "third", "tertiary"). They differ from [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numerals]], which represent quantity (e.g., "three") and other types of numerals. In traditional grammar, all [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, including ordinal numerals, are grouped into a separate [[part of speech]] ({{lang-la|nomen numerale}}, hence, "noun numeral" in older English grammar books); however, in modern interpretations of [[English grammar]], ordinal numerals are usually conflated with [[adjective]]s.

Ordinal numbers may be written in English with numerals and letter suffixes: 1st, 2nd or 2d, 3rd or 3d, 4th, 11th, 21st, 101st, 477th, etc., with the suffix acting as an [[ordinal indicator]].  Written dates often omit the suffix, although it is nevertheless pronounced. For example: 5 November 1605 (pronounced "the fifth of November ... "); November 5, 1605, ("November Fifth ..."). When written out in full with "of", however, the suffix is retained: the 5th of November. In other languages, different ordinal indicators are used to write ordinal numbers.

In [[American Sign Language]], the ordinal numbers first through ninth are formed with handshapes similar to those for the corresponding cardinal numbers with the addition of a small twist of the wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/n/numbersordianlandcardinal.htm |title="numbers" ASL American Sign Language |publisher=Lifeprint.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|Appendix:English ordinal numbers}}
In English, the main ordinal series is 'first', 'second', ....  It is used in a variety of rankings, including time ('the first hour of the event'), space ('the first left'), and quality ('first class cabin').

The Latinate series 'primary', 'secondary', ... is often used for importance or precedence ('primary consideration') and sequence of dependence ('secondary effect', 'secondary boycott', 'secondary industry'), though there are other uses as well ('primary school', 'primary election').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verbmall.blogspot.com/2007/01/ordinal-numbers-revisited.html |title=Ordinal Numbers Revisited  |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two in the sequence are by far the most common; 'tertiary' appears occasionally, and higher numbers are rare except in specialized contexts ('[[quaternary period]]').

The Greek series ''proto-'', ''deutero-'', ''trito-'', ... is only found in prefixes, generally scholarly and technical coinages, e.g. protagonist, deuteragonist, tritagonist; [[hydrogen-1|protium]], [[deuterium]], [[tritium]]; [[Book of Isaiah#Proto-Isaiah .28Isaiah 1.E2.80.9339.29|''Proto-Isaiah'']], [[Book of Isaiah#Deutero-Isaiah .28Isaiah 40.E2.80.9355.29|''Deutero-Isaiah'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0zIuAAAAYAAJ |title=De la restauration du Chant Liturgique| author=N.

The spatial and chronological ordinal numbers corresponding to cardinals from 13 to 19 are the number followed by the suffix ''-th'', as "sixteenth". For multiples of ten, the same principle applies, with terminal ''-y'' changed to ''-ieth'', as "sixtieth". For other numbers, the elements of the cardinal number are used, with the last word replaced by the ordinal: 23 → "twenty-third"; 523 → "five hundred twenty-third" ([[British English]]: "five hundred and twenty-third").

When speaking the numbers in [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], the spatial/chronological numbering system is used for denominators larger than 2 (2 as the denominator of a fraction is "half" rather than "second"), with a denominator of 4 sometimes spoken as "quarter" rather than "fourth". This system results in "two thirds" for {{frac|2|3}} and "fifteen thirty-seconds" for {{frac|15|32}}. This system is normally used for denominators less than 100 and for many [[powers of 10]]. Examples include "six ten-thousandths" for {{frac|6|10,000}} and "three hundredths" for 0.03.

{{Nihongo|'''''Oritaku Shiba no Ki'''''|折りたく柴の記||"Told Round a Brushwood Fire"}} is an [[autobiographical]] text written by Japanese [[Edo period|Edo-period]] scholar-official [[Arai Hakuseki]] (1657–1725). It describes Arai's ancestors, his childhood, and his work as an official of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa government]], providing an invaluable perspective on the Tokugawa government of his day.

==Title==

Hakuseki does not explain the meaning or significance of the title. The general view is that it is in reference to poem {{Numero|801}} in the ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'' poetry anthology:&lt;ref&gt;Odaka 135&lt;/ref&gt;

:''omoiizuru ori taku shiba no yūkeburi musebu mo ureshi wasuregatami ni''
:At dusk when I think of the one who is no longer here, I am happy to choke on the smoke of the burning brushwood twigs. It is a memento of the one who I can not forget.

This poem was written by [[Emperor Go-Toba]]. The smoke that he chokes is an illusion for sobbing for his wife Owari, who died in 1204. The smoke from the burning brushwood twigs reminds him of the smoke from her cremation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;

For Hakuseki, the one who he yearns for and can not forget is [[Tokugawa Ienobu]], the sixth ''[[shōgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

An alternative explanation is suggested by [[Katsuta Katsutoshi]]. He argues that Hakuseki did not have a talent for [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] and hence he could not have based the title on this poem. Further, in a correspondence with [[Mura Kyūsō]] ({{lang|ja|室鳩巣}}), Hakuseki writes about his father saying "They would burn brushwood and talk of things past and present throughout the night". Katsuta argues that burning brushwood is a euphemism for reminiscent discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Odaka 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==

''Oritaku Shiba no Ki'' has been translated into English by [[Joyce Ackroyd]] and released in 1979 under the title ''Told Round a Brushwood Fire'' and published by [[Princeton University Press]].

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation"(p. 17)'.{{Cite book|author=Shermer M.|year=1997|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|location=New York|publisher=W.

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G. Tobin (eds.), 2:1083–1092, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist epistemology|Feminist philosophers of science]], sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.

The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= Objective reality exists beyond or outside our self. Any belief that it arises from a real world outside us is actually an assumption. It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

==Philosophy of particular sciences==

In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of statistics===
{{Main|Philosophy of statistics}}
The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the [[foundations of statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]].

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G.

{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include [[Cartesian dualism]], the monogenetic conception of disease&lt;ref name="Lee 2012"&gt;Lee, K., 2012. The Philosophical Foundations of Modern Medicine, London/New York, Palgrave/Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conceptualization of 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'.&lt;ref name="Grünbaum 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grünbaum | first1 = A | year = 1981 | title = The Placebo Concept | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 157–167 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(81)90040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gøtzsche 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gøtzsche | first1 = P.C. | year = 1994 | title = Is there logic in the placebo? | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92273-x | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8927| pages = 925–926 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunn 2009"&gt;Nunn, R., 2009.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pitt Rivers Museum''' is a museum displaying the [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] collections of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000393 | title=Pitt Rivers Museum | accessdate=13 March 2011 | publisher=[[Culture 24]], UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located to the east of the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], and can only be accessed through that building.

The museum was founded in 1884 by Lt-General [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]], who donated his collection to the [[University of Oxford]] with the condition that a permanent lecturer in [[anthropology]] must be appointed. Museum staff are involved in teaching Archaeology and Anthropology at the University even today. The first Curator of the museum was [[Henry Balfour]].  A second stipulation in the Deed of Gift was that a building should be provided to house the collection and used for no other purpose. The University therefore engaged [[Thomas Manly Deane]], son of [[Thomas Newenham Deane]] who, together with [[Benjamin Woodward]], had designed and built the original Oxford University Museum of Natural History building three decades earlier, to create an adjoining building at the rear of the main building to house the collection. Construction started in 1885 and was completed in 1886.

The original donation consisted of approximately 22,000 items;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2232385/Characterizing_the_World_Archaeology_Collections_of_the_Pitt_Rivers_Museum | title=Dan Hicks 2013. Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum. In D. Hicks and A. Stevenson (eds) World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization. Oxford: Archaeopress}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has now grown to 500,000 items, many of which have been donated by travellers, scholars and missionaries.


==Organization==
[[File:Pitt_Rivers_Museum_Totem_pole.jpg|thumb|The Haida totem pole, from Star House in Massett village on Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands), Canada]]

The museum's collection is arranged typologically, according to how the objects were used, rather than according to their age or origin. This layout owes a lot to the theories of Pitt Rivers himself, who intended for his collection to show progression in design and evolution in human culture from the simple to the complex. Whilst this evolutionary approach to material culture is no longer fashionable in archaeology and anthropology, the museum has retained the original organisation of the displays.  The display of many examples of a particular type of tool or artifact, showing historical and regional variations, is an unusual and distinct feature of this museum.

The museum has a high density of objects on display, and the displays are changed periodically.

At 11.36m high the Haida [[totem pole]] is the largest object on display in the museum. From a Haida community, it originally stood outside Star House in the village of [[Old Massett]] (Haida name Uttewas), on [[Graham Island]], in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The house was built around 1882 and belonged to chief Anetlas (c.1816 - 1893). The pole came to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/totem.html|website=Pitt Rivers Museum: The Haida Totem Pole|title=Pitt Rivers Museum: The Haida Totem Pole|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
In 2004, the museum received £3,700,000 from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) to build a research annex adjoining the museum. Building work was completed in 2007, bringing the academic staff of the museum back to the site, and providing a [[laboratory]] for [[Archaeological site|conservation]] of the specimens. The annex will not affect the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] displays of the museum.

The second phase of development began on 7 July 2008 necessitating the closure of the museum and galleries.  The museum reopened on 1 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6187254.ece | title=The Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford reopens | accessdate=13 March 2011 | author=Campbell-Johnston, Rachel | publisher=[[The Times]] | date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, the 1960s exhibition gallery was dismantled, restoring the original view through to the museum’s totem pole. Original display cases were returned to their original place at the front of the museum. The space upstairs vacated by these cases provides additional space for a Clore Duffield Education Centre. A new entrance platform allows visitors to enter on the same level as the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and improves access for wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs. The entrance platform provides re-located shop and reception areas. An environmental control system has also been installed.

"'''Porphyria's Lover'''" is a poem by [[Robert Browning]] which was first published as "Porphyria" in the January 1836 issue of ''[[Monthly Repository]]''. Browning later republished it in ''[[Dramatic Lyrics]]'' (1842) paired with "[[Johannes Agricola in Meditation]]" under the title "Madhouse Cells". The poem did not receive its definitive title until 1863.

"Porphyria's Lover" is Browning's first ever short [[dramatic monologue]], and also the first of his poems to examine abnormal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Robert. ''Browning: [[Pippa Passes]] and Shorter Poems'' (Joseph E. Baker, Editor). New York: The Odyssey Press, 1947, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Although its initial publication passed nearly unnoticed and received little critical attention in the nineteenth century, the poem is now heavily anthologised and much studied.

In the poem, a man strangles his lover&amp;nbsp;– Porphyria&amp;nbsp;– with her hair; "... and all her hair&amp;nbsp;/ In one long yellow string I wound&amp;nbsp;/ Three times her little throat around,&amp;nbsp;/ And strangled her." Porphyria's lover then talks of the corpse's blue eyes, golden hair, and describes the feeling of perfect happiness the murder gives him. Although he winds her hair around her throat three times to throttle her, the woman never cries out. The poem uses a somewhat unusual rhyme scheme: A,B,A,B,B, the final repetition bringing each stanza to a heavy rest.

A possible source for the poem is John Wilson's "Extracts from Gosschen's Diary", a lurid account of a murder published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1818. Browning's friend and fellow poet [[Bryan Procter]] acknowledged basing his 1820 "Marcian Colonna" on this source, but added a new detail; after the murder, the killer sits up all night with his victim.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Catherine. "Porphyria's Lover", ''The Explicator'', Winter 2002, p. 68(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological interpretations==

Browning's monologues are frequently voiced by [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentrics]], lunatics, or people under emotional stress. Their ramblings illustrate character by describing the interactions of an odd personality with a particularly telling set of circumstances. In both "Porphyria's Lover" and "[[My Last Duchess]]", Browning uses this mode of exposition to describe a man who responds to the love of a beautiful woman by killing her. Each monologue offers the speaker's reasons for the desired woman from subject to object: in "My Last Duchess", the Duke may have jealously murdered his wife, but keeps a portrait of her behind a curtain so none can look upon her smile without his permission; in "Porphyria's Lover", the persona wishes to stop time at a single perfect moment and so kills his lover and sits all night embracing her carefully arranged body. It should be noted that in "My Last Duchess" the woman's murder is at best implied, while in "Porphyria's Lover" it is described quite explicitly by the speaker. The unchanging rhythmic pattern may also suggest the persona's insanity. 
    
The "Porphyria" persona's romantic egotism leads him into all manner of monstrously selfish assumptions compatible with his own longings. He seems convinced that Porphyria wanted to be murdered, and claims "No pain felt she" while being strangled, adding, as if to convince himself, "I am quite sure she felt no pain."  He may even believe she enjoyed the pain, because he, her lover, inflicted it. When she's dead, he says she's found her "utmost will," and when he sees her lifeless head drooping on his shoulder, he describes it as a "smiling rosy little head", possibly using the word "rosy" to symbolise the red roses of love, or to demonstrate his delusion that the girl, and their relationship, are still alive.  More likely, however, is the thought that blood returning to her face, after the strangulation, makes her cheeks "rosy."  Her "rosy little head" may also be a sly reference to the hymen; Porphyria leaves a "gay feast" and comes in from the outside world wearing "soiled gloves"; now her blue eyes, open in death, are "without a stain".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The lover may also be a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], indicated by the fact that he refers to her hair numerous times throughout the poem, and strangles her with it. He also refers to the "shut bud that holds a bee" which backs up the view of it being a sexual fetish.

Since the speaker may (as many speculate{{Who|date=February 2010}}) be insane, it is impossible to know the true nature of his relationship to Porphyria. Theories, some of them rather bizarre, abound: some contemporary scholars suggest, for example, that the persona may be a woman; if so, the strangulation could stem from frustration with the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  An incestuous relationship has also been suggested; Porphyria might be the speaker's mother or sister. Another possibility is that she is a former lover, now betrothed, or even married, to some other man. Alternatively, she may simply be some kind lady who has come to look in on him, or even a figment of his imagination.

Other sources speculate that the lover might be impotent, disabled, sick, or otherwise inadequate, and, as such, unable to satisfy Porphyria. There is much textual evidence to support this interpretation: he describes himself as "one so pale&amp;nbsp;/ for love of her, and all in vain." At the beginning of the poem, the persona never moves; he sits passively in a cold, dark room, sadly listening to the storm until Porphyria comes through "wind and rain", "shuts the cold out and the storm," and makes up his dying fire.  Finally, she sits beside him, calls his name, places his arm around her waist, and puts his head on her shoulder; she has to stoop to do this.  At the poem's midpoint, the persona suddenly takes action, strangling Porphyria, propping her body against his, and boasting that afterward, ''her'' head lay on ''his'' shoulder.

In line with the persona's suggested weakness and sickness, other scholars take the word "[[porphyria]]" literally, and suggest that the seductress embodies a disease, and that the persona's killing of her is a sign of his recovery. Porphyria, which usually involved delusional madness and death, was classified several years before the poem's publication; Browning, who had an avid interest in such pathologies, may well have been aware of the new disease, and used it in this way to express his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Popowich, Barry L. "Porphyria is Madness". ''Studies in Browning and his Circle'', May 1999, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been made of the final line: "And yet, God has not said a word!" Possibly, the speaker seeks divine condonement for the murder. He may believe God has said nothing because He is satisfied with his actions.  God may be satisfied because: He recognises that the persona's crime is the only way to keep Porphyria pure; or, because He doesn't think her life and death are important compared to the persona's. The persona may also be waiting in vain for some sign of God's approval. Alternatively, the line may represent his feelings of emptiness in the wake of his violence; Porphyria is gone, quiet descends, and he's alone. The persona may also be [[schizophrenic]]; he may be listening for a voice in his head, which he mistakes for the voice of God. It has also been postulated that this is Browning's statement of "God's silence," in which neither good nor bad acts are immediately recompensed by the deity.

The final line may also register the persona's sense of guilt over his crime. Despite his elaborate justifications for his act, he has, in fact, committed murder, and he expects God to punish him&amp;nbsp;– or, at least, to take notice. The persona is surprised, perhaps a little uneasy, at God's continued silence.

==As tableau vivant==
The mirrored effect produced by Porphyria's modelling of the persona in the first half, and the persona's reciprocal modelling of her after strangulation is indicative of a popular Victorian art form in which humans were used as art to recreate actual paintings. This is indicative of the allegorical content of "Porphyria's Lover" in which both characters imitate the process of artistic creation: when art is created or published, it is dead and forever unchanging.  In the last few lines of the poem, Porphyria is manipulated in much the same way as the speaker was in the first few lines of the poem. [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] shares similar ideas in "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", as do other [[Victorian era|Victorian]] authors who contribute to the popular conversation about the artistic processes.

The '''quechquemitl''' (also spelled quezquemitl) is a garment which has been worn by certain indigenous ethnicities in [[Mexico]] since the pre Hispanic period. It usually consists of two pieces of rectangular cloth, often woven by hand, which is sewn together to form a [[poncho]] or [[shawl]] like garment, which is usually worn hanging off the shoulders. It can be of various cloths, often with intricate weaves and highly decorated, most often with embroidery. In the pre Hispanic period only women of high social rank could wear it. Since the colonial period, it has been adopted by various peoples, mostly living in central Mexico for everyday wear, festival and rituals, but its use has declined.

==Definition and wearing of the garment==
[[File:Quechquemitl2MAPHidalgo.JPG|thumb|Two ways of wearing a quechquemitl, on the head and on the shoulders. The one of the shoulders is of the curved type]]
It has been variously described as a shawl, a cape and a triangular cloth. It is not really any of these although when worn points front and back it has a triangular appearance.&lt;ref name=eaevans&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |title=A design analysis of quechquemitl from the Cordry collection (costume, weaving, Mexican) |last= Evans |first= Elouise Adele |year=1985 |publisher= The University of Arizona |oclc=1325566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most quechquemitls are two pieces of rectangular cloth sewn together and most often worn off the shoulders, covering the upper body of women. Most have points which can hang down the front and back or over the arms.&lt;ref name=texmus&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.textilemuseum.org/totm/quechquemitlindex.htm |title= Quechquemitl Mexico, State of Mexico Otomí, ca. 1946 |publisher= The Textile Museum |location= Washington DC |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arthis&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583&amp;id_subseccion=962895 |title= El quechquémit  |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location= Mexico City  |language=Spanish |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quechquemitls are generally worn with various other garments such as a wraparound skirt tied with a sash, [[huipil]] and blouse. The size of the quechquemitl depends on how it is to be worn as well as its relation to other pieces of clothing. Its effect on the overall outfit is determined on this relationship, rather than standing along as a long huipil can.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;  The garment is used for everyday wear, social and ritual occasions.&lt;ref name=mirada&gt;{{cite news |author= Arturo Gómez Martínez |title= El quechquemitl: una mirada de la tradición, el diseño y la estética textil indígena de México |url= http://WWW.CRONICAOAXACA.INFO/CULTURA/AGENDA-CULTURAL-OAXACA/14179-EL-QUECHQUEMITL-UNA-MIRADA-DE-LA-TRADICION-EL-DISENO-Y-LA-ESTETICA-TEXTIL-INDIGENA-DE-MEXICO.HTML |date= June 7, 2011  |publisher=Crónica de Oaxaca |location= Oaxaca  |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Quechquemitl: a traditional look, the design and the aesthetics of an indigenous textile of Mexico |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garment is found mostly in central Mexico among indigenous women such as the  [[Huastecs]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], [[Tepehuán people|Tepehuas]], [[Otomi people|Otomis]], [[Totonacs]], [[Mazahuas]], [[Pame people|Pames]] and [[Huichols]] in states such as [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Querétaro]], the [[State of Mexico]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt; It has also been seen in some other areas such as the [[Uruapan]] area in [[Michoacán]], and parts of [[Morelos]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]]. While it used to be worn as the only upper garment, this practice has almost entirely disappeared, and today it is usually worn over a blouse for decoration or warmth. However, the popularity of highly decorated blouses has led to a diminishing of the quechquemitl.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt; Only among the Totonacs, Otomis and Nahuas is the garment widely used, but even with these it is mostly found on older women.  Younger women from the same communities prefer commercial blouses and shirts, reserving the quechquemitl for market days and festivals.&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt;

In some areas, the quechquemitl is also worn as a head covering. Among the Tepehuas in [[Huehuetla Municipality, Hidalgo|Huehuetla]], Hidalgo, this kind of quechquemitl is made with a fine gauze.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt;

==Making of the garment==
[[File:QuechquemitlMAPHidalgo.JPG|thumb|left|Quechquemitl from Hidalgo at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Peoples noted for the making of quechquemilts include the Huastecs, the Nahuas, the Tepehuas, the Huichols and the Otomis and the decoration of the garment can identify from which group it comes.&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt; However, the climate of the region it is made also has an effect such as the use of wool in colder areas.&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt; There is evidence that a number of motifs dates back to the pre Hispanic period. Others were adopted after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], and a number are hard to date as they show both European and indigenous influence.  Ancient designs include [[fretwork]], a symbol for [[Quetzalcoatl]], the scepter of Quetzalcoatl, related to [[Ursa Major]], an “S” form called an ilhuitl and a cross with branches of equal length which represents the cardinal directions. Colors have symbolic meaning such as yellow for east. One European element is a stylized vase with flowers, but the double headed eagle, can be of either indigenous or European origin.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt; The Huastecs in [[Tancanhuitz de Santos]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and the Huichols in Jalisco and Nayarit make their quechquemitls in an undyed cotton, which is heavily embroidered with flowers and animals in various colors. The Nahuas of San Francisco Chapantla, Hidalgo and [[Hueyapan (municipality)|Hueyapan, Puebla]] decorate their huipils with fretwork, animals and flowers.&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt; Among the Huastecs the garment is usually of undyed cotton which is heavily embroidered.&lt;ref name=gleason&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/los-bordados-teenek-en-la-huasteca-potosina.html |author=Eduardo Gleason Berumen |title= Los bordados teenek en la Huasteca Potosina|publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine  |location= Mexico City  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Huastic embroidery in the Huasteca Potosina |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other indigenous garments, the quechquemitl is made from uncut pieces of cloths as they come off the loom. Quechquemitl designs are achieved through weaving (fiber, color, structure), surface ornamentation (usually embroidery) and finishes applied to the seams and edges.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;  Various kinds of weaves are done for quechquemitls includes [[gauze]], [[seersucker]], [[brocade]] and curved or shaped weaving. The finest gauze pieces are from the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]], with very complex arrangements of [[heddle]]s, often with six used and as many as twenty have been noted. These gauze weavings tend to be more complex than those used for huipils. Some appear as a checkerboard pattern. Seersucker is used by adding commercial threads in stripes along with the handspun threads. The commercial threads do not shrink when washed and the puckering effect is created. Weft brocade is a decorative technique where heavier threads are introduced in the [[weft]] to create patterns. A looped brocade is also created by tugging on these weft threads to raise them. These brocades are often mistaken as embroidery in both Mexican and Guatemalan textiles. The curved weaving technique is particularly complicated and unique. Part of the warp is of white cotton and part a colored wool, either red or pink. The wool warp is much longer than the cotton at a point in the weaving producing warp faced fabric. The wool warp is cult and used as weft in a weft faced band, given the look of a colored border. The curvature is designed to fall on the shoulders of the wearer.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt; This type of garment can be found in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region.&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt;

There are three methods of joining the pieces of cloth. The first uses two rectangles of cloth with the narrow end of each joined to the long side of the other. This creates a warped loop whose points can be worn front/back or over the shoulders. Another is made with one long rectangle which is folded in half for a square look. The fold goes over one arm the edges going over the other arm are partially sewn, leaving space for the head to pass. A variation on this is two squares of fabric with the arm/shoulder seams sewn, leaving a neck opening. Another variation with is rare is made from a single rectangle from which a smaller rectangle has been cut. Then folded over, the two narrowest edges are sewn. It is worn with points hanging off the shoulders.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Otomí quexquémittl.png|thumb|An Otomi decorative element from the Sierra Norte de Puebla]]
The name “quechquemitl” (sometimes spelled quesquemitl, quezquemitl or quexquemitl) comes from [[Nahuatl]] and means  “neck garment” (quechtli = neck and tlaquemitl = garment) .&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;&lt;ref name=gleason/&gt; It has other names in other indigenous languages such as thayemlaab among the Huastecs.&lt;ref name=conferencia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/detalle-nota/?id=8125&amp;sec=estados |title= Ofrecerán la conferencia sobre el quechquemitl |publisher= CONACULTA |date= October 5, 2010  |location= Mexico  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Will offer a conference about the Quechquemitl |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garment has pre Hispanic origins and has been worn by some indigenous women for about 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=texmus/&gt;&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt; It is most likely that the garment originated with the Totonacs on the Gulf coast. It was brought to the Mexican highlands by the Otomis.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt; In the pre Hispanic era, the quechquemitl was worn with huipil and a wrap around skirt, generally only for special occasions and by high-ranking women. It may even have been reserved for use by goddesses and those portraying them in ritual in the [[Aztec]] era. In this era, it was particularly associated with fertility goddesses possibly due to the origins of the garment in the Gulf Coast region and its fertility. These garments when worn by the nobility were made of cotton, sometimes with rabbit fur or feathers woven in for warmth and/or decoration.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;&lt;ref name=texmus/&gt; There was another variation in which the cloth was twisted before the edges sewn, resulting in a shape that conformed closer to the body. The name of Mixtec princesses often had the word “quechquemitl”. The garments were woven on backstrap looms, which can still be seen today, and dyed with natural colorings such as [[cochineal]], [[indigo]] and other plants, animals and minerals.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;

After the Spanish conquest, the quechquemitl was adopted by all indigenous women. The garment was then worn alone, exposing the midriff or over a huipil. However, today neither of these uses are common.&lt;ref name=arthis/&gt; Treadle looms and spinning wheels were also introduced and well as sheep producing wool.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt;

Today, the quechquemitl is still worn but its use has diminished.&lt;ref name=eaevans/&gt; However, it remains important in Mexican culture. [[Frida Kahlo]], who was known for her wearing of Mexican indigenous clothing, had quechquemetls, including one from Puebla with symbols related to fertility which are no longer made.&lt;ref name=conarte&gt;{{cite news |author=Lourdes Zambrano |title=Entra Conarte al ropero de Frida |publisher=El Norte |location=Monterrery, Mexico |date=June 14, 2007 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Conarte enters Frida’s wardrobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been conferences and other academic events devoted to the garment, such as a [[CONACULTA]] sponsored conference at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]] .&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt;  and a conference on its use in Nahua and Huastec identities at the Centro de las Artes in San Luis Potosí.&lt;ref name=conferencia/&gt;

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

'''''Shiloh''''' is a [[media franchise]] that includes four novels and three films.

==Books==
===Shiloh===
{{main|Shiloh (Naylor novel)}}
''Shiloh'' is a [[Newbery Medal]]-winning [[children's literature|children's novel]] by [[Phyllis Reynolds Naylor]] published in [[1991 in literature|1991]]. The 65th book by Naylor, it is the first in a trilogy about a young boy and the [[title character]], an abused dog. Naylor decided to write ''Shiloh'' after an emotionally taxing experience in West Virginia where she encountered an abused dog.

Narrator and protagonist Marty Preston lives in the hills of [[Friendly, West Virginia]]. After finding an abused [[beagle]] owned by his brutal neighbor Judd Travers, Marty defies his society's standards of not meddling with each other's business. Marty resolves to steal and hide the dog, naming him Shiloh and fabricating a web of lies to keep his secret. After his theft is discovered, Marty discovers Judd shooting a deer out of season and blackmails him into selling Shiloh to him. Because he lacks the money to buy Shiloh, Marty resolutely works for Judd doing numerous chores.

Primarily a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and [[adventure novel]], the novel depicts the emotional tribulations and maturing of an 11-year-old boy. Some themes of the novel are [[ethics]], [[consequentialism]], religion and morality, and animal–human relationships. Marty learns that morality is confounding and must choose between two unpalatable choices: rescuing the abused Shiloh through stealing and lying and allowing Judd to keep abusing Shiloh.

Reviewers generally gave positive reviews of the book and were impressed by the novel's suspense and vernacular language. In addition to the Newbery Medal, ''Shiloh'' has received several state awards voted upon by children, including the [[Sequoyah Book Award#List of Sequoyah Children's Book Award winners|Sequoyah Children's Book Award]], the [[Mark Twain Readers Award]], and the [[William Allen White Children's Book Award]].

===Shiloh Season===
''Shiloh Season'' was published in 1996.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bainbridge|Pantaleo|1999|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Shiloh Season'', Naylor renews the strife by restoring Judd's hostility and aggravating it with a bout of drinking issues. Marty fears Judd will take back Shiloh and be faithless to the deal they made. Whereas in ''Shiloh'' Marty confronts the confusing and ambiguous concept of morality, in ''Shiloh Season'' he must face the notion of wickedness.&lt;ref name="Gilson1996-12-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=Boy from 'Shiloh' Given More to Ponder |author=Gilson, Nancy |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CLDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10DF8B6C1FE67160&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggdocs&amp;req_dat=0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |date=1996-12-05 |accessdate=2011-06-10 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zLdVUbhZ |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saving Shiloh===
''Saving Shiloh'' was published in 1997.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bainbridge|Pantaleo|1999|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marty's parents persuade Marty that people who have wronged are worthy of forgiveness. In the midst of several robberies and a murder, the community hastily faults Judd. Willing to grant Judd a second chance, Marty attempts to help him. Meanwhile, Marty and his family must face the intricacies of life such as death, hostility, and [[sibling rivalry]].&lt;ref name="Krenz"&gt;{{cite news |title=Take One Last Trip to Shiloh, and Be Sure to Pack Tissues |author=Krenz, Jeri Fischer |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CHOB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F244975AB0C1B8F&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggdocs&amp;req_dat=0D7C12F5A8A2A86A |newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=1997-08-31 |accessdate=2011-06-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zRdKV7hM |archivedate=2011-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4315">'''Survivance''' is a critical term in [[Native American studies]].

==History==
Survivance was originally a legal term, but fell out of use in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See OED&lt;/ref&gt; The word was subsequently utilized in the 20th century by francophone Canadians as "[[La Survivance]]," and also employed by the French theorist [[Jacques Derrida]] to denote a spectral existence that would be neither life nor death.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Calbi, ''Spectral Shakespeares: Media Adaptations in the Twenty-First Century'' (London: Palgrave, 2013), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It was first employed in the context of [[Native American Studies]] by the [[Anishinaabe]] cultural theorist [[Gerald Vizenor]], in his book ''[[Manifest Manners]]: Narratives on Postindian Survivance''. There he explains that "Survivance is an active sense of [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]], the continuance of native stories, not a mere reaction, or a survivable name. Native survivance stories are renunciations of dominance, tragedy and victimry".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Vizenor, ''Manifest Manners: Narratives on Postindian Survivance'' (Lincoln: Nebraska, 1999), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Vizenor makes the term, which is deliberately imprecise, the cornerstone of his analysis of contemporary Native American literature, culture and politics. Several critics (e.g. Alan Velie) have analysed the term as a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "survival and endurance," and others (e.g. Jace Weaver) have read it as a portmanteau of "survival + resistance," but there does not seem to be any evidence that Vizenor had such a specific combination in mind.  Rather, by changing the suffix from -''al'' to -''ance'', he insists on an active survival, in which contemporary Native American peoples go beyond merely subsisting in the ruins of tribal cultures to actively inheriting and refashioning those cultures for the postmodern age.  The [[Cherokee]]-descent poet [[Diane Glancy]] demonstrates the ways that an imprecise term can inspire creativity by reconfiguring it: "Poetry is rebound. A turn of writing. (Sur)vivance: Sur - a survival outside survival. Vivance - the vitality of it."&lt;ref&gt;Diane Glancy, "The Naked Spot: A Journey toward Survivance", in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizenor frequently defines "survivance" in opposition to "victimry," as some commentators note.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Alan Velie, "N. Scott Momaday's ''[[House Made of Dawn]] and Myths of the Victim'', in ''The Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', ed. A Robert Lee and Alan Velie (Norman: Oklahoma UP, 2014), p. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Kroeber]] writes that Vizenor's "work aims to repair a peculiarly vicious consequence of genocidal attacks on native of the Americas: an inducing in them of their destroyers' view that they are mere survivors. By accepting this white definition of themselves as victims, natives complete psychologically the not-quite-entirely-successful physical genocide."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kroeber, "Why It's a Good Thing Gerald Vizenor is not an Indian," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Joe Lockard calls it "the condition of self-reliant or communal survival without the social or personal indulgence of victimization."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Lockard, "Facing the Windiigoo," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has become a [[term of art]] in contemporary Native American studies, used far beyond the context of Vizenor's own work.  It is now also an interactive video game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://survivance.org/|title = Survivance|website = Survivance|access-date = 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in captions for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]],&lt;ref&gt;Sonya Atalay, "No Sense of the Struggle: Creating a Context for Survivance at the NMAI," ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 30.3&amp;4 (2006) 597-618.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being employed numerous times in titles of books and academic articles.

'''''The Brahmin and the Mongoose''''' (or '''''The Brahmin's Wife and the Mongoose''''') is a folktale from [[India]], and "one of the world's most travelled tales".&lt;ref name=b494&gt;Blackburn, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the rash killing of a loyal animal, and thus warns against hasty action. The story underlies certain legends in the West, such as that of Llywelyn and his dog [[Gelert]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=b494/&gt; or that of [[Saint Guinefort]] in France.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=b496/&gt; It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
[[File:8th century Panchatantra legends panels at Virupaksha Shaivism temple, Pattadakal Hindu monuments Karnataka 1.jpg|thumb|The woman and the mongoose ''Panchatantra'' fable is engraved in many historic Hindu temples such as at the 8th-century Virupaksha temple at [[Pattadakal]] (the middle panel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Blackburn | first=Stuart | title=The Brahmin and the Mongoose: The Narrative Context of a Well-Travelled Tale | journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=59 | issue=03 | year=1996 | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00030615 | pages=494-506}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The original version from the [[Panchatantra]] in [[Sanskrit]] goes as follows (translation from {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}):
{{quote|
The Loyal Mongoose{{efn|The source uses the spelling "mungoose" throughout; the spelling has been here modernized to "mongoose" for consistency with the rest of the article.}}

There was once a Brahman named Godly [orig. ''Devasharma''] in a certain town. His wife mothered a single son and a mongoose. And as she loved little ones, she cared for the mongoose also like a son, giving him milk from her breast, and salves, and baths, and so on. But she did not trust him, for she thought: “A mongoose is a nasty kind of creature. He might hurt my boy.” [...]

One day she tucked her son in bed, took a waterjar, and said to her husband: “Now, Professor, I am going for water. You must protect the boy from the mongoose.” But when she was gone, the Brahman went off somewhere himself to beg food, leaving the house empty.

While he was gone, a black snake issued from his hole and, as fate would have it, crawled toward the baby’s cradle. But the mongoose, feeling him to be a natural enemy, and fearing for the life of his baby brother, fell upon the vicious serpent halfway, joined battle with him, tore him to bits, and tossed the pieces far and wide. Then, delighted with his own heroism, he ran, blood trickling from his mouth, to meet the mother; for he wished to show what he had done.

But when the mother saw him coming, saw his bloody mouth and his excitement, she feared that the villain must have eaten her baby boy, and without thinking twice, she angrily dropped the water-jar upon him, which killed him the moment that it struck. There she left him without a second thought, and hurried home, where she found the baby safe and sound, and near the cradle a great black snake, torn to bits. Then, overwhelmed with sorrow because she had thoughtlessly killed her benefactor, her son, she beat her head and breast.

At this moment the Brahman came home with a dish of rice gruel which he had got from someone in his begging tour, and saw his wife bitterly lamenting her son, the mongoose. “Greedy! Greedy!” she cried. “Because you did not do as I told you, you must now taste the bitterness of a son’s death, the fruit of the tree of your own wickedness. Yes, this is what happens to those blinded by greed....”
}}

In Western variants of the story, other animals take the place of the mongoose, most often a dog. It is also found in other versions as a [[weasel]], cat (in Persia), bear, or lion, and the snake is sometimes replaced with a wolf (in Wales). The essence of the story, however, remains the same. Similarly, variants of the story sometimes have the man, instead of his wife, killing the loyal animal.&lt;ref name=b498&gt;Blackburn, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is sometimes placed within a frame story, where a saviour stands mistakenly accused and narrates this story, thereby preventing his own death.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Blackburn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and travel==
The story was first studied in 1859 by [[Theodor Benfey]], the pioneer of comparative literature, when he compared the versions in India, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Benfey, Theodor S. 1859. Pantschatantra.2 vols. Leipzig: F. W. Brockhaus; Benfey, Theodor S. 1862. 'Ueber die alte deutsche Uebersetzung des Kalilah und Dimnah', Orient und Occident, 1: 138-187.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1884, W. A. Clouston showed how it had reached Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Clouston, W. A. 1884. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnEAAAAAMAAJ The Book of Sindibad]. Glasgow: privately printed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelert.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gelert]]'' by [[Charles Burton Barber]] (1845–1894)]] 
[[Murray B. Emeneau]] considers the migration of this story, through its steps from India to Wales, as "one of the best authenticated cases of such diffusions of folk-tales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.2307/985117| jstor = 985117 | pages = 503–513 | title = A Classical Indian Folk-Tale as a Reported Modern Event: the Brahman and the Mongoose | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | publisher = American Philosophical Society | year = 1940| author1 = Emeneau | first1 = M. B.}}, p.507&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The story occurs in all versions of the [[Panchatantra]], as well as the later Sanskrit works [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=hitopadesha&gt;
{{citation | year=2007 | title = "Friendly advice" by Nārāyaṇa and "King Vikrama's adventures" | author1=Nārāyaṇa | author2=Judit Törzsök (transl.) | publisher=NYU Press and [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8305-4 | pages=513–515 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&amp;pg=PA513}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kathasaritsagara]].
It also occurs in most of the languages of India (and South Asia) where it is extremely familiar.
For instance, in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]], the story occurs as a proverb in inscriptions,&lt;ref name=b496&gt;Blackburn, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; as a sculpture in a temple,&lt;ref&gt;
Mallikarjuna Temple at [[Pattadakal]], Karnataka, eighth century. See:
* C. S. Patil (1995), ''Panchatantra in Karnataka sculptures'', Mysore: Directorate of Archaeology and Museums.
&lt;/ref&gt; in narratives of travelling storytellers and singers,&lt;ref&gt;
Blackburn p.505 and 499. Found as ''The Sati of Sulochana'' in a collection of bard-stories:
* Kyathanahalli Rāmaṇṇa (1972), ''Gondalingara Kathegalu''. Mysore: Institute for Kannada Studies.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0MHirNAR9o Nodiddu sullagabahudu (video)] ("Things are not always what they seem"), from ''Rama Lakshmana'' (1980). Note that here, too, the story is framed within another story of an unjustly accused animal (a pet tiger).&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] epic ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' recalls the story simply by its name.

Like the rest of the Panchatantra, in its westward migration it travelled from Sanskrit to Arabic (as ''Kalila wa Dimna''), Persian, [[Hebrew]], Greek, Latin, Old French, and eventually into all the major languages of Europe (as ''The Fables of Pilpay'' or ''Bidpai''), ranging from Russian to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to English. 
In its eastward migration, it appears in Chinese (ten versions, including in a redaction of the Vinaya Pitaka), and over a wide region from Mongolia to Malaysia.
It is also the only story found in all recensions of the Panchatantra, all versions of the 'Book of Sindibad' (not [[Sindbad]]),
and all versions of '[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'.&lt;ref name=b495&gt;Blackburn, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in Mexico and the United States. Blackburn observes that the fable is not a dead tradition and is still current, as a Belgian newspaper reported it as an anecdote about a man who left his son and dog in a shopping trolley in his car.&lt;ref name=b495/&gt;

The motif also occurs, with a happy ending, in the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

==Reception/influence==
The story is often used in culture as an [[exemplum]] cautioning against hasty action. In addition, it also serves as shorthand for sin, regret and grief.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

In Welsh it became the story of the nobleman Llywelyn who kills his loyal dog, [[Gelert]]. It was later interpreted as a legend about a true event, and small shrines to the dog exist in Wales (such as in the village of [[Beddgelert]], "Gelert's grave"). In France a similar metamorphosis took larger proportions, and the story became the cult of [[Saint Guinefort]] (a dog), which was popular until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{citation | author=Stephen Belcher | contribution=Panchatantra | title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales | editor=Donald Haase | year=2008 | volume=2 | pages=723–725 | isbn=978-0-313-33441-2 | quote=…is a saint's legend behind a pilgrimage site in France.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 496. {{quote|When the dog replaced the mongoose, the tale was commonly interpreted as a legend (that is as a true event), and the loyal animal's undeserving death was commemorated by small shrines to the dog not only in Wales but also in north India […] On a larger scale, this tale inspired the cult of St. Guinefort in France…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn points out that although in the many literary versions it is the man who kills the mongoose, in most ''oral'' versions (and even the literary version quoted above), it is the woman who does so. Further, ''both'' literary and oral versions place the woman at the centre of the story, emphasizing her maternal feelings toward the animal, her mixture of love and fear, and her grief at its death. Thus he asserts that "the tale is a drama enacted between a mother and her son" and proposes some interpretations.&lt;ref name=b501&gt;Blackburn, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enid Strict''', better known as '''The Church Lady''', is a recurring character from a series of sketches on the American television show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', that appeared from 1986 to 1990, and again in 1996, 2000, 2011, and 2016. She also appeared on ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' in March 1996, reading a [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten List]], "New Titles for [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]."&lt;ref&gt;James, Caryn [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/14/arts/television-review-sendups-of-forbes-clinton-and-royalty.html TELEVISION REVIEW;Sendups of Forbes, Clinton and Royalty] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 14, 1996). Retrieved on 5-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the character==
Created and played by [[Dana Carvey]], The Church Lady is a mature woman named “Enid Strict,” who is the uptight, smug and pious host of her own [[talk show]], ''Church Chat.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tobingrant.religionnews.com/2015/02/16/top-10-saturday-night-live-sketches-religion-plus-one-jack-handy/|title=Top 10 Saturday Night Live sketches on religion (plus one Jack Handy)|last=Grant|first=Tobin|date=February 16, 2015|work=Religion News|accessdate=1 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044129/http://tobingrant.religionnews.com/2015/02/16/top-10-saturday-night-live-sketches-religion-plus-one-jack-handy/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enid is a spoof of “holier-than-thou” Christian churchgoers. On her show (which only lasts the duration of the sketch itself) she has multiple guests, usually celebrities of the time played by other cast members of ''SNL'' or by the actual celebrities themselves (usually whoever is guest-hosting that week's ''SNL'' episode, appearing as themselves), who appear to be interviewed by her. However, the interviews are only a guise for her to call the celebrity guests out on their various alleged sins (which are often publicly known news events of the day). They initially receive sarcastic praises from her, until the interview eventually degrades into a tirade against their apparent lack of piety and their [[secular]] lifestyles, culminating with her judgmental admonishments and [[damnation]]. She often takes others to task for following the desires of their “naughty parts.”

The Church Lady is known for always wearing a matching blue and purple sweater/dress set, visible knee-high stockings, and a pair of [[Cat eye glasses|cat's eye]] [[horn-rimmed glasses]].  She was known for the [[catchphrase]]s, “Well, isn't that ''SPE-CIAL''?!”, "How ''con-VEEN-ient''!", and “Could it be...''SATAN?''” (in later years, the latter would always end with a haunting echo).  When sufficiently satisfied with herself, she would mug for the camera, while twitching the corners of her mouth from one side to the other for an indefinite length of time.  She also gave advice in response to letters she ostensibly received.  Furthermore, whenever she felt that she had demonstrated her superiority, she would do her "Superior dance" in which she would rhythmically strut to [[organ music]] (played by an organist named Pearl, who was played by musical director Cheryl Hardwick) in front of her alleged inferiors.

Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from his church growing up, who would keep track of his and others' attendance.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/04/27/president-donald-trump-impersonators-frauds-moos-pkg-erin.cnn/video/playlists/wacky-world-of-jeanne-moos/|title='Church Lady' returns to 'SNL,' takes on Trump ... again|date=May 10, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Lady became immediately recognizable and played an important role in ''SNL''{{'}}s resurgence in the mid-1980s. She made numerous appearances on ''SNL;'' [[Nora Dunn]] recalled that "everybody loved that character and [Carvey] was pressured to do it so, so often,"&lt;ref name="snlbackstage20110220"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Saturday Night Live Backstage | network=NBC | airdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Church Lady reappeared even after Carvey's departure from the show as a regular cast member. She was never incorporated into a feature-length film, however, as many of ''SNL'''s other recurring characters were.

==Memorable moments==
{{fanpov|section|date=February 2018}}
Dana Carvey recalls that he was prompted by executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] to introduce the character (when it was still in ''SNL'' rehearsals) at a [[Neil Young]] concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], which Church Lady interrupted, fussing and fuming: "What are we ''doing'' here? What's all this noise?"

During the first season Dana Carvey appeared as a cast regular on ''Saturday Night Live'', [[Joe Montana]] and [[Walter Payton]] co-hosted the show and both appeared in a Church Lady skit for a game of football with Church Lady.  Montana throws a touchdown pass to Church Lady after she distracted Payton (who was playing defense against her) and hid in the audience.  At the end of the sketch, all three did the "superior dance."

A classic moment was in March 1987 when she interviewed [[Jim Bakker|Jim]] and [[Tammy Faye Bakker]] (played by Phil Hartman and [[Jan Hooks]]) at the height of the sex scandal involving Jim Bakker and [[Jessica Hahn]]. During the show the televangelists begged for donations, and a mascara-dripping Tammy Faye recounted her experience with "demonic raisins."

Another notable moment in October 1987 featured actor [[Sean Penn]], playing himself as a guest on the show.  During the interview, the Church Lady (who calls him "Sin," and then quickly corrects her "mistake") makes numerous references to his then-wife [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and her overt sexuality, claiming Madonna "doesn't quite live up to her [[Virgin Mary|namesake]]."  The more she goes on about his wife's "bulbous buttocks gyrating" and her displaying of her "chestal area," the more angered Penn becomes, until he eventually throws a punch, hitting her directly in the nose. Carvey recalls that he was genuinely scared because Penn (who was well known for losing his temper) came dangerously close to actually hitting him.

[[Jan Hooks]] would appear again on the sketch in December 1987, this time playing [[Jessica Hahn]], of whom the Church Lady said in a sarcastic tone "Oh, sit right down, Jessie. Here we are not like those other talk shows that fawn all over you. No, siree!" Jessica Hahn claims that she is tired of degradation, to which the Church Lady produces the ''[[Playboy]]'' for which she posed (only the cover is shown). Jessica Hahn says that that type of degradation had her authorization and "I am free to degrade myself only how I see fit! For once Jessica Hahn is in control of her life!" and then goes on to say "Being used and degraded in a hotel room in Florida was not my decision. Being used and degraded in the pages of this magazine, that was my decision. I am in control of being used and degraded!"

Though the sketch routinely mocked popular celebrity scandals, in 1989, guest host [[Rob Lowe]] managed to avoid having his various sex scandals of the day (including the leaking of a sex tape involving the actor) mentioned per a special deal he cut with the Church Lady. In return for her silence on his various sex scandals, Rob Lowe submitted to corporal punishment at the end of the interview. However, Rob Lowe began to enjoy being spanked by the Church Lady, who took this as a sign that Satan had possessed Lowe's butt and began screaming for Satan to leave the actor's body.

Another sketch in February 1990 found child actor [[Fred Savage]] playing the Church Lady's niece, Enid. Savage was dressed in a miniature version of Church Lady's outfit and glasses, and co-spoke all of the familiar admonishing catchphrases, as well as performing the "Superior Dance" at the beginning of the sketch. In the same sketch was a visit from [[Donald Trump]] (as played by [[Phil Hartman]]), right after his legendary divorce.  The Church Lady scolded him and his "[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]," to which Trump responded by frankly telling her that he "could buy and sell this freak show, or dog and pony act, or whatever." The Church Lady responded that "if you could do that then Enid is just some little boy in a dress."&lt;ref name = "cnn" /&gt;

In a [[teaser trailer]] for the 1990 film ''[[Opportunity Knocks (film)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' (available on that film's DVD), Church Lady interrupts, warning viewers not to see the film and is punched in the face and knocked to the floor by Dana Carvey who introduces himself. Church Lady retaliates and the fight continues offscreen as the trailer ends.

Another notable sketch, in October 2000, featured The Church Lady interviewing [[Anne Heche]] (played by [[Chris Kattan]]), with the Church Lady teasing Anne about her bisexuality by offering her a snack and giving her the choice between a "wiener" and a "taco" (implying a choice between two obvious body parts) and referring to a bisexual as someone who "reaches down the front of somebody's pants and they're satisfied with whatever they find."

Sometimes the Church Lady was accompanied by a character known as "Minister Bob," played by [[Chevy Chase]]. He seemed to be the only person the Church Lady admired. During a church picnic an inebriated woman interrupted the gathering, shocking all the old ladies present, and saying how the Church Lady acts so high and mighty but is out of touch with the problems of people in everyday life. Minister Bob then acts more down to earth than the Church Lady, saying it is the responsibility of a pastor to deal with people with problems. When he seems to be leading the woman into why problem drinking is a bad idea, he ends with saying "...because of SATAN!", and joins the Church Lady in her Superior dance.

Toward the end of the character's run, a parody sketch of the film ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' aired in which Dana Carvey is doing a stand-up tour in Colorado, and announces to the audience this is a special day as it is the last time he will ever do a Church Lady sketch. He is then driving in a snowstorm with [[Jon Lovitz]], where Carvey says it was about time to put the Church Lady to rest and not make it a running gag. Lovitz (who played Satan in a December 1988 Church Lady sketch) pathetically asks if he can now play her (Lovitz' stalled career was a running joke on ''SNL'' the season after his official departure), but is interrupted by heavy snow flurries crushing the car. Carvey is rescued by guest star [[Roseanne Barr]], playing the Church Lady's disturbingly obsessed Number One Fan, who is so gleeful at rescuing Carvey and buys him things such as "orthopedic shoes, just like the Church Lady wears!" However, she becomes furious when she reads a comedy review saying Carvey has stopped doing the Church Lady, and intends to hold him until he promises to resume playing her. Reciting the lines was not good enough either, as Roseanne holds Carvey at gunpoint forcing him to wear the Church Lady wig and get her facial expressions and voice just right. Lorne Michaels tries to find the missing Carvey, but becomes increasingly uninterested, deciding instead to promote the "Makin' Copies" character, played by [[Rob Schneider]]. The skit ends with Carvey and Roseanne in a climactic fight scene, but Roseanne comically keeps getting back up. She and then Carvey are shot by the still-alive Jon Lovitz, who claims the Church Lady character for himself.

The Church Lady appeared on ABC's [[The Dana Carvey Show]] as part of a larger sketch where a viewer letter asked whether Dana Carvey's ''SNL'' characters were to appear on the show. The sketch responded by claiming that ABC used Disney's high-profile lawyers to engage [[NBC]] in a [[hostile takeover]], gaining the rights to Carvey's ''SNL'' characters, as well as some of the IPs of [[David Letterman]]'s show on [[CBS]]. It then cuts to the Church Lady reading David Letterman's [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten]] List.

Carvey reprised the character and sketch when he hosted the show in its 36th season, the Church Lady interviewing "the [[Kardashian]] sisters", attempting to exorcise "Snooki", and notably becoming enraptured and aroused by [[Justin Bieber]] before being settled down by God.

In 2016, The Church Lady was the opening skit on May 7 (season 41, episode 19) with [[Ted Cruz]] ([[Taran Killam]]) and [[Donald Trump]] ([[Darrell Hammond]]) as her guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/tv/2016/05/08/dana-carvey-revives-church-lady-snl-tackle-2016-election-calls-ted-cruz-little-preachy|title=Dana Carvey revives the Church Lady on SNL to tackle 2016 election, calls Ted Cruz ‘a little preachy’|last=DeCosta-Klipa|first=Nik|date=May 8, 2016|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz, who had been recently called "[[Lucifer]] in the flesh" by [[John Boehner]], reappeared mid sketch as the Devil after The Church Lady called Trump "an orange mannequin".&lt;ref name = "cnn" /&gt; She also appeared as a guest on the show's Weekend Update segment a few days before the November 2016 election, describing the election as a choice between "a bitter, female android from the ‘90s... or a riverboat gambler with a big tummy and an orange head”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snl-church-lady-election_us_581eed3ce4b0aac62484fd58|title=Dana Carvey’s Church Lady Gets Self-Righteous Over The Election In ‘SNL’ Return|last=Moran|first=Lee|date=November 6, 2016|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular catchphrases==
* “Well, isn't that ''special?''”
* "How con-VEEN-ient!"
* “Now, ''who'' could it be? Could it be ... ''Satan?''” (During a Christmas-themed December broadcast, using a magnetic spelling board, she rearranged letters spelling “Santa” to reveal “Satan”.)
* "We like ourselves, don't we?" (Usually directed at a guest on her show)
* "Ah yes, from the Chippewa word meaning drop your shorts, we don't have much time." (Usually directed towards a guest)

'''''The Hotwives''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that premiered on July 15, 2014, on the video streaming website [[Hulu]]. Developed by [[Paramount Digital Entertainment]] as a [[parody]] of ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' [[reality television]] franchise broadcast on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]], the first season follows the lives of several fictional women residing in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The series' seven hotwives are inspired by several housewives that have been featured on installments of ''The Real Housewives''.

Season two, following a new group of ladies in [[Las Vegas]], premiered on August 18, 2015.&lt;ref name="season2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/hotwives-of-orlando-renewed-hulu-las-vegas-1201343051/|title=‘Hotwives Of Orlando’ Renewed At Hulu, Pack Bags For Las Vegas – Deadline|author=Patrick Hipes|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==
The series was created by [[Dannah Phirman]] and [[Danielle Schneider]]. [[Paul Scheer]] and Jonathan Stern serve as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/hulu-adds-reality-spoof-hotwives-of-orlando-to-2014-originals-lineup-1201036575/ |title=Hulu Original Series — Reality Spoof ‘Hotwives of Orlando’ Added To 2014 Lineup |publisher=Variety |date=2014-01-08 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of Hulu's initiative to produce original scripted programming. The show is a scripted parody of the reality television franchise ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]. The reality TV parody series depicts the purportedly exclusive and glamorous world of "hot housewives" from different cities each season, following the women as they fight over everything from their love of shoes, plastic surgery, and the pursuit of spending all of their husbands' money.

==Plot==
The first season (''The Hotwives of Orlando'') focused on "Orlando Hotwives" Tawny St. John (portrayed by [[Casey Wilson]]), Shauna Maducci ([[Danielle Schneider]]), Phe Phe Reed ([[Tymberlee Hill]]), Veronica Von Vandervon ([[Andrea Savage]]), Crystal Simmons ([[Angela Kinsey]]), and Amanda Simmons ([[Kristen Schaal]]).

The second season (''The Hotwives of Las Vegas'') focuses on "Vegas Hotwives" Denise Funt (Schneider), Leona Carpeze ([[Dannah Phirman]]), Jenfer Beudon (Wilson), Ivanka Silversan (Savage), Callie Silversan ([[Erinn Hayes]]), "First Lady" Stephanie (Kinsey), and Hill reprising her role as Phe Phe Reed, now newly relocated to Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean L.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of The Hotwives episodes}}
{{:List of The Hotwives episodes}}

==Cast==

===Season one – ''The Hotwives of Orlando'' (2014) ===

====Main cast====
* [[Andrea Savage]] as '''Veronica Von Vandervon: "The Cougar"''' – A wealthy and classy woman who is known for her vulgar sense of humor and is always on the prowl for younger men. She often insists on explaining her overly suggestive jokes. She speaks in an English accent, although it is later revealed in the reunion that she is in fact not British and only sounds that way because she is white and rich. The sex-obsessed Veronica is an independent businesswoman and the heiress to the "Hot Holes, Heavy Putting" mini-golf fortune. 
* [[Angela Kinsey]] as '''Crystal Simmons: "The Religious Zealot"''' – A devout Christian and local Orlando weather girl. However, she claims to not have actually read the Bible because "it’s written in Jewish." She is known for her "holier than thou" attitude and being judgmental of everyone, especially of her younger sister, Amanda.
* [[Kristen Schaal]] as '''Amanda Simmons: "The Drug Addled Former Child Star"''' – Crystal's younger sister and a former child star who made her claim-to-fame as the "Florida Prune Juice girl" in a number of commercials as a child. She claims her substance abuse issues are behind her. She is not technically a wife as she is chronically single, but has hopes that being on the show will help her regain her fame.
* [[Danielle Schneider]] as '''Shauna Maducci: "The Bankrupt Overspender"''' – The brassy Italian-American hotwife with anger control problems. She is addicted to shopping and is constantly fighting with everyone from her husband, Anthony, to her "best friend" Tawny. She and her husband are on the verge of bankruptcy, which she is single-handedly responsible for because of her overspending habits.
* [[Tymberlee Hill]] as '''Phenomenon "Phe Phe" Reed: "The Entrepreneur"''' – The flashy African-American hotwife known for "speaking her mind", referring to herself in the third person, and coining catchphrases involving her name, such as "I'm just bein' Phe Phe!". Her "entrepreneurial" pursuits include lawyer, foot model, and aspiring taxidermist, among other careers.
* [[Casey Wilson]] as '''Tawny St. John: "The Trophy Wife"''' – The self-obsessed, gold-digging trophy hotwife who is cheating on her much older husband, Phil, with her fitness trainer, Heath. She defends her actions by claiming that Phil is dying, when he in fact just has allergies. She seemingly has no real marketable skills other than attending charity events, partying, and making music videos, although she has recently attempted to release her own cosmetic products such as her new line of "eyebrow extensions", and also runs a charity called "Classy Canines", which supplies high heels for dogs.

====Supporting and recurring cast====
* [[Paul Scheer]] as '''Matty Green''' – The show's executive producer who appears in every episode to plug his after-show, "The Hotwives Cooldown".
* [[Joey McIntyre]] as '''Heath''' – Tawny's fitness trainer with whom she's having an affair while her husband is on his deathbed.
* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as '''Phil''' – Tawny's much older, wealthy husband, who she thinks is dying, or she hopes is dying anyway. He is completely oblivious to the fact that Tawny is having an affair with Heath.
* [[Matt Besser]] as '''Anthony''' – Shauna's husband. He and Shauna are constantly fighting and both appear to hate each other.
* [[Jerry Minor]] as '''Rodney''' – Phe Phe's constantly cheating husband. He works as a sports mascot. He and Phe Phe later get divorced after she catches him in bed with another woman.
* [[Seth Morris]] as '''T.J.''' – Crystal's very controlling husband, who forbids Crystal from most activities because it goes against the Bible, which she has not read because he claims it is in "Jewish".
* [[Dannah Phirman]] as '''Alli''' – A wannabe hotwife who is often seen hanging around the ladies, usually trying to spread gossip. She isn't a hotwife but likes to tell everyone she could be.
* [[Sterling Knight]] as '''Billy''' – Veronica's under-aged boyfriend. He is not very smart.
* [[Jeff Hiller]] as '''Antoine Donner''' – The party planner often hired by the ladies.

Other guest appearances have included [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]], [[Rich Fulcher]], [[Melissa Rauch]], [[Kulap Vilaysack]], [[Lauren Lapkus]], and [[Horatio Sanz]].

===Season two – ''The Hotwives of Las Vegas'' (2015) ===
* [[Casey Wilson]] as '''Jenfer Beudon: "The Southern Bitch"''' – Cocky, southern, white-trash, and very pregnant. Best friends with First Lady until she became pregnant with Ace's baby (something Jenfer doesn't acknowledge happened until First Lady and Ace broke up, although it happened over six months prior). Writer of "The Loneliest Fingertip", a children's book based on her lack of fingertip on her right hand.
* [[Angela Kinsey]] as '''Stephanie: "The First Lady"''' – A highly tailored, uptight snob. Was married to the former mayor of the Vegas Strip. Creator of the ''Anorexi-Yeah!'' "food" line. Former best friends with Jenfer, then enemies, then the adopted mother of Jenfer's baby (who she insists is actually biologically hers).

=== Age of Demigods ===

First novel in the four-part series is set in the ancient civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient [[Wales|Cymru]]. The story follows a young [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] princess that has been plagued by nightmares every year on the night of her birthday when a full Blood-Moon rises. She is then swept away from her palace and the protection of her parents by her long time friend, Eoghan MacBeatha, a [[Druid]] apprentice. Eoghan steals the princess away from her homeland after a threat has stormed the palace, promising to kill her parents, Remus and Alina. Three allies, Lysandros, Brian, and Cailean, step in to save Remus and Alina from the attack, but end up having to say goodbye to a dear friend before setting off on a quest to find Breanna and Eoghan.

The book continues on a three quest adventure until the quests converge into an epic battle for survival among demigods, gods, and an old, resurrected threat the gods created to end war, Elpis, The Queen. Elpis has long been dead, destroyed by her husband, Eversor, under a spell from the gods. Upon her death The Power that lived in her blood escaped destruction and sought refuge in Etruria and Cymru until it could find its true vessel, Breanna, was ready to accept it. Eversor hunts Bre and her family in order to steal The Power and resurrect Elpis from the dead.

Through bloody carnage, Eversor manages to restore Elpis and half her powers. It is then the gods beg for Breanna's and her followers' protection. After realizing that the horrifying Blood-Moon nightmares were actually Elpis' memories reaching out to her, Bre doubts the intentions of the gods and wonders if they will try to destroy her like they did Elpis.

Breanna is a young girl with an old destiny that is torn between power and survival.&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Mancuso&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsunade''' (綱手), featured in the [[Japan]]ese [[folklore|folktale]] ''[[Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari]]'' (児雷也豪傑物語, "The tale of the gallant Jiraiya"), was the friend/wife of the [[ninja]] [[Jiraiya]]. She mastered  [[slug]] magic and was able to summon an enormous snail or turn into one.

== Influences on Fiction ==
* In the popular [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Naruto]]'', a character called Tsunade is the Hokage of the village where [[Naruto Uzumaki]] lives. Tsunade, Jiraiya, and Orochimaru appear as three legendary ninja known as the Sannin. ''Naruto''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Tsunade can summon slugs into battle, up to and including Kaiju-sized monsters. This summoning ability is predicated on Tsunade having established a blood-contract with all slug species. Jiraiya and Orochimaru can also summon toads and snakes (respectively), and Orochimaru is also capable of transforming into a snake.

'''Vega''', also known as '''Balrog''', is a fictional character from the ''[[Street Fighter (series)|Street Fighter]]'' fighting game series by [[Capcom]]. Vega is a mask-wearing, claw-wielding fighter from Spain who uses a personal fighting style combining Japanese [[Ninja in popular culture|ninjutsu]] and Spanish [[Matador|bullfighting]], earning him the nickname of "Spanish Ninja".

Vega first appears in the original ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' in 1991 as the second of four boss opponents the player faces at the end of the [[single-player video game|single-player mode]], a group known as the Four Devas or Grand Masters. From ''[[Street Fighter II: Champion Edition]]'' (the second version of the game) onwards, Vega and the other three boss characters, became playable. He reappears as a playable character in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', ''[[Street Fighter EX2]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter EX3|EX3]]'', the ''[[Capcom vs. SNK]]'' series, [[SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos]], ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]'', ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'', ''[[Ultra Street Fighter IV]]'', and ''[[Street Fighter V]]''.

==Conception and creation==
Vega was designed by [[Akira Yasuda]] with the premise of the [[Street Fighter (video game)|original ''Street Fighter'']]'s [[List of Street Fighter characters#Geki|Geki]] character in mind, and was initially conceived as a brief sketch of a masked man in a ripped shirt with long, frizzy hair.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; As development progressed the design evolved into a large, unarmed man, retaining the mask and dressed as a [[matador]]. The design was changed again, revolving around the concept of a foreign soldier with a cross on his vest and armed with a [[broadsword]], while still retaining the mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual |author=Capcom Sound Team Alph Lyla |url=http://fightingstreet.com/folders/artworkfolder/artworkpages/sf_art_pages/sfii_art_pages/sfiiww_art_pages/sfiiww_bwart2.html |title=Capcom-004: Street Fighter II Complete File |publisher=Capcom |date=November 15, 1992 |format=CD/booklet |section=Making of Street Fighter II |page=5 |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was eventually replaced in turn with another concept, a masked ninja in a bodysuit armed with a long metal claw on his right hand.&lt;ref name="EGM"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |author=Staff |date=April 1992 |issue=33 |title=The Making of Street Fighter II |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the character's finalized appearance was a culmination of all of these, incorporating various aspects of each into the finished design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insertcredit.com/features/makingsf2/ |title=The Making Of Street Fighter II (or, Writing is Rewriting) |publisher=Insert Credit |author=Kohler, Chris |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615070321/http://www.insertcredit.com/features/makingsf2/ |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the original ''Street Fighter II'' was being [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] for the English language market, Capcom's North American marketing staff felt that the name of the game's final boss, Vega, did not sound threatening enough to North American audiences, and was hence better suited for the bullfighter, as Vega is by itself a Spanish surname. Plus, afraid of a lawsuit from American boxer Mike Tyson (whose name and appearance was very similar to the game's first boss), they felt inclined to change the name of this character as well. As a result, Claw's name was changed from Balrog to Vega for English-language appearances, while original Vega (Dictator) became M.Bison and original M.Bison (the boxer) became Balrog.&lt;ref name=isaoabe&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409090400/http://www.capcom.co.jp/sound/topics/tpcs1_2.html|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/sound/topics/tpcs1_2.html|title=Interview with ''Street Fighter II'' composer Isao Abe |archivedate=April 9, 2004 |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Capcom]] |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Vega is one of the few ''Street Fighter'' characters to constantly carry a weapon, a ''[[wiktionary:tekkō kagi|tekkō kagi]]'', and the only character to do so in ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. This claw is useful for slashing attacks, yet curved in the end to prevent him from lethally stabbing his opponents. This claw gives him a very long range compared to most characters. It is the same type of weapon worn by [[Street Fighter (video game)#Japan stage|Geki]] in the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'', though longer.

Obsessively narcissistic and vain, Vega considers himself the epitome of beauty and perfection. As such, he wears his expressionless mask not to conceal his identity, but to protect his face from scarring or bruising during battle; in fact, Vega removes it after winning fights, as well as in certain character-select images.

Vega wears [[murrey]] and yellow [[Traje de luces|ceremonial trousers]], a red sash, loafers, and white leggings of a matador, suggesting his involvement with [[bullfighting]]. This decorative garb also offers matadors ease of movement, and is ideal for Vega's acrobatic maneuvers.

Depending on the games' color palettes, Vega has brown or blonde hair. In the various games in the ''Street Fighter II'' series, Vega's game sprite and character select profile shot depict him with brown hair, while his ending in ''Street Fighter II': Champion Edition'' and ''Super Street Fighter II'' depict him with blonde hair. In ''Street Fighter EX2'' and ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'', Vega is depicted with blonde hair in all iterations. His tattoos consist of a purple snake on his chest and two purple bands which circle his arm. In ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', in a victory pose, Vega will hold his arm out towards the opponent, with the tattoo coming to life and hissing at it. In the mobile puzzle game ''Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits'', he appears as a [[super-deformed]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mmosite.com/content/2014-10-13/capcom_announces_new_street_fighter_mobile_title_with_puzzle_element.shtml|title=Capcom Announces New Street Fighter Mobile Title with Puzzle Element|publisher=MMOsite|date=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Vega's backstory reveals that he was born to a noble family in [[Spain]]. As he matured, Vega studied bullfighting, a Spanish cultural tradition. He later traveled to Japan to learn [[ninjutsu]], a style that he believed would mesh well with his natural grace and agility. Returning home, Vega combined bullfighting with ninjutsu and entered an underground [[cage fighting]] circuit, where he quickly became one of the best. 

For undisclosed reasons, his family's status dwindled, causing his mother to remarry for financial security. Vega's new stepfather, incensed that his wife [[Hypergamy|only valued him for his money]], murdered her right in front of Vega, who killed him in return. The incident warped his mind and caused him to develop a dual personality: suave nobleman by day, sadistic masked murderer by night. Brandishing a three-pronged, razor sharp claw gauntlet, Vega embarked on many murderous rampages, taking great pleasure in mutilating his victims, especially those he perceived as "ugly". The murder of his mother caused him to view "beauty" as a trait of heroism and strength, whereas "ugliness" represented cowardice and evil. Eventually, Vega's insatiable bloodlust and brutal fighting skills caught the attention of criminal leader [[M. Bison]], who accepted the young nobleman into Shadaloo as his personal assassin and one of his three Grand Master bodyguards. Vega accepted Bison's offer purely to improve his own aesthetic senses. His official tag partner in the crossover fighting game ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' is Balrog, although they are shown to loathe each other due to their clashing personalities. 

====Gameplay====
Vega is one of the fastest characters in the ''Street Fighter'' series, and also one of the most fragile. His strength is in long-range attacks, with the reach advantage provided by his claw, his speed and jumps. During fights, Vega is capable of losing his claw. This reduces his attack range significantly, and prevents him from performing certain moves. Since ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'', Vega can pick up the claw again if lost. Other games allow Vega to lose his mask, lowering his health but increasing his attack power as a result. In ''[[Street Fighter EX2]], [[Street Fighter EX3]]'', and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' Vega can take his claw and mask off manually. Vega becomes able to switch freely between clawed and bare-handed in his most recent rendition, ''[[Street Fighter V]]''.

===In other media===
In the 1994 live-action film version of ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'', Vega was played by Native American actor [[Jay Tavare]] in his film debut. He is depicted as a member of the Shadaloo Tong working for Sagat. Along with his trademark mask and claw, he has very few lines during the whole film and utters them while his face is obscured or when he is off-camera. He forms a rivalry with [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]], and in the film's final battle, he is defeated by Ryu and abandoned by Sagat to presumably die when Bison's base explodes. He also appears in the arcade game based on the film titled ''[[Street Fighter: The Movie (arcade game)|Street Fighter: The Movie]]'', as well as in the [[Street Fighter: The Movie (home video game)|home video game]] also based on the film. In the arcade version of the game, Vega has the ability to take his mask off and throw it to his opponent. In the home version, this ability was removed and Vega fights unmasked.

In the 2009 live-action film ''[[Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li]]'', Vega is played by rapper [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] of the group [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. This version of Vega retains his claw and mask, but the mask is made of metal and he appears dressed in black from head to toe. The film changed the reason Vega wears the mask, from protecting his face to hiding his identity.

In the 1994 anime film ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'', Vega was voiced by [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] in Japanese and [[Richard Cansino]] in the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]]. In the film, he works for Shadowlaw under Bison, and is sent to New York to kill [[Chun-Li]]. He almost succeeds through a vicious and bloody duel that takes its toll on both fighters, but after baiting Vega into a rage by attacking his face, Chun-Li eventually defeats him by Hundred-Burst-Kicking him through her apartment wall into the streets far below.

In the 1995 anime ''[[Street Fighter II V]]'', Vega appears as a bullfighter who tries to seduce Chun-Li. Envious over Ryu and [[Ken Masters|Ken]]'s friendship with Chun-Li, Vega invites the three to a party in his castle, which is actually a trap to lure Ryu and Ken to a caged death match with him. Since Ryu does not attend the party, he subsequently fights only Ken, and is finally defeated after a brutal match. He is given the surname of '''Fabio La Cerda''' in the series. Kaneto Shiozawa provided his voice for the Japanese version, while [[Vic Mignogna]] provided his voice for the English dub from ADV Films and [[Richard Cansino]] provided his voice for the Animaze English dub.

Vega appears in two episodes of the 1995 American ''[[Street Fighter (TV series)|Street Fighter]]'' animated series, "Eye of the Beholder" and "Face of Fury," where he is a former henchman of Bison promised eternal youth who develops a rivalry against [[Blanka]]. He was voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]] in the series.

Vega makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in 1999 anime miniseries ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'', where he ends up pulverizing, though not outright killing, his opponent Dan Hibiki during an underground fight. Vega reappears in the Shadaloo helicopter near the end of ''[[Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind]]''. He will appear in the upcoming ''Street Fighter: World Warrior''.

The '''Yariguí people''' were an indigenous [[Colombia]]n tribe that gave their name to a mountainous area they once inhabited in the Andean cloud forest. It has been said that they committed mass suicide instead of submitting to Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Territory ==
The indigenous nation of the '''Yariguies'''  was located in an extensive forested area of the [[Magdalena River Valley]], in the western portion of the current department of Santander in Colombia.

The approximate boundaries of their indigenous territory were the [[Minero River]] to the south, the Sogamoso River to the north, the [[Magdalena River]] to the west, and the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]] to the east. They lived, then, in a region of woodland and rainforest, a land of high temperatures and great humidity, which made life difficult for the inhabitants.

== Language and culture ==
Belonging to the [[Carib language]] family, the Yariguies were a people formed essentially of nomadic hunters and gatherers. They were divided into five independent clans: the Arayas Chiracotas, Tolomeos, Suamacaes, Opones, and Carares. Each clan was independently governed by its own [[cacique]]. 

== History ==
From first contact with Spanish explorers, the Yariguies were hostile and presented a strong resistance. They impeded the invaders' penetration into their lands, aided by the natural difficulties of the rainforest. The chroniclers, like [[friar]] [[Pedro Simón]], referred to the Yariguies, using their [[macana]]s, arrows, poisoned darts, and surprise tactics to reduce the 16th-century army of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] from 900 to 169 men.

By 1570, four Yariguí caciques were known to the Spaniards: Beto of the Arayas, Caciquillo of the Opones, Martinillo of the Carares, and Suamacá of the los Suamacaes, all dedicated to attacking the expeditions on the Magdalena, [[Sogamoso River|Sogamoso]], [[Carare River|Carare]], and Opón rivers that transported colonists, militias, and merchants to Vélez and Santafé de Bogotá. They also attacked troops sent to hunt down natives.

The ''cacique'' Pipatón (he was the husband of ''cacica'' Yarima) offered the most famous resistance, having been captured and maimed by having his heels cut in 1601, after which he escaped and returned to lead the resistance against the Spanish. Nonetheless, at the end of his life, he turned himself in to the colonial authorities and was sent to a convent of friars in Bogotá, where he died after 1612.

Three circumstances combined to weigh against the Yariguies' desires to keep their land free from intrusion: their low birthrate, the increasing number of colonists, and the diseases brought by Europeans, especially the flu, [[smallpox]], and [[measles]], against which the natives had no immunological defenses. These factors caused the population of indigenous peoples to decline drastically over the 17th and 18th centuries.

== Population decline ==
At the moment of the Spanish arrival in 1536, the Yariguies are estimated to have comprised a population of some 50,000 persons. Three centuries later 15,000 still survived. Until that date, the woodland and rainforest that made up their landbase was for the most part intact. By 1880, the Yariguies numbered 10,000, then 5,000 in 1900, 1,000 in 1910, 500 in 1920, and none in 1940. The blame for the final extinction of this community is due to the new mestizo colonists who invaded their territory in search of pastureland, quinine, tagua, wood, and, ultimately, petroleum. Additionally, the construction of a road from Socorro, then capital of Santander, to the Magdalena River, brought further incursions into the region and authorized "hunting parties" against the indigenous peoples, destroying whole villages.
