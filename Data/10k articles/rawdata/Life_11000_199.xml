      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4722">'''A. Ronald Walton''' (1943 &amp;ndash; September 5, 1996) was professor of [[Chinese language]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], who was regarded as an expert in language pedagogy, policy, and planning. He was known for his promotion of the teaching of foreign languages and was the Deputy Director of the [[National Foreign Language Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from its inception in 1987 until his death.

== Chinese linguistics ==

Walton graduated from the [[University of Texas]] in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in general linguistics, before proceeding to complete an M.A. and Ph.D. at [[Cornell University]] in general and Chinese linguistics. He then commenced his academic career by teaching Chinese language and linguistics, specializing in research into Chinese dialectology and phonology. Walton was the Deputy Director and Acting Director of Cornell’s intensive Chinese language program from 1972 to 1975, before transferring to the [[State University of New York]] at [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and in 1983, to the University of Maryland, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Walton remained a core member of the University of Maryland faculty despite his wide responsibilities in various organizations. He was instrumental in creating the Language Center and was its Director from 1991 to 1993. In the Department of Asian and East European Languages and Cultures, he devoted a substantial amount of time to shaping the language curriculum, and to formulating M.A. programs for training language teachers who could understand and attend to the needs of the future. Walton compiled two monographs on Chinese phonology: ''Phonological Redundancy in Shanghai'' (1976) and ''Tone, Segment and Syllable in Chinese: A Polydimensional Approach to Surface Phonetic Structure'' (1983); both appeared as part of the Cornell East Asia Papers Series.

== Business Chinese ==

In the first part of the 1980s, Walton's professional interests changed direction. He penned a self-study guide to accompany a widely used [[Japanese language]] text, before coauthoring a three-volume text, ''A Course in Business Chinese''. Following his completion of the books, he began work as a consultant and reviewer of language curricula and programs, in Chinese and other languages as well. It was in this field that he quickly established a reputation as one of the best in the business.

In 1987, Walton was one of the main forces behind the creation of the National Foreign Language Center in Washington, D.C.. He was the inaugural Deputy Director, serving in the role until his death. It was in this role that Walton left his deepest imprint on national language policy and standards in the field of foreign language education. Working with ACTFL, the [[US Department of Education]], the College Board, among other organizations, Walton helped to formulate nationwide standards for [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] Chinese and [[Korean language|Korean]].

== Other languages ==

As a co-Director of the ''National Council of Organizations of [[Less Commonly Taught Languages]]'' (NCOLCTL), Walton a key figure in creating national teachers’ organizations for African, Southeast and South Asian languages, and Korean. Walton penned ten articles and two monographs on language assessment, policy, and standards; lecturing about these topics on a regular basis. Walton was the main investigator or co-investigator, for more than fifteen major grants shaping a new vision for language in the United States. Despite this, Walton retained his lifelong commitment to his first interest, Chinese language education; at the time of his death he was contracted to [[Yale University]] to develop a new textbook in basic Chinese.

== Personal life ==

His mother, Lavera, raised Ron and his sister as a single mom in the late forties and  fifties.  He married his high school sweetheart, Karen.  They were married for nine years and had a daughter, Kris. Walton died of acute coronary thrombosis on September 5, 1996, while visiting his mother in [[Austin, Texas]], at the age of 53.

Belyavsky was also the first presenter of the popular TV Show ''The 13 Chairs Tavern''. In 1988 he was designated The [[Meritorious Artist|Meritorious Artist of Russia]]; in 2003, he was named a [[People's Artist of Russia]].&lt;ref name="rusactors"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = | url  = http://www.rusactors.ru/b/belyavski/index.shtml|title = Alexander Belyavsky| publisher  = www.rusactors.ru| accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kinoteatr"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date =| url = http://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/m/sov/401/bio/|title = Alexander Belyavsky. Biography| publisher  = www.kino-teatr.ru| accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Alexander Belyavsky was born in Moscow, to Boris Moiseyevich Belyavsky and his wife Lyubov Alexandrovna. He was the family's eldest child, with two younger siblings. After finishing school in 1949 he enrolled into the Geological research faculty of the Moscow's Gold and Non-ferrous metals Institute where he studied up until 1955, making frequent trips to the Central Asian Soviet republics for professional practice. After the graduation Belyavsky spent several years in [[Irkutsk]], working for the East-Siberian Geological department. He made his debut as an actor at the Irkutsk Drama Theatre, playing Molchalin in [[Alexander Griboyedov]]'s ''[[Woe from Wit]]''. Back in Moscow Belyavsky continued working as a geology engineer, occasionally taking part in amateur theatrical productions staged by The Teachers' House. He decided then to quit his regular job, enrolled into the [[Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute]], and joined [[Vladimir Etush]]'s class at the [[Vakhtangov Theatre]]. In summer 1957 Belyavsky made his debut on screen in ''Tales About Lenin'' (as a young worker Kolya). Three years later, still a student, he appeared in the Kiev Studio's film ''Save Our Souls'' (1960).&lt;ref name="rusactors"/&gt;

In 1961 Belyavsky graduated the Shchukin Theatre Institute with honors and was invited to join the [[Moscow Satire Theatre]]. In 1964 the [[Poland|Polish]] director [[Leonard Buczkowski]] cast him in the film ''Przerwany lot'' (Aborted Flight).&lt;ref&gt;[http://za-nami.narod.ru/html/koe-chto.html Fox's Jubilee /ЮБИЛЕЙ ФОКСА (из «Крестьянской Руси»)]&lt;/ref&gt; While working in [[Warsaw]] Belyavsky learned the [[Polish language]] and later appeared in five more Polish films, including the popular TV wartime thriller series ''The Four Tankmen and a Dog'' (as a Soviet captain Pavlov). In 1964 he left the Satire Theatre but never severed ties with its troupe, having become the co-director (with Georgy Zelinsky) and the first presenter of the popular TV series ''13 Chairs Tavern''. It was Belyavsky who came up with the idea of staging a satirical TV series ridiculing a good-for-nothing 'firm' (apparently based in Poland), members of which meet at the tavern to discuss their (highly ridiculous) problems and perform Polish (later West European) pop songs in a karaoke-style.&lt;ref name="kinoteatr"/&gt;

In 1964 Belyavsky joined the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre|Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]], then moved in 1966 to the Theatre-Studio of a Cinema Actor. All in all he appeared in more than one hundred films (working in [[Poland]], [[East Germany]], [[North Korea]], [[Finland]], France, [[Chekhoslovakia]], United States), one of his best-known roles being that of villainous Fox in [[Stanislav Govorukhin]]'s  ''[[The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed]]'' (1979). In the 1990s Belyavsky hosted several TV shows; he played [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Igor Gostev's ''Grey Wolves'' (1993). In 1999 he returned to the theatre and in 2003 was awarded the title of The People's Artist of Russia.

In December 2003, Alexander Belyavsky suffered a stroke which left him incapacitated. On September 8, 2012, he was found on the ground by the house where he lived, having fallen, apparently, from the staircase window between the 5th and the 6th floor of the house he lived in. The initial police reports  implied it was suicide;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = September 8, 2012| url  = http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/331282|title = Investigators Are Inclined to See it as a Suicide| publisher = NTV Russia| accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; later it was suggested the fall might have been accidental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argumenti.ru/cinema/2012/09/201075 «Аргументы недели»: Народный артист России Александр Белявский выпал из окна многоэтажки случайно]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Belyavsky was buried in Kuzminskoye Cemetery in Moscow.&lt;ref name="rusactors"/&gt;

==Private life==
Alexander Belyavsky was married twice. In his first marriage, to Valentina Viktorovna he fathered a son, Boris (born on March 22, 1973, drowned aged two) and daughter Nadezhda (born in 1976). With his second wife Lyudmila Tikhonovna they had a daughter, Alexandra, born on August 28, 2003, just three months prior to his suffering a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tvnet.ru/content/show/aleksandr-belyavskii-biografiya_14161.html Alexander Belyavsky’s biography at www.1tvnet.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Allen''' (c. 1888&amp;ndash;1938) was an English [[executioner]] from [[Wolverhampton]]. His career lasted from 1928 to 1937, during which he carried out 3 [[hanging]]s as a chief executioner and assisted at 14 others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hangmen.html "The English hangmen 1850 - 1964"]. ''capitalpunishmentuk.org''. Retrieved 2010-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen participated in his first hanging on 11 December 1928, when he assisted [[Robert Baxter (executioner)|Robert Baxter]]. It did not go well for Allen. He failed to move clear of the trapdoor after securing the prisoner's legs and then fell into the pit when Baxter pulled the lever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html "History of British judicial hanging"]. ''capitalpunishmentuk.org''. Retrieved 2010-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen was not injured.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Steve. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hvu1GQAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Executioner's+Bible&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=adXcTN3SOIG8lQenjamGDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA The Executioner's Bible: The Story of Every British Hangman of the Twentieth Century]'' (John Blake, 2008), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, Allen did not receive many jobs. When he did, it was as an assistant to [[Thomas Pierrepoint]]. His first action as chief executioner came on 23 November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Steve, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reunited with Baxter one more time, in 1934; although there was no incident such as the one that had occurred during their first partnership, Baxter did state later that he found Allen "an unpleasant person to share sleeping quarters with."&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Steve, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen carried out his last hanging on 17 August 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, Steve, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2068">'''Aristobulus III''' (53–36 BC) was the last scion of the [[Hasmonean]] royal house, brother of [[Herod the Great]]'s wife [[Mariamne (second wife of Herod)|Mariamne]], and paternal grandson of [[Aristobulus II]]. He was a favorite of the people on account of his noble descent and handsome presence, and thus became an object of fear to Herod, who at first sought to ignore him entirely by debarring him from the high priesthood. But his mother [[Alexandra Maccabeus|Alexandra]] (63 BC – 28 BC), through intercession with [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]], compelled Herod to remove [[Ananelus]] from the office of High Priest and appoint Aristobulus instead.

To secure himself against danger from Aristobulus, Herod instituted a system of espionage against him and his mother. This surveillance proved so onerous that they sought to gain their freedom by taking refuge with Cleopatra. As told by the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]], their plans were betrayed and the disclosure had the effect of greatly increasing Herod's suspicions against his brother-in-law. As Herod dared not resort to open violence, he caused him to be drowned while he was bathing in a pool in [[Jericho]] during a banquet organized by Aristobulus' mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Josephus| title=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BabelNet''' is a [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] lexicalized [[semantic network]] and [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], at  the Department of Computer Science Linguistic Computing Laboratory.&lt;ref name="NavigliPonzetto12"&gt;R. Navigli and S. P Ponzetto. 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2012.07.001 BabelNet: The Automatic Construction, Evaluation and Application of a Wide-Coverage Multilingual Semantic Network]. Artificial Intelligence, 193, Elsevier, pp. 217-250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Navigli, S. P. Ponzetto. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1023.pdf BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network]. Proc. of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2010), Uppsala, Sweden, July 11–16, 2010, pp. 216–225.&lt;/ref&gt; BabelNet was automatically created by linking Wikipedia to the most popular computational [[Dictionary|lexicon]] of the [[English language]], [[WordNet]]. The integration is done using an automatic mapping and by filling in lexical gaps in resource-poor [[language]]s by using [[statistical machine translation]]. The result is an "encyclopedic dictionary" that provides [[concept]]s and [[Named entity|named entities]] [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] in many languages and connected with large amounts of [[Semantic relation#Relationships|semantic relations]]. Additional lexicalizations and definitions are added by linking to free-license wordnets, OmegaWiki, the English [[Wiktionary]], [[Wikidata]], [[FrameNet]], [[VerbNet]] and others. Similarly to WordNet, BabelNet groups [[word]]s in different languages into sets of [[synonyms]], called ''Babel [[synsets]]''. For each Babel synset, BabelNet provides short definitions (called [[Definition|glosses]]) in many languages harvested from both WordNet and Wikipedia.

[[File:The BabelNet structure.png|thumb|600px|BabelNet is a multilingual semantic network obtained as an integration of WordNet and Wikipedia.]]

==Statistics of BabelNet==

{{As of|2018|02}}, BabelNet (version 4.0) covers 284 [[language]]s, including all European languages, most [[Asian language]]s, and [[Latin]]. BabelNet 4.0 contains almost 16 million synsets and about 833 million [[word sense]]s (regardless of their language). Each Babel synset contains 2 synonyms per language, i.e., word senses, on average. The semantic network includes all the lexico-semantic relations from WordNet ([[Hyponymy|hypernymy and hyponymy]], [[meronymy]] and [[holonymy]], [[antonymy]] and [[synonymy]], etc., totaling around 364,000 relation edges) as well as an underspecified relatedness relation from Wikipedia (totaling around 1,3 bilion edges).&lt;ref name="NavigliPonzetto12" /&gt; Version 4.0 also associates about 53 million images with Babel synsets and provides a Lemon [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] encoding of the resource,&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehrmann, F. Cecconi, D. Vannella, J. McCrae, P. Cimiano, R. Navigli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">A '''brain–brain interface''' is a direct communication pathway between the brain of one animal and the brain of another animal.

Brain to brain interfaces have been used to help rats collaborate with each other. When a second rat was unable to choose the correct lever, the first rat noticed (not getting a second reward), and produced a round of task-related neuron firing that made the second rat more likely to choose the correct lever.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Technologyreview.com_July_19_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/511721/rats-communicate-through-brain-chips/ |title=Rats Collaborate Through a Brain-to-Brain Interface |newspaper=Technologyreview.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Rajesh Rao]] was able to use electrical brain recordings and a form of magnetic stimulation to send a brain signal to Andrea Stocco on the other side of the [[University of Washington]] campus.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Washington.edu_July_19_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/08/27/researcher-controls-colleagues-motions-in-1st-human-brain-to-brain-interface/ |title=Researcher controls colleague's motions in 1st human brain-to-brain interface |newspaper=Washington.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, researchers linked up multiple brains, of both monkeys and rats, to form an “organic computer.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Blogs.discovermagazine.com_July_19_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/07/10/wired-brains-together/#.VayFGPk8ZcM |title=Researchers Wire Brains Together to Make a Super-Brain |newspaper=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hypothesized that by using [[neurotechnology|brain-to-brain interfaces]] (BTBIs) a biological computer, or '''brain-net''', could be constructed using animal brains as its computational units. Initial exploratory work demonstrated collaboration between rats in distant cages linked by signals from cortical microelectrode arrays implanted in their brains. The rats were rewarded when actions were performed by the "decoding rat" which conformed to incoming signals and when signals were transmitted by the "encoding rat" which resulted in the desired action. In the initial experiment the rewarded action was pushing a lever in the remote location corresponding to the position of a lever near a lighted LED at the home location.&lt;ref name=NYT022813&gt;{{cite news|title=In a First, Experiment Links Brains of Two Rats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/science/new-research-suggests-two-rat-brains-can-be-linked.html|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 28, 2013|author=James Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a month was required for the rats to acclimate themselves to incoming "[[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]]."&lt;ref name=FT022813&gt;{{cite news|title=Telepathic rats solve problems together|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/422e4e8a-8197-11e2-904c-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=February 28, 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=February 28, 2013|author=Clive Cookson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SR1319&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pais-Vieira|first=Miguel |author2=Mikhail Lebedev |author3=Carolina Kunicki |author4=Jing Wang |author5=[[Miguel Nicolelis|Miguel A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lastly, it is important to stress that the topology of BTBI does not need to be restricted to one encoder and one decoder subjects. Instead, we have already proposed that, in theory, channel accuracy can be increased if instead of a dyad a whole grid of multiple reciprocally interconnected brains are employed. Such a computing structure could define the first example of an organic computer capable of solving [[heuristic]] problems that would be deemed non-computable by a general Turing-machine. Future works will elucidate in detail the characteristics of this multi-brain system, its computational capabilities, and how it compares to other non-Turing computational architectures&lt;ref name=SR1319 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical '''cable theory''' uses [[mathematical model]]s to calculate the [[electric current]] (and accompanying [[voltage]]) along passive&lt;ref name="classical" group="lower-alpha"/&gt; [[neurite]]s, particularly the [[dendrite]]s that receive [[synapse|synaptic]] inputs at different sites and times. Estimates are made by modeling dendrites and [[axons]] as cylinders composed of segments with [[capacitance]]s &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;/math&gt; and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]s &lt;math&gt;r_m&lt;/math&gt; combined in parallel (see Fig. 1). The capacitance of a neuronal fiber comes about because [[electrostatic]] forces are acting through the very thin lipid bilayer (see Figure 2). The resistance in series along the fiber &lt;math&gt;r_l&lt;/math&gt; is due to the [[axoplasm]]'s significant resistance to movement of [[electric charge]].

[[Image:NeuronCapacitanceRev.jpg|thumb|alt=Capacitance in a neuron fiber|300px|right|Figure. 2: Fiber capacitance]]

== History ==

Cable theory in computational [[neuroscience]] has roots leading back to the 1850s, when Professor [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later known as Lord Kelvin) began developing mathematical models of signal decay in submarine (underwater) telegraphic cables. The models resembled the partial differential equations used by [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] to describe heat conduction in a wire.

The 1870s saw the first attempts by Hermann to model [[neuronal]] [[electrotonic potential]]s also by focusing on analogies with heat conduction. However, it was Hoorweg who first discovered the analogies with Kelvin's undersea cables in 1898 and then Hermann and Cremer who independently developed the cable theory for neuronal fibers in the early 20th century. Further mathematical theories of nerve fiber conduction based on cable theory were developed by Cole and [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] (1920s–1930s), Offner et al. (1940), and Rushton (1951).

Experimental evidence for the importance of cable theory in modelling the behavior of [[axons]] began surfacing in the 1930s from work done by Cole, Curtis, Hodgkin, [[Sir Bernard Katz]], Rushton, Tasaki and others. Two key papers from this era are those of Davis and [[Rafael Lorente de Nó|Lorente de Nó]] (1947) and Hodgkin and Rushton (1946).

The 1950s saw improvements in techniques for measuring the electric activity of individual [[neurons]]. Thus cable theory became important for analyzing data collected from intracellular microelectrode recordings and for analyzing the electrical properties of neuronal [[dendrites]]. Scientists like Coombs, [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|Eccles]], Fatt, Frank, Fuortes and others now relied heavily on cable theory to obtain functional insights of neurons and for guiding them in the design of new experiments.

Later, cable theory with its mathematical derivatives allowed ever more sophisticated [[Biological neuron model|neuron models]] to be explored by workers such as Jack, [[Wilfrid Rall|Rall]], Redman, Rinzel, Idan Segev, Tuckwell, Bell, and Iannella.

== Deriving the cable equation ==
Note, various conventions of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; exist.
Here ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, as introduced above, are measured per membrane-length unit (per meter (m)). Thus ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is measured in [[ohm]]·meters (&amp;Omega;·m) and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; in [[farad]]s per meter (F/m). This is in contrast to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (in Ω·m²) and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (in F/m²), which represent the specific resistance and capacitance respectively of one unit area of membrane (in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, if the radius, ''a'', of the axon is known,&lt;ref name="fiberradius" group="lower-alpha"/&gt; then its circumference is 2''πa'', and its ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, and its ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; values can be calculated as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;r_m = \frac{R_m}{2 \pi a\ }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c_m = C_m 2 \pi a\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
 
These relationships make sense intuitively, because the greater the circumference of the axon, the greater the area for charge to escape through its membrane, and therefore the lower the membrane resistance (dividing ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; by 2''πa''); and the more membrane available to store charge (multiplying ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; by 2''πa'').
Similarly, the specific resistance, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, of the axoplasm allows one to calculate the longitudinal intracellular resistance per unit length, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, (in Ω·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by the equation:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;r_l = \frac{R_l}{\pi a^2\ }&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
 
The greater the cross sectional area of the axon, ''πa''², the greater the number of paths for the charge to flow through its axoplasm, and the lower the axoplasmic resistance.

Several important avenues of extending classical cable theory have recently seen the introduction of endogenous structures in order to analyze the effects of protein polarization within dendrites and different synaptic input distributions over the dendritic surface of a neuron.

To better understand how the cable equation is derived, first simplify the theoretical neuron even further and pretend it has a perfectly sealed membrane (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;=∞) with no loss of current to the outside, and no capacitance (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0). A current injected into the fiber &lt;ref name="linearity" group="lower-alpha"/&gt; at position ''x''&amp;nbsp;= 0 would move along the inside of the fiber unchanged. Moving away from the point of injection and by using [[Ohm's law]] (''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''IR'') we can calculate the voltage change as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = -i_l r_l \Delta x\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}} where the negative is because current flows down the potential gradient.

Letting Δ''x'' go towards zero and having infinitely small increments of ''x'', one can write ({{EquationNote|4}}) as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -i_l r_l\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

or

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_l} \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -i_l\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Bringing ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; back into the picture is like making holes in a garden hose. The more holes, the faster the water will escape from the hose, and the less water will travel all the way from the beginning of the hose to the end. Similarly, in an axon, some of the current traveling longitudinally through the axoplasm will escape through the membrane.

If ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the current escaping through the membrane per length unit, m, then the total current escaping along ''y'' units must be ''y·i''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the change of current in the axoplasm, Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;, at distance, Δ''x'', from position ''x''=0 can be written as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta i_l = -i_m \Delta x\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

or, using continuous, infinitesimally small increments:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial i_l}{\partial x}=-i_m\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

&lt;math&gt;i_m&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed with yet another formula, by including the capacitance. The capacitance will cause a flow of charge (a current) towards the membrane on the side of the cytoplasm. This current is usually referred to as displacement current (here denoted &lt;math&gt;i_c&lt;/math&gt;.) The flow will only take place as long as the membrane's storage capacity has not been reached. &lt;math&gt;i_c&lt;/math&gt; can then be expressed as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;i_c = c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane's capacitance and &lt;math&gt;{\partial V}/{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in voltage over time. 
The current that passes the membrane (&lt;math&gt;i_r&lt;/math&gt;) can be expressed as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;i_r=\frac{V}{r_m}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

and because &lt;math&gt;i_m = i_r + i_c&lt;/math&gt; the following equation for &lt;math&gt;i_m&lt;/math&gt; can be derived if no additional current is added from an electrode:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial i_l}{\partial x}=-i_m=-\left( \frac{V}{r_m}+c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}
 
where &lt;math&gt;{\partial i_l}/{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; represents the change per unit length of the longitudinal current.

Combining equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) and ({{EquationNote|11}}) gives a first version of a cable equation:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_l} \frac{\partial ^2 V}{\partial x^2}=c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{V}{r_m}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

which is a second-order [[partial differential equation]] (PDE).

By a simple rearrangement of equation ({{EquationNote|12}}) (see later) it is possible to make two important terms appear, namely the length constant (sometimes referred to as the space constant) denoted &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the time constant denoted &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The following sections focus on these terms.

== Length constant ==
{{Main|Length constant}}

The length constant, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda), is a parameter that indicates how far a stationary current will influence the voltage along the cable. The larger the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the farther the charge will flow. The length constant can be expressed as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \sqrt \frac{r_m}{r_l}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

The larger the membrane resistance, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the greater the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and the more current will remain inside the axoplasm to travel longitudinally through the axon. The higher the axoplasmic resistance, &lt;math&gt;r_l&lt;/math&gt;, the smaller the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the harder it will be for current to travel through the axoplasm, and the shorter the current will be able to travel.
It is possible to solve equation ({{EquationNote|12}}) and arrive at the following equation (which is valid in steady-state conditions, i.e. when time approaches infinity):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_x = V_0 e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

Where &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the depolarization at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; (point of current injection), ''e'' is the exponential constant (approximate value 2.71828) and &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage at a given distance ''x'' from ''x''=0. When &lt;math&gt;x=\lambda&lt;/math&gt; then

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{\lambda}=1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_x = V_0 e^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

which means that when we measure &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; at distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; we get

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_\lambda = \frac{V_0}{e} = 0.368 V_0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

Thus &lt;math&gt;V_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is always 36.8 percent of &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Time constant ==
{{Main|Time constant}}

Neuroscientists are often interested in knowing how fast the membrane potential, &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;, of an axon changes in response to changes in the current injected into the axoplasm. The time constant, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is an index that provides information about that value. &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tau = r_m c_m. \ &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

The larger the membrane capacitance, &lt;math&gt;c_m&lt;/math&gt;, the more current it takes to charge and discharge a patch of membrane and the longer this process will take. The larger the membrane resistance &lt;math&gt; r_m &lt;/math&gt;, the harder it is for a current to induce a change in membrane potential. So the higher the &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; the slower the nerve impulse can travel. That means, membrane potential (voltage across the membrane) lags more behind current injections. Response times vary from 1–2 milliseconds in neurons that are processing information that needs high temporal precision to 100 milliseconds or longer. A typical response time is around 20 milliseconds.

== Generic form and mathematical structure ==
If one multiplies equation ({{EquationNote|12}}) by &lt;math&gt;r_m&lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the equal sign we get:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{r_m}{r_l} \frac{\partial ^2 V}{\partial x^2}=c_m r_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+ V&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}

and recognize &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 = {r_m}/{r_l}&lt;/math&gt; on the left side and &lt;math&gt;\tau = c_m r_m&lt;/math&gt; on the right side. The cable equation can now be written in its perhaps best known form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\lambda^2 \frac{\partial ^2 V}{\partial x^2}=\tau \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+ V&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

This is a 1D [[Heat equation]] or [[Diffusion Equation]] for which many solution methods, such as Green's functions and Fourier methods, have been developed.

It is also a special case of the [[Telegrapher's equation]].

== Notes ==

{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|refs=
&lt;ref name="classical" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Passive here refers to the membrane resistance being voltage-independent. However recent experiments (Stuart and Sakmann 1994) with dendritic membranes shows that many of these are equipped with voltage gated [[ion channel]]s thus making the resistance of the membrane voltage dependent. Consequently there has been a need to update the classical cable theory to accommodate for the fact that most dendritic membranes are not passive.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="fiberradius" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Classical cable theory assumes that the fiber has a constant radius along the distance being modeled.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="linearity" group="lower-alpha"&gt;Classical cable theory assumes that the inputs (usually injections with a micro device) are currents which can be summed linearly. This linearity does not hold for changes in synaptic membrane conductance.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Cell-free protein synthesis''', also known as '''''[[in vitro]]'' [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]''' or '''CFPS''', is the production of [[protein]] using [[Biology|biological]] machinery in a [[cell-free system]], that is, without the use of living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The ''in vitro'' protein synthesis environment is not constrained by a [[cell wall]] or [[homeostasis]] conditions necessary to maintain cell viability.  Thus, CFPS enables direct access and control of the [[Translation (biology)|translation]] environment which is advantageous for a number of applications including co-translational solubilisation of membrane proteins, optimisation of protein production, incorporation of non-natural amino acids, selective and site-specific labelling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cell-Free Protein Synthesis|author1=Roos|first1=C|last2=Kai|first2=L|last3=Haberstock|first3=S|last4=Proverbio|first4=D|last5=Ghoshdastider|first5=U|last6=Ma|first6=Y|last7=Filipek|first7=S|last8=Wang|first8=X|last9=Dötsch|first9=V|year=2014|isbn=978-1-62703-781-5|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=1118|pages=109–30|chapter=High-Level Cell-Free Production of Membrane Proteins with Nanodiscs|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-782-2_7|pmid=24395412|last10=Bernhard|first10=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Roos|first1=C|last2=Kai|first2=L|last3=Proverbio|first3=D|last4=Ghoshdastider|first4=U|last5=Filipek|first5=S|last6=Dötsch|first6=V|last7=Bernhard|first7=F|year=2013|title=Co-translational association of cell-free expressed membrane proteins with supplied lipid bilayers|journal=Molecular Membrane Biology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=75–89|doi=10.3109/09687688.2012.693212|pmid=22716775}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to the open nature of the system, different expression conditions such as pH, [[Redox potential|redox potentials]], temperatures, and [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] can be screened. Since there is no need to maintain cell viability, toxic proteins can be produced.  

==Introduction==

Common components of a cell-free reaction include a cell extract, an energy source, a supply of [[amino acids]], [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[magnesium]], and the [[DNA]] with the desired [[genes]]. A cell extract is obtained by [[Lysis|lysing]] the cell of interest and [[Centrifuge|centrifuging]] out the cell walls, DNA [[genome]], and other debris. The remains are the necessary cell machinery including [[ribosomes]], [[aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases]], translation initiation and [[elongation factors]], [[nucleases]], etc.

Two types of DNA can be used in CFPS: [[plasmids]] and [[linear expression templates]] (LETs). Plasmids are circular, and only made inside cells. LETs can be made much more effectively via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] , which replicates DNA much faster than raising cells in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]]. While LETs are easier and faster to make, plasmid yields are usually much higher in CFPS. Because of this, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS with plasmids.

An energy source is an important part of a cell-free reaction. Usually, a separate mixture containing the needed energy source, along with a supply of amino acids, is added to the extract for the reaction. Common sources are [[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenol pyruvate]], [[acetyl phosphate]], and [[creatine phosphate]].

==Advantages and Applications==

CFPS has many advantages over the traditional ''[[in vivo]]'' synthesis of proteins. Most notably, a cell-free reaction, including extract preparation, usually takes 1 –2 days, whereas ''in vivo'' protein expression may take 1–2 weeks.&lt;ref name="ghoshdastider"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ma Y, Ghoshdastider U, Wang J, Ye W, Dötsch V, Filipek S, Bernhard F, Wang X |title=Cell-free expression of human glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (HsGNA1) for inhibitor screening |journal=Protein Expr. Purif. |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=120–6 |year=2012 |pmid=23036358 |doi=10.1016/j.pep.2012.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlson ED, Gan R, Hodgman CE, Jewett MC |title=Cell-free protein synthesis: applications come of age |journal=Biotechnol. Adv. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=1185–94 |year=2012 |pmid=22008973 |pmc=4038126 |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.09.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFPS is an open reaction. The lack of cell wall allows direct manipulation of the chemical environment. Samples are easily taken, concentrations optimized, and the reaction can be monitored. In contrast, once DNA is inserted into live cells, the reaction cannot be accessed until it is over and the cells are lysed.

Another advantage to CFPS is the lack of concern for toxicity. Some desired proteins and labeled proteins are toxic to cells when synthesized.&lt;ref name="Jackson2004"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Jackson AM|title=Cell-free protein synthesis for proteomics|journal=Briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics|volume=2|issue=4|year=2004|pages=308–319|issn=1473-9550|doi=10.1093/bfgp/2.4.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since live cells are not being used, the toxicity of the product protein is not a significant concern.

A major application of CFPS is incorporation of unnatural amino acids into [[protein structure]]s (see [[expanded genetic code]]). The openness of the reaction is ideal for inserting the modified [[tRNAs]] and unnatural amino acids required for such a reaction.

Synthetic biology has many other uses and is a bright future in fields such as [[protein evolution]], [[nanomachines]], [[nucleic acid circuits]], and synthesis of [[virus]]-like particles for [[vaccines]] and [[drug therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.21716 | doi=10.1002/bit.21716| pmid=18023052| title=Escherichia coli-based cell-free synthesis of virus-like particles| journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering| volume=100| issue=1| pages=28–37| year=2008| last1=Bundy| first1=Bradley C.| last2=Franciszkowicz| first2=Marc J.| last3=Swartz| first3=James R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patriarchi T, Shen A, He W, Baikoghli M, Cheng RH, Xiang YK, Coleman MA, Tian L|title=Nanodelivery of a functional membrane receptor to manipulate cellular phenotype |journal=Sci.

==Limitations==

One challenge associated with CFPS is the degradation of the DNA by [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] nucleases in the cell extract. This is particularly problematic with LETs. Cells have [[endonucleases]] that attack random sites of a DNA strands; however, much more common are the [[exonucleases]] which attack DNA from the ends. Since plasmids are circular and have no end to which the exonucleases may attach, they are not affected by the latter. LETs, however, are susceptible to both. Because of LET vulnerability, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS using plasmids.

One example of this improved protection with plasmids is use of the [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage lambda]] [[gam protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03702|title=gam - Host-nuclease inhibitor protein gam - Escherichia phage lambda - gam gene &amp; protein|website=www.uniprot.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gam is an inhibitor of [[RecBCD]], an exonuclease found in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kenan C.|title=The λ Gam Protein Inhibits RecBCD Binding to dsDNA Ends|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283607006171|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=371|issue=1|pages=19–24|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.085}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of gam, CFPS yields with LETs were greatly increased, and were comparable to CFPS yields with plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sitaraman|first=Kalavathy|last2=Esposito|first2=Dominic|last3=Klarmann|first3=George|last4=Grice|first4=Stuart F Le|last5=Hartley|first5=James L|last6=Chatterjee|first6=Deb K|title=A novel cell-free protein synthesis system|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168165604001142|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|volume=110|issue=3|pages=257–263|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2004.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PURE extracts can also be made, eliminating the concern of exonucleases. These extracts are expensive to make and are not currently an economical solution to the issue of exogenous DNA degradation.

==Types of Cell-free systems==

Common cell extracts in use today are made from ''E. coli'' (ECE), [[rabbit]] [[reticulocytes]] (RRL), [[wheat germ]] (WGE), and [[insect]] cells (ICE).&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"/&gt; All of these extracts are commercially available.

ECE is the most popular lysate for several reasons. It is the most inexpensive extract and the least time intensive to create. Also, large amounts of ''E. coli'' are easily grown, and then easily lysed through use of a [[homogenizer]]. ECE also provides the highest protein yields. However, high yield production can limit the complexity of the synthesized protein, particularly in post-translational modification. In that regard, the lower efficient [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] systems could be advantageous, provided that modifying [[enzyme]] systems have been maintained in the extracts.

Each eukaryotic system has their advantages and disadvantages. For example, WGE extract produces the highest yields of the three eukaryotic extracts; however, it is not as effective for some post-translational modifications such as [[glycosylation]].&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"/&gt; When choosing an extract, the type of post-translational modification, desired yields, and cost should be taken into account.

==History==
The first elucidation of a [[codon]] was done by [[Marshall Nirenberg]] and [[Heinrich J. Matthaei]] in 1961 at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=223178 | year=1961 | author1=Nirenberg | first1=M. W. | title=The Dependence of Cell- Free Protein Synthesis in E. Coli Upon Naturally Occurring or Synthetic Polyribonucleotides | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=47 | issue=10 | pages=1588–1602 | last2=Matthaei | first2=J. H. | bibcode=1961PNAS...47.1588N | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.10.1588 | pmid=14479932}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-[[uracil]] [[RNA]] sequence (or UUUUU... in [[biochemical]] terms) and discovered that the [[polypeptide]] they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. They thereby deduced from this poly-phenylalanine that the codon UUU specified the amino-acid phenylalanine. Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of each codon.

A '''chronic electrode implant''' is an electronic device implanted chronically (for a long period) into the brain or other electrically excitable tissue. It may record electrical impulses in the brain or may stimulate neurons with electrical impulses from an external source.

== Clinical applications and direction ==
[[Image:16wire electrode array.jpg|thumb|Example of chronic electrode implant]]
[[Image:Utah array pat5215088.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of the "Utah" chronic electrode array]]

=== Clinical applications for brain computer interfaces (BCI) ===
The potential for neural interfacing technology to restore lost sensory or motor function is staggering; victims of [[paralysis]] due to peripheral [[nerve injury]] could achieve a full recovery by directly recording the output of their [[motor cortex]], but the technology is immature and unreliable.{{ref|arosarena}}{{ref|lebedev}}  There are numerous examples in the literature of intra-cortical electrode recording used to a variety of ends that fail after a few weeks, a few months at best.{{ref|kipke}}{{ref|marzullo}}{{ref|nicolelis}}{{ref|rousche}}{{ref|santhanam}}{{ref|schwartz}}{{ref|vetter}}{{ref|williams}} This document will review the current state of research into electrode failure, focusing on recording electrodes as opposed to stimulating electrodes.

===Direction for development of Chronic BCI ===
Chronic brain-computer interfaces come in two varieties, stimulating and recording.  Applications for stimulating interfaces include sensory [[prosthetics]] ([[cochlear implant]]s, for example, are the most successful variety of sensory prosthetics) and [[deep brain stimulation]] therapies, while recording interfaces can be used for research applications{{ref|berger}} and to record the activity of speech or motor centers directly from the brain.  In principle these systems are susceptible to the same tissue response that causes failure in implanted electrodes, but stimulating interfaces can overcome this problem by increasing signal strength.  Recording electrodes, however, must rely on whatever signals are present where they are implanted, and cannot easily be made more sensitive.

Current implantable [[microelectrodes]] are unable to record single- or multi-unit activity reliably on a chronic scale.  Lebedev &amp; Nicolelis discuss in their 2006 review the specific needs for research in the field to truly improve the technology to the level of clinical implementation.  In short, the 4 requirements outlined in their review are:  
* 1) Consistent long term (over the course of years) recording of large neuronal populations residing in multiple brain areas;
* 2) Efficient computational processing of recorded data;

This review will focus on techniques pursued in the literature that are relevant to achieving the goal of consistent, long-term recordings.  Research towards this end can be divided into two primary categories: characterizing the specific causes of recording failure, and techniques for preventing or delaying electrode failure.

== Interaction between electrode and tissue ==
As mentioned above, if there is to be significant progress towards long-term implantable electrodes, an important step is documenting the response of living tissue to electrode implantation in both the acute and chronic timelines.  It is ultimately this tissue response that causes electrodes to fail by encapsulating the electrode itself in a protective layer called a “glial scar,” (see 2.2). One serious impediment to understanding the tissue response is the lack of true standardization of implantation technique or of electrode materials.  Common materials for electrode or probe construction include [[silicon]], [[platinum]], [[iridium]], [[polyimide]], [[ceramic]], [[gold]], as well as others.{{ref|cheung}}{{ref|moffit}}{{ref|vince}}{{ref|weiland}}{{ref|westby}}{{ref|moxon1}}{{ref|moxon2}}  In addition to the variety of materials used, electrodes are constructed in many different shapes,{{ref|hoogerwerf}} including planar shanks, simple uniform microwires, and probes that taper to a thin tip from a wider base.  Implantable electrode research also employs many different techniques for surgically implanting the electrodes; the most critical differences are whether or not the implant is anchored across the skull{{ref|kim}} and the speed of insertion.{{ref|biran}}  The overall observed tissue response is caused by a combination of the traumatic injury of electrode insertion and the persistent presence of a foreign body in the neural tissue.

=== Defining and minimizing acute term effects of electrode insertion ===
Damage caused by electrodes in the short term is caused by the insertion into the tissue.  Consequently, research into minimizing this is focused on the geometry of the electrode and the proper technique for insertion. Short term effects of electrode insertion on surrounding tissue have been documented extensively.{{ref|bjornsson}}  They include cell death (both [[neuronal]] and [[glial]]), severed neuronal processes and blood vessels, mechanical tissue compression, and collection of debris resulting from cell death.

In the Bjornsson et al. 2006 study, an ex vivo apparatus was constructed explicitly to study the deformation of and damage to neural tissue during electrode insertion.  Electrodes were constructed from silicon wafers to have three different sharpnesses (interior angle of 5° for sharp, 90° for medium, 150° for blunt).  Insertion speed was also presented at three speeds, 2&amp;nbsp;mm/s, 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm/s, and 0.125&amp;nbsp;mm/s.  Qualitative assessments of vascular damage were made by taking real-time images of electrodes being inserted into 500&amp;nbsp;um thick coronal brain slices.  To facilitate direct visualization of vascular deformation, tissue was labeled with fluorescent dextran and microbeads before viewing.  The fluorescent dextran filled the blood vessels, allowing initial geometry to be visualized along with any distortions or breakages. Fluorescent microbeads lodged throughout the tissue, providing discrete coordinates that aided in computerized calculations of strain and deformation.  Analysis of the images prompted the division of tissue damage into 4 categories:
* 1) fluid displacement,
* 2) vessel rupture,
* 3) vessel severing, and
* 4) vessel dragging.
Fluid displacement by device insertion frequently resulted in ruptured vessels.  Severing and dragging were consistently present along the insertion track, but did not correlate with tip geometry.  Rather, these features were correlated with insertion speed, being more prevalent at medium and slow insertion speeds.  Faster insertion of sharp probes was the only condition resulting in no reported vascular damage.

=== Tissue response to chronic-term electrode implantation ===
When implanted in neural tissue in the long term, microelectrodes stimulate a sort of foreign body response, primarily effected by [[astrocytes]] and [[microglia]].  Each cell-type performs many functions in supporting healthy, uninjured neural tissue, and each is also ‘activated’ by injury related mechanisms that result in changes in morphology, expression profile, and function.  Tissue response has also been shown to be greater in situation where the electrodes are anchored through the subject’s skull; the tethering forces aggravate the injury caused by the electrode’s insertion and sustain the tissue response.{{ref|kim}}

One function taken on by microglia when activated is to cluster around foreign bodies and degrade them enzymatically.  It has been proposed that when the foreign body cannot be degraded, as in the case of implanted electrodes whose material composition is resistant to such enzymatic dissolution, this ‘frustrated [[phagocytosis]]’ contributes to the failure of recordings, releasing necrotic substances into the immediate vicinity and contributing to cell death around the electrode.{{ref|weldon}}

Activated astrocytes form the major component of the encapsulating tissue that forms around implanted electrodes.  “''Current theories hold that glial encapsulation, i.e. [[gliosis]], insulates the electrode from nearby neurons, thereby hindering diffusion and increasing impedance, extends the distance between the electrode and its nearest target neurons, or creates an inhibitory environment for neurite extension, thus repelling regenerating neural processes away from recording sites''”.{{ref|polikov}}{{ref|griffith}}  Either activated astrocytes or buildup of cellular debris from cell death around the electrode would act to insulate the recording sites from other, active neurons.{{ref|gray}}  Even very small increases in the separation between the electrode and local nerve population can insulate the electrode completely, as electrodes must be within 100&amp;nbsp;um to get a signal.

Another recent study addresses the problem of the tissue response.{{ref|biran}}  Michigan-type electrodes (see article for detailed dimensions) were surgically inserted into the brains of Adult male Fischer 344 rats; a control population was treated with the same surgical procedures, but the electrode was implanted and immediately removed so that a comparison could be made between tissue response to acute injury and chronic presence.  Animal subjects were sacrificed at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation to quantify the tissue response with histological and immunostaining techniques.  Samples were stained for ED1 and GFAP presence.  ED1+ reading is indicative of the presence of [[macrophages]], and was observed in a densely packed region within approximately 50&amp;nbsp;um of the electrode surface.  ED1+ cells were present at both 2 and 4 weeks after implantation, with no significant difference between the time points.  Presence of GFAP indicates presence of reactive astrocytes, and was seen at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation, extending more than 500&amp;nbsp;um from the electrode surface.  Stab controls showed signs of inflammation and reactive gliosis as well, however signals were significantly lower in intensity than those found in chronic test subjects, and diminished noticeably from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.  This is strong evidence that glial scarring and the encapsulation, and eventual isolation, of implanted microelectrodes is primarily a result of chronic implantation, and not the acute injury.

Another recent study addressing the impact  of chronically implanted electrodes points that tungsten-coated electrodes seem to be well tolerated by the nervous tissue, inducing a small and circumscribed inflammatory response only in the vicinity of the implant, associated with a small cell death {{ref|freire}}.

== Developing methods to alleviate chronic effects ==
Techniques for combating long-term failure of electrodes are understandably focused on disarming the foreign body response.  This can most obviously be achieved by improving the biocompatibility of the electrode itself, thus reducing the tissue’s perception of the electrode as a foreign substance.  As a result, much of the research towards alleviating the tissue response is focused on improved [[biocompatibility]].

It is difficult to effectively evaluate progress towards improved electrode biocompatibility because of the variety of research in this field.

=== Improving biocompatibility of recording electrodes ===
This section loosely categorizes different approaches to improving biocompatibility seen in the literature.  Descriptions of the research are limited to a brief summary of the theory and technique, not the results, which are presented in detail in the original publications.  Thus far, no technique has achieved results drastic and sweeping enough to change the fact of the encapsulation response.

==== Biological coating ====
Research focusing on bioactive coatings to alleviate the tissue response is conducted primarily on silicon-based electrodes.  Techniques include the following:  
* storing anti-inflammatory [[neuropeptide]] α-MSH under a layer of [[nitrocellulose]] or within a nitrocellulose matrix to be released gradually into the local tissue post-implantation;{{ref|zhong}} 
* coating electrodes with alternating layers of [[polyethylimine]] (PEI) and [[laminin]] (LN), with the objective of the outer LN layer decreasing the tissue response by helping to disguise the electrode as native material;{{ref|he1}}{{ref|he2}} 
* coating electrodes with a conductive [[polymer]] film to improve electrical characteristics, overcoming the encapsulation barrier by increasing electrode sensitivity.{{ref|ludwig}}

==== Protein functionalization ====
Another body of research dedicated to improving the biocompatibility of electrodes focuses on functionalizing the electrode surface with relevant protein sequences.  Studies have demonstrated that surfaces functionalized with sequences taken from adhesive peptides will decrease cellular motility and support higher neuronal populations.{{ref|olbrich}}{{ref|stauffer}}
It has also been shown that peptides can be selected to specifically support neuronal growth or glial growth, and that peptides can be deposited in patterns to guide cellular outgrowth.{{ref|kam}}{{ref|lu}}{{ref|saneinejad}} If populations of neurons can be induced to grow onto inserted electrodes, electrode failure should be minimized.

==== Electrode design ====
Kennedy’s research details the use of a glass cone electrode which contains a microwire built inside of it.{{ref|kennedy}}  The microwire is used for recording, and the cone is filled with neurotrophic substances or neural tissue in order to promote growth of local neurons into the electrode to allow for recording.  This approach overcomes tissue response by encouraging neurons to grow closer to recording surface.

=== Microfluid delivery ===
Some notable success has also been made in developing microfluid delivery mechanisms that could ostensibly deliver targeted pharmacological agents to electrode implantation sites to alleviate the tissue response.{{ref|rathnasingham}}

== Research tools being developed ==
Just as in other fields, some effort is devoted explicitly to the development of standardized research tools.  The goal of these tools is to provide a powerful, objective way of analyzing the failure of chronic neural electrodes in order to improve the reliability of the technology.

One such effort describes the development of an ''in vitro'' model to study the tissue response phenomenon.  Midbrains are surgically removed from day 14 Fischer 344 rats and grown in culture to create a confluent layer of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes.  This confluent layer can be used to study the foreign body response by scrape-injury or depositing electrode microwires on the monolayer, fixing the culture at defined time points after insertion/injury and studying tissue response with histological methods.{{ref|polikov2}}
 
Another research tool is a numerical model of the mechanical electrode-tissue interface.  The goal of this model is not to detail the electrical or chemical characteristics of the interface, but the mechanical ones created by electrode-tissue adhesion, tethering forces, and strain mismatch.  This model can be used to predict forces generated at the interface by electrodes of different material stiffnesses or geometries.{{ref|subbaroyan}}

For studies requiring a massive quantity of identical electrodes, a bench-top technique has been demonstrated in the literature to use a silicon shape as a master to produce multiple copies out of polymeric materials via a PDMS intermediate.  This is exceptionally useful for material studies or for labs who need a high volume of electrodes but cannot afford to buy them all.{{ref|russo}}

[[File:Church of Light Emblem.gif|thumbnail|right|Official Emblem of the Church of Light]]
{{Hermeticism}}

The '''Church of Light''' was incorporated  November 2, 1932 in Los Angeles, California. Its mission is  “to teach, practice, and disseminate The Religion of The Stars, a way of life for the Aquarian Age, as set forth in writings of C.C. Zain.”  The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of  Light, established in the same city in 1915. The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by Los Angeles County “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.”&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain",''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Brotherhood of Light==
[[File:Elbert Benjamine AKA C. C. Zain.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=Refer to caption|Elbert Benjamine AKA C. C. Zain]]
The Church is the continuation of an initiatic organization, the Brotherhood of  Light, established also in Los Angeles in 1915. The Brotherhood of  Light lessons, on the three branches of occult science, were written between the spring of 1910 and 1950 by Elbert Benjamine (also known as C.C. Zain, born Benjamin Parker Williams).&lt;ref&gt;Volume XVI titled 'Stellar Anatomy' Copyright, 1947, Serial No. 197 Reprinted December, 1966 The Church of Light, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamine had been invited in 1909 by the leaders of the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]] (HBofL) in Denver to join them as successor to Minnie Higgin, who had been the order’s astrologer until her death that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Elbert Benjamine", ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology,'' 5th ed. (Detroit: Gale, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving Council members  proposed to Benjamine that he rewrite the order’s teachings in a systematic form as the basis for a new organization that would “bring occultism to the life of ordinary people.”&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Mitch, ''Occult America'' (New York: Bantam, 2009), 217&lt;/ref&gt; This change was inspired by orders from [[Max Theon]] to close the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor following the death of his wife the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, Chanel, and Deveney, eds., ''The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor''. (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1995), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; After five years of preparation and study, Elbert Benjamine came to Los Angeles in 1915 and began to hold meetings. “At that point it still operated as a secret society. On November 11, 1918, the Brotherhood of Light opened its doors to the public, offering classes and a home-study course.”&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain,''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996,61.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Influences===
Astro-Philosophical Publications, founded in Denver in 1892, was a publishing arm of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor created by Henry and Belle Wagner. The authors it published included Thomas H. Burgoyne and Sarah Stanley Grimke, both cited by Benjamine as sources of Brotherhood teachings. He accorded the same status to  ''Ghost Land'' and ''Art Magic'' by [[Emma Hardinge Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;Zain, C.C., ''Laws of Occultism'', (Los Angeles: The Church of Light, 1994), 152,156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early HBofL member, [[Genevieve Stebbins]], relocated to California from England in 1917 with her husband Norman Astley, and provided assistance to the Benjamines in establishing the Brotherhood of Light.&lt;ref&gt;"C.C. Zain", Greer, John Michael, ''The New Encyclopedia of the Occult''.(St. Paul, MN: LLewellyn, 2003, 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founders==
The 1932 reorganization as The Church of Light was a response to ordinances passed that year by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] “prohibiting both the teaching and practice of astrology.” The three founding officers were 

*C.C. Zain, pen name of Elbert Benjamine (1882-1951) - President
*Fred Skinner (1872-1940) - Vice President
*Elizabeth D. Benjamine (1875-1942) - Secretary-Treasurer

==Schisms==

Following the 1943 remarriage of Elbert Benjamine, his son and heir apparent Will Benjamine departed in acrimony and established the Stellar Ministry, “a short-lived religious group that taught a mixture of Hermeticism and Christianity.” &lt;ref name="GibsonChristopher"&gt;Gibson, Christopher, "The Religion of the Stars: The Hermetic Philosophy of C.C. Zain",''Gnosis Magazine'', Winter 1996, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this interim disharmony, Church of Light membership continues to steadily grow with continual newcomers.

==Activities==

The 21 volume Brotherhood of Light lessons are publicly accessible to nonmembers of the church, but only members participate in a system of written examinations covering each volume. Each examination passed advances the member one degree. Seven volumes each are devoted to astrology, alchemy, and magic. Students who complete all 21 degrees (including examinations) are awarded a “Hermetician’s Certificate.”&lt;ref name="GibsonChristopher" /&gt;

Church headquarters were located through 1999 at 117 (later 2341) Coral Street in Los Angeles, which had been the home of the Benjamines.  After several years based in Brea, California, in 2005 it relocated to Albuquerque,  New Mexico. Regular classes and services are held at its headquarters, 2119 Gold Avenue, many of which are viewable as live streams and archived on the church website. The current president is Christopher Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.light.org/meet-the-staff.cfm ''Meet the Staff'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Military Police Corps (United States)|United States Army Military Police Corps]] defines criminal intelligence in more detail; '''criminal intelligence''' is information gathered or collated, analyzed, recorded/reported and disseminated by law enforcement agencies concerning types of [[crime]], identified criminals and known or suspected criminal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm;jsessionid=2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ!99557122|title=Field Manual (FM) 3-19.50 - Police Intelligence Operations (2006)|work=rdl.train.army.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002859/https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm%3Bjsessionid%3D2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ%2199557122|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly useful when dealing with [[organized crime]]. Criminal intelligence is developed by using [[surveillance]], [[informant]]s, [[interrogation]], and [[research]], or may be just picked up on the "street" by individual [[police]] officers.

Some larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a [[computer]] system) which can be "mined" (searched) for specific information.

==US Army usage==
Criminal intelligence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential [[criminal]] threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (''CRIMINT'') and human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"&gt;FM 3-19.13 LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CRIMINT Process==
The CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into [[intelligence]] products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.

* CRIMINT planning and directing.
* CRIMINT collection and reporting.
* CRIMINT processing.
* Analysis and production.
* Dissemination and integration.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"/&gt;

== Criminal intelligence analysis ==
''Criminal intelligence analysis'' has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police ([[INTERPOL]]), European Police ([[EUROPOL]]) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071005230215/http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-05|title=International Police (INTERPOL) (2010)|work=interpol.int|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than [[criminology]].

== Criminal investigation analysis software ==
There are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is [[link analysis]] which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.

The '''Cybermen''' are a fictional race of [[cyborg]]s who are among the most persistent enemies of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in the British [[science fiction television]] programme, ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  Within the context of the series, the Cybermen are a species of emotionless space-faring cyborgs who look to co-opt human beings or other similar species to join and populate their ranks. First appearing in 1966, the Cybermen were created by Dr. [[Kit Pedler]] (the unofficial scientific advisor to the show) and story editor [[Gerry Davis (screenwriter)|Gerry Davis]].

The Cybermen have seen many redesigns and costume changes over ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s long run. Over the years, the show and its many spin-offs in other media have also presented a number of varying [[origin story|origin stories]] for the species. In their first appearance, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966), they are explained as being the product of humans from Earth's nearly identical "twin planet" of [[Mondas]] who upgraded themselves into cyborgs in a bid for self-preservation. Forty years later, "[[The Age of Steel]]" (2006) depicted the Cybermen's separate emergence on a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] version of Earth. ''Doctor Who'' audio dramas, novels, and comic books have also elaborated on the origins for the Cybermen, or presented alternative origin stories. 

In the show's 2017 episode "[[The Doctor Falls]]", it is stated that the Cybermen are the universe's great example of [[parallel evolution]], due to the inevitability of humans and human-like species attempting to upgrade themselves through technology, thereby resolving continuity tensions in the history of the Cybermen.

A mainstay of ''Doctor Who'' since the 1960s, the Cybermen have also made appearances in related programs and spin-off media, including novels, audiobooks, comic books, and video games. Cybermen stories continued to be produced in officially licensed ''Doctor Who'' productions between 1989 and 2005, when the TV show was off the air, with many writers choosing to fill in gaps in the history of the Cybermen or depict new encounters between them and the Doctor. The species also appeared in the ''Doctor Who'' TV spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'', appearing in the fourth episode, "[[Cyberwoman]]" (2006).

== Creation ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The name "Cyberman" comes from [[cybernetics]], a term used in [[Norbert Wiener]]'s book ''Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (MIT Press, 1948). Wiener used the term in reference to the control of complex systems in the animal world and in mechanical networks, in particular self-regulating control systems. By 1960, doctors were performing research into surgically or mechanically augmenting humans or animals to operate machinery in space, leading to the [[portmanteau]] "cyborg", for "cybernetic organism".

In the 1960s, "spare-part" surgery was starting out, with the first, gigantic heart-lung machines being developed. There were also serious suggestions of wiring the nerve endings of amputees directly into machines for quicker response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Donald Longmore|title=Spare Part Surgery – The Science of the Future|publisher=Aldus|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Kit Pedler had a conversation with his wife (who was also a doctor) about what would happen if a person had so many prostheses that they could no longer distinguish themselves between man and machine. He got the opportunity to develop this idea when, in 1966, after an appearance on the [[BBC]] science programmes ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' and ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'', the BBC hired him to help on the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The War Machines]]'' (1966). That eventually led to him writing, with Gerry Davis' help, ''[[The Tenth Planet (Doctor Who)|The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966) for ''Doctor Who''.

Pedler, influenced by the logic-driven [[Treens]] from the ''[[Dan Dare]]'' comic strip, originally envisaged the Cybermen as "space monks", but was persuaded by Davis to concentrate on his fears about the direction of spare-part surgery. The original Cybermen were imagined as human, but with plastic and metal prostheses. The Cybermen of ''The Tenth Planet'' still have human hands, and their facial structures are visible beneath the masks they wear. However, over time, they evolved into metallic, more robot-like designs.

===Television=== 
[[File:Doctor Who Experience series 10 (35604690953).jpg|thumb|left|A "primitive" Mondasian Cyberman, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition]]
The Cybermen first appear in the serial ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' in 1966, set in 1986, in which their origin story is given as follows. Millions of years ago, during prehistoric times, Earth had a twin planet known as Mondas. Mondas was knocked out of solar orbit and drifted into deep space. The Mondasians, already far in advance of Earth's technology and fearful for their race's survival, their lifespans shortening,&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Lance &amp; Pearson, Lars (2012). ''A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition)'', p. 48. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. {{ISBN|978-193523411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; replaced most of their bodies with cybernetic parts. Having eventually removed all emotion from their brains, to maintain their sanity, the natives installed a drive propulsion system so they could pilot the planet itself through space. As the original race was limited in numbers and were continually being depleted, the Mondasians – now Cybermen – became a race of conquerors who reproduced by taking other organic beings and forcibly changing them into Cybermen. These Cybermen fight against the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]) when the Cybermen attempt to drain the Earth's energy to make way for Mondas' return to the solar system. However, Mondas absorbs too much energy from Earth, destroying it and those Cybermen on Earth. The adventure takes its physical toll on the Doctor, forcing him to [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] for the first time, becoming the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]).

[[File:Cybermen Emerge The Invasion.png|thumb|right|250px|The Cybermen as they emerge from the sewers onto the streets in their first invasion of Earth as seen in ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]''.]]
Redesigned Cybermen next appear in ''[[The Moonbase]]'' (1967), set in 2070, opposite the Second Doctor, who discovers a crypt containing Cybermen during a visit to the Moon. They attempt to remotely destroy the Earth by affecting its weather patterns with a device called the Gravitron. However, the Gravitron is used against them, hurling them into space. Later that year, ''[[The Tomb of the Cybermen]]'' sees a 25th Century human expedition discover sarcophagi containing hibernating Cybermen on the planet [[Telos (Doctor Who)|Telos]], where the creatures arise and attack. This episode introduces the cybermats, small mechanical scouts used by the Cybermen, as well as their leader, the Cyber Controller. In ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' (1968), the Doctor and his crew face off against the Cybermen on a marooned Earth space station in the 21st Century. This episode introduces the Cyber-Planner, an immobile unit which directs the Cybermen. The Cybermen plan to take over the space station, after which their fleet will invade Earth. The Doctor uses an x-ray laser to destroy the Cybermen. In ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' that same year, the Doctor and his companions visit late 20th century England where he discovers an army of Cybermen are hidden on Earth, working with magnate Tobias Vaughn ([[Kevin Stoney]]) for their fleet to invade Earth. Their invasion is defeated by the Doctor and the military support of the newly formed [[UNIT|United Nations Intelligence Taskforce]].

The Cybermen were not shown to face the [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]) during his original run, but one is shown as part of an exhibit in ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'' (1973). The [[Fourth Doctor]] ([[Tom Baker]]) is next to encounter a small group of Cybermen in ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]'' (1975), for which they were once again redesigned. These Cybermen are depicted as the wandering remnants of a fallen empire, ravaged by the so-called Cyber-Wars against victorious humanity, which had crucially exploited the Cybermen's weakness to gold. These Cybermen attempt to restore the glory of their race by destroying the humans' gold-rich asteroid Voga. Another long hiatus preceded ''[[Earthshock]]'' (1982), in which the [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]) encounters Cybermen in Earth in the year 2526, who seek to destroy the planet with a large bomb while alien dignitaries visit Earth to discuss the ongoing Cyber-Wars. After the Doctor foils this plan, they decide to crash their freighter into the planet to much the same effect. The Doctor's companion, boy genius [[Adric]] ([[Matthew Waterhouse]]), is trapped on board and attempts to escape from the freighter, but inadvertently causes it to hurtle back in time. The freighter crashes into prehistoric Earth, killing Adric and triggering the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|K-T extinction event]]. The Cybermen appear once more in the Fifth Doctor's era, alongside the four previous Doctors, in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983), when they are all transported alongside other nemeses of the Doctor to his home planet of [[Gallifrey]] by the [[Time Lord]] President [[Borusa]] ([[Philip Latham]]).

''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'' (1985) is set much earlier in the Cyber-Wars than ''Revenge'', during a time in which the Cybermen faced defeat following the human invention of the glittergun and the discovery of gold-rich Voga. The Cybermen attempt to use a time machine to avert the destruction of Mondas. Their plan fails, and they also lose their adopted homeworld of Telos to its original inhabitants, the Cryons, following the intervention of the [[Sixth Doctor]] ([[Colin Baker]]). The Cybermen appeared for a final time in the classic series in ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' (1988), in which a fleet of Cybermen warships assemble to convert Earth into a new Mondas. A Cybermen scouting party is sent to Earth in search of the legendary Nemesis statue, a Time Lord artefact of immense power, made of the "living metal" validium. The intervention of the [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) and his companion [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] ([[Sophie Aldred]]), however, ensures that the Nemesis destroys the entire cyber-fleet instead. Between the series' cancellation and its subsequent revival, they make one other brief appearance in the 1993 [[Children in Need]] special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', as one of several enemies used by evil Time Lady [[Rani (Doctor Who)|the Rani]] ([[Kate O'Mara]]) to hunt the Doctor.

[[File:Cyberman from Doctor Who (529659465).jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|The 2006 redesign of the Cybermen]]
''Doctor Who'' was revived after a long hiatus by new showrunner [[Russell T Davies]] in 2005. By then, development of [[computer-generated imaging|CGI]] let script-writers include large numbers of Cybermen or [[Dalek]]s in stories. In the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|first series]] of the revived programme, the Cybermen do not appear except for the inactive head of one, which is seen in a private museum of alien artefacts on Earth in the episode "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]". For [[Doctor Who (series 2)|series 2]] in 2006, Cybermen were reintroduced with a new [[origin story]] set in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. In the "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]"/"[[The Age of Steel]]" two-part story, the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) and his companions crash land in a parallel London where the Cybermen are being created on modern-day Earth. The Cybermen are created by the owner of Cybus Industries, the dying [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] [[mad scientist]] John Lumic ([[Roger Lloyd-Pack]]). Lumic's Cybermen successfully convert much of the world's population by placing their human brains into robotic shells. The Doctor and his friends free London from their control. A human resistance group, the Preachers, then sets about to clean up the remainder of Lumic's factories around the world. The Cybermen reappear in the 2006 finale "[[Army of Ghosts]]"/"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", exploiting a breach between universes to invade the Doctor's Earth. This breach is caused by a transport device belonging to the [[Dalek]]s, who reveal themselves and trigger all-out war between the two species. The Doctor ultimately re-opens the breach, causing the Cybermen and all but a few Daleks to become trapped inside before it is re-sealed. Cybermen next appear in the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' Christmas special "[[The Next Doctor]]", emerging in 1851 London after the Daleks damaged the walls of reality in [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|the previous episode]]. They attempt to raise a new army on Earth [[steampunk|using period technology]], but are again foiled by the Doctor.

After [[Steven Moffat]] took over the role of executive producer in 2010, Cyberman of essentially the design introduced by Davies continued to appear. No explicit reference is made to their origin, but generally the stylised 'c' (for Cybus Corporation) on their breastplate had been replaced by a plain circle, implying that they were not from the parallel universe. They appear in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010) alongside many of the Doctor's recurring enemies as part of an alliance dedicated to stopping him, arriving in cyber ships in 102 [[Common Era|CE]]. They appear again in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" (2011), when the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) companion [[Rory Williams|Rory]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]) demands the location of a secret asteroid base in a quadrant of space which they monitor in the 52nd century. The Doctor destroys a large fleet of their spaceships to indicate their seriousness. In "[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]", an ancient slumbering cyber ship is awakened in 2011 [[Colchester]], and the Doctor and his friend Craig ([[James Corden]]) work together to repel a Cyberman invasion. This episode also reintroduces cybermats to the series. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s episode "[[Nightmare in Silver]]" (2013) depicts the re-emergence of the Cybermen in the distant future, following what was believed to be their complete eradication by humankind. These redesigned Cybermen have discarded many of their limitations, exhibiting increased speed, rapid upgrading to overcome weaknesses, and the ability to cyberconvert any biological organism into their ranks. The Eleventh Doctor undergoes a partial cyberconversion, and mentally duels with a Cyber-Planner for control of his body. The emperor of the galaxy ([[Warwick Davis]]) orders a planet's destruction to wipe out the Cyberman, but one intact cybermite (new, minuscule cybermat variants) is later seen floating through space. A dead Cyberman head is briefly shown in the [[UNIT]] Black Archive in "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", and in "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" they are among the many species which besiege the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#T|Trenzalore]] for centuries. In the latter episode, the Doctor also uses a disembodied Cyberman head, devoid of any remaining organic parts; named "Handles", he serves as the Doctor's personal assistant and confidant for several centuries until his eventual 'death' brings the Doctor to tears.

In the finale of the 2014 series, "[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]"/"[[Death in Heaven]]", the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) learns too late that the Cybermen have formed an alliance with Missy (the current, female, incarnation of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]) ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who is converting the stolen bodies of the dead into an army. A cyberconversion process begins on all of Earth's dead. Missy offers the Doctor control of the Cybermen army so they can rule the universe together, but her plan is foiled when [[Danny Pink|Danny]] ([[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]]), the cyber-converted boyfriend of the Doctor's companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]), resists his programming and destroys himself along with all the other Cybermen. Cybermen are next seen in "[[Face the Raven]]" (2015), among the various alien refugees hiding in London, and in series finale "[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]", in which a rusted Cyberman is imprisoned in the Cloisters of Gallifrey. The origin of the Cybermen of Mondas is told in the two-episode series 10 finale "[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]" / "[[The Doctor Falls]]", when a Mondasian colony ship is stuck escaping the gravity of a black hole for many years. The human-like Mondasians, assisted unknowingly by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), begin upgrading their population to adapt to life aboard the decaying ship. The Doctor reflects on all the societies that have created Cybermen and concludes that the Cybermen is an example of [[parallel evolution]]: a concept that is waiting to impose itself on human-like species across the universe. Ultimately, this encounter with the Cybermen proves brutal: the Doctor's companion [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]] ([[Pearl Mackie]]) is cyberconverted; two incarnations of the Master (Simm and Gomez) kill one another in a disagreement over standing alongside the Doctor; and the Doctor's companion [[Nardole]] ([[Matt Lucas]]) is left behind on the ship to look after human colonists, for whom inevitable cyberconversion has been delayed but not averted. The Doctor, exhausted to a point of nearing death, awakens in his TARDIS and begins to regenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/adff0629-5ce5-4a0e-b81a-69693d489745 |title=Original Mondasian Cybermen return to Doctor Who! |author=The Doctor Who Team |date=6 March 2017 |website=BBC Latest News - Doctor Who |publisher= |access-date=8 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spin-offs===
The Cybermen have appeared in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media.

==== Novels ====
The Cybermen were also featured in the novel ''Iceberg'' by actor [[David Banks (actor)|David Banks]], who played the Cyber Leader in the television series from ''Earthshock'' to ''Silver Nemesis''. Banks had previously written, in 1988, ''Cybermen'', a fictional history of the Cybermen which included a "future" design for them. The Missing Adventure Novel ''[[Killing Ground (Doctor Who)|Killing Ground]]'' also features Cybermen of the type seen in ''Revenge of the Cybermen''. During this novel, the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s new companion [[Grant Markham]] returns to his home planet and learns that a group of Cybermen have hidden on it for centuries, with his robophobia being based around the repressed memory of witnessing a Cyberman kill his mother before he escaped.

In two Virgin Missing Adventures novels by [[Craig Hinton]], the Cybermen become Cyberlords at some point in their history. They are mentioned in passing in Hinton's ''[[The Crystal Bucephalus]]'', where the Cyberlord Hegemony is a peaceful future version of the Cybermen who have an empire in the [[Milky Way]]; their description was modelled after Banks's designs. In ''[[The Quantum Archangel]]'', there are numerous unexplained references to the Cyberlords as an extremely advanced race. At one point, they are referred to as the Time Lords' greatest ally in the Millennium War, though because that war was supposed to have taken place a very long time before the modern era, it is unclear how this bit of Cyberhistory fits in or whether or not they have achieved advanced time travel capabilities. While not explicitly mentioned, Hinton may have adopted this idea from the aborted script for the [[Five Doctors]] by [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)]], which would have had the Cybermen adopting [[Time Lord]] DNA to achieve their higher state of being.

The Past Doctor Adventures novel ''[[Illegal Alien (Doctor Who)|Illegal Alien]]'' featured Cybermen and Cybermats in London during [[the Blitz]]. Cyber-technology left over from that adventure was subsequently misused in ''[[Loving the Alien (Doctor Who)|Loving the Alien]]'', written by the same authors. The Fifth Doctor story ''[[Warmonger (Doctor Who)|Warmonger]]'' by [[Terrance Dicks]] has the Cybermen join the Doctor's alliance against [[Morbius (Doctor Who villain)|Morbius]]. The First Doctor story ''[[The Time Travellers]]'' by Simon Guerrier, set in an alternate reality, has the Cybermen (who are never named) living at the South Pole and trading advanced technology to South Africa. The [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Hope (Doctor Who)|Hope]]'' by Mark Clapham features the Silverati, a group of cybernetically enhanced humans heavily reminiscent of the Cybermen, in existence in the very far future as the universe approaches its end, with some evidence suggesting that the Silverati were adapted from remnants of the Cybermen of the present.

==== Audio dramas ====
The Cybermen have appeared in several Big Finish audio plays battling the Doctor, the first of which was ''[[Sword of Orion]]'' (released on CD in 2001 and broadcast on [[BBC 7]] in 2005), where the [[Eighth Doctor]] deals with humans and androids engaged in a war who seek Cyber-technology to improve their sides. The 2002 play ''[[Spare Parts (Doctor Who)|Spare Parts]]'' explored aspects of the Cybermen's origin, revealing that the design was ironically only perfected after their creator, Doctorman Allan, studied the biology of the Fifth Doctor and duplicated a third lobe to the Doctor's brain that controlled his body functions. They were the villains in the company's [[bbc.co.uk|BBCi]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]'' in 2002 and appeared in a linked trilogy of plays entitled ''[[The Harvest (Doctor Who audio)|The Harvest]]'' (2004), ''[[The Reaping (Doctor Who audio)|The Reaping]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Gathering (Doctor Who audio)|The Gathering]]'' (2006), where small groups of Cybermen attempt to manipulate humans into setting up conversion factories on Earth. They appear in ''[[Human Resources (Doctor Who audio)|Human Resources]]'', which Big Finish produced for radio [[BBC 7]] and subsequently released on CD, and sees the Eighth Doctor averting a plan to take control of a new weapons system. In the [[Fourth Doctor Adventures]] audio ''The Fate of Krelos''/''Return to Telos'', the Fourth Doctor, Leela and K9 discover that the Cybermen planted nanobots on Jamie during their past trip to Telos that allow the Cybermen to infect K9 and subsequently use the TARDIS to take over the machinery of the planet Krelos, but the Doctor is able to use a robot drone to go back to his original trip to Telos and prevent Jamie being exposed to the nanites, undoing these events. The Sixth Doctor joins forces with the Second Doctor's companions Jamie and Zoe to deal with two different Cybermen assaults in ''[[Legend of the Cybermen]]'' and ''[[Last of the Cybermen]]''; ''Legend'' sees Zoe made into the new Mistress of the Land of Fiction, bringing in the Sixth Doctor and a fictional version of Jamie to stop the Cybermen conquering the Land, and ''Last'' depicts the Sixth swapping places with the Second just as the younger Doctor discovers a Cybermen plot to alter the outcome of the last battle of the Cyber-Wars. 

The first instalment of a four-CD series titled ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Cyberman|Cyberman]]'', which does not feature the Doctor, was released in September 2005. ''Sword of Orion'' and the ''Cyberman'' series are set around the "Great Orion Cyber-Wars" of the 26th century, when androids rebelled against humanity in the Orion System and both human and android turned to the Cybermen to gain a military advantage. In ''Sword Of Orion'', the Cybermen are still entombed on Telos and are mostly forgotten, setting it before ''Earthshock''; by the time of ''Cyberman'', Telos has been destroyed by an asteroid collision, placing that series after ''Attack of the Cybermen''. The [[Bernice Summerfield]] play ''[[The Crystal of Cantus]]'' features a former human colony turned into Cybermen, with [[Irving Braxiatel]] planning to use them as a private army. A Cyberman tomb also appeared in the Bernice Summerfield play ''Silver Lining'', which came free with ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #351.

==== Comics ====
They have also appeared in the various ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, beginning with ''The Coming of the Cybermen'' in ''[[TV Comic]]'' #824-#827. TV Comic cashed in on their frequent presence in the TV series in the late 1960s by featuring them regularly, and they appeared in ''Flower Power'' (TVC #832-#835), ''Cyber-Mole'' (TVC #842-#845), ''The Cyber Empire'' (TVC #850-#853), ''Eskimo Joe'' (TVC #903-#906), ''Masquerade'' (TVC Holiday Special 1968), ''The Time Museum'' (TVC Annual 1969), ''The Champion'' (TVC Holiday Special 1969) and ''Test-Flight'' (TVC Annual 1970). Their absence from the TV show for most of the 1970s was reflected in a lack of appearances in the strip: they eventually returned in the early 1980s in the ''[[Doctor Who Monthly]]'' strip ''Junk-Yard Demon'' (DWM #58-#59). They made further appearances after the publication was re-titled ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'': ''Exodus''/''Revelation''/''Genesis'' (DWM #108-#110), ''The World Shapers'' (DWM #127-#129, written by [[Grant Morrison]], which revealed that the [[Voord]] were the race that evolved into the Cybermen and that Mondas was previously the planet Marinus),&lt;ref&gt;Lance Parkin, ''Whoniverse'', Aurum Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Good Soldier'' (DWM #175-#178) and ''The Flood'' (DWM #346-#353). In addition, a Cyberman named [[Kroton (Cyberman)|Kroton]], who originally appeared in a couple of ''[[Doctor Who Weekly]]'' back-up strips called ''Throwback: The Soul of a Cyberman'' (DWW #5-#7) and ''Ship of Fools'' (DWW #23-#24), was reintroduced in ''Unnatural Born Killers'' (DWM #277) and was briefly a companion of the [[Eighth Doctor]] in ''The Company of Thieves'' (DWM #284-#286) and ''The Glorious Dead'' (DWM #287-#296). The Cybermen had their own one-page strip in DWM from issues #215-#238, written by Alan Barnes and drawn by Adrian Salmon.

In 1996, the ''[[Radio Times]]'' published a ''Doctor Who'' comic strip. The first story, entitled ''Dreadnought'', featured the Cybermen attacking a human starship in 2220 and introduced the strip companion [[Stacy Townsend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuttingsarchive.org.uk/comics/cuttings/rt_strip/dnough01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502115541/http://cuttingsarchive.org.uk/comics/cuttings/rt_strip/dnough01.htm |archivedate=2 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Doctor Who''/''[[Star Trek]]'' crossover, [[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2|''Assimilation2'']], the Cybermen join forces with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], forcing the [[Eleventh Doctor]] to join forces with the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] to stop them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/ |title=Doctor Who, Star Trek crossover comic revealed • Doctor Who News • WhovianNet |publisher=News.whoviannet.co.uk |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borg and Cybermen have begun to attack and convert worlds without warning, with the apparent 'leader' being a Cyber-Controller with Borg components. The Doctor also recalls a past incident where he helped the crew of the original ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' defeat a Cyberman infiltration of a Federation outpost in his [[Fourth Doctor|fourth incarnation]], although it would appear that this is a recent addition to his past history as the Eleventh Doctor also remembers ''not'' remembering that encounter. The Cybermen attempt to subvert and take over the Borg Collective, forcing the Doctor and the ''Enterprise'' to ally with the Borg to stop the Cybermen and restore the Collective to normal.

The Cybermen also feature in the Titan Comics 2016 multi-Doctor event story ''Supremacy of the Cybermen'', which depicts the last Cybermen at the end of the universe forming an alliance with [[Rassilon]]- after he was exiled from Gallifrey by the Twelfth Doctor in "[[Hell Bent]]"- with the goal of conquering Gallifrey and using Time Lord energy to regenerate the universe into one under Cyber-control. Although Rassilon's insight allows the Cybermen to conquer history and defeat all of the past Doctors, the Twelfth Doctor is able to convince Rassilon to help him after the Cybermen betray Rassilon, the two turning the Cybermens' equipment against them so that the universe is 'regenerated' to a point before the Cybermen conquered Gallifrey, with only the Twelfth Doctor (and possibly Rassilon) remembering these events.

==== Video games ====
The 2010 video game ''[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games|Blood of the Cybermen]]'', features Cybermen of the 2006 design without the Cybus Industries chest plate. These Cybermen are unearthed in the Arctic in 2010; their ship is said to have been damaged by a time-storm and crashed 10,000 years earlier. The player plays as the Eleventh Doctor and his companion Amy, who work to defeat the Cybermen. They also appear on Telos in both the android games ''[[Doctor Who: The Mazes of Time]]'' and Doctor Who And The Dalek.

The Cybermen appear as enemies in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', and one was added as a playable character in Wave 3.

==Physical characteristics==

While the Doctor's [[archenemy]], the [[Dalek]]s, were on the whole unchanged during the original series's 26-season run, the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every encounter. The Cybermen are [[humanoid]], but have been altered until they have few remaining organic parts. They retain living [[human brain]]s. In their first appearance in the series, the only parts of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands; by their next appearance in ''[[The Moonbase]]'' (1967), their bodies were entirely covered in their metallic suits, with their hands replaced by three finger claws, but they changed back to regular five-fingered hands in ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968). As they are relatively few, the Cybermen tend towards covert activity, scheming from hiding and using human pawns or [[robot]]s to act in their place until they need to appear. They also seek to increase their numbers by converting others into Cybermen (a process known as "cyber-conversion" or Cybernisation" in the older episodes and "upgrading" in the newer episodes), an often painful process as body parts are removed and replaced with cybernetic replacements.

It is implied that there are still organic components beneath their suits, meaning they are [[cyborg]]s, not robots: in ''The Tenth Planet'', a Cyberman tells a group of humans that "our brains are just like yours", although by the time of ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'' (1985), their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics. Also in this story, two human slave-prisoners of the Cybermen on the planet Telos, named Bates and Stratton, reveal that their organic arms and legs have been removed by the Cybermen and replaced by cyber-substitutes. In ''[[Earthshock]]'' (1982), the actors' chins were vaguely visible through a clear [[perspex]] area on the helmet to suggest some kind of organic matter. In ''[[The Tomb of the Cybermen]]'' (1967), veins and brains were visible through the domed head of the Cyber-Controller, and similarly, in ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'' (1985) and "[[The Age of Steel]]" (2006), the Cyber-Controller's brain is visible through the dome. The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller, and the second involves alternative Earth's John Lumic. However, in ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]'' (1975), the Doctor says they are "total machine creatures".

The audio play ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]'' implies that the converted victim's face remains beneath the Cyberman faceplate, although the audio plays, like all non-televised spin-off media, are of uncertain [[Canon (fiction)#Doctor Who|canonicity]] with regard to the television series. In the 2014's "[[Death in Heaven]]", [[List of Doctor Who supporting characters#Danny Pink|Danny Pink]] removes the faceplate showing his face underneath. The [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Iceberg (Banks novel)|Iceberg]]'' by [[David Banks (actor)|David Banks]] states that some Cybermen experience rare flashes of emotional memory from the time before they were converted; these flashes are then usually suppressed. The Cybermen in the revived series are usually constructed from human brains bonded to a Cyberman exoskeletal shell with an artificially-grown nervous system threaded throughout ("The Age of Steel"), although direct grafting of cyber-components is another method of conversion ("[[Cyberwoman]]"). In "[[The Pandorica Opens]]", a Cyberman head is shown to open up, revealing an entire human skull, not just the brain.
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:2008-07-12 Dr.Who Cyberman 01.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of a redesigned Cyberman]] --&gt;

Although the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion, they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor. Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as "Krang". Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre-conversion lives, although their emotional response varied. In "Cyberwoman", the partial conversion led to a degree of insanity in [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Lisa Hallett|Lisa Hallett]], which was retained even after she transferred her brain into a fully human body. In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", Yvonne Hartman retains at least some elements of her personality (including her voice being heard over the usual Cyberman voice) to prevent the advance of a group of other Cybermen, and is last seen weeping what appears to be either an oil-like substance or blood. In the same episode, the Cyber-Leader expresses clear frustration at the humans' refusal to surrender, although in a later scene he criticises the Doctor for showing emotion. In "[[The Age of Steel]]", the Doctor defeats the Cybermen by shutting down their emotional inhibitors, enabling them to "see" what had become of them. Their realisation of what they had become led them to either simply shut down out of sheer horror, or partially explode. Lastly, when the first Cyber Leader is killed, his head explodes with some white liquid leaking down his body; there are references in that episode to a patented Cybus Industries mixture of chemicals used to preserve the brain. In "Death in Heaven", Danny Pink also retains some of his personality traits, including shock at seeing his reflection and what he's become, but also his love for [[Clara Oswald]]. The Doctor turns it on to gain intelligence and reveal that the Cybermen have developed a way to cyber-convert dead human remains. Only then does the Doctor exploit Danny's keeping of his personality traits, even under the inhibitor, to command the Cyber-Army. In "[[The Doctor Falls]]", the Doctor's companion Bill retains her complete sense of self and identity, even to the point of not initially seeing herself as a Cyberman, as a result of her experiences resisting [[mind control]] and telepathic suggestions in a past adventure. However, Cyberman program does manifest in her bursts of anger and she says her mind cannot hold on forever.

The [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[Killing Ground (Doctor Who)|Killing Ground]]'', by [[Steve Lyons (writer)|Steve Lyons]] suggests that some Cybermen imitate emotions to intimidate and unnerve their victims. The Big Finish Productions audio play ''[[Spare Parts (Doctor Who)|Spare Parts]]'' (set on Mondas in the early days of Cyber-conversion) suggests that the Cybermen deliberately remove their emotions as part of the conversion process to stifle the physical and emotional trauma of becoming a Cyberman.

This motive behind the removal of emotions is made more explicit in "The Age of Steel", where it is done by an emotional inhibitor. In that episode, deactivating their emotional inhibitors causes the converted Cybermen to realise what they have become, driving them insane and killing them. 

===Weaknesses===
The Cybermen have had a number of weaknesses since their introduction. The most notable weakness of the original Cybermen is the element [[gold]]. Their aversion to gold was not mentioned until they try to destroy the planetoid Voga (the so-called "Planet of Gold") in ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]'' (1975). Initially, it was explained that, due to its non-corrodible nature, gold essentially [[asphyxiation|chokes]] their [[respiratory system]]s. For example, the glittergun, a weapon used during the Cyber-Wars in the future, fired gold dust at its targets. However, in later serials, gold appeared to affect them rather as silver affects [[werewolf|werewolves]], with gold coins or gold-tipped [[cartridge (firearms)|bullets]] fired at them having the same effect. The revived series's Cybermen have no such weakness, though the tie-in website for the episode mentions it.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.cybusindustries.net/lumic.htm Cybus Industries tie-in website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923001724/http://www.cybusindustries.net/lumic.htm |date=23 September 2012 }} refers to earlier prototypes having an "allergy" to gold, stating that this was eliminated after further improvements of the Cyberman body.&lt;/ref&gt; Cybermen are also efficiently killed when shot with their own guns, or by a [[Daleks|Dalek]]. Other weaknesses from early stories include [[solvent]]s, [[gravity]] based technology, and excessive levels of [[radioactive contamination|radiation]]. In "The Age of Steel", an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] grenade is shown to disable a Cyberman and shut down its emotional inhibitor. The vulnerability to gold is clearly not present in some early Cyberman types, for example the type seen in the 1968 serial ''The Invasion'' were unlikely to possess it, or perhaps more likely the weakness is not known, otherwise the Doctor/UNIT would simply have used it and not needed the elaborate plan involving the assistance of a [[Russia]]n missile base and the Cybermen's puppet ally, Tobias Vaughn. In "Nightmare in Silver", the Doctor uses gold to slow down though not destroy some circuitry of technologically advanced Cybermen in the distant future. It is unclear precisely how many of the different types, and which types, of Cyberman are vulnerable to gold.

Their armour is often depicted as flexible and resistant to bullets, but can be penetrated by gold arrows and projectiles made of gold. The Cybus Cybermen are bullet-proof and are very resilient, but are not indestructible — they are vulnerable to high explosives, electromagnetic pulses, specialised weaponry and [[Dalek]] weapons.

===Costumes===
{{fiction|section|date=April 2017}}
For ''[[The Tenth Planet (Doctor Who)|The Tenth Planet]]'', the original Cyberman costumes, including the "handle" shapes on their heads, were designed by [[Sandra Reid]]. The masks and one-piece bodystockings were made from [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] fabric, with holes trimmed with vinyl where the Cybermen "eyes" and "mouths" were; the actors' features were darkened to hide their faces. The fabric of the costumes were coloured a faint blue so they could show up on black and white television cameras. Over the top of the stockings, the Cybermen wore polythene suits ribbed with metal wings, along with epaulettes made of metal, and plastic piping. Their boots were short [[Wellington boot]]s, painted silver. In a 2016 interview, Reid, by then going by the name Alexandra Tynan, described the motivation behind her designs was "I had a planning meeting that I had to be at, and I had to have a design drawing with me. My motivation was the clock on the wall!" Although the script specified the Cybermen should keep their human hands, Reid wanted them to wear gloves. However, Reid mistakenly forgot she said she would make special gloves for the Cybermen until the first day in the studio. Instead, make-up designer Gillian James hastily added silver paint to the actors' human hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tynan |first=Alexandra |author-link=Alexandra Tynan |last2=Cook |first2=Benjamin |author-link2=Benjamin Cook (journalist) |date=November 2016 |title=The Cybermum |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |pages=15–17 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chest units and "handles" were built by Shawcraft of Uxbridge. The handles were adapted from lorry headlamps, while the chest units used a lot of clear plastic and had battery-powered flashing mechanisms. The handles were intended as the housing for wires that lit up the lamps, but in a test shot the bulb exploded and the idea was dropped. Tynan explained in 2016, "I indicated that there was going to be a chest unit there, but I didn't do any designs for them, because I knew that the units were going to be a props thing."&lt;ref name="tynan handles"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tynan |first=Alexandra |author-link=Alexandra Tynan |last2=Cook |first2=Benjamin |author-link2=Benjamin Cook (journalist) |date=November 2016 |title=The Cybermum |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=17 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Innes Lloyd]]'s production team wished to update the Cybermen for ''[[The Moonbase]]'' and make them look more sophisticated and robotic. Sandra Reid designed new costumes for this serial. These were based on a one-piece silver jumpsuit made from vinyl fabric, and the Cybermen were given gloves with three-fingered hands. Their boots were lace-up army boots painted silver. Fibreglass helmets and chest units made from aluminium were built by freelance prop makers Jack and John Lovell. Silver tape was added around the eye and mouth area for emphasis, and on Reid's instruction, the Lovells attached "hydraulic joints" consisting of tubing from a vacuum cleaner manufacturer and plastic practice golf balls. Costume designer [[Daphne Dare]], consulting with Reid over the phone, took over midway through production of ''The Moonbase'' while Reid was recovering from surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tynan |first=Alexandra |author-link=Alexandra Tynan |last2=Cook |first2=Benjamin |author-link2=Benjamin Cook (journalist) |date=November 2016 |title=The Cybermum |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=19 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of these costumes were reused, with slight repainting and additions, for ''[[The Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', Reid's final ''Doctor Who'' serial, and a new costume was built for the Cyber Controller, with a red-domed cranium built that was intended to light up, but the lighting mechanism failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Tynan |first=Alexandra |author-link=Alexandra Tynan |last2=Cook |first2=Benjamin |author-link2=Benjamin Cook (journalist) |date=November 2016 |title=The Cybermum |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=20 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the filmed inserts in ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'', [[Martin Baugh]] supervised the creation of the costumes, made from a thinner one-piece material. Junction boxes, linked by steel rods, were used at the joints and near the neck to give the impression of something more technological and functional than was seen in ''The Moonbase'' and ''The Tomb of the Cybermen''. The same chest units from before were used, with the lamp at the bottom of the unit. New helmets were cast with simpler handles that extended out further from the head. These introduced a "teardrop" shape to the Cybermen's eyes. An unmodified ''Tomb of the Cybermen'' suit was also used to swell the Cybermen's numbers during the spacewalk scene, and was positioned at the back to hide the difference from the other two costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rymill |first=Gavin |date=November 2016 |title=Cyber Conversion! |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=44 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-production, the suits were redesigned again for the more extensive recordings of ''The Wheel in Space'' in the studio. Baugh's solution was to spray-paint two padded wet suits to make them look bulkier, with the helmets, junction boxes and rods from the filmed inserts modified or removed to make the actors move more freely. The hands from the earlier ''Wheel in Space'' costumes were cut off and used as gloves for the new costumes. The chest units were turned upside down so the lamps, mounted beneath the Cybermen's chins, could be fired as a weapon in a tighter shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rymill |first=Gavin |date=November 2016 |title=Cyber Conversion! |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |pages=44–45 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'', costume designer [[Bobi Bartlett]] ordered a resculpt of the helmet moulds with more head space for the actors to be done by outside company Trading Post. This included the sculpting of two large "ear muffs".&lt;ref name="invasion dwm"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rymill |first=Gavin |date=November 2016 |title=Cyber Conversion! |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |pages=45 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet was made of a light fibreglass. The costumes featured army boots, and now had five-fingered gloves, rather than three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |last2=Morris |first2=Jonathan |author-link2=Jonathan Morris (author) |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard |last4=McGown |first4=Alistair |author-link4=Alistair McGown |date=16 December 2015 |title=The Invasion: Pre-production |url= |magazine=Doctor Who: The Complete History |location= |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini Magazines]]/[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Partworks Ltd]] |volume=13 |page=65 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetsuits were reused for this serial, and a simpler and sturdier version of the chest units, with the light at the top of the unit as before, was commissioned. At each of the joints there were now domes connected by a set of ribbed rods.&lt;ref name="invasion dwm"/&gt;

While production notes in ''Doctor Who: The Complete History'' claimed that the brief appearance of a Cyberman in ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'' consisted of a diving suit from ''The Invasion'',&lt;ref name="carnival complete"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |last2=Morris |first2=Jonathan |author-link2=Jonathan Morris (author) |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard |last4=McGown |first4=Alistair |author-link4=Alistair McGown |last5=Hadoke |first5=Toby |author-link5=Toby Hadoke |date=2017 |title=Carnival of Monsters: Production |url= |magazine=Doctor Who: The Complete History |location= |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini Magazines]]/[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Partworks Ltd]] |volume=19 |page=71 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Rymill in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' wrote that this Cyberman was a Cyber Controller costume from ''The Tomb of the Cybermen''.&lt;ref name="invasion dwm"/&gt; Both sources concurred that the helmet originated from ''The Invasion'', and the back of the helmet was left unfastened.&lt;ref name="carnival complete"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dwm revenge"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rymill |first=Gavin |date=November 2016 |title=Cyber Conversion! |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=46 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prue Handley]] was the costume designer on ''[[Revenge of the Cybermen]]''.&lt;ref name="dwm revenge"/&gt; The costumes were built by freelance prop company Alister Bowtell, and were again based on wet suits, with rubber tubing along the arms and at the knees and elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |last2=Morris |first2=Jonathan |author-link2=Jonathan Morris (author) |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard |last4=McGown |first4=Alistair |author-link4=Alistair McGown |last5=Hadoke |first5=Toby |author-link5=Toby Hadoke |date=5 October 2016 |title=Revenge of the Cybermen: Pre-production |url= |magazine=Doctor Who: The Complete History |location= |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini Magazines]]/[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Partworks Ltd]] |volume=23 |pages=60–61 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chest unit props from ''The Moonbase'' returned,&lt;ref name="dwm revenge"/&gt; and included bits of broken television sets.

The ''[[Earthshock]]'' designs by [[Dinah Collin]] included a set of Mk 2C [[RAF]] flight suits with built-in pipes used to pump cool air around. The ''Revenge of the Cybermen'' head was reshaped and recut by Richard Gregory of the freelance company Imagineering to add more details. There was a transparent section in the face through where the actor's moving jaw could be seen. New chest units were made in fibreglass, and they were decorated with ammunition trays. Also worn with the costumes were padded zip-back gloves and [[Tecnica]] [[Moon Boot]]s. For ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' and ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'', the jaw area was sprayed silver, and less ostentatious boots were worn.&lt;ref name="eighties"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rymill |first=Gavin |date=November 2016 |title=Cyber Conversion! |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=504 |page=47 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anushia Nieradzik]] was the costume designer on ''Attack of the Cybermen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |last2=Morris |first2=Jonathan |author-link2=Jonathan Morris (author) |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard |last4=McGown |first4=Alistair |author-link4=Alistair McGown |last5=Hadoke |first5=Toby |author-link5=Toby Hadoke |date=4 May 2016 |title=Attack of the Cybermen: Pre-production |url= |magazine=Doctor Who: The Complete History |location= |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini Magazines]]/[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Partworks Ltd]] |volume=40 |page=67 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specially modified Cyber Controller costume with a tall silver dome on its head was made for ''Attack of the Cybermen''; as with the Controller costume used in ''The Tomb of the Cybermen'', its helmet had no handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |last2=Morris |first2=Jonathan |author-link2=Jonathan Morris (author) |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard |last4=McGown |first4=Alistair |author-link4=Alistair McGown |last5=Hadoke |first5=Toby |author-link5=Toby Hadoke |date=4 May 2016 |title=Attack of the Cybermen: Production |url= |magazine=Doctor Who: The Complete History |location= |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini Magazines]]/[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Partworks Ltd]] |volume=40 |page=81 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'', the same head and chest pieces returned with a dappled plastic jaw and the removal of the ammunition trays. A plainer type of flight suit without built-in pipes was used for the bodies, and cable junction boxes with plastic tubes were added to the limbs for more detail. The costumes had cricket gloves sprayed silver, and [[Dr. Martens]] boots.&lt;ref name="eighties"/&gt;

The redesign of the Cybermen in "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" and "[[The Age of Steel]]" was a month-long process involving nearly every part of the design team. The production team decided on an [[Art Deco]] approach, and the final design was handed to [[Neill Gorton]]'s team at Millennium FX, who also built the final costumes. The head was designed to be able to be turned independently from the body; such movement had not been possible in previous helmets. Millennium's [[Martin Rezard]] was the lead sculptor of a full-sized clay Cyberman, from which moulds were taken to create over forty fibreglass pieces to make up the head and body of each costume. Powdered aluminium was added to the final layer of the fibreglass, and each component was hand polished until it gleamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Richards |first=Justin |author-link=Justin Richards |date=March 2014 |title=21st-Century Cybermen |url= |magazine=The Essential Doctor Who |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=1: ''The Cybermen'' |pages=81–83 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the fibreglass pieces were clipped onto a basic [[Lycra]] suit assembled by Jo Glover.

The sleeker and more elegant design introduced in "[[Nightmare in Silver]]" was made by the Millennium FX team from flexible polyurethane rubber, painted to look metallic using a new process originally developed for use in the car industry.&lt;ref name="nightmare"/&gt;

The "Mondasian Cybermen" in "[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]" and "[[The Doctor Falls]]" were created by the Millennium FX team, and were an updated version of Sandra Reid's 1966 design of the Cybermen for ''The Tenth Planet''. The chest units were built by Rocky Marshall out of cardboard, plastic and "other bits that he'd found". The costumes themselves were built from a silver latex fabric by costume designer Robin Archer. The Cybermen's hands were covered by rubber gloves. Millennium also created the transitional "patients" that evolve into Cybermen from the two-parter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Walshe |first=Kate |last2=Pollard |first2=Gary |last3=Ruddock |first3=Martin |date=October 2017 |title=Monsters Inc |url= |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |location=Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Panini Comics|Panini UK Ltd]] |issue=516 |pages=22–23 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ''Tenth Planet'' Cybermen not having gloves, director [[Rachel Talalay]] said that the reason for adding them to the Mondasian Cybermen in the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|series 10]] two-part finale was "partially an issue because of skintone" with [[Pearl Mackie]]'s Cyberman, but also to "get a scarier feel and something more artificial by putting the gloves on them". She further explained that in ''The Tenth Planet'' it was hard to tell if they had skintone gloves or not to justify their addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-09-06/doctor-whos-peter-capaldi-had-a-very-nerdy-complaint-about-the-return-of-the-mondasian-cybermen/|title=Doctor Who’s Peter Capaldi had a VERY nerdy complaint about the return of the Mondasian Cybermen|publisher=''[[Radio Times]]''|first=Huw|last=Fullerton|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Doctor's other foes, the Cybermen costumes have changed substantially in appearance over the years, looking more and more modern, although retaining certain commonalities of design, the most iconic being the "handles" attached to Cybermen heads.&lt;ref name="tynan handles"/&gt; Other design elements include their round eyeholes and their chest units.

Aside from these changes, variations in design between rank-and-file Cybermen and their leaders have been seen. In ''The Wheel in Space'' and ''The Invasion'' (both 1968), the Cyber Director was depicted as an immobile mechanism. The Cyber Leader in "[[The Next Doctor]]" sports a transparent brain casing.

Because the Doctor is a time traveller, he meets the Cybermen at various points in their history out of sequence from the order the serials were made. This can be confusing since Cybermen from serials set in "earlier" periods of history can sometimes look more sophisticated than those from "later" periods. [[Lawrence Miles]] suggests in his reference work ''About Time 5'' that the anachronistically designed Cybermen of ''Earthshock'' and ''Silver Nemesis'' are time travellers, like those in ''Attack of the Cybermen''. [[The Doctor Who Role Playing Game]] "Cyber Files" worked around the contradiction by stating that in ''The Tenth Planet'', the oldest designs of Cybermen were used for the attack while the later more sophisticated models remained on Mondas.

The ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Cyberwoman]]" features a partially cyber-converted woman who lacks the outer plating of a fully converted Cyberman. Her body is encased in metal structures but much of her flesh, including her face, is visible. She also has clearly visible metallic breasts, though it is not clear how much of her own flesh has been replaced and how much is merely covered. Another character speculates she could be 40–45% human, and 55–60% Cyberman.

===Voice===
Early Cybermen had an unsettling, sing-song voice, constructed by placing the [[inflection]]s of words on the wrong [[syllable]]s. In their first appearance, the effect of this was augmented by having a Cyberman abruptly open his mouth wide and keep it open, without moving his tongue or lips, while the separately recorded voice would be playing, and then shut it quickly when the line was finished. Although the cloth-like masks of the first Cybermen were soon replaced by a full helmet, a similar physical effect involving the mouth "hatch" opening and then shutting when the line was finished was used until ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' (1968).

Later, the production team used [[special effect]]s from its [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|Radiophonic Workshop]] by adding first a [[mechanical larynx]], then a [[vocoder]], to modify speech to make it sound more artificial. In later stories of the original series and in the audio plays, two copies of the voice track were sampled and pitch-shifted downwards by differing amounts and layered to produce the effect, sometimes with the addition of a small amount of [[flanging]]. From ''Revenge of the Cybermen'' to ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' (1988) the actors provided the voices themselves, using microphones and transmitters in the chest units.

The voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen are similar to the buzzing electronic monotone voices of the Cybermen used in ''The Invasion''. They were provided by [[Nicholas Briggs]]. As shown in the second series of ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', the timbre was created by processing Briggs' voice through a Moog [[moogerfooger]] ring modulator. Unusually, in "The Age of Steel", the Cyber-Controller (John Lumic, played by [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]]) retains his voice after being upgraded, but it is still electronic. In "Doomsday", a Cyberman which contains the brain of [[Torchwood Institute]] director Yvonne Hartman retains a female-sounding though still electronic voice, as does the partially converted [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Lisa Hallett|Lisa Hallett]] in "Cyberwoman" when her Cyberman personality is dominant. In an effect reminiscent of the earliest Cybermen's mouths snapping open while speaking, the new Cybermen have a blue light in their "mouths" (or "teeth") which blinks in synchronisation with their speech.

Since "The Age of Steel" in 2006, the Cybermen have had nasally-sounding electronic voices; this continued all the way until "Closing Time" in 2011. Following this, since the 2013 episode "Nightmare in Silver", the Cybermen (continuing to be voiced by Briggs) now have deep, almost growl-like voices. Their mouths retain a blue light-up effect but flicker luminously instead of staying lit as opposed to the 2006 design.

==Variants==
&lt;!-- [[File:Dr Who (2428387892).jpg|left|thumb|Cyber Controller, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]] --&gt;

Some Cybermen are given titles, being credited as "Cyber Leader" (or variants thereof), "Cyber Lieutenant", "[[Cyber-Scout|Cyber Scout]]" or the "Cyber Controller".

An immobile computer, referred to as the "Cyber Planner", appears in ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' and ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]''. A Cyber Planner also takes over the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s body in "[[Nightmare in Silver]]".

The original Controller is seen (and destroyed) in two serials, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'' and ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'', and in each may or may not be the same consciousness in different bodies; it appears to recognise and remember the Doctor from previous encounters. In the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Iceberg (Banks novel)|Iceberg]]'', the first Cyber Controller is created by implanting a Cyber Director, or Cyber Planner, into the skull of a recently converted Cyberman.

The parallel universe Cyber Controller in "[[The Age of Steel]]" uses the brain of [[John Lumic]], the creator of the Cybermen in that parallel reality.

In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", a Cyber Leader appears, and when he is destroyed, mention is made of downloading his data files into another Cyberman unit, which is then upgraded to Cyber Leader.

The 2008 Christmas special, "[[The Next Doctor]]", featured a new, more agile variant called a Cybershade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Doctor Who to be challenged by new Cyberman enemy|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2473376/Doctor-Who-to-be-challenged-by-new-Cyberman-enemy.html|first=Tom|last=Peterkin|date=30 July 2008|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor theorises that it is a more primitive version of a Cyberman, using the brain of a cat, and they physically resemble animals as they cannot speak and walk on all fours. In the same story a "Cyber-King" appears; according to the Doctor, it is a "[[Dreadnought]]-class" ship for use in invasions resembling a Cyberman hundreds of feet tall, and contains a Cyber-factory in its chest. It is controlled from within its mouth. Its right arm can be converted into a cannon, and its left into a laser.
&lt;!-- [[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943612035).jpg|right|thumb|The wooden Cybermen as it appears at the Doctor Who Experience]] --&gt;
"[[The Time of the Doctor]]" introduced a unique prototype Cyberman that was made of wood to avoid detection by the [[The Time of the Doctor#Plot|Church of the Papal Mainframe]] and equipped with blowtorches.

After Bill Potts is wounded on the bridge of a Mondasian colony ship, and taken down the ship's lifts to be surgically repaired, she encounters half converted Mondasians referred to only as 'The Patients'. They wore grey surgical robes and their faces were entirely covered with cloth bags, save for a nasal canulla that administered fluids and all were hooked up to IV drips. Most remained stationary; confined to wheelchairs in the "out ward" while some walked the hospital grounds; being prepped for additional surgery and rounding up humans in the city and leading them to the hospital. During the early stages of these experiments (a precursor to cyber-conversion), The Patients were shown to feel the pain caused by this process, with some even begging for death, twisting in their chairs and jabbing at their speech keyboards. They were capable of attacking, following commands (such as restraining Bill) and possessed great strength. They could be incapacitated, though not killed by gunfire

==Technology==
Cybermen technology is almost completely oriented towards weaponry, apart from their own bodies. When originally seen in ''The Tenth Planet'', they had large energy weapons that attached to their chests. In ''The Moonbase'', the Cybermen had two types of weaponry: an electrical discharge from their hands, which stunned the target, and a type of gun. They also made use of a large laser cannon with which they attempted to attack the base itself.

The hand discharge was also present in ''The Tomb of the Cybermen'', which featured a smaller, hand-held Cyber-weapon shaped like a [[pistol]] that was described as an [[X-ray]] [[laser]]. In ''The Wheel in Space'', the Cybermen could use the discharge to also operate machinery, and had [[raygun|death ray]]s built into their chest units. They displayed the same units in ''The Invasion'' as well as carrying large rifles for medium distance combat. In ''Revenge of the Cybermen'' and the audio play ''Real Time'', their weapons were built into their helmets. ''Killing Ground'' indicates that this type of Cybermen also have more powerful hand weapons. Subsequent appearances have shown them armed almost exclusively with hand-held cyberguns.

The Cybermen have access to [[weapons of mass destruction]] known as cobalt bombs, also sometimes as Cyber-bombs, which were banned by the galactic Armageddon Convention (''Revenge of the Cybermen''). A "Cyber-megatron bomb" was mentioned in ''The Invasion'', supposedly powerful enough to destroy all life on Earth. In ''Earthshock'', the Cybermen also used android drones as part of their plans to invade Earth.

The revived programme Cybermen [[Electric shock|electrocute]] their victims by touching them and at first carried no other weaponry. In "Army of Ghosts" and "Doomsday", the Cybermen are equipped with retractable energy weapons housed within their forearms (these were actually first shown in "[[The Age of Steel]]", but only very briefly and were not used during that episode), but also use advanced human weapons to battle the Daleks. The arm mounted guns prove effective against humans but are unable to penetrate Dalek shields. Two Cybermen sent to parley with Dalek Thay at the Battle of Canary Wharf shot the Dalek but were promptly exterminated. In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Cyberwoman]]", the partially converted [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Lisa Hallett|Lisa Hallett]] used her electrical touch against the Torchwood team, as well as an energy beam fired from her arm which could only stun the part of the body at which it was aimed. In "[[The Pandorica Opens]]", the Cybermen again have the wrist-blaster, but also regain the modified human weapons. In "[[Nightmare in Silver]]", the Cybermen have the ability to move at a warp-like speed. At this speed they appear as blurry after images. Cyberman had also overcome the weakness of solely being able to convert human-like species; the Doctor had been safe from being in danger of conversion until this point.

The Mondasian Cybermen from The Tenth Planet were updated for the Series 10 Finale. As opposed to shooting from their chest pieces they used their lanterns as weapons. This was in the Novelisation for The Tenth Planet. They also had the ability to emit electricity.

===Cybermat===
[[File:Cybermite.jpg|thumb|left|The Cybermat, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]
The Cybermen also use smaller, cybernetic creatures called "cybermats" as weapons of attack. In their first appearance in ''[[The Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', they resembled oversized metallic [[silverfish]] and had segmented bodies with hair-like tactile sensor probes along the base of their heads, which were topped with crystalline eyes. The [[Second Doctor]] described them as a "form of metallic life," implying that they may be semi-organic like the Cybermen, and that they too attack by feeding off brain waves.

The second model of Cybermat seen in ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' was used for sabotage, able to tune in on human brainwaves. They were carried to the "Wheel" in small but high-density sacs that sank through the hull of the space station, causing drops in air pressure. These Cybermats had solid [[photodetector|photoreceptor]]s for eyes instead of crystals. The Second Doctor used an audio frequency to jam them, causing them to spin, crash and disintegrate.

The third model, seen in ''Revenge of the Cybermen'', was a much larger, snake-like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims. It had no visible eyes or other features, and was as vulnerable to gold dust as the Cybermen were.

The original model was later mentioned in a conversation between the Doctor and his double during ''[[The Rebel Flesh]]'', reaffirming that that model of Cybermat killed by feeding on brainwaves.

The fourth model of cybermat appears for the first time in the revived series in the 2011 episode "[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]", where it is shown to have an organic mouth full of sharp teeth, and transmits power to a crashed cyber-ship.

In the audio play ''Spare Parts'', "mats" are cybernetically augmented creatures, sometimes kept as pets. Cybermats of a different design are used for surveillance by Mondas' Central Committee. The creatures occasionally go wild, chewing on power sources, and must be rounded up by a "mat-catcher." In the [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Illegal Alien (Doctor Who)|Illegal Alien]]'' by [[Mike Tucker]] and [[Robert Perry (writer)|Robert Perry]], set in the 1940s, the Cybermen create cybermats by cyber-converting local animals like cats or birds, possibly because of lack of technological resources.

In the [[Bernice Summerfield]] audio adventure ''[[The Crystal of Cantus]]'', a Cyberman reveals that the organs of children who are too small to be fully cyber-converted are used in the creation of cybermats.

The cybermats appeared in the video game "[[Blood of the Cybermen]]" where instead of killing, they turned individuals into cyberslaves. The slaves have mostly human bodies, but have Cyberman heads and arms. The Cybermen see the cyberslaves as inferior, and delete them once they have served their purpose.

An upgraded form of cybermats appeared in "[[Nightmare in Silver]]". They were incredibly small mechanical insects that were more versatile and were able to partially convert other lifeforms into Cybermen. They were referred to as cybermites.

'''''Dracorex''''' is a controversial [[dinosaur]] [[genus]] of the family [[Pachycephalosaurid]]ae, from the Late [[Cretaceous]] of North America. The [[type species|type]] (and only known) [[species]] is ''Dracorex hogwartsia'', meaning "[[Hungarian Horntail|dragon]] king of [[Hogwarts]]". This dinosaur is named for the wizard school in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books. It is known from one nearly complete skull (the [[holotype]] TCMI 2004.17.1), as well as four cervical vertebrae: the atlas, third, eighth and ninth. These were discovered in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[South Dakota]] by three amateur paleontologists from [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]]. The skull was subsequently donated to [[the Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] for study in 2004, and was formally described by [[Bob Bakker]] and Robert Sullivan in 2006.&lt;ref name=RTBetal06&gt;Bakker, R.

Horner|Jack Horner]] ''et al.'' suspect that it is a juvenile ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'' and an analysis of pachycephalosaur fossils by a joint team from the University of California, Berkeley and the [[Museum of the Rockies]] has questioned the validity of two named genera of pachycephalosaur, ''Dracorex'' and ''[[Stygimoloch]]''. According to the team, specimens of ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' might actually represent earlier growth stages of ''Pachycephalosaurus''. This has been supported in a 2016 analysis of the youngest ''Pachycephalosaurus'' material known, which indicates that the unique features of ''Dracorex'' represent instead ontogenetically variant features on a ''Pachycephalosaurus'' growth curve.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Mark B.|last2=Evans|first2=David C.|date=2016-02-06|title=The early expression of squamosal horns and parietal ornamentation confirmed by new end-stage juvenilePachycephalosaurusfossils from the Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation, Montana|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2016.1078343|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=36|issue=2|pages=e1078343|doi=10.1080/02724634.2016.1078343|issn=0272-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Dracorex BW.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration.]] 
''Dracorex'', a [[herbivore]], had a skull with spiky horns, bumps, and a long muzzle. The species also sports well-developed supratemporal [[Skull#Temporal fenestrae|fenestrae]] and a heavily armored flat skull—lacking the characteristic pachycephalosaurid dome. Coupled with these two features is the excessive number of osteoderms in the form of irregular osteodermal crust: a number of nodes, larger hornlets, and spikes. Disregarding this, ''Dracorex'' is physically comparable to ''[[Stygimoloch]]''.

In the Pachycephalosauridae, the [[Asia]]n taxa include a number of (somewhat) flat-headed pachycephalosaurs (''[[Homalocephale]] calathocercos'', ''[[Goyocephale]] lattimorei'', and ''[[Wannanosaurus]] yansiensis''). However, prior to the discovery of ''Dracorex'', the only semi-flat-headed pachycephalosaur from [[North America]] was ''[[Stegoceras]] validum'' (inclusive of ''[[Ornatotholus]] browni''). Even then, the semi-flat-headed trait was only present in juveniles of the species.
[[Image:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Dracorex actual skull.jpg|thumb|The holotype skull]]
Aside from having a flat, nodal skull, the most prominent feature of ''Dracorex'' is the pair of huge and unrestricted superior temporal openings. The supratemporal fenestrae are much larger front-to-back and side-to-side than in ''Homalocephale'', and larger than in ''Goyocephale''. Only a fragmentary ''Wannanosaurus'' skull shows fenestrae as large as those of ''Dracorex''. This fenestral architecture has been seen in ancient [[archosaur]]s, but not in other pachycephalosaurs.

Consequently, if unreduced superior fenestrae are [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] primitive, then ''Dracorex'' is more primitive in the temporal region than any other known pachycephalosaur. However, Sullivan (2003, 2006) demonstrated that the oldest-known pachycephalosaurs were, in fact, fully domed, and that the flat-headed morphology appeared later in the fossil record. This suggests that doming may be primitive for pachycephalosaurs and that a [[Evolutionary biology|reversion]] to the non-domed, flat-headed state is a secondary (derived) character reversion, coupled with the re-opening of the supratemporal fenestrae. Indeed, while ''Stegoceras'' has been considered to be transitional between domed and flat-headed taxa, it may indicate the beginning of a character reversion to suppression of doming and opening of the supratemporal fenestrae in some taxa.

The excavated specimen was most likely a young adult. However, based on the beginning of [[ossification]] of the mid-cervical arch with the [[body of vertebra|centrum]], it was near maturity.&lt;ref name=RTBetal06/&gt; It was about {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="Holtz2008"&gt;Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) ''Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages,'' [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/dinoappendix/HoltzappendixWinter2010.pdf Winter 2010 Appendix.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:Pachycephalosaurus ontogeny.png|thumb|left|Diagram showing ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' as growth stages of ''Pachycephalosaurus''.]]
''Dracorex'' may actually be an individual of the closely related ''[[Stygimoloch]]'' and/or ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'' in which the dome and horns are not well-developed, either because the animal was a juvenile or a female. This consideration was supported at the 2007 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Stokstad,"SOCIETY OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY MEETING: Did Horny Young Dinosaurs Cause Illusion of Separate Species?", ''Science'' Vol. 18, 23 Nov. 2007, p. 1236; http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5854/1236&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Horner of [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] presented evidence, from analysis of the skull of the single existing ''Dracorex'' specimen, that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of ''Stygimoloch''. In addition, he presented data that indicates that both ''Stygimoloch'' and ''Dracorex'' may be juvenile forms of ''Pachycephalosaurus''. Horner and M.B. Goodwin published their findings in 2009, showing that the spike/node and skull dome bones of all three 'species' exhibit extreme plasticity, and that both ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' are known only from juvenile specimens, while ''Pachycephalosaurus'' is known only from adult specimens. These observations, in addition to the fact that all three forms lived in the same time and place, lead them to conclude that ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' may have simply been juvenile ''Pachycephalosaurs'' that had lost their spikes and grew domes as they aged.&lt;ref name=horneretal2009&gt;Horner J.R. and Goodwin, M.B. (2009). "Extreme cranial ontogeny in the Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur ''Pachycephalosaurus''." ''PLoS ONE'', '''4'''(10): e7626. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007626 Online full text]&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers were unable to destructively sample the ''Dracorex'' skull,&lt;ref name="UCB09press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/10/30_dino_demise.shtml|title=New analyses of dinosaur growth may wipe out one-third of species|last=Sanders|first=Robert|date=30 October 2009|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had to use a cast of the skull for descriptive purposes.&lt;ref name=horneretal2009/&gt; A 2010 study by Nick Longrich and colleagues also supported the hypothesis that all flat-skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles, suggesting that flat-skulled forms, like ''Goyocephale'' and ''Homalocephale'', represent juveniles of dome-skulled adults.&lt;ref name=longrichetal2010&gt;Longrich, N.R., Sankey, J. and Tanke, D. (2010). "''Texacephale langstoni'', a new genus of pachycephalosaurid (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the upper Campanian Aguja Formation, southern Texas, USA." ''Cretaceous Research'', . {{doi|10.1016/j.cretres.2009.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Goodwin and Evans analyzed the youngest-known ontogimorphs of ''Pachycephalosaurus'', collected from the Hell Creek Formation. While this material would normally be referred to ''Dracorex'', as it represented one or more individuals younger than the only known ''Dracorex'' individual and displayed similar features, the elements showed that the unique characters in ''Dracorex'' and ''Stygimoloch'' represent instead consistent morphological characters on a morphological continuum for ''Pachycephalosaurus''. In other words, this younger individual(s) displayed that the features of Dracorex were most likely transient, and can be plotted easily on a growth curve for ''Pachycephalosaurus'', where ''Stygimoloch'' and ''Dracorex'' are incorporated within this genus. As such, ''Dracorex'' likely is not a unique species, but instead a junior synonym of ''Pachycephalosaurus''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Pachycephalosaurus scale.png|thumb|Size comparison of ''Dracorex'' (red) and a human]] 
The name ''Dracorex hogwartsia'' was inspired by young visitors to [[the Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] as a tribute to both [[dragon]]s (''Dracorex'' means "dragon king"), which the animal resembled, as well as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books by [[J. K. Rowling]] (''hogwartsia'' for the [[Hogwarts]] School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the fictional school from the popular series). The writer declared:

{{bquote|I am absolutely thrilled to think that Hogwarts has made a small ([[claw]]?) mark upon the fascinating world of dinosaurs. I happen to know more on the subject of [[palaeontology]] than many might credit, because my eldest daughter was ''[[Utahraptor]]''-obsessed and I am now living with a passionate ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex''-lover, aged three. My credibility has soared within my science-loving family, and I am very much looking forward to reading [[Robert T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">[[File:Guy the Gorilla statue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statue of Guy in London Zoo]]
'''Guy the Gorilla''' (1946–1978) was a [[western lowland gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') who was [[London Zoo]]'s famous resident, something of a [[celebrity]] in the 1960s–70s and was often profiled on children's TV shows and natural history productions. Guy the Gorilla was one of London Zoo's best-loved animals.  The exact day of Guy's birth was never known, but the official birthday was set by the Zoo as May 30, and he received large numbers of cards every year.

== Life ==
Guy arrived at the zoo on 5 November 1947,&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered"&gt;[http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/news/guy-the-gorilla-a-life-remembered,409,NS.html "Guy the Gorilla: a life remembered"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113190515/http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/news/guy-the-gorilla-a-life-remembered,409,NS.html |date=2013-01-13 }}, The Zoological Society of London, 7 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Fawkes Night]], hence his name. He was a tiny baby, weighing just 23&amp;nbsp;lb (10&amp;nbsp;kg) and holding a small tin hot-water bottle.&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered" /&gt; Guy was the replacement for the zoo's previous gorilla, Meng, who had died in 1941. Guy was captured in the [[French Cameroons]] on behalf of [[Paris Zoological Park|Paris Zoo]] and was traded for a tiger from [[Calcutta Zoo]]. It was arranged that London Zoo would have Guy.  The Paris Zoo Director sent instructions to their game department in West Africa to find a suitable female to mate with him.

London sent a request to a variety of animal dealers and zoos worldwide to find a mate, and in 1969 the zoo was offered Lomie, a five-year-old female who had been living in nearby [[Chessington Zoo]]. She then lived for a year in the old Monkey House in London Zoo before being introduced to Guy. When the new Ape and Monkey House, the [[Michael Sobell]] Pavilion, was opened in 1971, Guy and Lomie were finally introduced. However, after 25 years of isolation, it was too late; they never produced any offspring.&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered" /&gt;

Lowland gorillas are the world's largest primates. Males can weigh between 140 and 275&amp;nbsp;kg. Guy's dimensions as [[silverback]] were measured in 1966 and 1971: he weighed 520&amp;nbsp;lb (240&amp;nbsp;kg), was 5&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in (1.63 m) tall, and had an arm span of 9&amp;nbsp;ft (2.7 m). His upper arm had a circumference of 23.5 in (58&amp;nbsp;cm), his thighs 28 in (70&amp;nbsp;cm), and his neck 36 in (90&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered" /&gt;

His appearance was fearsome, yet his nature was very gentle; when small birds flew into his cage, he was often seen to lift them on his hands and examine them softly.&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered" /&gt; This gentleness is said to have been a major part of his great popularity.

Guy died aged 31 or 32, in 1978 of a [[heart attack]] during an operation on his infected teeth. His [[tooth decay]] had been caused by the fact that visitors were allowed to feed him sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9706989/Guy-the-Gorilla-returns-as-a-national-treasure.html|title=Guy the Gorilla returns as a national treasure|last=Singh|first=Anita|date=27 November 2012|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he had become an [[icon]]. Public awareness of animal behaviour had been growing, thanks to the ever-improving natural history programmes on television, while studies of wild apes by scientists like [[Jane Goodall]], [[Biruté Galdikas]] and [[Dian Fossey]] were changing the public's attitude towards primates.

During [[pre-production]] for the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), [[Daniel Richter (actor)|Dan Richter]] — who played the lead ape-man ("Moonwatcher") in the film — studied Guy intently and modelled his acting and [[mime]] performance partly on Guy's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Richter (interview), In: ''2001: The Making of a Myth'' (2001), [[Channel 4]], Available on the 2007 DVD Two-Disc Special Edition of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Richter is interviewed in front of the Timym statue. This [[featurette]] also includes a brief 1966 clip of Guy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*A statue of Guy by the sculptor [[David Wynne (sculptor)|David Wynne]] was erected in [[Crystal Palace Park]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w02.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/features/3163/Animal_statues_in_London.html|title=Animal statues in London|work=Time Out|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=17 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222214720/http://w02.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/features/3163/Animal_statues_in_London.html|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] head [[taxidermist]] at the time of Guy's death, Arthur Hayward, was given the task of modelling and mounting Guy's skin. After nearly nine months of work, the re-creation of Guy was put on display at the Natural History Museum in November 1982. Years later, Guy was taken out of public display and moved into the scientific study collections. As of late 2012, however, he has been returned to public display as part of the permanent new 'Treasures' exhibition in the museum's Cadogan Gallery.
*In 1982, Guy was commemorated by a bronze statue by [[William Timym]],&lt;ref name="ZSL remembered" /&gt; located near London Zoo's main entrance, by the Michael Sobell Pavilion for Monkeys and Apes, where Guy spent his final years. He is also commemorated in an oil painting by Timym which hangs in the Zoological Society of London's library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zsl.org/about-us/library/artefact-of-the-month-septermber-2007,716,AR.html|title=Artefact of the month: Oil painting of Guy the gorilla, by William Timym. c. 1980|date=September 2007|publisher=Zoological Society of London|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8435">'''Günter Ropohl''' (14 June 1939 in [[Cologne]], Germany – 28 January 2017) was a German philosopher of technology.

== Biography ==
Günter Ropohl studied [[mechanical engineering]] and philosophy at [[Stuttgart]] University, where he was a scholar of the philosopher [[Max Bense]]. After his PhD ([[Dr.-Ing.]]) in 1970, he wrote his [[Habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy und Sociology at [[Karlsruhe University]] 1978 under the supervision of [[Hans Lenk (philosopher)|Hans Lenk]]. His work dealt with the [[systems theory]] of "[[Technik]]" (engl. ''technique''), leading to the concept of [[general technology]].&lt;ref&gt;published under the title ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'' 1979, 2nd. ed. under the title ''Allgemeine Technologie'', 1999, 3rd ed. 2009, open source: [http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/1000011529]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1979, Ropohl became Professor at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]. Soon after, in 1981, he became Professor for [[Allgemeine Technologie]] (general technology) and [[philosophy of technology]] at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany (until 2004). In the 1980s, he visited his colleague and friend [[Carl Mitcham]] in the United States. From 1983 to 1991, i.e. during the period of the [[Cold War]], he was course director and visiting lecturer at the Inter-University Centre Dubrovnik ([[Croatia]]). In 1988, he was invited as visiting professor at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], Rochester NY.
Ropohl was an honorary member of the German Engineering Association ([[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]]), due to his interdisciplinary engagement for the philosophy of technology. He was co-editor of an anthology of the ''classics'' in the philosophy of technology in a Continental-European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;* Hubig, Ch., Huning, A. and Ropohl, G. (Eds.), ''Nachdenken über Technik. Die Klassiker der Technikphilosophie'', Berlin 2000. 3rd ed. 2013 (to be translated into English and Chinese in the next years).&lt;/ref&gt; Ropohl published 15 monographs, (co-)edited another 15 books and published more than 180 articles. He died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwerk-rauchen.de/component/content/article/1-aktuelle-nachrichten/975-guenter-ropohl-verstorben.html Günter Ropohl verstorben] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

A central concept in his work was [[sociotechnical systems]], i.e. he regarded techniques as societal structures. Ropohl was a critic of the systems theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]] and voted for the recognition of [[material culture]]. His definition of (''German'') "Technik" included a) the [[utility]], b) artificiality and c) [[Function (engineering)|functionality]]. In the focus of his work is the combination of technique as [[Document|artefact]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]], whereas [[knowledge]] insinuates the meta-concept of [[technology]]. Therefore, he differentiated between [[engineering sciences]] and [[technical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter Ropohl, ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'', 1979, p. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ropohl was well known in the German-speaking academia for his writings on the concepts of ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'', the [[ethics of technology]], [[technology assessment]], professional ethics for engineers and on the societal need for educating towards technology literacy.

He received a [[Festschrift]] with contributions from academic scholars, focusing on his work and related discourses, both on his 65th and 75th birthday (edited by [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], see literature), including a complete list of his publications from the late 1960s to 2014.

'''''Harryplax''''' is a genus of [[crab]] containing the sole species '''''Harryplax severus''''', native to Guam, where it is found in offshore coral rubble. Measuring {{convert|7.9|by|5.6|mm|in|abbr=on}}, ''H. severus'' occurs at depths of {{convert|1|to|7.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. First collected in 1998 and described in 2017, the genus name honors collector Harry T. Conley, as well as the literary character [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], an allusion to Conley's "uncanny ability to collect rare and interesting creatures as if by magic." The species name alludes to [[Severus Snape]], also from the ''Harry Potter'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jose C.E.|last2=Ng|first2=Peter K.L.|title=''Harryplax severus'', a new genus and species of an unusual coral rubble-inhabiting crab from Guam (Crustacea, Brachyura, Christmaplacidae)|journal=ZooKeys|date=2017|volume=647|pages=23–35|doi=10.3897/zookeys.647.11455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greshko|first1=Michael|title=Pale, Beady-Eyed Crab Named for Harry Potter|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/new-crab-species-harry-potter-characters-severus/|website=National Geographic News|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geggel|first1=Laura|title=Accio Crab!

==Homeostatic capacity and aging==
A hypothesis proffered by the proponents of the Palo Alto Longevity Prize is that the array of ailments associated with aging may be epiphenomena of eroding homeostatic capacity and the process of [[aging]] may be halted or reversed by restoring homeostatic capacity to that of a healthy young adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paloaltoprize.com/faq/ | title=FAQ – Palo Alto Longevity Prize | publisher=''Palo Alto Longevity Prize'' | accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-09-09/silicon-valley-investor-backs-1-million-longevity-prize | title=Silicon Valley Investor Backs $1 Million Prize to End Death | publisher=''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' | date=September 9, 2014 | accessdate=October 1, 2014 | author=Ashlee Vance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-million-longevity-prize-seeks-133000078.html | title=$1 Million Longevity Prize Seeks To "Hack The Aging Code" | publisher=''[[Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7470">'''Hybrid inviability''' is a [[Reproductive isolation|post-zygotic barrier]], which reduces a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]'s capacity to mature into a healthy, fit adult.&lt;ref&gt;Hybrid inviability. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 03, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/278018/hybrid-inviability&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively low health of these hybrids relative to [[Pure breed|pure-breed]] individuals prevents [[gene flow]] between species.  Thus, hybrid inviability acts as an [[Isolating mechanisms|isolating mechanism]], limiting [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and allowing for the differentiation of species.
	
The barrier of hybrid inviability occurs after mating species overcome pre-zygotic barriers (behavioral, mechanical, etc.) to produce a [[zygote]].  The barrier emerges from the cumulative effect of parental [[gene]]s; these conflicting genes interfere with the [[embryo]]'s development and prevents its [[Fetal development|maturation]].  Most often, the hybrid embryo dies before birth.  However, sometimes, the offspring develops fully with mixed traits, forming a frail, often [[Infertility|infertile]] adult.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, N. A., J. B. Reece, L. A. Urry, M. L. Cain, S. A. Wasserman, P. V. Minorsky, and R. B. Jackson. 2008. Biology: Eighth Ed. San Francisco, CA:491.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hybrid displays reduced fitness, marked by decreased rates of [[:wikt:survival|survival]] and [[reproduction]] relative to the parent species.  The offspring fails to compete with purebred individuals, limiting genes flow between species.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, S., and J. C. Herron. 2007. Evolutionary Analysis:Fourth Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:627.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of Hybrid Inviability in Tetrapods ==
	
In the 1970s, [[Allan C. Wilson]] and his colleagues first investigated the evolution of hybrid inviability in [[tetrapod]]s, specifically [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[frog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prager, E. M., and A. C. Wilson. 1975. Slow evolutionary loss of the potential for interspecific hybridization in birds: a manifestation of slow regulatory evolution. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72:200-204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A. C., L. R. Maxson, and V. M. Sarich. 1974. Two types of molecular evolution: evidence from studies of interspecific hybridization. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71:2843-2847.
&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Recognizing that hybrid viability decreases with time, the researchers used [[molecular clock]]s to quantify [[divergence]] time.  They identified how long ago the [[common ancestor]] of hybridizing species diverged into two lines, and found that bird and frog species can produce viable hybrids up to twenty million years after [[speciation]].  In addition, the researchers showed that mammal species can only produce viable hybrids up to two or three million years after speciation.

Wilson et al. (1974) proposes two [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the relatively faster [[evolution]] of hybrid inviability in mammals: the Regulatory and the Immunological Hypotheses.  Subsequent research finds support for these hypotheses.

'''The Regulatory Hypothesis''' accounts for two characteristics of mammals, and explains the general formation of hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs.

First, mammals display relatively lower protein diversity than frogs.  As Wilson et al. (1974) suggests, “mammals that can hybridize with each other differ only slightly at the protein level, whereas frogs that differ substantially in [[protein sequence]] hybridize readily.”  This analysis suggests that gene divergence is not the only determinate of hybridization in mammals, birds, or frogs.
	
Second, the evolution of anatomical diversity occurred far faster in mammals than in either birds or frogs.  As Fitzpatrick (2004) indicates, “the morphological disparities among [[bat]]s, [[naked mole-rat|mole-rat]]s, and [[whale]]s are more dramatic than any disparities in birds and frogs.”  This anatomical diversity is evidence for the diversification of [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory system]]s.  This mammalian characteristic suggests that, although mammals are genetically similar, dramatic changes in regulatory genes caused distinct developmental differences.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, B. M. 2004. Rates of evolution of hybrid viability in birds and mammals. Evolution 58:1865-1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regulatory Hypotheses specifically attributes hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs to differences in [[gene regulation]]. It proposes that hybrid inviability evolved faster in mammalian [[Taxon|taxa]] because mammals have accumulated significantly more changes in regulatory systems than birds or frogs, and it suggests that organisms with distinctly different systems of gene regulation may not produce viable hybrids.

Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes that the development of embryos in the mammalian [[placenta]] requires regulatory compatibility.  Both the regulatory genes of the [[sperm]] and [[Egg (biology)|egg]] contribute to the expression of other protein-coding genes in the zygote; if certain regulatory genes are not expressed or are expressed at the wrong time, the inter-specific zygote will abort or develop unhealthy traits.  Moreover, because the development of the zygote depends on maternal characteristics, such as cytoplasmic determinants, the regulatory traits of the mother may not support the hybrid's developmental needs. 

'''The Immunological Hypothesis''' proposes that the divergence of certain protein structures associated with mother and child causes hybrid inviability.  The hypothesis applies only to mammals, where [[fertilization]] and development is internal.  In birds and in frogs, fertilization is primarily external, and the mother’s [[immune system]] does not interfere with [[fetal development]].	 

This hypothesis stems from the immunological characteristics of the placenta, where the growing [[fetus]] is in constant contact with the fluids and tissues of the mother.  Variation within species and variation between species may contribute to fetal-maternal incompatibility, and according to the hypothesis, if the proteins of the fetus varies significantly from the proteins of the placenta, the mother may produce [[Antibody|anti-bodies]] that will attack and abort the fetus.  Therefore, if the fetal proteins of the father species are incompatible the mother's placental proteins, the mother's immune system may abort the embryo.
	
Evidence for the Immunological Hypothesis varies considerably.  Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes studies that provide no support to the Immunological Hypotheses.  In these experiments, the use of [[Immune suppressant|immunological suppressants]] provided no additional viability to inter-specific hybrids.  In contrast, Elliot and Crespi (2006) documents the effects of placental immunology on hybrid inviability, showing that mammals with [[Hemochorial placentation|hemochorial placentas]] more readily hybridize than mammals with [[epitheliochorial]] or [[Endotheliochorial placentation|endotheliochorial placentas]].  These different placenta types possess divergent immunological systems, and consequently, they cause varying degrees of hybrid inviability.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, M. G., and B. J. Crespi. 2006. Placental invasiveness mediates the evolution of hybrid inviability in mammals. Am. Nat. 168:114-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''INDECT''' is a research project in the area of intelligent security systems performed by several European universities since 2009 and funded by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/fp7-ga-annex2-v5_en.pdf] Project's Grant Agreement&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the project is to involve European scientists and researchers in the development of solutions to and tools for automatic threat detection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indect-project.eu/] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; through e.g. processing of [[CCTV camera]] data streams,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6210255/EU-funding-Orwellian-artificial-intelligence-plan-to-monitor-public-for-abnormal-behaviour.html] EU funding 'Orwellian' artificial intelligence plan to monitor public for "abnormal behaviour"&lt;/ref&gt; standardization of video sequence quality for user applications,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-012-1161-6] Optimising task-based video quality - Springer&lt;/ref&gt; threat detection in computer networks&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-21512-4_4] INACT — INDECT Advanced Image Cataloguing Tool - Springer&lt;/ref&gt; as well as data and privacy protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indect-project.eu/benefits-for-the-security-of-citizens-selected-tools-and-applications] Benefits for the security of citizens &amp; selected tools and applications — indect-home&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6657328] Overview of Recent Advances in CCTV Processing Chain in the INDECT and INSIGMA Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of research, applied methods and techniques are described in the public deliverables&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indect-project.eu/public-deliverables] Public Deliverables&lt;/ref&gt; which are available to the public on the project's website. Practically, all information related to the research is public. Only documents that comprise information related to financial data or information that could negatively influence the competitiveness and law enforcement capabilities of parties involved in the project are not published. This follows regulations and practices applied in EU research projects.

==Application and target users==

The main end-user of INDECT solutions are police forces and security services.

The principle of operation of the project is detecting threats and identifying source of threats, without monitoring and searching for particular citizens or groups of citizens. Then, the system operator (i.e. police officer) decides whether an intervention of services responsible for public security are required or not. Further investigation eventually leading to persons related to threats are performed, preserving the presumption of innocence,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policja.pl/ftp/pliki/police_act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of existing procedures already used by police services and prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-8217&amp;language=EN|title=Answer to a written question - Indect project - E-8217/2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it can be found in the project deliverables, INDECT does not involve storage of personal data (such as names, addresses, identity document numbers, etc.).

A similar, behaviour based surveillance program was [[SAMURAI]] ''(Suspicious and Abnormal behaviour Monitoring Using a netwoRk of cAmeras &amp; sensors for sItuation awareness enhancement)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89343_en.html CORDIS record for "SAMURAI"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected results==

The main expected results of the INDECT project are:
* Trial of intelligent analysis of video and audio data for threat detection in urban environments,
* Creation of tools and technology for privacy and data protection during storage and transmission of information using quantum cryptography and new methods of digital watermarking,
* Performing computer-aided detection of threats and targeted crimes in Internet resources with privacy-protecting solutions,
* Construction of a search engine for rapid semantic search based on watermarking of content related to child pornography and human organ trafficking,
* Implementation of a distributed computer system that is capable of effective intelligent processing.

==Controversy==
Some media and other sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6210255/EU-funding-Orwellian-artificial-intelligence-plan-to-monitor-public-for-abnormal-behaviour.html|title=EU funding 'Orwellian' artificial intelligence plan to monitor public for|author=Ian Johnston|date=19 September 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; accuse INDECT of privacy abuse, collecting personal data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-8217&amp;language=EN] European Parliament on data protection&lt;/ref&gt; and keeping information from the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-7521&amp;language=EN] European Parliament on the project's transparency to the public&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these issues have been commented and discussed by some Members of the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sidesSearch/sipadeMapUrl.do?PROG=QP&amp;SORT_ORDER=DA&amp;S_REF_QP=%25&amp;S_RANK=%25&amp;F_MI_TEXT=indect&amp;MI_TEXT=indect&amp;LEG_ID=7&amp;L=EN] Parliamentary questions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+WDECL+P7-DCL-2010-0082+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=written declaration (Number of signatories : 177) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(102&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As can be seen in the  project's documentation, INDECT does not involve mobile phone tracking or call interception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indect-project.eu/files/deliverables/public/INDECT_Deliverable_D5_1.pdf], Preliminary report on police and prosecutor repositories and access procedures&lt;/ref&gt;

The rumours about testing INDECT during [[2012 UEFA European Football Championship]] also turned out to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-6912&amp;language=EN], European Parliament on testing INDECT during EURO 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-term review of the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] to the European Parliament strongly urges the European Commission to immediately make all documents available and to define a clear and strict mandate for the research goal, the application, and the end users of INDECT, and stresses a thorough investigation of the possible impact on [[Fundamental rights#European Union|fundamental rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee on Industry, Research and Energy]]: [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2011-0160+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN Report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2011/2043(INI)).] Results of FP7, 27. 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to Mr. Paweł Kowal, MEP, the project had the ethical review on 15 March 2011 in Brussels with the participation of ethics experts from Austria, France, Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain.

==Murder==
The lifeless body of Iana Kasian was found by law enforcement officers on May 26, 2016. The discovery was made following a barricade stand-off with [[Blake Leibel]], who is the father of Kasian's daughter. Leibel was charged with Kasian's murder, which occurred on the 8500 block of Holloway Drive in West Hollywood, California in an apartment that the couple had recently shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hamilton |first=Matt |date=27 May 2016 |title=The Homicide Report |url=http://homicide.latimes.com/post/iana-kasian/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media reported the crime as  "grisly" and possibly "the most gruesome murder in the history of West Hollywood if not [[Los Angeles]]".&lt;ref name="WEHOville"&gt;{{cite web |title=WeHo’s Holloway Drive: Scene of the Most Gruesome Murder in L.A.

An [[autopsy]] report was released on September 20, 2017, listing Kasian's causes of death as [[exsanguination]] and [[head trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case Information - Iana Kasian |url=http://mec.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/mec/main/home/caseinformation/casedetail?CaseNum=2016-03915 |website=Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A civil lawsuit filed by the victim's mother, Olga Kasian, included transcripts of [[Los Angeles County Coroner]] Dr. James Ribe's deposition, which stated:

{{Quote|text=“Kasian's entire scalp was traumatically absent and was not found, was not present with the body. Her skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone … There was no scalp present except for little bits in the back of the neck... portions of the right side of her face were torn away including the right ear and part of the posterior face on the (right) side, all the way down to the jawline... there were quite a number of bruises and abrasions on the face, primarily on the left side, the left cheek, and left jaw area, a number of bruises and abrasion, including one which turned out to be a human bite mark... she had lived for at least eight hours approximately after receiving the scalp injury and the bruise to the collarbone... I have never seen this before. And I doubt if hardly any forensic pathologists in this country or abroad have even seen this outside of, perhaps, wartime...

'''Incremental heuristic search''' algorithms combine both incremental and heuristic search to speed up searches of sequences of similar search problems, which is important in domains that are only incompletely known or change dynamically.&lt;ref&gt;S. Koenig, M. Likhachev, Y. Liu and D. Furcy. Incremental Heuristic Search in Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence Magazine, 25(2), 99-112, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Incremental search has been studied at least since the late 1960s. Incremental search algorithms reuse information from previous searches to speed up the current search and solve search problems potentially much faster than solving them repeatedly from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Narsingh Deo|N. Deo]] and C. Pang. Shortest-path algorithms: Taxonomy and Annotation.  Networks 14, 275–323, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, heuristic search has also been studied at least since the late 1960s.

Heuristic search algorithms, often based on [[A*]], use heuristic knowledge in the form of approximations of the goal distances to focus the search and solve search problems potentially much faster than uninformed search algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hart, N. Nilsson and B. Raphael, A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths, IEEE Trans. Syst. Science and Cybernetics, SSC-4(2), 100-107, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting search problems, sometimes called dynamic path planning problems, are graph search problems where paths have to be found repeatedly because the [[topology]] of the graph, its edge costs, the start vertex or the goal vertices change over time.&lt;ref&gt;N. Deo and C. Pang. Shortest-path algorithms: Taxonomy
and Annotation.  Networks 14, 275–323, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, three main classes of incremental heuristic search algorithms have been developed:

* The first class restarts A* at the point where its current search deviates from the previous one (example: Fringe Saving A*&lt;ref&gt;X. Sun and S. Koenig. The Fringe-Saving A* Search Algorithm - A Feasibility Study. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2391-2397, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* The second class updates the h-values (heuristic, i.e. approximate distance to goal) from the previous search during the current search to make them more informed (example: Generalized Adaptive A*&lt;ref&gt;X. Sun, S. Koenig and W. Yeoh. Generalized Adaptive A*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), 469-476, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* The third class updates the g-values (distance from start) from the previous search during the current search to correct them when necessary, which can be interpreted as transforming the A* search tree from the previous search into the A* search tree for the current search (examples: [[Lifelong Planning A*]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Koenig, M. Likhachev and D. Furcy. Lifelong Planning A*. Artificial Intelligence Journal, 155, (1-2), 93-146, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D*]],&lt;ref&gt;6. A. Stentz. The Focussed D* Algorithm for Real-Time Replanning. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1652–1659, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D*#D.2A Lite|D* Lite]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Koenig and M. Likhachev. Fast Replanning for Navigation in Unknown Terrain. Transactions on Robotics, 21, (3), 354-363, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;).

All three classes of incremental heuristic search algorithms are different from other replanning algorithms, such as planning by analogy, in that their plan quality does not deteriorate with the number of replanning episodes.

==Applications==
Incremental heuristic search has been extensively used in [[robotics]], where a larger number of path planning systems are based on either [[D*]] (typically
earlier systems) or D* Lite (current systems), two different incremental heuristic search algorithms.

The '''interpersonal theory of suicide''' attempts to explain why individuals engage in [[suicide|suicidal behavior]] and to identify individuals who are at risk. It was developed by [[Thomas Joiner]] and is outlined in ''Why People Die By Suicide''.&lt;ref name= "Joiner"&gt;Joiner, T. E. (2005). ''Why People Die By Suicide''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The theory consists of three components that together lead to suicide attempts. According to the theory, the simultaneous presence of thwarted [[belongingness]] and perceived [[burdensomeness]] produce the desire for suicide. While the desire for suicide is necessary, it alone will not result in death by suicide. Rather, Joiner asserts that one must also have acquired capability (that is, the acquired ability to overcome one's natural fear of death).

A number of [[risk factor]]s have been linked to suicidal behavior, and there are many theories of suicide that integrate these established risk factors, but few are capable of explaining all of the phenomena associated with suicidal behavior as the interpersonal theory of suicide does. Another strength of this theory lies in its ability to be tested empirically. It is constructed in a way that allows for falsifiability. A number of studies have found at least partial support for the interpersonal theory of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Cukrowicz, K. C., Braithwaite, S., Selby, E. A., &amp; Joiner Jr., T. E. (2010). The interpersonal theory of suicide". ''[[Psychological Review]]'', 117(2), 575-600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joiner Jr, T. E., Van Orden, K. A., Witte, T. K., Selby, E. A., Ribeiro, J. D., Lewis, R., &amp; Rudd, M. D. (2009). "Main predictions of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicidal behavior: Empirical tests in two samples of young adults". ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'', 118(3), 634&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a systematic review of 66 studies using the interpersonal theory of suicide found that the effect of perceived burdensomeness on suicide ideation was the most tested and supported relationship. The theory’s other predictions, particularly in terms of critical interaction effects, are less strongly supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jennifer|last2=Batterham|first2=Philip J.|last3=Calear|first3=Alison L.|last4=Han|first4=Jin|date=2016-06-01|title=A systematic review of the predictions of the Interpersonal–Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behavior|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735815301744|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=46|pages=34–45|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire for suicide==

===Thwarted belongingness===
Belongingness—feeling accepted by others—is believed to be a fundamental need, something that is essential for an individual's psychological health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Leary, M. R. (1995). "The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation". ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', 117, 497-529&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[social connectedness]]—a construct related to belongingness—has been shown to lower risk for suicide. More specifically, being married, having children, and having more friends are associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyer G, &amp; Lund E. (1993). "Suicide among women related to number of children in marriage". ''[[Archives of General Psychiatry]]'', 50, 134–137&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "pulling together" (e.g., gathering for sporting events, celebrations) with others has been shown to have a preventive effect.&lt;ref name= "pulling"&gt;Joiner, Jr., T.E., Hollar, D., &amp; Van Orden, K.A. (2007). "On Buckeyes, Gators, Super Bowl Sunday, and the Miracle on Ice: 'Pulling together' is associated with lower suicide rates". ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology'', 25, 180–196&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suicide rates have been lower on [[Super Bowl Sunday]]s than other Sundays, and it is believed that the social connectedness that occurs from being a fan of a sport's team increases one's feeling of belongingness.&lt;ref name= "pulling"/&gt; In contrast, [[social isolation]] is frequently reported by those who die by suicide prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, D. L. (1980). "The role of social isolation in suicide". ''[[Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior]]'', 10, 10–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived burdensomeness===
Perceived burdensomeness is the belief that one is a burden on others or society. Joiner describes perceived burdensomeness as the belief that "my death is worth more than my life".&lt;ref name= "Joiner"/&gt; [[Unemployment]], medical or health problems, and incarceration are examples of situations in which a person may feel like they are a burden to others.&lt;ref name= "Joiner"/&gt; It is important to note that the burdensomeness is "perceived", and is often a false belief. According to the theory, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness together constitute the desire for suicide.

==Acquired capability==
Joiner terms this "acquired" capability because it is not an ability with which humans are born. Rather, this ability to engage in suicidal behaviors is only acquired through life experiences. Fear of death is a natural and powerful instinct. According to the theory, one's fear of death is weakened when one is exposed to physical [[pain]] or provocative life experiences as these experiences often lead to fearlessness and pain insensitivity. These experiences could include [[childhood trauma]], witnessing a traumatic event, suffering from a severe illness, or engaging in [[self-harm]] behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Joiner"/&gt;

These behaviors are thought to result in the desensitization to painful stimuli and to increase one's ability to engage in suicidal behaviors. This component is important in identifying individuals who are likely to attempt or die by suicide. For example, certain professions (e.g., soldiers, surgeons, and police officers) are exposed to physical pain or provocative experiences. More specifically, soldiers with a history of combat have likely been exposed to grave injuries, witnessing the death of others, and are [[Habituation|habituated]] to fear of painful experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Joiner, T. E. (2010). "Overcoming the fear of lethal injury: Evaluating suicidal behavior in the military through the lens of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicide". ''[[Clinical Psychology Review]]'', 30(3), 298-307. doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.004&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with data indicating an increased rate of suicide in soldiers. Additionally, past attempts of suicide has been found to be the number one predictor of future attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Borowsky, I. W., Ireland, M., &amp; Resnick, M. D. (2001). "Adolescent suicide attempts: risks and protectors". ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'', 107(3), 485-493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, R. C., Borges, G., &amp; Walters, E. E. (1999). "Prevalence of and risk factors for lifetime suicide attempts in the National Comorbidity Survey". ''Archives of General Psychiatry'', 56(7), 617-626&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with Joiner's theory; individuals who attempt suicide will habituate to the fear of death, and this weakened fear will make an individual more likely to make a subsequent attempt.

==Implications==
A survey study of a large population-based cohort provides support for the interpersonal theory in that the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation, and suicidal ideation and ability predicted plans to attempt suicide and actual attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, H., Batterham, P. J., Soubelet, A., &amp; Mackinnon, A. J. (2013). "A test of the interpersonal theory of suicide in a large community-based cohort". ''[[Journal of Affective Disorders]]'', 144(3), 225-234. doi:10.1016/j.jad.2012.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpersonal theory of suicide identifies factors clinicians should assess for increased suicide risk and factors that should be targeted in prevention and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Stellrecht, N. E., Gordon, K. H., Van Orden, K., Witte, T. K., Wingate, L. R., Cukrowicz, K. C., ... &amp; Fitzpatrick, K. K. (2006). "Clinical applications of the interpersonal‐psychological theory of attempted and completed suicide". ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'', 62(2), 211-222&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the theory provides avenues of future research for scientists.

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-22''''' was one of five [[Type C submarine|Type C]] [[cruiser submarine]]s of the C1 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1930s.

==Design and description==
The Type C submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub-class of the {{Sclass-|Kaidai|submarine|4}} with a heavier torpedo armament for long-range attacks. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|2554|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} surfaced and {{Convert|3561|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|109.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a diving depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|6200|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|1000|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23.6|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface, the ''C1''s had a range of {{convert|14000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kn}}.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt;

The boats were armed with eight internal bow {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s and carried a total of 20 [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with a single [[14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gun|{{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}}/40]] [[deck gun]] and two single or twin mounts for [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. They were equipped to carry one [[Type A Kō-hyōteki-class submarine|Type A midget submarine]] aft of the [[conning tower]].&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Dorr, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Construction and career==
''I-22'' was commissioned at [[Yokosuka, Japan]] on March 10, 1941.  The submarine participated in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], and the [[attack on Sydney Harbour]] in May and June 1942.  ''I-22'' disappeared while on patrol near [[Malaita]] in the [[Solomon Islands]] on or around October 4, 1942 and was presumed lost with all 100 hands.

'''John Henry Owen "Busty" Brown''' [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]] (died 1964) was a [[Company Quartermaster Sergeant#United Kingdom|Quartermaster Sergeant]] in the [[Royal Artillery]] in the [[British Army]], who served in [[France]] at the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He was one of Britain's most successful [[espionage]] agents as a [[prisoner of war]] following his capture by German forces, and, following the war's conclusion, acted as a prosecution witness in trials for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]].

==Prisoner of war==
Before he left England he had been sent on a special course for spies operating in enemy hands. He was told that he would be of more use as a POW than as a combat soldier.

He was captured at [[Dunkirk]] on 29 May 1940 and remained a prisoner of war until 1945. He volunteered to serve at the [[Blechhammer]] POW camp in [[Upper Silesia]], and the fact that he had been a member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] before the war helped him ingratiate himself with the Germans and strike up a relationship with the camp commandant.

In the summer of 1942 a special camp was established to separate potential collaborators from other British POWs, [[Stalag III-D]] near Berlin. This in turn was divided into Special Detachment 999 (an officers' camp) and Special Detachment 517 (for other ranks). Both were presented by the Germans as "holiday camps" away from the poor rations, hard work and cold of normal camps, but the camp security was run by the [[Abwehr]].

Brown was one of the prisoners sent to Freigegeben (Open Prison) Stalag III-D for an initial examination. A former member of the [[British Union of Fascists]], he had developed a good relationship with the Germans, which he exploited to run a very efficient blackmarket operation among the conscripted foreign workers, using some of the profits to buy "luxury" items such as extra food, medicine for the camp hospital and even musical instruments for the camp band. Brown also had a hidden radio so was aware of the course of the war.

At Stalag III-D Brown quickly realised something was wrong, and after his visit he returned to Blechhammer. There he had met Captain [[Julius Green]], a Jewish-Glaswegian officer who was the camp's dentist. Green gave Brown the codes and the means to pass intelligence back to London through [[MI9]]'s Escape and Evasion Network.

Brown decided to return to Stalag III-D as soon as possible; not only were the conditions better, he was suspicious of what the Germans were planning. After a carefully orchestrated row with the senior British NCOs at Blechhammer he persuaded the Commandant, Rittmeister Prinz Von Hohenlohe, to transfer him back to Stalag III-D. He arrived on 12 June 1943 where he was selected by Major Heimpel of the Gestapo to be senior British NCO of Special Detachment 517 based at [[Genshagen]], in the [[Teltow-Fläming]] district of Berlin.

Throughout all this time, while being distrusted by the British P.O.W.s, he was reporting to [[MI6]] by coded letters, giving guidance on targets for bomber attacks. More particularly he was engaged in subverting the German proposal to form a [[British Free Corps]] to fight for Germany. His cohorts included opera singer [[Margery Booth]], a fellow British spy, who on one occasion whilst entertaining the camp inmates sang before Hitler just after Brown had hidden secret documents in her dress; Hitler subsequently sent her red roses wrapped in a [[Swastika]] flag.&lt;ref name=DMail1310484&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: British opera singer turned spy who performed for Hitler with secret documents hidden in her underwear|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1310484/Margery-Booth-British-opera-singer-turned-spy-performed-Hitler.html#ixzz0zA6012B3|publisher=Daily Mail|date=10 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC11258623&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11258623|title=WWII knicker spy Margery Booth photos to be auctioned|publisher=BBC news|date=10 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was instrumental in identifying the British [[traitor]] [[John Amery]], and both Brown and Booth had contact with [[William Joyce]] (Lord Haw-Haw), and were recruited by Joyce as a broadcaster on the German Concordia radio service; both later identified him post war, and were witnesses at his trial.&lt;ref name=DMail1310484/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC11258623/&gt;

At one point Brown was confronted by Major Heimpel with a statement from a traitor giving details of Brown's espionage activities, but Brown blamed it on some of the Jewish inmates, saying they were out to destroy the idea of a British Free Corps. The Germans believed him, but Heimpel still believed that he was a secret agent, and when the British Free Corps were disbanded Himmler ordered Brown's arrest.

As the Allied forces entered Germany, Brown and a friend managed to kill an SS Colonel, steal his car and make contact with [[US Army]] forces. However, once back with British forces he found himself facing a charge of aiding the enemy. Word of his secret work for the Allies soon came from London, and he was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] in recognition of his achievements. After the war he was the chief prosecution witness at 20 treason trials.&lt;ref name=DMail1310484/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC11258623/&gt;

==Later life==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
He wrote of his wartime exploits in a book, ''In Durance Vile'' (Hale 1981), concluding "...I was only able to do what I did because of my Christian belief which sustained me in my durance vile through not only the danger, but the hopeless dreariness of prisoner-of-war life".  

Brown's story is recounted from the perspective of Reg Beattie, one of the members of his team, in the book about Reg's POW diary entitled "Captive Plans".

After working as a businessman in Newcastle, he moved to Dorset, where he died in 1964.

'''Judah Maccabee''' (or '''Judas Maccabeus''', also spelled Machabeus, or Maccabaeus, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''יהודה המכבי''',&lt;ref&gt;The modern Hebrew spelling for Maccabaeus follows a reconstruction based on the Greek name Μακκαβαῖος (the double "kk" being rendered as the Hebrew character ''kaph'' = '''כ'''), while overlooking the more ancient spelling of this name found in the Aramaic [[Scroll of Antiochus]], and where the name is rendered as '''מַקבֵּי'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Yehudah ha-Makabi'') was a [[Jew]]ish priest (''[[kohen]]'') and a son of the priest [[Mattathias]]. He led the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]] (167–160 BCE).

The Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]] ("Dedication") commemorates the restoration of Jewish worship at the temple in Jerusalem in 164 BCE, after Judah Maccabeus removed all of the statues depicting Greek gods and goddesses and purified it. 

==Life==

===Early life===
Judah was the third son of [[Mattathias]] the [[Hasmonean]], a [[Kohen|Jewish priest]] from the village of [[Modiin]]. In 167 BCE Mattathias, together with his sons Judah, [[Eleazar Avaran|Eleazar]], [[Simon Thassi|Simon]], [[John Gaddi|John]], and [[Jonathan Apphus|Jonathan]], started a revolt against the [[Seleucid]] ruler [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], who since 175 BCE had issued decrees that forbade [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious practices. After Mattathias's death in 166 BCE, Judah assumed leadership of the revolt in accordance with the deathbed disposition of his father. The [[First Book of Maccabees]]&lt;ref&gt;Virtually all that is known about Judah Maccabee is contained in the [[Books of the Maccabees]] and in the works of [[Josephus]], largely dependent on this source.&lt;/ref&gt; praises Judah's valor and military talent, suggesting that those qualities made Judah a natural choice for the new commander.

===Origin of Name "The Hammer"===
In the early days of the rebellion, Judah received a surname Maccabee. Several explanations have been put forward for this surname. One suggestion is that the name derives from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''maqqaba'' ("makebet" in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), "hammer" or "sledgehammer" (cf. the cognomen of [[Charles Martel]], the 8th century Frankish leader), in recognition of his ferocity in battle. Others believe it is in reference to his weapon of choice. 

It is also possible that the name Maccabee is an [[acronym]] for the [[Torah]] verse ''Mi kamokha ba'elim Adonai'', "Who among the gods is like you, O Adonai?", his battle-cry to motivate troops. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 15:11). Rabbi Moshe Schreiber writes that it is an acronym for his father's name Mattityahu Kohen Ben Yochanan. Some scholars maintain that the name is a shortened form of the Hebrew ''maqqab-ya ¯hû'' (from  ''na ¯qab'', ‘‘to
mark, to designate’’), meaning ‘‘the one designated by Yahweh.’&lt;ref&gt;NEW CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA, second edition, vol. 9, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Mindful of the superiority of Seleucid forces during the first two years of the revolt, Judah's strategy was to avoid any engagement with their regular army, and to resort to [[guerrilla warfare]], in order to give them a feeling of insecurity. The strategy enabled Judah to win a string of victories. At the [[Battle of Wadi Haramia|battle of Nahal el-Haramiah]] (wadi haramia), he defeated a small Seleucid force under the command of Apollonius, governor of [[Samaria]], who was killed. Judah took possession of Apollonius's sword and used it until his death as a symbol of vengeance. After Nahal el-Haramiah, recruits flocked to the Jewish cause.

===Early victories===
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 152.png|thumb|300px|Judah from ''[[commons:Die Bibel in Bildern|Die Bibel in Bildern]]'']]
Shortly thereafter, Judah [[Battle of Beth Horon (166 BC)|routed a larger Seleucid army]] under the command of Seron near [[Beth-Horon]], largely thanks to a good choice of battlefield. Then in the [[Battle of Emmaus]], Judah proceeded to defeat the Seleucid forces led by generals [[Nicanor (Seleucid general)|Nicanor]] and [[Gorgias (general)|Gorgias]]. This force was dispatched by [[Lysias (Syrian chancellor)|Lysias]], whom Antiochus left as [[viceroy]] after departing on a campaign against the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. By a forced night march, Judah succeeded in eluding Gorgias, who had intended to attack and destroy the Jewish forces in their camp with his cavalry. While Gorgias was searching for him in the mountains, Judah made a surprise attack upon the Seleucid camp and defeated the Seleucids at the [[Battle of Emmaus]]. The Seleucid commander had no alternative but to withdraw to the coast.

The defeat at [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]] convinced Lysias that he must prepare for a serious and prolonged war. He accordingly assembled a new and larger army and marched with it on [[Judea]] from the south via [[Idumea]]. After several years of conflict Judah drove out his foes from Jerusalem, except for the garrison in the citadel of [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]]. He purified the defiled [[Temple of Jerusalem]] and on the 25th of [[Kislev]] (December 14, 164 BCE) restored the service in the Temple. The reconsecration of the Temple became a permanent Jewish holiday, [[Hanukkah]], which continued even after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Temple was destroyed]] in 70 CE. Hanukkah is still celebrated annually. The liberation of Jerusalem was the first step on the road to ultimate independence.

===After Jerusalem===
[[File:Judea Judas Makk.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Judea under Judah Maccabee]]
Upon hearing the news that the Jewish communities in [[Gilead]], [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]], and [[Galilee]] were under attack by neighboring [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek]] cities, Judah immediately went to their aid. Judah sent his brother, Simeon, to Galilee at the head of 3,000 men; Simeon proceeded to successfully fulfill his task, achieving numerous victories and transplanted a substantial portion of the Jewish settlements, including women and children, to Judea. Judah personally led the campaign in Transjordan, taking with him his brother Jonathan. After fierce fighting, he defeated the Transjordanian tribes and rescued the Jews concentrated in fortified towns in Gilead. The Jewish population of the areas taken by the Maccabees was evacuated to Judea.&lt;ref&gt;Galilee, however, does not seem to have been evacuated of its Jewish population, since two generations later, when [[John Hyrcanus]] conquered it, he found it largely inhabited by Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the fighting in Transjordan, Judah turned against the [[Edomites]] in the south, captured and destroyed [[Hebron]] and [[Maresha]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Flavius ''Antiquities of the Jews'' Book 12 Chapter 8 paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He then marched on the coast of the Mediterranean, destroyed the altars and statues of the pagan gods in [[Ashdod]], and returned to Judea with much spoils.

Judah then laid siege to the Seleucid garrison at the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]], the Seleucid citadel of Jerusalem. The besieged, who included not only Syrian-Greek troops but also [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] Jews, appealed for help to Lysias, who effectively became the regent of the young king [[Antiochus V Eupator]] after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes at the end of 164 BCE during the [[Parthia]]n campaign. Lysias together with Eupator set out for a new campaign in Judea. Lysias skirted Judea as he had done in his first campaign, entering it from the south, and besieged [[Beth-Zur]]. Judah raised the siege of the Acra and went to meet Lysias. In the [[Battle of Beth-zechariah]], south of [[Bethlehem]], the Seleucids achieved their first major victory over the Maccabees, and Judah was forced to withdraw to Jerusalem. Beth-Zur was compelled to surrender and Lysias reached Jerusalem, laying siege to the city. The defenders found themselves in a precarious situation because their provisions were exhausted, it being a [[Shmita|sabbatical year]] during which the fields were left uncultivated. However, just as capitulation seemed imminent, Lysias and Eupator had to withdraw when Antiochus Epiphanes's commander-in-chief Philip, whom the late ruler appointed regent before his death, rebelled against Lysias and was about to enter [[Antioch]] and seize power. Lysias decided to propose a peaceful settlement, which was concluded at the end of 163 BCE. The terms of peace were based on the restoration of religious freedom, the permission for the Jews to live in accordance with their own laws, and the official return of the Temple to the Jews. Lysias defeated Philip, only to be overthrown by [[Demetrius I Soter|Demetrius]], son of the late [[Seleucus IV Philopator]]; returned from years as a hostage in Rome. Demetrius appointed Alcimus (Jakim), a Hellenist Jew, as high priest, a choice the Hasidim (Pietists) might have accepted since he was of priestly descent.

===Internal conflict===
[[File:145.Judas Maccabeus before the Army of Nicanor.jpg|thumb|Judas Maccabeus before the army of Nicanor, by Gustave Doré]]
When war against the external enemy came to an end, an internal struggle broke out between the party led by Judah and the Hellenist party. The influence of the Hellenizers all but collapsed in the wake of the Seleucid defeat. The Hellenizing [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]] was removed from office and executed. His successor was another Hellenizer [[Alcimus]]. When Alcimus executed sixty priests who were opposed to him, he found himself in open conflict with the Maccabees. Alcimus fled from Jerusalem and went to the Seleucid king, asking for help.

Meanwhile, [[Demetrius I Soter]], son of [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] and nephew of the late Antiochus IV Epiphanes, fled from Rome in defiance of the [[Roman Senate]], arrived in Syria. Declaring himself the rightful king, he captured and killed Lysias and Antiochus Eupator, taking the throne. It was thus Demetrius to whom the delegation led by Alcimus, complained of the persecution of the Hellenist party in Judea. Demetrius granted Alcimus's request to be appointed High Priest under the protection of the king's army and sent to Judea an army led by [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]]. The weaker Jewish army couldn't oppose the enemy and withdrew from Jerusalem, so Judah returned to wage guerrilla warfare. Soon after, it was necessary for the Seleucid Army to return to [[Antioch]] because of the turbulent political situation. Judah's forces returned to Jerusalem and the Seleucids dispatched another army, again led by Nicanor. In a [[Battle of Adasa|battle near Adasa]], on the 13th [[Adar]] 161 BCE, the Seleucid army was destroyed and Nicanor was killed. The annual "Day of Nicanor" was instituted to commemorate this victory.

===The Agreement with Rome and the Death of Judas Maccabeus===

[[File:José Teófilo de Jesus - A morte de Judas Macabeu.jpg|thumb|''Death of Judas Maccabeus'' by José Teófilo de Jesus]]

The [[Roman-Jewish Treaty]] was an agreement made between Judah Maccabee and the [[Roman Republic]] in 161 BCE according to {{Bibleverse|1|Maccabees|8:17-20|NRSV}} and [[Josephus]]. It was the first recorded contract between the [[Jewish]] people and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

The agreement with Rome failed to have any effect on Demetrius' policy. On receipt of the news of Nicanor's defeat, he dispatched a new army, again commanded by Bacchides. This time the Seleucid forces of 20,000 men were numerically so superior that most of Judah's men left the field of battle and advised their leader to do likewise and to await a more favorable opportunity. However, Judah decided to stand his ground.

In the [[Battle of Elasa]], Judah and those who remained faithful to him were killed. His body was taken by his brothers from the battlefield and buried in the family sepulchre at [[Modiin]]. The death of Judah Maccabee (d. 160 BCE) stirred the Jews to renewed resistance. After several additional years of war under the leadership of two of Mattathias' other sons (Jonathan and Simon), the Jews finally achieved independence and the liberty to worship freely.

==In the arts==

===Pre-19th century===
As warrior hero and national liberator, Judah Maccabee has inspired many writers, and several artists and composers. In [[the Divine Comedy]], [[Dante]] sees his spirit in the Heaven of Mars with the other "heroes of the true faith". In [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Love's Labour's Lost]], he is enacted along with the other [[Nine Worthies]], but heckled for sharing a name with [[Judas Iscariot]]. Most significant works dedicated solely to him date from the 17th century onwards. William Houghton's ''Judas Maccabaeus'', performed in about 1601 but now lost, is thought to have been the first drama on the theme; however,  ''Judas Macabeo,'' an early ''comedia'' by crucial Spanish playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca is extant. Fernando Rodríguez-Gallego details its history in his critical edition: the play was performed in the 1620s in different versions and finally published as part of an anthology by Vera Tassis in 1637. Following on its heels is ''El Macabeo'' ([[Naples]], 1638), a [[Spanish language|Castilian]] epic by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Marrano]] Miguel de Silveyra. Two other 17th century works are ''La chevalerie de Judas Macabé'' by French poet [[Pierre du Ryer]] (c. 1600–1658) and the anonymous neo-Latin work ''Judas Machabaeus'' (Rome, 1695). [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] wrote his [[Judas Maccabaeus (Handel)|''Judas Maccabaeus'' oratorio]] (1746) on the subject.

===19th century===
There has been interest in Judah in every century. ''Giuda Macabeo, ossia la morte di Nicanore...'' (1839), is an Italian "azione sacra" based on which Vallicella composed an [[oratorio]]. One of the best-known literary works on the theme is ''Judas Maccabaeus'' (1872), a five-act verse tragedy by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. A Hebrew version of Longfellow's play was published in 1900. Two later 19th-century interpretations of the story are ''Judas Makkabaeus'', a novella by the German writer Josef Eduard Konrad Bischoff, which appeared in ''Der Gefangene von Kuestrin'' (1885), and ''The Hammer'' (1890), a book by Alfred J. Church and Richmond Seeley.

===20th century===
Several 20th-century Jewish authors have also written works devoted to Judah Maccabee and the Maccabeean Revolt. Jacob Benjamin Katznelson (1855–1930) wrote the poem, "Alilot Gibbor ha-Yehudim Yehudah ha-Makkabi le-Veit ha-Hashmona'im" (1922); the [[Yiddish]] writer Moses Schulstein wrote the dramatic poem, "Yehudah ha-Makkabi" (in ''A Layter tsu der Zun'', 1954); Jacob Fichmann's "Yehudah ha-Makkabi" is one of the heroic tales included in ''Sippurim le-Mofet'' (1954). Amit Arad's historical novel "Lions of Judea - The miraculous story of the Maccabees" (2014). Many children's plays have also been written on the theme by various Jewish authors.

In addition, the American writer [[Howard Fast]] penned the [[historical fiction|historical novel]], ''[[My Glorious Brothers]]'', which was published in 1948, during the [[Israeli War of Independence]].

During World War II the Swiss-German writer Karl Boxler published his novel ''Judas Makkabaeus; ein Kleinvolk kaempft um Glaube und Heimat'' (1943), the subtitle of which suggests that Swiss democrats then drew a parallel between their own national hero, [[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]], and the leader of the Maccabean revolt against foreign tyranny.

The modern play ''Playing Dreidel with Judah Maccabee'' by [[Edward Einhorn]] is about a contemporary boy who meets the historical figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwbooks/article/Theater-61-Press-Presents-Playing-Dreidel-with-Judah-Maccabee-20110809 Broadway World: Theater 61 Press Presents Playing Dreidel with Judah Maccabee]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Christianity|Christian]] art, Judah Maccabee was regarded as one of the heroes of the [[Old Testament]]. He figures in a tenth-century illustrated manuscript ''Libri Maccabaeorum''. The late medieval French artist [[Jean Fouquet]] painted an illustration of Judah triumphing over his enemies for his famous manuscript of Josephus. [[Rubens]] painted Judah Maccabee praying for the dead; the painting illustrates an episode from 2 Maccabees 12:39–48 in which Judah's troops find stolen idolatrous charms on the corpses of Jewish warriors slain on the battlefield. He therefore offers prayers and an expiatory sacrifice for these warriors who have died in a state of sin. During the [[Counter-Reformation]] the passage was used by [[Catholicism|Catholics]] against [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in order to justify the doctrine of [[purgatory]]. Accordingly, Rubens painted the scene for the Chapel of the Dead in [[Tournai]] cathedral. In the 19th century, Paul Gustave Doré executed an engraving of Judah Maccabee victoriously pursuing the shattered troops of the Syrian enemy.

===Music===
In music, almost all the compositions inspired by the Hasmonean rebellion revolve around Judah. In 1746, the composer [[George Frideric Handel]] composed his [[oratorio]] ''[[Judas Maccabaeus (oratorio)|Judas Maccabeus]],'' putting the biblical story in the context of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. This work, with libretto by [[Thomas Morell]], had been written for the celebrations following the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]'s victory over the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebels at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The oratorio's most famous chorus is "See, the conqu'ring hero comes". The tune of this chorus was later adopted as a [[Christian]] [[Easter]] hymn tune ''Thine Be The Glory, Risen Conquering Son''. A Hebrew translation of Handel's ''Judas Maccabaeus'' was prepared for the 1932 [[Maccabiah Games]] and is now popular in [[Israel]] with the motif of "conqu'ring hero" becoming a [[Hanukkah]] song. [[Beethoven]] composed a set of theme and variations 12 Variations on 'See the conqu'ring hero comes' for Cello and Piano, WoO 45.

[[Tom Lehrer]] refers to Judas Maccabeus in his song "Hanukkah in Santa Monica".

[[Mirah]] refers to Judah Maccabee in her song "Jerusalem".

In "[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]] Mixtape", a parody song is named "Judah Macabee".

The '''magpie goose''' (''Anseranas semipalmata'') is the sole living representative [[species]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Anseranatidae]]. This common [[waterbird]] is found in northern [[Australia]] and southern [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=HBW&gt;{{cite book| author=Carboneras, C. | title=Magpie Goose | editor1=del Hoyo, J. | editor2=Elliott, A. | editor3=Sargatal, J. | year=1992 | work=Handbook of the Birds of the World | volume=1 | publisher=Lynx Edicions | pages=574–575 | isbn=84-87334-10-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the species is prone to wandering, especially when not breeding, it is sometimes recorded outside its core range.&lt;ref name=HBW/&gt; The species was once also widespread in southern Australia, but disappeared from there largely due to the drainage of the wetlands where the birds once bred. The Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land know this bird as Manimanuk.  It became an important food item with the formation of wetlands about 1500 ya, and is depicted in rock art from this period.  Mimi figures are often shown holding goose-feather fans (Goodfellow &amp; Stott, 2001; 2005).

==Description==
Magpie geese are unmistakable birds with their black and white plumage and yellowish legs. The feet are only partially webbed, and the magpie goose feeds on vegetable matter in the water, as well as on land. Males are larger than females. Unlike true [[anserinae|geese]], their [[moult]] is gradual, so no flightless period results. Their voice is a loud honking.

==Systematics and evolution==
This species is placed in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Anseriformes]], having the characteristic bill structure, but is considered to be distinct from the other species in this [[taxon]]. The related and extant families, [[Anhimidae]] ([[screamer]]s) and [[Anatidae]] ([[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], and [[swan]]s), contain all the other taxa. The magpie goose is contained in the genus ''Anseranas'' and family Anseranatidae, which are [[monotypic]] now.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

[[File:Magpie Goose taking off.jpg|thumb|left]]
A cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese, and swans.&lt;ref name=auk/&gt;

This family is quite old, a [[living fossil]], having apparently diverged before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] — the relative ''[[Vegavis iaai]]'' lived some 68-67 million years ago. The [[fossil]] record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus ''[[Anatalavis]]'' ([[Hornerstown Formation|Hornerstown]] [[Late Cretaceous]] or [[Early Paleocene]] of New Jersey, USA - [[London Clay]] [[Early Eocene]] of [[Walton-on-the-Naze]], England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known anseranatid. Other [[Paleogene]] birds sometimes considered magpie-geese are the genera ''[[Geranopsis]]'' from the [[Hordwell Formation]] [[Late Eocene]] to the [[Early Oligocene]] of England&lt;!-- BullAMNH151:1 --&gt; and ''[[Anserpica]]'' from the [[Late Oligocene]] of [[Billy, Allier|Billy]]-[[Créchy]] ([[France]]).&lt;ref name=Hugueney/&gt; The earliest known member of the group in Australia is an unnamed species represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland. Additional fossils from North America and Europe suggest that the family was spread across the globe during the late Paleogene period.&lt;ref name=Worthy/&gt; The Australian distribution of the living species ties in well with the presumed [[Gondwana]]n origin of [[Anseriformes]], but Northern Hemisphere fossils are puzzling. Perhaps the magpie geese were one of the dominant groups of Paleogene waterfowl, only to become largely extinct later.{{Original research inline|date=June 2015}}

==Ecology and status==
[[File:Magpie Geese June09 02.jpg|thumb|Magpie goose colony at [[Serendip Sanctuary]]]]
[[File:Anseranas semipalmata MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.13.8.jpg|thumb| ''Anseranas semipalmata'' - [[MHNT]]]]
The magpie goose is found in a variety of open [[wetland]] areas such as [[floodplain]]s and [[swamp]]s. It is fairly sedentary apart from some movement during the dry season. They are colonial breeders and are gregarious outside of the breeding season when they can form large and noisy flocks of up to a few thousand individuals. Its nest is on the ground, and a typical [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is 5-14 eggs. Some males mate with two females, all of which raise the young, unlike some other polygamous birds. This may be beneficial when predation of young is high as chicks raised by trios are more likely to survive.

This species is plentiful across its range, although this is significantly reduced in comparison to the range at time of European settlement. The range once extended as far south as the Coorong and the wetlands of the southeast of South Australia and Western Victoria. For Australia as a whole, it is not threatened and has a controlled hunting season when numbers are large. However, most of the southern populations were extirpated in the mid-20th century by [[overhunting]] and [[habitat destruction]]. The species has been subject to [[reintroduction]] projects such as [[Bool Lagoon]] between Penola and Naracoorte. Populations in more northern areas have again reached a level where it can be regularly utilized by hunters, although not in the example provided. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the magpie goose was listed as [[near threatened]] on the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria.&lt;ref name=VDSE2007a/&gt; In the December 2007 [[Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act]] list of threatened fauna, it is also listed.&lt;ref&gt;The FFGA list does not distinguish different threat categories.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VDSE2007c/&gt; As of early 2008, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species had not been prepared.&lt;ref name=VDSE2007b/&gt; 

With the advent of climate change, and more frequent seawater inundations of the current extensive freshwater floodplains, [[CSIRO]] scientists argue that Magpie geese populations may be at risk.&lt;ref name=ecos&gt;[https://blogs.csiro.au/ecos/magpie-geese/?utm_source=ECOS-2018-11&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ECOS ECOS: Indigenous icon at risk from sea level rise.] Blogs, [[CSIRO]].

'''Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek''' (July 17, 1990 – June 22, 2004), known as '''Mattie J.T. Stepanek''', was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] (or as he wanted to be remembered as "a poet, a peacemaker, and a philosopher who played")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/us/mattie-stepanek-13-poet-and-inspiration.html |newspaper=NY Times/Associated Press| title=Mattie Stepanek, 13 - Poet and Inspiration| date=23 June 2004 |accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published seven [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best-selling]] books of poetry and peace essays. Before his death (at the age of 13) he had become known as a peace advocate and motivational speaker.

==Life and career==
Matthew Stepanek was born on July 17, 1990. Stepanek's parents divorced when he was a child.&lt;ref name="archive.azcentral.com"&gt;http://archive.azcentral.com/families/articles/0710muscular0711.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in Upper Marlboro, Maryland and later lived in Rockville, Maryland.&lt;ref name="LA Times-Mattie"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/24/local/me-mattie24 |newspaper=LA Times |title=Matthew 'Mattie' Stepanek, 13; Poet, Peacemaker |first=Myrna | last=Oliver |date=24 June 2004 |accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hero was former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], who described Stepanek as "the most extraordinary person whom I have ever known".&lt;ref name="LA Times-Mattie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/mattie-stepanek-singer-of-heartsongs/2416/#sthash.jgrrKl5A.dpuf.|publisher=Legacy.com| title=Mattie Stepanek, Singer of Heartsongs| accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/inspirational-boy-meets-hero-5354519&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0204/17/lkl.00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Stepanek suffered from a rare disorder, [[dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy]]. His three older siblings died from dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, too. The condition was unknown until his mother was diagnosed with [[mitochondrial disease]] in 1992, after all four of the children had been born.&lt;ref name="archive.azcentral.com"/&gt;

Stepanek was a poet and speaker, penning six volumes of bestselling Heartsongs poetry books, and a collection of peace essays that also became a bestseller. He was the lyricist for [[Music Through Heartsongs: Songs Based on the Poems of Mattie J.T. Stepanek|Music Through Heartsongs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-through-heartsongs-songs-based-on-the-poems-of-mattie-jt-stepanek-mw0000024245 |publisher=AllMusic.com | title=Review - Heartsongs by Billy Gilman|accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was produced by [[Sony]], was released in 2003 and performed by [[Billy Gilman]], and which debuted at number 109 on the [[Billboard 200]] and at number 15 on [[Hot Country Songs]].

===Death===
Stepanek died at age 13 at [[Children's National Medical Center]] in Washington, D.C., on June 22, 2004. He was interred at [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12554-2004Jun28.html|last=Johnson|first=Darragh|title=Celebrating the Courage of Mattie|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Shortly after Stepanek's death in 2004, the non-profit Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation was established by a group of citizens in Rockville, Maryland where he lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.mattieonline.com/?page_id=8477|website=The Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[We Are Family Foundation]] hosted the first annual international Three Dot Dash 'Just Peace Summit' based on the message Stepanek offered in his book "Just Peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.youthaward.org/partners/three-dot-dash | publisher=Youth Award | title=Partners - Three Dot Dash | accessdate=18 Oct 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141019010349/http://www.youthaward.org/partners/three-dot-dash | archivedate=2014-10-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2008, the Mattie J.T Stepanek Park was dedicated in [[Rockville, Maryland]] at an event attended by [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Billy Gilman]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/In-Memory-of-Mattie-Stepanek/3 |publisher=Oprah.com |title=In Memory of Mattie Stepanek, p. 3| accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pepper Choplin set words from Stepanek's final peace speech to music, and a 100-voice choir performed the debut of "Look Up Way Down". Central to the park is the "Peace Garden", which was designed based on the peace imagery Stepanek used in his essay book, ''Just Peace: A Message of Hope''. In the Peace Garden there is a life-size bronze statue of Stepanek and his service dog, Micah, surrounded by chess tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/In-Memory-of-Mattie-Stepanek/2 |publisher=Oprah.com|title=In Memory of Mattie Stepanek, p. 2| accessdate=18 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the park are quotes and soundbites from Stepanek.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On September 21, 2012, the Feast of St. Matthew the Apostle, the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Guild was officially initiated. The purpose of the Guild is to gather information and investigate Stepanek's life for the possible Cause of Canonization in the Catholic Church. In 2013, the National Catholic Partnership on Disability posthumously honored Stepanek with the Youth/Young Adult Leadership Award. On June 22, 2014, a Memorial Mass at the Franciscan Monastery in Washington, DC commemorated Stepanek's ten year death anniversary. It was con-celebrated by several priests from the Archdiocese of Washington, DC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

At the behest of the Mattie J.T. Stepanek Foundation, in 2013, [[Barbara Mikulski]], a [[United States Senator]] from Maryland, sent a letter to US President Barack Obama, wanting to declare July 17 (Stepanek's birthday) a national peace day in Stepanek's honor. In July 2014, [[Ben Cardin]], a [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] United States Senator from Maryland, joined Mikulski in introducing a House Resolution (#509), which was approved by the Senate and honors Stepanek's life and peace legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resolution Honoring Life Of Marylander Mattie Stepanek|url=https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-mikulski-applaud-senate-passage-of-resolution-honoring-life-of-marylander-mattie-stepanek|accessdate=12 March 2017|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.Res.509 - A resolution honoring the extraordinary and courageous life of Mattie Stepanek.|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-resolution/509/text|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the City of Rockville, Maryland voted to declare Mattie's July 17 birthday as "Peace Day" at a local level in perpetua, as a statement of support for the National Peace Day Campaign.

{{nihongo|'''''Mermaid Saga'''''|人魚シリーズ|Ningyo Shirīzu|lead=yes}} is a series of [[manga]] graphic novels in three volumes by [[Rumiko Takahashi]]. Two of the stories from the series, '''''Mermaid's Forest''''' and '''''Mermaid's Scar''''', have been adapted as [[anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]]s, and all of the tales, except one, were later produced as an [[anime]] television series.

==Plot==
According to an ancient Japanese legend, [[mermaid]] flesh may grant immortality if eaten. However, there is a much greater chance that consumption will lead to death or transformation into a damned creature known as a Lost Soul (or Deformed Ones in the English dub). Mermaid Saga tells the tale of Yuta, an immortal who has been alive for five hundred years. Throughout the series, he wanders across Japan searching for a cure and meets others whose lives have also been ruined by mermaid flesh.

==Characters==
''Note: In some cases a character is portrayed by a different [[voice actor]] in the [[OVA]]s. These voice actors are also added.''

===Main characters===
;{{nihongo|Yuta|湧太|Yūta}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Kōichi Yamadera]]|[[Justin Gross]] and [[Liam O'Brien]]}}
:''Mermaid Forest OVA'' {{Voiced by|[[Michael Magee]]}} (English)
:''Mermaid's Scar OVA'' {{Voiced by|[[Jason Gray-Stanford]]}} (English)
:As a [[main character]] of the series, Yuta is a 500-year-old immortal. He had eaten the flesh of a mermaid out of curiosity when his fellow fishermen had captured one, but out of all the fishermen who ate a piece, only Yuta survived. His comrades had either been poisoned or turned into Deformed Ones. Yuta was afraid that he would eventually meet the same fate. When nothing happens to him he forgets about ever eating the mermaid's flesh. He takes a wife and lives normally until he discovers that while she grew older as the years went by, he had not aged physically since the day he ate the flesh.  He hears that a mermaid will be able to help him turn normal again, so he begins his endless travel in search of a way to become mortal. Along his travels, he meets a lovely fifteen-year-old girl named Mana, another immortal. He rescues Mana from mermaids who were planning to devour her and take on her youthful appearance, and she joins him as a traveling companion. Kind-hearted and helpful, Yuta has befriended many people who are affiliated with the mermaid's flesh over 500 years, and tried to help them from its curse.

:''Mermaid's Scar OVA'' {{Voiced by|Lalainia Lindbjerg}} (English)
:The female [[protagonist]] of the series, she is an immortal and Yuta's companion. She was raised by a group of old women who kept her captive and incapacitated in a hut. In reality, they were mermaids who consumed human flesh in order to regain their youth, and they planned to eat her once she reached adolescence. She travels with Yuta after he rescues her, and possesses a large sense of loyalty and feelings towards him, but due to her somewhat naïve and spoiled nature, she does not seem to truly realize her emotions towards him may be love, or even simple affection (even where Yuta stated she might have been jealous, she does not understand what that word means, mistaking the pronunciation for [[Jell-O|jellosy]] and asking if it tastes good). She is fifteen when she gains immortality at the beginning of the series.

===Other characters===
;{{nihongo|Masato|真人|Masato}}
:[[File:MermaidScar.jpg|thumb|right|Masato in ''Mermaid's Scar''.]]
:{{Voiced by|[[Makiko Ohmoto]]|[[Erika Weinstein]]}}
:''Mermaid's Scar OVA'' ''Voiced by:'' [[Yuuichi Harada]] (Japanese), Chris Turner (English)
:A young boy who has been immortal for eight hundred years. He has a face of an angel, but the soul of a devil. Despite his childlike appearance, eight hundred years of loneliness and wandering have turned Masato into a cruel and heartless monster. His first victim to whom he fed mermaid flesh was his original mother eight hundred years ago, who became a Lost Soul. After one hundred years of being adopted by various people and losing them to famine, disease, and war, the boy decides to end this cycle of loneliness and try mermaid flesh again. For the next seven hundred years to come, he would patiently give mermaid flesh to a woman, and have her pose as his mother until she was deemed useless, not caring if they turn into monsters or die from poison, and knowing that he would one day find a true immortal companion. He acquired a [[Nambu pistol]] from [[World War II]], which he used in his battle against Yuta. In the OVA, it is revealed that his latest mother figure, Misa, gave him the name Masato. He found her during World War II after she had lost her real son in an [[airstrike|air-raid]]; he continuously pursued her when she attempted to flee after growing weary of living with him. Sixty years later, Yuta and Mana came across Misa and Masato, and after Misa began losing her regenerative powers, Masato set his sights on making his nanny, Yukie, as his new mother-figure. Yukie turned into a Lost Soul, and Masato turned his sights on Mana. However, after seeing how Mana was devoted to Yuta and brutally attacked Masato for it, the 800-year-old boy gave her up for being a "horrible girl", and set the mansion on fire in an attempt to burn the two to death. He took Misa's car and fled, but plowed right into a truck (off a cliff in the OVA), and was thought to have perished. However, since his corpse was not found, it was implied that he was still out there searching for another mother. Masato is the only character in the entire series known to have lived longer than Yuta, a fact that shocked and horrified Yuta when he tried (unsuccessfully) to use his own 500 years to intimidate Masato. Although Masato did not feel anything regarding his role in Yukie's death, he did shed a tear for Misa's death before leaving.

;{{nihongo|Misa|美沙|Misa}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Rei Sakuma]]|Gina Grad}}
:''Mermaid's Scar OVA'' {{Voiced by|[[Gara Takashima]]}} (Japanese), [[Janyse Jaud]] (English)
:She lost her husband and child during [[World War II]], and nearly died herself when she met a little boy who offered her a strange piece of meat. The child was Masato and the meat mermaid flesh. At first Misa was happy to have a new child in her life, but she grew afraid of the fact that neither were aging, and became terrified of what Masato was capable of. After escaping from him five years ago, she was taken in by an old man whom she later married. About one month ago, the two were in a boating accident and Misa was thought dead until a week later when she appeared with no wounds. Masato tracked her down and forced her to continue to act as his mother figure. She, in turn, tried to take the mermaid flesh from him to prevent him from feeding anyone else it, but to no avail. Misa failed to become a full-fledged immortal, as the mermaid flesh's effect began to wear off, and her healing powers were getting slower and weaker. Masato then simply told her that he would find a replacement. She eventually died after being attacked by a Lost Soul which was formerly Masato's nanny, Yukie. Masato shed a tear for her demise before departing.

;{{nihongo|Yukie|雪枝|Yukie}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Chieko Honda]]|[[Hunter Mackenzie Austin]]}}
:''Mermaid's Scar OVA'' {{Voiced by|[[Kikuko Inoue]]}} (Japanese), [[Kathleen Barr]] (English)
:Masato's nanny. She is loving and caring and an excellent choice for Masato to choose as his new mother. Yukie does not know anything about Masato's immortality and Misa's dreadful past when she became an immortal. Later in the story, Yukie got engaged, but worries that she might leave Masato forever. To prevent her from leaving, Masato gives Yukie a piece of meat in which it turns out to be mermaid's flesh and then she eats it. She did not become an immortal, however: she transformed into a Lost Soul. After Yuta kills the monster, he discovers that it is Yukie who ate the mermaid flesh by finding her ring lying on the floor. Masato, being so detached from humanity for so long, did not feel anything for destroying Yukie despite her kindness. Yuta possesses Yukie's ring during his travels to help him remember Yukie as his friend (in Mermaid Scar OVA, he throws the ring to the ocean in the end).

;{{nihongo|Rin|鱗|Rin}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Houko Kuwashima]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}
:She is a daughter of Toba Island's headman, but due to the headman's sickness, Rin has to take over his leadership. Rin has been searching for a mermaid to cure her father. By that time, she meets Yuta when he came back to life after dying in a terrible battle he was in. Rin and Yuta fell in love with each other and Yuta promised to stay in Toba Island if he could turn back into a mortal. Isago wounded Rin's father to force Rin and Yuta to go hunting for a mermaid. They catch one but the Sakagami Islanders kill Yuta and capture Rin. In the end, Rin and Yuta learned that Isago is a mermaid. Yuta decides to leave Toba Island because he does not want to marry another mortal girl while he is immortal. Rin continues her father's leadership.

;{{nihongo|Isago|砂|Isago}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Orikasa]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}
:A wife of the Sakagami Island headman. Isago told her husband of the immortality of the mermaid's flesh and encouraged him to find one. Isago is pregnant from her former husband who was murdered by the Sakagami pirates three years earlier. In order to give birth to a healthy child, Isago needs to eat the mermaid flesh, because she is in fact a mermaid. She tells Rin that there are mermaids who can walk on land and mermaids who swim at sea. The ones who walk on land eat the swimming mermaids' flesh, especially during pregnancy. Isago finally ate mermaid flesh, dived into the ocean, transformed back into a mermaid, and gave birth to two healthy babies.

;{{nihongo|Towa Kannagi|神無木 登和|Kannagi Towa}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Sumi Shimamoto]]|[[Erica Shaffer]]}}
:''Mermaid Forest OVA'' {{Voiced by|[[Mika Doi]]|Kata Sheridan}}
:She was Dr. Shiina's fiancée. She suffered from a deadly illness when she was a young girl, so Towa's twin sister Sawa fed her the blood of a mermaid. The blood cured her illness, but her arm deformed that of a Lost Soul's and her hair turned pure white. While she did not age on the outside, her insides continued to age at the same rate as a mortal's. When Towa's father learned of what Sawa did to her, he had Towa locked up in a cell underneath the house and never allowed her to come out. Sawa lived a normal life: She wed and had a child while Towa lived alone with no visitors except for Shiina. Her deformed arm caused her terrible pain, so she asked Dr. Shiina to cut off the arms of dead girls and re-attach them onto her. But after a few years every arm also became deformed and the pain came back. After their father died, Sawa released Towa from her cell. Towa threatens to replace her body with Mana's unless Sawa reveals where Mermaid Hill is. Once Towa found the mermaid, she tries to force Sawa to eat its flesh to fulfill her revenge, but Sawa dies of a [[cardiac arrest|heart attack]]. Robbed of her revenge, Towa joins her sister in death and asks them to burn Mermaid Hill and everything associated with it.

:Towa's twin sister who inherited the family line and thus was placed in charge of guarding Mermaid Hill. When Towa was dying, she fed her the blood of a mermaid. Towa recovered from her illness, but her arm became deformed and her hair turned completely white. As years pass, Sawa is married and gives birth to a child, but her husband dies fighting in [[World War II]]. Her child and father died sometime after that. Sawa reluctantly reveals the location of Mermaid Hill after Towa threatens to kill Mana. Upon arrival, Towa tries to force her to eat the mermaid's flesh. But Sawa suddenly dies of a cardiac arrest. Her body is apparently burned in Mermaid Hill.

;{{nihongo|Dr. Shiina|椎名|Shiina}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Eisuke Yoda]]|[[Michael Forest]]}}
:''Mermaid Forest OVA'' Voiced by Bob Foster (English)
:Towa Kannagi's fiancé. Shiina begged Towa many times to leave with him and go somewhere else, but she always refused telling him that there was something she must do. However, Towa did ask him to cut off the arms of dead girls and replace her deformed arm, which he agreed to. Shiina recounts to Yuta and Mana his history with Towa and how she would never look his way but was always fixed on her "other self" (in the OVA, after Towa ran into the burning Mermaid Hill to end her life of revenge, Shiina chased after her to join her in death, making up for fifty-five years of lost time).

;{{nihongo|Big Eyes|大眼|Ōmanako}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Gōri]]|[[Kyle Hebert]]}}
:He was once a mortal, but he ate the flesh of a mermaid corpse he found lying on the beach in the hopes that he would gain immortality. When he woke up, he saw that his village has been destroyed and everyone - including his family - had been murdered. The flesh had transformed him into a Lost Soul, though not fully as he can speak and has human feelings. He had apparently lost control of himself after transforming and done the deed himself. The transformation had caused his eyes to swell so he was called "Big Eyes" from then on. He is without company for a long time until Mana came along. He finds her just reviving next to a dead Yuta at the bottom of a cliff they fell from. He takes her to his cave and feeds her after she wakes up. He wants Mana to stay with him for company as she is the first person to treat him kindly since his transformation. Upon finding Mana and Big Eyes, a hunter who lost his left eye to Big Eyes 40 years ago attacks him. The attack causes Big Eyes to lose control of himself and revert to his Lost Soul side. Mana tries to protect him, but Yuta and the hunter have no choice but to kill him in the end. As he lay dying, he calls out Mana's name with his last breath. Yuta tells her that this shows Big Eyes died as a human.

;{{nihongo|Natsume|なつめ|Natsume}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Kazuko Sugiyama]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}
:She died as a young girl during the [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]]. A [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]] found her father mourning the loss of his only daughter. Pitying the man, the monk attempted to resurrect Natsume with an ancient art called "Hangon". Even though he was inexperienced, the monk used mermaid's liver in the process. Using a mermaid's liver for Hangon not only brought Natsume back to life, but also granted her immortality. However, it also caused her to eat the livers of animals and even humans. Many decades later, Yuta meets Natsume while he is questing to find a mermaid. He also meets the monk who has decided to return Natsume to bones. When Yuta meets the monk, he agrees that he'll try to help the situation, but Natsume befriends Yuta and asks if she can come with Yuta on his journey. But her father became angry at this and tries to kill Yuta to prevent Natsume from leaving him. With her father dealing with Yuta, Natsume is now unprotected from the monk, who is able to rip out her liver. Natsume saves Yuta from getting killed, but her father jumps from a cliff with her in his arms. Her father died from the fall, but Natsume was able to live a little bit longer. She tells Yuta a good-bye and she says that she'll always be with him in his journey, and then she returns to bones.

;{{nihongo|Nanao|七生|Nanao}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Toshiko Fujita]]|[[Christopher Corey Smith|Chris Kent]]}}
:''Young'' {{Voiced by|[[Jay D. Stone]]}} (English)
:A young boy who seems to be a kidnapping victim. Yuta and Mana found him terribly injured when he escape from the moving car. Nanao swallows his mother's medicine and suddenly, his wounds healed fast. Yuta and Mana takes Nanao home where they meets his mother and grandmother. Nanao's grandmother is behaving strangely and tells Yuta and Mana that they should not bring Nanao back home. She then shows them a picture of the boy and his mother. Yuta looks at the woman's face and said that this woman is different from Nanao's mother and the boy is very different from Nanao. By that time, Yuta discovers that man who kidnapped Nanao is actually Nanao's father, who is also named Nanao. Nanao's "mother" is actually Nanao's grandmother who became an immortal 25 years ago and plans to feed the mermaid's flesh to him. The medicine Nanao's mother gave him is actually mermaid's ashes to build up his immunity to the mermaid flesh. Nanao is about to eat the flesh but stopped by Yuta and Mana while Nanao's mother did not have the strength to stop him from eating it. Nanao's mother then leaves Nanao's father her gift and the boy back and went off to the world. Nanao so far still had no clue that his "mother" was really his grandmother, or at least that he was kidnapped and was reluctant to accept his father. His birth mother is never mentioned, she either died, divorced his father or gave up when he had been kidnapped.

;{{nihongo|Nanao's mother|七生の母|Nanao no haha}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Masako Katsuki]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}
:She became an immortal in 1969 after her divorce with her husband and about to be separated with her son, Nanao. There were hints that she may have been mentally ill and the boy was forced to choose his father; fearing his safety. She fed her son mermaid flesh and she ate it, but Nanao spit out the flesh and left him scarred. However, Nanao's mother became an immortal, but she has a scar on her face, making her feel the pain for all eternal. Years pass, she sees her son all grown up, got married, and has a baby son. With the baby as a reminder, she kidnaps the baby, naming him Nanao and raising him as her own son. By that time, she saw a dead woman lying on the beach, replacing her face into another's, making her look like a different person and hide away the scar and she lived in almost constant pain. Though she apparently loved both her son and grandson; whether it is her mentality or her desperation. She still refused to let her real son see his. And when the real Nanao begged for his son back, she pushed her own son off a cliff with no sign of guilt or remorse. When she met Yuta and Mana when they bring "Nanao" back home, "Nanao"'s grandmother showed them a photograph with a woman and her son. Both "Nanao" and his mother are much different. They have learned that "Nanao"'s mother has fed him mermaid ashes all along, but they're not sure why. Yuta and Mana learns that the two people are the same person who switches faces. "Nanao" is her grandson as a replace of her real son, who is also named Nanao. She plans to feed the mermaid flesh to her grandson. Though remembering her son's experience, she was hesitant but still urged him to eat the flesh. Mana and Yuta stopped them both just barely in time.  She finally gives up her gift from her real son and gives him back the boy. Her body was found at a warehouse that was apparently set on fire.

:{{Voiced by|[[Yuri Amano]]|[[Karen Strassman]]}}
:She met Yuta years before [[World War II]]. When she learned about Yuta's curse of immortality, she tells him a secret about mermaid's ashes. She spread the ashes all around the field of red flowers, causing to bloom all year long, never to wilt or die by season, including winter. She calls the field "red valley". Soon, she and Yuta fell in love and began meeting in the red valley in private. Her fiancée, Eijiro, got jealous of Yuta falling for Nae, but never believed that she would betray him. He learned about Nae's signal of meeting Yuta in the red valley, so he went there to meet her. When she arrived at the valley, Eijiro became shocked of her betrayal that he strangled her to death. As years pass, Eijiro though he felt guilty, he never told anyone he had murdered. When he learned of the mermaid ashes, he vowed to use it to bring her back and keep her for himself. He eventually found the ashes and uses them to bring her back to life, but she became a shadow of her former self. While Nae and Yuta recounted how the nun became a violent murderous demon. She only seemed to go into a trance when threatened or hears noises that apparently reminds her of her death. It is hinted that Nae may have spent most of her time, trying to go to the valley to see Yuta. But Eijiro prevented her every time. When Yuta and Mana return to what was once the village, Mana causes Nae to remember remnants of her past; including the promise to meet Yuta again. Though Eijiro and his men try many times to stop her and kill Mana, the two eventually make their way to the red valley. When separated from Mana, she remembers her death and how Yuta never came. She at first looked ready to kill Yuta. But as Yuta and Nae reunite once again, she returns to her old self. She tells Yuta that she is having a nightmare. Then Yuta remembers that there is a village legend that a priestess came to the village, carrying a jar of mermaid ashes. And then a man murdered the priestess, but the ashes went into her mouth, brought her back to life as a shadow, but then wears as she went to the mountains as her deathbed. Nae's affect of the ashes wears off, left her to die once again in the red valley as her deathbed.

:''Young'' {{Voiced by|[[Yasunori Matsumoto]]|[[Travis Willingham]]}}
:Before World War II, Eijiro was a young, bright man who fell in love with Nae Kogure, who is from a wealthy family. When Yuta came to town, Nae falls in love with him, planning to meet him in the red valley. When Eijiro discovers that Nae is planning to run away with Yuta, he refused to believe that she would go wander off to a world with a wanderer like Yuta. So he staged a meeting to test her loyalty to him. Nae did not realize he had set her up, but it was too late. Eijiro murdered her realizing that she had rejected him for Yuta. After realizing what he did, he hid her body in the red valley. Whatever love he had turned to something disgusting. He states he mostly vowed to find the mermaid ashes to resurrect her and keep her for himself; to do with her as he basically pleased. He would eventually find them and use them to bring her back; but Nae is a shadow of herself. Further, she has an almost instinctive drive to return to the valley and hopefully see Yuta. But he most likely stopped her often, until Yuta and Mana returned. This throws all his plans astray and he tries any means to kill both of them. Whether she vaguely remembers him murdering her or a sounds triggers her murderous side, she hits him with a rock; which shocks him. He then realizes that Nae is heading to the valley again to see Yuta. More proof that even in death, Nae never loved him and still wanted Yuta. He then orders his men to kill her. Though Mana and Yuta stop his plans, he rejects Nae saying she was a demon with no feelings. However, Mana loudly disagrees and states that her love for Yuta is what's driving her to keep some of her old self.

;{{nihongo|Akiko Kiryu|鬼柳 晶子|Kiryū Akiko}} (Manga only)
:Akiko is the sister of Shingo Kiryu, but unlike him she does not have his violent nature. She is a sweet girl who blames herself for Shingo's disturbing behavior. When they were young, Shingo liked to kill small animals with his knife. Akiko was sickened by this and tried to stop him, but accidentally hit him in the face with his knife and caused him to lose an eye. Shingo continued hurting animals and eventually people, but always blamed it on the loss of his eye. Akiko felt responsible for Shingo and always defended him whenever he did something wrong. Eventually even Akiko grew disgusted by Shingo's behavior and decided to poison him. Because she felt responsible for the way he turned out though, she poisoned herself as well. The poison she used was the flesh of a mermaid, but instead of becoming an immortal, Akiko continued living in an almost comatose state. Many people have come to believe that she is actually a life-sized doll, and she is sitting in a chair in her home to this day. Shingo returns to his childhood home hoping to find his sister. After a battle with Shingo, Yuta decapitated Akiko, thus ending her life as a lifeless doll.

;{{nihongo|Shingo Kiryu|鬼柳 新吾|Kiryū Shingo}} (Manga only)
:Shingo is the insane brother of Akiko Kiryu. They lived together in the Kiryu Manor shortly before the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Yuta worked there temporarily and saw Shingo's cruel and sadistic behavior firsthand. Akiko tried to prevent her brother from hurting anymore people by poisoning him. She did not realize though that the poison was actually the flesh of a mermaid. Shingo seemed to die after eating it, but he was able to dig himself out of his grave and return home. His father was so upset to see him that he tried to kill him again, but that failed as well. Because of Shingo's insanity, he was kept in a cell in the basement of the Kiryu home. Once he was released, he ripped the eye out of his sisters corpse and fled. Because it is his sisters eye, every time he murders someone he sees the last thing that she saw, his own twisted face reaching down to rip her eye out. Shingo believes that by killing his sister he can finally make the visions stop, so he continually harasses the elderly women who now live in his home. After a battle with Yuta, Yuta decapitated Akiko, then attempted to do the same with Shingo. After Shingo suffered another vision, he came to realize he would forever be tormented by his sister's last sight, and he took Yuta's sword and decapitated himself.

===Manga===
The original manga was serialised in ''[[Shōnen Sunday]]'', starting in 1984. In total there are 9 stories told in 16 episodes.&lt;!--see list at http://www.oocities.org/~egero/Mermaid/chapters/manga1.html for instance--&gt;

The first [[tankōbon]] was ''Ningyo no Mori'', named after the third story within it (or ''Rumic World: Ningyo no Mori'' in its OVA adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. [2006] (2006). The Anime Encyclopedia: Revised &amp; Expanded Edition. Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933330-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The second tankōbon, ''Ningyo no Kizu'' was then released in Japan, leaving out two stories (4 episodes): "Yasha no Hitomi" and "Saigo no Kao". These stories were not available then the book came out. The series was re-released in [[Shinsoban]] format in 2003, now in three volumes and with all episodes. Later a new edition, in four volumes, with the same 16 episodes were released.

Mermaid Forest began serialisation by [[Viz Media]] in [[Animerica]]'s first issue. [[Matt Thorn]] provided the translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Animerica]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date= March 1993 |page=20 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the manga was first released in three volumes, called ''Mermaid Forest'', ''Mermaid's Scar'' and ''Mermaid's Gaze''. Later in four books, simply named ''Mermaid Saga'' volume 1-4.

===Anime===
The first OVA, Mermaid Forest, was released in Japan in August 1991. A subtitled VHS release was released in North America by [[Central Park Media|US Manga Corps]] on March 3, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Animerica]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date= March 1993 |page=18 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was marketed as one of the "Rumik World" anime (along with ''[[Maris the Chojo]]'', ''[[Fire Tripper]]'', and ''[[Laughing Target]]'').

''Mermaid's Scar'', was released in Japan on VHS and [[Laserdisc]] by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] on September 24, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Animerica]] |volume=1 |issue=7 |date=September 1993 |page=13 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viz media]] published a dubbed release on VHS on November 21, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Animerica]] |volume=3 |issue=11 |date=1995 |page=19 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the animation company [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] produced a 13 episodes TV series based on Takahashi's short stories as part of the [[Takahashi Rumiko Gekijō]] series. All but ''Mermaid's Gaze'' were animated. While closely following the story of the original manga (more so than the [[OVA]] versions), many of the violent aspects of the stories were toned down. Only eleven episodes were shown on Japanese TV, with the final two episodes (''Mermaid's Scar'') released direct to video, allegedly because this particular story was too violent for TV. It was released in North America by [[Geneon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9723">{{About|the British murder victim|the American harpist|Edna Phillips}}
'''Edna Phillips''' was a 70-year-old woman who was murdered on 16 July 1992 by two teenage girls, one of them her next-door neighbour, at her home on a [[council estate]] in [[Penywaun]] in [[South Wales]]. The details of the crime were made public soon after the start of the trial of the two boys who murdered two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] in [[Merseyside]], which contributed to the resulting [[moral panic]] in the United Kingdom.

==Background and murder==
Phillips lived on the Penywaun council estate, which had become increasingly dangerous since unemployment increased in the [[Cynon Valley]] and the local police station was closed as a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name=Despair&gt;Peter Dunn, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/despair-and-death-on-an-estate-without-hope-peter-dunn-looks-at-the-background-to-the-brutal-murder-1496695.html "Despair and death on an estate without hope: Peter Dunn looks at the background to the brutal murder of a lonely old woman whose cries for help went unheeded"], ''The Independent'', 10 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rossi family moved into the house next door when their daughter, Maria, was a toddler.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Edith M. Lederer, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Another-Slaying-This-Time-of-Elderly-Woman-Rocks-Britain/id-e90bf88b6d012e6a3c60a05f80c6b288 "Another Slaying - This Time of Elderly Woman - Rocks Britain"], [[Associated Press]], 10 March 1993. Also [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-11/news/mn-1034_1_edna-phillips "Brutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons' Shock"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 11 March 1993; [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/britain-reels-at-details-of-torture-death/article_1ddd3868-dabc-5e73-9788-7ed1d8d01337.html "Britain Reels at Details of Torture Death"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', 11 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips took Maria for walks when she was young, but later made complaints about loud music and drunkenness at the Rossi house, and reported Maria to the police; after that the Rossis despised her, rubbish was dumped in her garden, and Maria threw stones at her, called her a "fucking bitch" in the street, smeared faeces on her house and committed other vandalism, stole her money, and mistreated her dog, Chum.&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;Marianne MacDonald, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/custody-for-evil-girls-who-killed-pensioner-1496496.html "Custody for 'evil' girls who killed pensioner"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 9 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Phillips began asking to be moved to another house, but her request was not granted. In 1992, after Maria burgled her house, she wrote to her [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Ann Clwyd]]; the police then put her in touch with Victims' Services and installed a burglar alarm, and a deputy divisional commander wrote to Clwyd that "All matters raised within the letter [had] been satisfactorily addressed."&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clwyd&gt;[[Anne Clwyd]] with Joanna Masters, ''Rebel With a Cause'', London: Biteback, 2017, {{ISBN|9781785900938}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RFvDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;85–86].&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the evening of 16 July 1992, under the influences of [[hard cider|cider]] and drugs, Maria Rossi and her friend, Christina "Tina" Molloy, both 17, saw Phillips, who was then 70 and partially sighted, calling for Chum to come in; they forced her back into her house, where they strangled her with the dog's chain, slashed her 35 times in the face with a [[utility knife]], scissors and a piece of broken glass, stabbed her 86 times and stamped on her chest, breaking five ribs, broke her nose and attempted to [[Scalping|scalp]] her, and broke eggs over her body. They stole her vacuum cleaner and radio and her money.&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clwyd/&gt; The next morning Maria was heard singing "Ding, dong, Edna's dead" or "We've killed Edna".&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wales&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/stay-away-us-killer-told-2486954 "Stay away from us, killer told"], ''[[Wales Online]]'', 4 April 2003, updated 1 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial verdict and public reactions==
A crowd of 300 people attacked the Rossi house after discovery of the murder, throwing stones, destroying a greenhouse belonging to Maria Rossi's grandparents and uprooting the plants. 'Murderer' was painted on the house and Molloy's parents' house was also wrecked; both families had to be taken to safety and their new addresses kept secret.&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

On 8 March 1993, both Rossi, who had previous convictions for theft and drug offenses, and Molloy, who had two previous convictions for assault and criminal damage, were given [[Detention during Her Majesty's pleasure|indefinite sentences]]. In sentencing, Judge Baker described them as "evil products of a modern age"&lt;ref name=Despair/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alix Kirsta, ''Deadlier than the Male: Violence and Aggression in Women'', London: HarperCollins, 1994, {{ISBN|9780006378495}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LwZHAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Edna+Phillips+murder&amp;dq=Edna+Phillips+murder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF1eenr97TAhUjs1QKHdxuD0kQ6AEIMzAD p.&amp;nbsp;133].&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "If as youngsters some discipline had been imposed upon you, whether in the home, at school or through the courts, you might not be standing in the dock for this dreadful offense."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

Details of the crime were first made public at the sentencing, which followed by less than three weeks the start of the trial of two ten-year-old boys for murdering two-year-old James Bulger.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; It contributed to a moral panic in the UK concerning young killers,&lt;ref&gt;"[I]n the construction of the moral panic surrounding the James Bulger incident, [there were] a multitude of 'newsworthy' or 'panic-worthy' primary narratives [including] the abduction and murder of James Bulger [and] the murder of Edna Phillips by two teenage girls": [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02243042?LI=true "Abstracts"], ''European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research'' 3.4, December 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;132–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosalind Miles]], ''The Children We Deserve: Love and Hate in the Making of the Family'', London: HarperCollins, 1995, {{ISBN|9780586092316}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bDhHAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Edna+Phillips+murder&amp;dq=Edna+Phillips+murder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF1eenr97TAhUjs1QKHdxuD0kQ6AEIIzAA pp.&amp;nbsp;231–32].&lt;/ref&gt; who, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out in a 1995 article, were particularly disturbing since they did not constitute a clear "[[folk devil]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Trial by Spectacle.

==Appeal and reduction in sentence==
Molloy and Rossi were sentenced to a 'tariff' (minimum term) of 15 years. In April 1999 the [[Home Secretary]], [[Jack Straw]], reduced Rossi's to 13 years, but the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], refused to reduce it further, while reducing Molloy's to 12 years.&lt;ref name=Wales/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3479709.stm "Killer could be released early"], [[BBC news]], 11 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wales2&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/young-killer-may-be-released-2449695 "Young killer may be released"], ''Wales Online'', 12 February 2004, updated 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a case brought on behalf of Rossi and of Anthony Dudson, who was 16 when he participated in the [[murder of Suzanne Capper]] in Manchester in December 1992, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled that the Home Secretary must regularly review all sentences of those in prison for murders committed when they were juveniles; this ruling was affirmed in February 2004 over the objections of the then Home Secretary, [[David Blunkett]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Rossi was then known as Maria Smith. People in Penywaun warned that neither of them would be welcome to return.&lt;ref name=Wales/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wales2/&gt;

Christina Molloy was found dead in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2017-05-16/edna-phillips-killer-christina-molloy-dies/|title=Edna Phillips' killer Christina Molloy dies|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erica Michelle Marie Green''' (May 15, 1997 &amp;ndash; April 28, 2001) was a three-year-old  murder victim discovered on April 28, 2001, in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], who remained unidentified (and known as '''Precious Doe''') until May 5, 2005. The girl had been [[murder]]ed and decapitated (between 12 and 48 hours prior to discovery).&lt;ref name=infolope /&gt;&lt;ref name=2charged /&gt; The body was naked and the head was wrapped in a trash bag and dumped nearby. The brutality of the crime, and the fact that the child went unidentified for a long period, sparked national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Discovery==
On April 28, 2001, Erica's body was found, missing the head, near Hibbs Park at 59th Street and Kensington Avenue, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. The young girl's head was found approximately 150 to 200 yards southeast of the body recovery site on May 1, 2001.&lt;ref name=infolope /&gt; It was determined that she had been beaten with an [[ashtray]] (which was found with the body, but lacked DNA or fingerprints), and kicked several times, causing brutal injuries all over her body. The girl had been decapitated in an effort to keep police from being able to identify the body.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''nuchal cord''' is when the [[umbilical cord]] becomes wrapped around the [[fetus]]'s neck.&lt;ref name=Pe2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peesay |first1=Morarji |title=Nuchal cord and its implications |journal=Maternal Health, Neonatology and Perinatology |date=6 December 2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=28 |doi=10.1186/s40748-017-0068-7 |pmid=29234502|pmc=5719938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms present in the baby shortly after birth from a prior nuchal cord may include duskiness of face, facial [[petechia]], and [[subconjunctival bleeding|bleeding in the whites of the eye]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt; Complications can include [[meconium]], [[respiratory distress]], [[anemia]], and [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt; Multiple wraps are associated with greater risk.&lt;ref name=Has2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasegawa |first1=J |last2=Matsuoka |first2=R |last3=Ichizuka |first3=K |last4=Sekizawa |first4=A |last5=Okai |first5=T |title=Ultrasound diagnosis and management of umbilical cord abnormalities. |journal=Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |date=March 2009 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=23–7 |doi=10.1016/S1028-4559(09)60031-0 |pmid=19346188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Risk factors and diagnosis --&gt;
The diagnosis may be suspected if there is a decrease in the babies heart rate during [[Childbirth|delivery]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt; Nuchal cords are typically checked for by running the finger over the baby's neck once the head has delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2015 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2014 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323084307 |page=e23 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=icTsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound]] may pick up the condition before labor.&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
If detected during delivery, management includes trying to unwrap the cord or if this is not possible clamping and cutting the cord.&lt;ref name=Mer2018/&gt; Delivery can typically take place as normal and outcomes are generally good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=James G. |title=Emergency Medicine E-Book: Clinical Essentials (Expert Consult -- Online) |date=2012 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-1455733941 |page=1064 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rpoH-KYE93IC&amp;pg=PA1064 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt; Rarely long term brain damage or [[cerebral palsy]] may occur.&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacLennan |first1=AH |last2=Thompson |first2=SC |last3=Gecz |first3=J |title=Cerebral palsy: causes, pathways, and the role of genetic variants. |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=December 2015 |volume=213 |issue=6 |pages=779–88 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.05.034 |pmid=26003063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuchal cords occur in about a quarter of deliveries.&lt;ref name=Mer2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuchal Cord |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-labor-and-delivery/nuchal-cord |website=Merck Manuals Consumer Version |accessdate=2 October 2018 |date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition has been described at least as early as 300 BC by [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of a prior nuchal cord shortly after birth in the baby may include duskiness of face, facial [[petechia]], and [[subconjunctival bleeding|bleeding in the whites of the eye]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt; Complications can include [[meconium]], [[respiratory disease]], [[anemia]], and [[still birth]].&lt;ref name=Pe2017/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:USNuchal.gif|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasound]] showing a nuchal cord]]
In 1962, J. Selwyn Crawford MD from the British Research Council defined a nuchal cord as one that is wrapped 360 degrees around the fetal neck. Crawford commented "It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that little work has been done ... to analyze its effects during labor and delivery".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} To date, there is no prospective case control double-blind study looking at nuchal cords and observational studies vary in opinion as to the degree of poor outcomes. Also not included in these studies is which umbilical cord form (of the 8 different possible structures) was considered a nuchal cord.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Ultrasound]] diagnosis of a cord around the neck was first described in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jouppila|first=Pentti|last2=Kirkinen|first2=Pertti|year=February 1982|title=Ultrasonic diagnosis of nuchal encirclement by the umbilical cord: A case and methodological report|journal=Journal of Clinical Ultrasound|volume=10|issue=2|pages=59–62|doi=10.1002/jcu.1870100205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Coils occur in about 25% of cases and ordinarily do no harm, but occasionally they may be so tight that constriction of the umbilical vessels and consequent hypoxia result.”{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition, has only one single sentence in the entire textbook regarding cords around the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition|last=Williams|first=J. Whitridge|publisher=Appleton &amp; Lange, US|year=1980|isbn=978-0838597316|location=|pages=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1770 had 20 pages of information about Umbilical Cord Pathology with drawings of Umbilical Cord Entanglement. The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] has these images on its brochure. There are currently three recent texts on ultrasonography which demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to identify umbilical cord issues with reliability as of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A study published in 2004 was done to establish the sensitivity of ultrasound in the diagnosis of a nuchal cord. Each of 289 women, induced the same day, underwent a transabdominal [[ultrasound scan]] with an Aloka 1700 ultrasound machine with a 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz abdominal probe, using gray-scale and color Doppler imaging immediately prior to induction of labor.  Presence of the cord was sought in the transverse and sagittal plane of the neck. A nuchal cord was diagnosed if the cord was visualized lying around at least 3 of the 4 sides of the neck.  A cord was actually present at delivery in 52 of the 289 women. Only 18 of the 52 cords or 35% of the nuchal cords were detected on ultrasound done immediately before delivery, and 65% of nuchal cords were not detected. Of the 237 cases where there was no cord at delivery, ultrasound had false positive results, i.e. diagnosed a cord in 44 of the 237 cases (19%) in which there was no cord present at all.  In this study, ultrasound was only 35% accurate at finding a single loop, and only 60% accurate at detecting a nuchal cord wrapped multiple times around the neck.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peregrine|first=E.|last2=O’Brien|first2=P.|last3=Jauniaux|first3=Eric|date=August 2005|title=Ultrasound Detection of Nuchal Cord Prior to Labor Induction and the Risk of Cesarean Section|url=http://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Abstract/2005/08000/Ultrasound_Detection_of_Nuchal_Cord_Prior_to_Labor.10.aspx|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|volume=60|issue=8|pages=506–507|doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000172319.27668.34|access-date=December 26, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In no study was it possible by ultrasound to distinguish between a loose or a tight cord, although at least 3 attempted to do so.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Peregrine&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; concludes that ultrasound diagnosis of nuchal cords will only be useful if doctors are able to do so reliably and predict which of those fetuses are likely to have a problem., However, [[perinatology|perinatologists]] routinely look for umbilical cord issues in [[monoamniotic twins]]. Studies have shown an improvement in outcomes where cord entanglement was prenatally identified in these cases. Ultrasound measurement of the velocity of flow in the cord may be useful in the management of twins and chronically growth-retarded fetuses. Of course this depends on the training of the sonographer. To date there are no ultrasound courses which teach the identification of nuchal cord to physicians or technicians. A recent review by  Wilson of the American Academy of Ultrasonography Technicians recommends the documentation of umbilical cord issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson|first=Bettye|date=March–April 2008|title=Sonography of the Placenta And Umbilical Cord|url=http://www.radiologictechnology.org/content/79/4/333S.short|journal=Radiologic Technology|volume=79|issue=|pages=333S–345S|access-date=December 26, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Treatment==
Management of a presenting nuchal cord should be tailored to prevent [[umbilical cord compression]] whenever possible. Techniques to preserve an intact nuchal cord depend on how tightly the cord is wrapped around the infant’s neck. If the cord is loose, it can easily be slipped over the infant’s head. The infant can be [[childbirth|delivered]] normally and placed on maternal abdomen as desired. If the cord is too tight to go over the infant’s head, the provider may be able to slip it over the infant’s shoulders and deliver the body through the cord. The cord can then be unwrapped from around the baby after birth. Finally, if the cord is too tight to slip back over the shoulders, one may use the somersault maneuver to allow the body to be delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=L|date=March 1999|title=Practice tips. 'Somersault' maneuver for a tight umbilical cord|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=45|pages=613|pmc=2328444|pmid=10099799|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth attendant may also choose to clamp and cut the umbilical cord to allow for [[vaginal delivery]] if other methods of nuchal cord management are not feasible.

==Prognosis==
Retrospective data of over 182,000 births, with the statistical power to determine even mild associations, suggest that a single or multiple nuchal cords at the time of delivery is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, is associated with higher [[birthweight]]s and fewer caesarean sections in births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastrobattista|first=Joan M.|last2=Hollier|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Yeomans|first3=Edward R.|last4=Ramin|first4=Susan M.|last5=Day|first5=Mary-Clare|last6=Sosa|first6=Alfred|last7=Gilstrap|first7=Larry C.|date=February 2005|title=Effects of nuchal cord on birthweight and immediate neonatal outcomes.|journal=American Journal of Perinatology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=83–85|doi=10.1055/s-2005-837737|pmid=15731986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schäffer|first=Leonhard|last2=Burkhardt|first2=Tilo|last3=Zimmermann|first3=Roland|last4=Kurmanavicius|first4=Juozas|date=July 2005|title=Nuchal cords in term and postterm deliveries—do we need to know?|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=106|issue=1|pages=23–28|doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000165322.42051.0f|pmid=15994613|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheiner|first=Sheiner|last2=Abramowicz|first2=Jacques S.|last3=Levy|first3=Amalia|last4=Silberstein|first4=Tali|last5=Mazor|first5=Moshe|last6=Hershkovitz|first6=Reli|date=May 2006|title=Nuchal cord is not associated with adverse perinatal outcome|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=274|issue=2|pages=81–83|doi=10.1007/s00404-005-0110-2|pmid=16374604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some studies have found that a tight nuchal cord is associated with short term morbidity, it is unclear whether such outcomes are actually a result of the presence of the nuchal cord itself, or as a result of clamping and cutting the cord &lt;ref name="Reed, R 2009, pp. 106-109"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=Rachel|last2=Barnes|first2=Margaret|last3=Allan|first3=Jan|date=February 2009|title=Nuchal cords: sharing the evidence with parents|journal=British Journal of Midwifery|volume=17|issue=2|pages=106–109|doi=10.12968/bjom.2009.17.2.39379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to spirituality:

'''[[Spirituality]]''' may refer to an ultimate or an alleged immaterial [[reality]],&lt;ref&gt;Ewert Cousins, preface to Antoine Faivre and Jacob Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', Crossroad Publishing 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2015}} an [[Involution (philosophy)|inner path]] enabling a person to discover the essence of his/her being, or the “deepest values and meanings by which people live.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Sheldrake]], ''A Brief History of Spirituality'', Wiley-Blackwell 2007 p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2015}}

[[Spiritual practice]]s, including [[meditation]], [[prayer]] and [[contemplation]], are intended to develop an individual's inner life; spiritual experience includes that of [[connectedness]] with a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive [[self]]; with other individuals or the [[human]] [[community]]; with [[nature]] or the [[cosmos]]; or with the [[Divinity|divine]] realm.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A.

[[File:Raymond Kurzweil, Stanford 2006 (square crop).jpg|thumb|Ray Kurzweil in 2006]]

American author, inventor and [[futurist]] [[Raymond Kurzweil]] has become well known for his predictions about [[artificial intelligence]] and the human species, mainly concerning the [[Technological Singularity]]. He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and 2005's ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots ([[nanobots]]) called [[utility fog|foglets]] and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby [[nanotechnology]] is incorporated into many internal organs.

==Accuracy of predictions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===''The Age of Intelligent Machines''===
Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', was published in 1990. It forecast the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union]] due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication "was a big factor" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Renee Blodgett |url=http://www.weblogtheworld.com/countries/northern-america/ray-kurzweil-on-gorbachev/ |title=Ray Kurzweil on Gorbachev |publisher=We Blog The World |date=April 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players "by the year 2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997 chess World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] was defeated by IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Swift and Slashing, Computer Topples Kasparav|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/nyregion/swift-and-slashing-computer-topples-kasparov.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffman|first=K.G|title=Growth of the Internet|date=2001|publisher=AT&amp;T Labs Research|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/oft.internet.growth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the publication of ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'', there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 | work=UNESCO Courier | title=Fleeing the dot.com era – decline in Internet usage | first=Sally | last=Wyatt | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services".{{Cite quote|date=February 2013}} Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===''The Age of Spiritual Machines''===
In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled "To Face the Future", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named "2009", "2019", "2029", and "2099". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Kurzweil restated his earlier prediction from ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The [[K-NFB Reader|"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)]] was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KNFB Reader becomes the Property of the Nation's Blind|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm15/bm1506/bm150603.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) [[Nokia N82]] smartphone was available for $1,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNFB Reader Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|archivedate=February 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208144803/http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for [[iOS]] phones was released for $99 in 2014 and [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] for $75 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/award-winning-text-recognition-app-gives-blind-access-print-now-available-android&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Singularity Is Near''===
While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', though longer-term visions abound.

Kurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the ''computational capacities'' to simulate [[protein folding]] will be introduced.  In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond.  The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Ledford |title=Supercomputer sets protein-folding record |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101014/full/news.2010.541.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date = October 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2011 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biyearly protein structure prediction contest [[CASP]] shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Other sources===
In an October 2002 article published on [http://www.Kurzweilai.net his website], Kurzweil stated that "[[Deep Fritz]]-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, or Are Computers Getting Stupider?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094405/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/player/deep_fritz.html The chess games of Deep Fritz (Computer)].

===Ray Kurzweil's response===
According to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/01/ray-kurzweil-responds-to-issue-of.html Ray Kurzweil Responds to the Issue of Accuracy of His Predictions], Next Big Future, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray (October 2010) [http://www.kurzweilai.net/predictions/download.php How My Predictions Are Faring]. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

*The majority of reading is done on displays rather than paper, though paper documents (including print books) are still common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most text will be created using speech recognition technology.
*Intelligent roads and driverless cars are in use, mostly on highways. Local roads still require full human interaction.
*People use personal computers the size of rings, pins, credit cards and books.
*Most portable computers do not have moving parts or keyboards.
*Though desktop PCs are still common for data storage, individuals primarily use portable devices for their computer-related tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation.
*Many devices offer high-speed network access via wireless technology.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digital products such as books, songs, games, movies and software are typically acquired as files via a wireless network and have no physical object associated with them.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
*Cables are disappearing. Computer peripherals use wireless communication.
*People can talk to their computer to give commands.
*Computer displays built into eyeglasses for [[augmented reality]] are used.
*Computers can [[face recognition|recognize their owner's face]] from a picture or video.
*[[3D integrated circuit|Three-dimensional chips]] are commonly used.
*Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space.
*A $1,000 computer can perform a trillion calculations per second.
*Supercomputers have been built that can operate at 20 petaflops (roughly the hardware-equivalent of the human brain according to Kurzweil).
*Consumer-level computers across the world can network together to form decentralized supercomputers, many of which have the computational capacity of the human brain.
*There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of "chaotic" or complexity theory computing.
*Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans.
*Autonomous nano-engineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls.
*Digital documents routinely display moving images and sounds.
*Artificial voices sound fully human.
*Phones can translate spoken sentences to different languages and read them back aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Telephone communication is mostly wireless.
*Cell phones display high resolution images. Users can engage in audio-video teleconferences.
*High resolution audio-visual cybersex is common, aided by falling costs of high-speed internet and computer hardware.
*At least 50% of all transactions are conducted over the internet.
*Personal artificial digital assistants are in widespread use. They can understand spoken language, look up answers to questions, set appointments, conduct transactions, tell jokes, and more.
*An increasing share of the population is working from home and while traveling.
*The typical home has over 100 computers in it, many of which are embedded in appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-14-028202-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Though not yet ubiquitous, many households have one or more robots that perform some type of housekeeping.
*People often play music alongside digital musicians. (In "How My Predictions Are Faring" written in 2010, Kurzweil cited ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and Apple's ''Magic [[GarageBand]] Jam'' as two examples.)
*Audio-visual [[virtual reality]] has entered the mass market. Users can digitally tour real locations or play in highly immersive fantasy worlds. Tactile (haptic) VR technology is still primitive however.
*Militaries rely heavily on armed unmanned airborne devices.
*Death rates for cancer and heart disease have continued to fall as a result of improvements in medical technology.
*Telemedicine is common. Devices monitor and relay health-related data of many patients and send that information to doctors remotely. Teleconferencing between doctor and patient is also popular.
*Computers and medical software are capable enough at image and pattern recognition that they are routinely used to [[computer-aided diagnosis|help diagnose diseases]] by analyzing scans of patients.
*Doctors and medical students often train in virtual reality environments, which include haptic feedback and simulated patients.

====2019====
*The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the [[human brain]] (20 quadrillion calculations per second).
*The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.
*Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).
*People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.
*These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver "augmented reality" and "virtual reality" in three different ways. First, they can project "[[head-up display|heads-up-displays]]" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the "real" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.
*People communicate with their computers [[voice user interface|via two-way speech]] and [[gesture recognition|gestures]] instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.
*Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
*Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a "computer" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.
*Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.
*Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.
*Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.
*Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.
*Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.
*Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.
*Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. "Nanoengineered machines" begin to be used in manufacturing.
*Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.
*Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.
*Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.
*Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.
*All students have access to computers.
*Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.
*Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.
*Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.
*Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.
*People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.
*Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (e.g. Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).
*Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
*Effective language technologies (natural language processing, [[speech recognition]], speech synthesis) exist.
*Anyone can wirelessly access the internet with wearable devices such as computerized glasses, contacts, and watches.
*Traditional computers and communication devices such as desktop PCs, laptops, and cell phones still exist, but most of their functions can be performed by wearable gadgets. Examples include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, and teleconferencing.
*Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (e.g. tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. "Virtual sex"—in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a "simulated" partner that only exists on a computer—becomes a reality.
*Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, [[haptic technology]] has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
*Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.
*The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
*Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.
*Computers do most of the vehicle driving—-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.
*Most roads now have automated driving systems—networks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.
*Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.
*Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
*Most decisions made by humans involve consultation with machine intelligence. For example, a doctor may seek the advice of a digital assistant. A lawyer might utilize a virtual researcher. Or a shopper may receive recommendations from a software program that has learned his or her shopping habits.
*While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.
*Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
*Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface.
*Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.
*The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)
*Virtual artists—creative computers capable of making their own art and music—emerge in all fields of the arts.
*Most flying weapons are bird-sized robots. Some are as small as insects.
*Average life expectancy is over 100.
*Computerized watches, clothing, and jewelry can monitor the wearers health continuously. They can detect many types of diseases and offer recommendations for treatment.

====2029====
*A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain.
*The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains.
*Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers.
*Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse-engineering the human brain, are in common use.
*The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears.
*Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence.
*Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers "know" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings.
*Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual reality—with complete sensory stimulation—without any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use.
*Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human.
*The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.
*The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real "[[robot rights]]" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a "human being."
*Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas.
*Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth.
* Reverse engineering of the human brain completed
* Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence
* Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth

====2049====
*Food is commonly "assembled" by nanomachines. This food is externally indistinguishable from "natural" food, but it can be made more wholesome since production can be controlled at the molecular level. This technology decouples food production from climate conditions and the availability of natural resources.
*The distinction between virtual reality and "real" reality becomes confounded as [[Utility fog|foglets]] come into common use, allowing immediate assembly or disassembly of all sorts of physical objects.

====2072====
*[[Picoengineering]] (technology on the scale of trillionths of a meter) becomes practical.

====2099====
*The human brain has been completely reverse engineered and all aspects of its functioning are understood.
*Natural human thinking possesses no advantages over computer minds.
*Machines have attained equal legal status with humans.
*Humans and machines merge in the physical and mental realms. Cybernetic brain implants enable humans to fuse their minds with AI's.
*In consequence, clear distinctions between humans and machines no longer exist.
*Most conscious beings lack a permanent physical form.
*The vast majority of the Earth's sentient beings are AI's that exist entirely as thinking computer programs capable of instantly moving from one computer to another across the Internet (or whatever equivalent exists in 2099). These computer-based beings are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the physical world by creating or taking over robotic bodies, with individual AI's also being capable of controlling multiple bodies at once.
*Individual beings merge and separate constantly, making it impossible to determine how many “people” there are on Earth.
*This new plasticity of consciousness and ability for beings to join minds seriously alters the nature of self-identity.
*The majority of interpersonal interactions occur in virtual environments. Actually having two people physically meet in the real world to have a conversation or transact business without any technological interference is very rare.
*Organic human beings are a small minority of the intelligent life forms on Earth. Even among the remaining ''Homo sapiens'', the use of computerized implants that heavily augment normal abilities is ubiquitous and accepted as normal. The small fraction of humans who opt to remain "natural" and unmodified effectively exist on a lower and more limited plane of consciousness from everyone else, and thus find it impossible to fully interact with AI's and highly modified humans.
*"Natural" humans are protected from extermination. In spite of their shortcomings and frailties, humans are respected by AI's for giving rise to the machines.
*Since knowledge and skills can be instantly downloaded and comprehended by most intelligent beings, the process of learning is compressed into an instantaneous affair instead of the years-long struggle normal humans experience. Free from this time-consuming burden, AI's now focus their energies on making new discoveries and contributions.
*AI's are capable of dividing their attention and energies in countless directions, allowing one being to manage a multitude of endeavors simultaneously.
*Femtoengineering (engineering on the scale of one thousandth of a trillionth of a meter) might be possible.
*AI's communicate via a shared electronic language.
*Artwork and music created by machines encompasses areas of the light spectrum and frequencies of sounds that normal humans cannot perceive.
*Money has deflated in value, meaning all sorts of goods and services have become cheaper.
*Some humans at least as old as the Baby Boomers are still alive and well.
*Computer viruses are a major threat since most intelligent beings are software-based.
*AI's frequently make "backup copies" of themselves, guaranteeing a sort of immortality should the original AI be killed.
*The concept of "life expectancy" has become irrelevant to humans and machines thanks to medical immortality and advanced computers.
*The pace of technological change continues to accelerate as the 22nd century nears.

====Thousands of years from now====
*"Intelligent beings consider the fate of all the Universe."

===''The Singularity is Near'' (2005)===
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=July 2016}}

====2010====
*Supercomputers will have the same raw computing power as human brains, though the software to emulate human thinking on those computers does not yet exist. ([[IBM Sequoia]])
*Computers will start to disappear as distinct physical objects, meaning many will have nontraditional shapes or will be embedded in clothing and everyday objects.
*Full-immersion audio-visual virtual reality will exist.

====2015====
*By now, it is likely that "clean a house" will be within the capabilities of a household robot.

====2018====
*10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; bits (=10 TB) of computer memory—roughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain—will cost $1000.
10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.

====2010s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Two", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just "[[designer babies]]" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to "reprogram" their own biochemistry away from disease and aging, radically extending life expectancy.
*Computers become smaller and increasingly integrated into everyday life.
*More and more computer devices will be used as miniature web servers, and more will have their resources pooled for computation.
*High-quality broadband Internet access will become available almost everywhere.
*Eyeglasses that beam images onto the users' retinas to produce virtual reality will be developed. They will also come with speakers or headphone attachments that will complete the experience with sounds.  These eyeglasses will become a new medium for [[advertising]] which will be wirelessly transmitted to them as one walks by various business establishments. This was fictionalized in [[Dennō Coil]].
*The VR glasses will also have built-in computers featuring "virtual assistant" programs that can help the user with various daily tasks. 
*Virtual assistants would be capable of multiple functions. One useful function would be real-time language translation in which words spoken in a foreign language would be translated into text that would appear as subtitles to a user wearing the glasses. 
*Cell phones will be built into clothing and will be able to project sounds directly into the ears of their users. 
*Advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear.

====2020s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Three", the revolution in Nanotechnology, is to begin: allowing humans to vastly overcome the inherent limitations of biology, as no matter how much humanity fine-tunes its biology, they will never be as capable otherwise. This decade also marks the revolution in Robotics ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]), as an AI is expected to pass the [[Turing test]] by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning it can pass for a human being (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of an average, educated human). What follows then will be an era of consolidation in which nonbiological intelligence will undergo exponential growth (Runaway AI), eventually leading to the extraordinary expansion contemplated by the Singularity, in which human intelligence is multiplied by billions by the mid-2040s.
*Early in this decade, humanity will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence within a $1000 personal computer, followed shortly by effective software models of human intelligence toward the middle of the decade: this will be enabled through the continuing exponential growth of brain-scanning technology, which is doubling in bandwidth, temporal and spatial resolution every year, and will be greatly amplified with nanotechnology, allowing us to have a detailed understanding of all the regions of the human brain and to aid in developing human-level machine intelligence by the end of this decade.
*Computers less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm in size will be possible.
*As one of their first practical applications, [[nanomachines]] are used for medical purposes.
*Highly advanced medical [[nanobots]] will perform detailed [[Neuroimaging|brainscans]] on live patients.
*Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood.
*Nanobots capable of entering the bloodstream to "feed" cells and extract waste will exist (though not necessarily be in wide use) by the end of this decade. They will make the normal mode of human food consumption obsolete.
*By the late 2020s, nanotech-based manufacturing will be in widespread use, radically altering the economy as all sorts of products can suddenly be produced for a fraction of their traditional-manufacture costs. The true cost of any product is now the amount it takes to download the design schematics.
*By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality.
*The threat posed by genetically engineered [[pathogens]] permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots—infinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism—become sufficiently advanced.
*The many variations of "Human Body 2.0" (as Kurzweil calls it) are incrementally accumulated into this and the following decade, with each organ and body system having its own course of refinement and development. It ultimately consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation, obsolescing many internal organs, brain-extension and an improved skeleton.

====2023====
*10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; calculations per second—roughly the equivalent of one human brain—will cost $1,000.

====2025====
*The most likely year for the debut of advanced nanotechnology.
*Some military [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s and land vehicles will be 100% computer-controlled.

====2030s====
*[[Mind uploading]] becomes successful and perfected by the end of this decade as humans become software-based: living out on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they want or need (whether in virtual or real reality), and living indefinitely so long as they maintain their "mind file". Eventually, all human beings (including those with [[transbiological]] 2.0 or 3.0 bodies) will migrate to this [[postbiological]] state except for those who wish to remain unenhanced: the transbiological era giving way to the postbiological era.
*Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. [[Afferent nerve fiber|Afferent nerve]] pathways could be blocked, totally cancelling out the "real" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience.
*Brain nanobots could also elicit emotional responses from users.
*Using brain nanobots, recorded or real-time brain transmissions of a person's daily life known as "experience beamers" will be available for other people to remotely experience. This is very similar to how the characters in ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' were able to enter the mind of Malkovich and see the world through his eyes.
*Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to "telepathically" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks.
*The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality.
*The many variations of "Human Body 3.0" are gradually implemented during this and the following decade; It most likely lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology.

====2040s====
*People spend most of their time in full-immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited ''[[The Matrix]]'' as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist).
*[[Utility fog|Foglet]]s are in use.
*Nonbiological intelligence will be billions of times more capable than biological intelligence.

====2045: The Singularity====
*$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans.
*The [[technological singularity]] occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted (hence the term "Singularity").
*The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans.

====Post-2045: "Waking up" the Universe====
*The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as [[memristors]] integrated into [[Crossbar latch]]es) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size.
*Because of this, A.I.s convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer, except for a few [[nature reserves]] set aside on the planetary surface for those humans who decided to remain in their natural state. "MOSH's" (Mostly Original Substrate Human) who choose to remain purely organic would still possess virtual assistants that will act as their transcendent servants, living in the blurred real world ("foglet-reality") and being provided with environments and everything they could possibly need as they live out the rest of their normal lives unless they enhance themselves.
*At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter and energy in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate outward from Earth, first into the [[Solar System]] and then out into [[interstellar space]], then galaxies in all directions, utilizing [[starship]]s that are [[Von Neumann probes]] with nanobot crews, breaking down whole planets, stars, moons, and meteoroids and reassembling them into computers. This, in effect, "wakes up" the universe as all the inanimate "dumb" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life).
*Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make [[Jupiter Brain|planet-sized computers]] by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity.
*The process of "waking up" the universe could be completed well before the end of the 22nd century, provided humans are not limited by the speed of light.
*With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of "life") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. It is unknown what events will happen in a post cosmic computer mind era, but whatever it is, it will truly be incomprehensible in every sense of the word to feeble human minds. Perhaps an infinite unification of infinite saturated universes, multiverses, and omniverses, an endless vast collection of united cosmic computers possibly.
====Some indeterminate points within a few decades from now====
*Space technology becomes advanced enough to provide the Earth permanent protection from the threat of asteroid impacts.
*The antitechnology [[Luddite]] movement will grow increasingly vocal and possibly resort to violence as these people become enraged over the emergence of new technologies that threaten traditional attitudes regarding the nature of human life (radical life extension, genetic engineering, cybernetics) and the supremacy of mankind (artificial intelligence). Though the Luddites might, at best, succeed in delaying the Singularity, the march of technology is irresistible and they will inevitably fail in keeping the world frozen at a fixed level of development.
*The emergence of distributed energy grids and full-immersion virtual reality will, when combined with high bandwidth Internet, enable the ultimate in [[telecommuting]]. This, in turn, will make cities obsolete since workers will no longer need to be located near their workplaces. The decentralization of the population will make societies less vulnerable to terrorist and military attacks.

Kurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that "nanotechnology-based" flying cars would be available in 20 years.&lt;ref name=booktv&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?194500-1/depth-ray-kurzweil |title=In Depth with Ray Kurzweil |publisher=[[Book TV]] |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a "tipping point" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030&lt;ref&gt;Human 2.0. By: Kurzweil, Ray, New Scientist, 02624079, September 24, 2005, Vol. 187, Issue 2518&lt;/ref&gt; (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.

Kurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/04/12/virtual-reality-will-come-from-inside-our-brain-not-goggles-says-ray-kurzweil/|title=Virtual reality via nanobot injection?

*By the same year, practical virtual reality glasses will be in use. The devices will work by beaming images directly onto the retinas of their users, creating large, three-dimensional floating images in the person's field of view.

The glasses will deliver full-immersion virtual reality.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
*By 2017, "augmented reality" will exist: The V.R. glasses previously mentioned will have advanced computers and sensors built into them that will be able to recognize elements within the user's environment and then provide appropriate information and assistance through visual or auditory means. If the user looks at a building or a person's face, the computer will provide information through a "heads-up-display" beamed onto the person's retinas.

*By 2022, medical technology will be more than a thousand times more advanced than it is today, and the "tipping point" of human life expectancy will have been reached, with every new year of research guaranteeing at least one more year of life expectancy. Kurzweil also states that 3–4 months of life expectancy were added in 2007 due to the development of new medicines and treatments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;
*Cell phones and PCs will be increasingly woven into a global grid of computers wirelessly connected to the Internet. Instead of each device just sending and receiving its own data, more and more of the machines will be tasked with processing foreign data, creating a huge, interconnected network with millions of nodes.
*By 2027, accurate computer simulations of all parts of the human brain will exist.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] criticized Kurzweil's predictions: "On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Rennie |author-link=John Rennie (editor) |title=Ray Kurzweil's slippery futurism |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date = December 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolf Oskar Ewald Günter Herricht''' (October 5, 1927 &amp;ndash; August 23, 1981) was an [[East Germany|East German]] comedian.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Herricht graduated from school in 1943 after passing a '[[:de:Notabitur|War Abitur]]', a form of an [[Abitur]] designated to free school pupils to be mobilized. In 1945, he was drafted to the [[Volkssturm]] and assigned as an [[Flakhelfer|anti-aircraft battery assistant]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.defa.de/cms/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=2008 Rolf Herricht (English-Language Biography)]''. defa.de.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war's end, he began working as property master and stage manager in a theater in his native [[Magdeburg]], while studying acting in a local studio. After completion, he went to appear on the stages of theaters in [[Salzwedel]], [[Stendal]], [[Staßfurt]], [[Güstrow]] and also in the Kleist Theater in [[Frankfurt am Oder]].&lt;ref&gt;Elke Schneider.

===Breakthrough===
Herricht first met fellow actor [[Hans-Joachim Preil]] in 1951, while they both worked in [[Bernburg]]. The two formed the 'Herricht and Preil' [[comedy duo]], staging their first sketch, 'The Chess Match', in 1953. In the sketch, Preil vainly attempts to play chess with Herricht, who is completely oblivious to the rules of the game. In their act, Herricht played the 'funny man', while Preil served as the 'straight man'. The pair were active until Herricht's passing away.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Ralf Schenk. ''[http://www.superillu.de/kino-tv/Rolf_Herricht_289220.html The Man who Made Everyone Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130106034026/http://www.superillu.de/kino-tv/Rolf_Herricht_289220.html |date=2013-01-06 }}''. ''[[Superillu]]'', 6 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Herricht returned to the Magdeburg Theater, where he remained until 1961. He mainly played comical characters, like the scribe in ''[[The Beaver Coat]]'' and the drunkard from [[Auerbach's Cellar]] in ''[[Faust I]]''.&lt;ref name = "B"&gt;Ines Walk. [http://www.film-zeit.de/Person/32878/Rolf-Herricht/Biographie/ "Rolf Herricht"]. film-zeit.de.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Magdeburg, he also worked in the radio. He and Preil first performed on television when one of their sketches was broadcast by [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] in 1959. The show was well received by the audience and the two began making regular appearances on TV. Herricht and Preil became the [[German Democratic Republic]]'s most celebrated comedians.&lt;ref name = "A"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.filmmuseum-potsdam.de/de/480-2271.htm Rolf Herricht]''. filmmuseum-potsdam.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mdr.de/damals/archiv/artikel104980.html Das Geheimnis eines großes Erfolges]''.

===Height of career===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0812-0006-001, Freyburg, Dreh DEFA-Film "Hauptmann Florian von der Mühle".jpg|right|thumb|220px|Herricht (back to camera) with [[Manfred Krug]] during the filming of ''[[Hauptmann Florian von der Mühle]]''. 12 August 1967.]]
Herricht made his film debut in [[DEFA]]'s 1959 comedy ''[[Before the Lightning Strikes]]'', playing a minor part of a locomotive constructor. Herricht later appeared in some twenty cinema productions, while also playing in many television films. In 1964, he joined the regular cast of the Metropol Theater in Berlin. He also had a career as a singer.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.defa-sternstunden.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=322&amp;Itemid=4 Rolf Herricht]''. defa-sternstunden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herricht appeared on screen in relatively minor roles until writer Maurycy Janowski and director Gottfried Kolditz decided to create a film the plot of which would be based on his comical skill, the 1964 ''[[Geliebte weiße Maus]]''.&lt;ref name = "A"/&gt; Herricht portrayed a traffic policeman who falls in love with a woman and only dares speak to her when she makes an accident on the road. The picture met with considerable success. Herricht starred in several other popular DEFA comedies during the 1960s and the 1970s: among others, he played the erratic [[National People's Army]] reserve soldier Ralf Horricht in the 1965 ''[[Der Reserveheld]]'' and the last-minute-travel-guide Hurtig in the 1967 ''[[Meine Freundin Sybille]]''. His 1965 ''[[Hands Up, Or I'll Shoot|Hände hoch oder ich schieße]]'', in which he again appeared as an eccentric policeman, was banned at the 11th plenary session of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] and only released in 2009, 28 years after his death.&lt;ref name = "B"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.filmportal.de/df/85/Uebersicht,,,,,,,,BCB03C0DE8894368BC321A9D1BF15222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.html Rolf Herricht]''. filmportal.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mdr.de/damals/humor/artikel114240.html Rolf Herricht im Porträt: der Komiker, der ernst genommen werden wollte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402172233/http://www.mdr.de/damals/humor/artikel114240.html |date=2012-04-02 }}''.

'''Saint Afan of Builth''' ({{lang-cy|Sant Afan Buellt}}; {{lang-la|Avanus}}) was an early 6th-century [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[bishop]], [[Martyr of the Faith|martyr]], and [[list of Welsh saints|saint]]. His [[Gŵyl Mabsant|feast day]] is generally placed on 17 November, although the [[Demetia]]n Calendar formerly used in southern [[Wales]] placed it on the 16th;&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; it is no longer observed by either the [[Church in Wales|Anglican]]&lt;ref&gt;The Church in Wales.

__NOTOC__

==Name==
Afan as a [[masculine name|man's name]] in [[Welsh name|Wales]] is probably a loan from the Latin ''[[Amandus]]''.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; In Welsh, he is sometimes known as ''{{lang|cy|Esgob Afan}}'' ("Bishop Afan") from his title and as ''{{lang|cy|Afan Buellt}}'' or ''{{lang|cy|Buallt}}'' from his diocese around [[Builth]] in [[Brycheiniog]].&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;

==Life==
Saint Afan was the son of Cedig ap [[Ceredig]], son of [[Cunedda Wledig]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Rice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8IclDShLSYC ''An Essay on the Welsh Saints Or the Primitive Christians, Usually Considered to Have Been the Founders of the Churches in Wales'', p.&amp;nbsp;208].  Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, &amp; Longman, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|He is sometimes also erroneously given as a son of Ceredig himself.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;}} Through this line, he was a cousin of [[Saint David]], [[patron saint]] of [[Wales]]. Afan's mother is variously given as Dwywai,&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel (ed.) ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Triads of the Island of Britain'', {{nowrap|pp. 506 f}}. University Of Wales Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7083-1386-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Degfed ("Tenth"),&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Evans, A.&amp;nbsp;W.

Afan was the founder of a [[Llanafan (Ceredigion)|Llanafan]] in [[Ceredigion]] and two others ([[Llanafan Fawr]] and [[Llanfechan|Llanafan Fechan]]) in [[Brecknockshire]]. He is recorded as a bishop, although his diocese remains unknown.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; He may have been the third bishop of [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn]] in [[Ceredigion]],&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Enwogion Cymru|Enwogion Cymru 1852]]: 29&lt;/ref&gt; bishop over [[Builth]] with his seat at [[Llanafan Fawr]],&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;&lt;ref name="cathon"&gt;{{cite web | title =St. Afan | work =Saints and Angels | publisher =Catholic Online | url =http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1149 | accessdate =2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or held the title without any purview beyond his own parish.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; His death was credited to [[Christian martyrs|martyrdom]] at the hand of Irish or Danish pirates on the banks of the River Chwefru.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; He was claimed as an ancestor of the 10th-century bishop Ieuan who was also martyred by Viking marauders.&lt;ref name="patron"&gt;{{cite web | last = Jones | first = Terry | title = Afan | work = Patron Saints Index | url = http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintaay.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101133247/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintaay.htm | archivedate = 2008-01-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracles==
[[File:Llanfechan Church - geograph.org.uk - 230355.jpg|thumb|left|300px|St Afan's Church at [[Llanfechan]].]]
A miracle recounted by [[Gerald of Wales]] claimed that the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] lord [[Philip de Braose]] was struck [[Blindness|blind]] and saw his [[hunting dog]]s go mad when he disrespectfully used {{nowrap|St Afan's}} church in Brecknockshire as a makeshift hostel one night.{{refn|"At this point I must tell you what happened, in the reign of Henry I, King of the English, to the [[castellan]] of [[Radnorshire|Radnor]] castle, in the territory of [[Builth]], which is not far away, being adjacent to his own lands, which he himself conquered. He had gone into the church of Saint Afan, called Llanafan in Welsh, and there he had spent the night with his dogs, which was a foolish and irreverent thing to do. He got up at first light, as hunters are wont to do, but he found that all his dogs had gone mad and that he himself was blind. He had lost his sight completely and he had to grope his way out with his hand..."&lt;ref name="description"/&gt;}} He was told that his vision would only return if he resolved to leave his estates and fight in the [[Crusades]]. Some say his sight was restored upon his pledge&lt;ref name="patron"/&gt; but Gerald records that he traveled to the [[Holy Land]] and fought blind, where he was "immediately struck down by a blow from a sword and so ended his life with honour".&lt;ref name="description"&gt;{{cite book | last =Gerald of Wales | title =The Journey Through Wales and the Description of Wales | publisher =Penguin Classics | year =1978 | pages =78–79 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=puyem4d6wJ8C&amp;pg=PA77| isbn = 0-14-044339-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglwys Y Plwyf Llanafan y Trawsgoed.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[St Afan's Church, Llanafan|Capel Afan]] in [[Llanafan (Ceredigion)|Ceredigion]].]]

==Legacy==
Saint Afan was said to have founded the parish of Llanafan in Ceredigion (now [[Llanafan y Trawsgoed]]), whose [[St Afan's Church, Llanafan|present church]] serves as the chapel for the village of [[Llanafan (Ceredigion)|Llanafan]] and the nearby [[Trawsgoed Estate]]. Its grounds house the family crypt of the [[Earl of Lisburne|earls of Lisburne]].

Two churches were dedicated to him in the [[deanery]] of [[Builth]]: [[Llanafan Fawr]] ("Great Llanafan") and Llanafan Fechan or Fach ("Lesser Llanafan"), which eventually became known as [[Llanfechan]].&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt; His [[relic]]s are claimed by Llanafan Fawr, which served as a [[List of Christian pilgrimage sites|pilgrimage site]] during the [[medieval Wales|Middle Ages]]. Saint Afan's grave in the churchyard there is inscribed {{sc|hic iacet sanctus avanus episcopus}} ("Here lies Saint Avan, bishop") in deeply cut, slightly ornamented [[Beneventan script|Lombardic script]]. The present tomb, however, is not older than the late 13th century.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;

Browne Willis also considered the "Saint Afran" honored at [[Llantrisant, Anglesey|Llantrisant]] on [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]] to be a corruption of Afan.&lt;ref name=sabi/&gt;

The tree was split by lightning on July 29, 2011, and was eventually [[Windthrow|knocked down by strong winds]] on or around July 22, 2016.

==Role in film==
Though the film is set in Maine, much of the filming took place in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], and nearby locations. The oak appears near the end of ''The Shawshank Redemption'' when Red (played by [[Morgan Freeman]]) follows clues left by Andy Dufresne (played by [[Tim Robbins]]) to its location. Red finds a box buried at the base of a stone wall in the shade of the oak.&lt;ref name=cleveland /&gt; The box contains a letter from Andy and cash to buy a bus ticket to visit him in Mexico.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; In the film, Andy describes the tree as "like something out of a [[Robert Frost]] poem".&lt;ref name="ClevelandFans"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/movies/index.ssf/2011/08/shawshank_redemption_fan_makes.html | title='Shawshank Redemption' fan makes a pilgrimage to Mansfield and film's iconic tree | work=The Plain Dealer | date=August 20, 2011 | accessdate=July 25, 2016 | author=Simakis, Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2059">{{about|the concept in Christianity in general|the concept in Mormonism|spirit body|the esoteric concept|Subtle body}}

In Christianity, the [[apostle Paul]] introduced the concept of the '''spiritual body''' in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 15:44), describing the resurrection body as "spiritual" (Greek ''"pneumatikos"'') in contrast to the natural (Greek ''"psychikos"'') body:

{{quotation|1 Corinthians 15:42-44  So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.}}

Christian teaching traditionally interprets Paul as comparing the resurrection body with the mortal body,{{cn|date=January 2014}} saying that it will be a different kind of body; a "spiritual body", meaning an [[immortal body]], or [[incorruptible body]] (15:53—54).&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

| quote                 = The New Testament [...] makes a clear distinction between the 'natural' (''psychichos'') human life and the 'life in Christ,' a spiritual (''pneumatikos'') life that a person receives after conversion to Christ and baptism. [...] Rather, it will be a ''different kind of body'': a 'spiritual body,' an immortal, incorruptible body (15:53-54).

'''Systemic design''' is a recent initiative in design that integrates [[systems thinking]] and [[human-centered design]], with the intention of helping designers cope with complex design projects. 
The recent challenges to design coming from the increased complexity caused by globalization, migration, sustainability render traditional design methods insufficient. Designers need better ways to design responsibly and to avoid unintended side-effects. 
Systemic design intends to develop methodologies and approaches that help to integrate systems thinking with design towards sustainability at environmental, social and economic level. It is a pluralistic initiative where many different approaches are encouraged to thrive and where dialogue and organic development of new practices is central.

The systemic design dialogue is driven by the '''Relating Systems Thinking and Design''' (RSD) symposium series resulting in published proceedings and several special issues on systemic design in the scientific design research journal FORMakademisk.

==Academic groups==
Systemic design is being developed within the design practice and through the '''Systemic Design Research Network''', focusing on different aspects of the issue.&lt;ref name="systemic-design.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/sdrn/|title=Systemic Design Research Network « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different academic groups have been facing Systemic Design both in their teaching and researching activities:
*  '''Systems oriented design''' is an example of a systemic design approach being used at the '''Oslo School of Architecture and Design'''. Systems Oriented Design seeks to train the designers ability to cope with a larger degree of complexity and to take more responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Holistic perspectives, ethics and sustainability as well as cultural, organizational, economic, and technical considerations are central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aho.no/en/|title=The Oslo School of Architecture and Design|author=|date=|website=aho.no|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At '''[[Politecnico di Torino]]''', the '''Master of Science in Systemic Design''' is active and it is named after Aurelio Peccei, in that place didactics and research are growing up together.&lt;ref&gt;Barbero, S. (2016). Opportunities and challenges in teaching Systemic Design. The evolution of the Open Systems master courses at Politecnico di Torino. Proceedings of the 6th International Forum of Design as a Process, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, pp. 57-66.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, put forward by Luigi Bistagnino, focuses on the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system, by viewing waste as a valuable resource.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemicdesign.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Research on Systemic Design at Politecnico di Torino is now led by Silvia Barbero.
* The '''Strategic Foresight and innovation master''' program at '''OCAD University''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocadu.ca/academics/graduate-studies/strategic-foresight-and-innovation.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto is a well known systemic design initiative led by Peter H. Jones. Emphasis is placed on teaching complex problem finding, framing and solving, to envision and develop sustainable futures. 
* At the '''[[National Institute of Design]]''' (NID) '''India''' there is a group of academics at the design department, established by late M.P. Ranjan and led by Praween Nahar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/rsd2/teaching-systemic-design/#nahar/|title=Teaching Systemic Design « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems Thinking and Design is part of the academic programme at NID, it involves the application of the systems approach towards complex issues and wicked problems from socio-cultural-economic-environmental perspective with high level of ambiguity, uncertainty and complexity.
* Alex Ryan is leading a group of systemic designers at the '''Government of Alberta.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-overlap/the-alberta-colab-story-2d409ecf747c|title=The Alberta CoLab Story|first=Alex|last=Ryan|date=3 April 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They combine systemic design and strategic foresight to redesign the policy development process in government.

==History==
=== From complexity theories to systemic design ===

The theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, on the basis of the '''General Systems Theory''' by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968).&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, K.L. (1968) General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also '''productive models with their organizations and management''', where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Pisek, P.E. and Wilson, T. (2001) Complexity, Leadership, And Management In Healthcare Organizations, British Medical Journal, Vol.323, pp.746-749.&lt;/ref&gt;). In that field, '''Cluster Theory''' (Porter, 1990 &lt;ref&gt;Porter, M.E. (1990) Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like '''Industrial Ecology''' (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 &lt;ref&gt;Frosh, R.A. and Gallopoulos, N.E. (1989) Strategies for Manufacturing, Scientific American, Vol.3 No.189, pp.94-102.
&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Industrial Symbiosis''' (Chertow, 2000 &lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M.R. (2000) Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and Environment, Vol.25, pp.313-337&lt;/ref&gt;). 
In 1994, '''Gunter Pauli''' and '''Heitor Gurgulino de Souza''' founded the research institute '''Zero Emission Research and Initiatives''' (ZERI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeri.org/|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.zeri.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem.
The '''design thinking''', as Buchanan (1992) said,&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, R. (1992) Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, Design Issues, Vol.8 No.2, pp.5-21.&lt;/ref&gt; means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 &lt;ref&gt;Fuller R.B. (1981), Critical Path, St. Martin’s Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 &lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M. R., Ashton, W. and Kuppali, R. (2004) The Industrial Symbiosis Research Symposium at Yale: Advancing the Study of Industry and Environment, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a '''human-centred systems-oriented design practice''' (Bistagnino, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Bistagnino, L. (2011) Systemic Design: Designing the productive and environmental sustainability, 2nd ed., Slow Food, Bra.&lt;/ref&gt; Sevaldson, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Sevaldson, B. (2011). Gigamapping: Visualization for complexity and systems thinking in design. Proceedings of the Nordic Design Research Conference. Aalto University, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson and Stolterman, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, H.G. and Stolterman, E. (2012). The design way: Intentional change in an unpredictable world, 2nd ed., MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P.H. (2014) ‘Systemic Design Principles for Complex Social Systems’, in Metcalf, G.S. (Eds.), Social Systems and Design, Springer Verlag, Berlin, pp.91-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Toso at al., 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Toso D., Barbero S., Tamborrini P. (2012) Systemic Design: Beyond Ecodesign. Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Sustainable Development Research Conference, University of Hull, UK&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Systemic design today ===

The contemporary debate on Systemic design started with the '''Relating Systems Thinking and Design Symposia series''' (RSD)  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/rsd-symposia/|title=RSD Proceedings « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the initiative of Birger Sevaldson at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in 2012. Amongst the invited participants were Harold Nelson, Peter H. Jones and Alex Ryan. An initial meeting was held in Oslo to consolidate the possibility of building a future network. Other participants were Michael Hensel, Colleen Ponto and others. The RSD seminars started in the context of Systems Oriented Design (SOD). In 2013-14 a discussion was initiated by Birger Sevaldson questioning the framework of the new emerging network. The network changed its name to Systemic Design allowing it to grow more pluralistically while SOD could develop more specially. The Systemic Design Research Network was founded shortly after on the initiative of Peter H. Jones and with Harold Nelson, Alex Ryan and Birger Sevaldson as co-founders.&lt;ref name="systemic-design.net"/&gt;

==Background==
Systems thinking in design has a long history with people like Christpher Alexander, Horst Rittel,  Russl Ackoff, Bela Banathy, Ranulph Glanville, M.P.Ranjan, Harold Nelson and others. Also the main systems theories and models were known and applied in design since their beginning. Despite this Systems Thinking has never become mainstream in design. The reasons for this might be that the prescribed techniques and approaches were too technical and did not fit well to an organic design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/4645-feature-article-learning-the-lessons-of-systems-thinking-exploring-the-gap-between-thinking-and-leadership/|title=Feature Article: Learning the Lessons of Systems Thinking: Exploring the Gap between Thinking and Leadership - Integral Leadership Review|author=|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systemic design initiative is addressing this problem by seeking new connections and relations between systems thinking and designerly ways of working.

In June and July 2018, a widely publicised [[cave rescue]] successfully extracted members of a junior [[Association football|football]] team trapped in [[Tham Luang Nang Non]] cave in [[Chiang Rai Province]], [[Thailand]]. Twelve members of the team, aged eleven to seventeen, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23 June after football practice. Shortly afterwards, heavy rains partially flooded the cave, trapping the group inside.

Efforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and no contact was made for more than a week. The rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest. On 2 July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers [[John Volanthen]] and [[Richard Stanton (cave diver)|Richard Stanton]] found the group alive on an elevated rock about {{convert|4|km}} from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic [[Underwater diving|diving skills]] to enable their early rescue, wait until a new entrance was found or drilled, or wait for the floodwaters to subside at the end of the [[monsoon season]] months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from rain, the rescue teams hastened to get everyone out before the next [[monsoon]] rain, which was expected to bring a potential {{convert|52|mm|in|abbr=on}} of additional rainfall and was predicted to start around 11 July. 
Between 8 and 10 July, all of the boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.&lt;ref name="Ars_Technica"&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Peterman|url=https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/07/risky-thailand-cave-rescue-relied-on-talent-luck-and-on-sticking-to-the-rules/#p3|title=Risky Thailand cave rescue relied on talent, luck—and on sticking to the rules|work=Ars Technica|date=22 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rescue effort involved more than 10,000 people, including over 100 divers, many rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers and 2,000 soldiers, and required ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, more than 700 diving cylinders, and the pumping of more than a billion litres of water out of the caves.

There was one fatality, Saman Kunan, a 37-year-old former [[Naval Special Warfare Command (Thailand)|Thai Navy SEAL]] who died of [[asphyxiation]] on 6 July while returning to a staging base in the cave after delivering [[Diving cylinder|supplies of air]].

Tham Luang Nang Non is a [[karstic]] cave complex beneath [[Doi Nang Non]], a mountain range on the border between [[Thailand]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The system is {{convert|10|km}} long and has many deep recesses, narrow passages and tunnels winding under hundreds of metres of [[limestone]] strata. Since part of the cave system is seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July–November) is posted at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/2018-07-03-watch--agonising-rescue-ahead-for-thai-cave-boys-as-nation-rejoices/ Dispatch Live: WATCH | Agonising rescue ahead for Thai cave boys as nation rejoices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703140012/https://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/2018-07-03-watch--agonising-rescue-ahead-for-thai-cave-boys-as-nation-rejoices/ |date=3 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 23 June 2018, a group of twelve boys aged between 11 and 17 from a local junior football team named the ''Wild Boars'' and their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkaphon Chanthawong,&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|eakatol|เอกพล จันทะวงษ์}}.&lt;/ref&gt; went missing after setting out to explore the cave.

Around 7 p.m., head coach Nopparat Khanthawong ({{lang-th|นพรัตน์ กัณฑะวงษ์}}) checked his phone, finding about twenty missed calls from parents worried that their children had not come home. Nopparat dialed assistant coach Chanthawong, followed by a number of the boys in quick succession. Eventually, he reached Songpon Kanthawong, a 13-year-old member of the team who mentioned he was picked up after practice, and that the rest of the boys had gone exploring in the Tham Luang caves. The coach raced up to the caves finding abandoned bicycles and bags near the entrance, with water seeping out of the muddy pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mahtani |first1=Shibani |title=‘He loved them more than himself’: How a 25-year-old former monk kept the Thai soccer team alive |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/he-loved-them-more-than-himself-how-a-25-year-old-former-monk-kept-the-thai-soccer-team-alive/2018/07/07/b4100076-815e-11e8-b3b5-b61896f90919_story.html |work=The Washington Post |date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alerted authorities to the missing group after seeing their unclaimed belongings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2154269/how-25-year-old-ex-monk-kept-thai-cave-boys-alive-and-won|title=How a 25-year-old ex-monk kept the Thai cave boys alive – and won the hearts of their parents|date= 8 July 2018|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assistant coach and three of the boys had no nationality. Nopparat Khanthavong, the founder of the ''Wild Boars'' team, explained that they are from tribes in [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|an area that extends across Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and China]]. This region has no clear borders and people are not assigned passports. Their [[statelessness]] deprived them of basic benefits and rights, including the possibility to leave the Chiang Rai province. "To get nationality is the biggest hope for the boys", Khanthavong said. "In the past, these boys have problems traveling to play matches outside of Chiang Rai because of their nationless status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bacon |first1=John |title=Video shows rescued Thai soccer players waving to parents, loved ones |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/11/thai-cave-rescue-how-100-heroes-came-together-save-12-boys-coach/774339002/ |work=USA Today |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the team's rescue, Thai officials promised to provide the three boys and the coach with legal assistance in obtaining Thai citizenship, a process which they said could take up to six months.&lt;ref name="Stateless"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-cave-latest-rescued-boys-citizenship-coach-stateless-trapped-chiang-rai-a8445516.html | title='Stateless' Thai boys and coach to be given citizenship after cave rescue | work=The Independent | access-date=13 July 2018 | language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September, the boys and the coach were granted Thai citizenship.&lt;ref name="Citizenship_obtained"&gt;{{cite web |title=Thai cave rescue: stateless boys and coach granted citizenship |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/thai-cave-rescue-stateless-boys-and-coach-granted-citizenship |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and preparation==
[[File:Thai cave.png|thumb|Rescue camp near Tham Luang cave]]

A logistics camp was established at the cave entrance, which accommodated hundreds of volunteers and journalists in addition to the rescue workers. The site was divided into several zones: restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civilian rescuers, an area for the relatives to give them privacy, and areas for the press and for the general public.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44736582|title=Thai cave boys unite community in hope|last=Cheung|first=Helier|date=6 July 2018|work=''BBC News''|access-date=6 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706145318/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44736582|archivedate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 10,000 people contributed to the rescue effort, including more than 100 divers, representatives from about 100 government agencies, 900 police officers, 2,000 soldiers and numerous volunteers. Equipment included ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, and more than 700 diving cylinders, of which more than 500 were in the cave at any time while another 200 were in the queue to be refilled. More than a billion litres of water (the equivalent of 400 Olympic-size swimming pools) were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dvorak,  Phred |author2=Watts, Jake Maxwell |title=The Thai Cave Rescue, Before Its Triumph, Teetered on the Brink of Disaster |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-thai-cave-rescue-before-its-triumph-teetered-on-the-brink-of-disaster-1531346977 |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180712"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beech |first1=Hannah |last2=Paddock |first2=Richard C. |last3=Suhartono |first3=Muktita |title=‘Still Can’t Believe It Worked’: The Story of the Thailand Cave Rescue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/world/asia/thailand-cave-rescue-seals.html |date=12 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Water pumping near Tham Luang cave.jpg|thumb|Pumps used to drain water from the cave and downstream lakes]]
From the outset rescue workers battled rising water levels. In an effort to de-water the cave, a stone diversion dam was built upstream and systems were installed to pump water out of the cave and divert flows that were entering it. On 4 July, it was estimated that the pumps were removing {{convert|1,600,000|l/hour|gal/hour|abbr=on}} from the cave, ruining nearby farm fields in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/03/asia/thai-rescue-next-phase-intl/index.html|title=Thailand cave rescue: Search teams unsure how to free boys|first=Steve|last=George|first2=Kocha|last2=Olarn|publisher=CNN|accessdate=6 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705061904/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/03/asia/thai-rescue-next-phase-intl/index.html|archivedate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thai-cave-rescue-farmers-happy-even-though-fields-ruined-to-help-clear-exit-for-trapped|title=Thai cave rescue: Farmers happy even though fields ruined to help clear exit for trapped boys|last=hermesauto|date=5 July 2018|journal=The Straits Times|accessdate=6 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706022153/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thai-cave-rescue-farmers-happy-even-though-fields-ruined-to-help-clear-exit-for-trapped|archivedate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, well-meaning volunteers inadvertently pumped water back into the [[groundwater]] supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand cave rescue: Volunteers inadvertently pumped water back into tunnels |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/05/thailand-cave-race-drain-water-caverns-before-new-rains-arrive/758692002/ |work=USA Today |accessdate=5 July 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705065536/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/07/05/thailand-cave-race-drain-water-caverns-before-new-rains-arrive/758692002/ |archivedate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helped by a spell of unseasonably dry weather, these efforts reduced water levels by {{convert|1.5|cm|1}} per hour on 5 July, enabling rescue teams to walk {{convert|1.5|km}} into the cave.

On 6 July, the oxygen level in the cave was detected to have dropped, raising fears that the boys might develop [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] if they remained for a prolonged time.

==Rescue==
On the morning of 8 July, officials instructed the media and all non-essential personnel around the cave entrance to clear the area as a rescue operation was imminent, due to the threat of monsoon rains later in the week, which were expected to flood the cave until October.  

For the first part of the extraction, eighteen rescue divers consisting of thirteen international cave divers and five Thai Navy SEALs were sent into the caves to retrieve the boys, with one diver to accompany each boy on the dive out.&lt;ref name="FourCornersABC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Key phase of the rescue operation to bring the boys out of Tham Luang Nang Non Cave begins |url=https://www.caverescue.org.uk/key-phase-of-the-rescue-operation-to-bring-the-boys-out-of-tham-luang-nang-non-cave-begins/ |publisher=British Cave Rescue Council |accessdate=4 August 2018 |date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SunTim15Jul"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Josh |title=Thai cave rescue: Perth hero diver Craig Challen speaks on life and death mission |url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/thai-cave-rescue-perth-hero-diver-craig-challen-speaks-on-life-and-death-mission-ng-b88895946z |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=The Sunday Times |publisher=PerthNow |date=15 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/news/wa/thai-cave-rescue-perth-hero-diver-craig-challen-speaks-on-life-and-death-mission-ng-b88895946z |archivedate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were conflicting reports that the boys were rescued with the weakest first or strongest first.

He also passed on a message in which he apologised for putting the children in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mahtani |first1=Shibani |title='He loved them more than himself': How a 25-year-old former monk kept the Thai soccer team alive |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/he-loved-them-more-than-himself-how-a-25-year-old-former-monk-kept-the-thai-soccer-team-alive/2018/07/07/b4100076-815e-11e8-b3b5-b61896f90919_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709215206/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/he-loved-them-more-than-himself-how-a-25-year-old-former-monk-kept-the-thai-soccer-team-alive/2018/07/07/b4100076-815e-11e8-b3b5-b61896f90919_story.html?utm_term=.251328379eff |archive-date=9 July 2018 |dead-url=no |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How coach Chanthawong helped trapped Thai boys survive inside the cave |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-coach-chanthawong-helped-trapped-thai-boys-survive-inside-the-cave/articleshow/64920599.cms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709215226/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-coach-chanthawong-helped-trapped-thai-boys-survive-inside-the-cave/articleshow/64920599.cms |archive-date=9 July 2018 |dead-url=no |work=[[The Times of India]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=9 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai authorities said the rescued boys were able to eat [[Congee#Thailand|rice porridge]], but more complex foods would be withheld for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44772783|title=Cave divers ready to rescue last five|date=9 July 2018|work=''BBC News''|access-date=9 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709215318/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44772783|archivedate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Thai Health Ministry]] said the boys lost an average of {{convert|2|kg}} each, but were in "good condition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai cave rescue: Boys lost two kilograms during weeks in cave |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/asia/thai-cave-rescue-aftermath-intl/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 July 2018 |date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys were quarantined while health workers determined whether they had caught any [[Infection|infectious diseases]], and they were expected to remain hospitalised for at least one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/asia/thai-cave-rescue-mission-intl/index.html | title = Thai rescue: Hopes high 4 boys, coach will be freed from cave Tuesday | first = Euan | last = McKirdy | date = 9 July 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = CNN | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180710030312/https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/asia/thai-cave-rescue-mission-intl/index.html | archivedate = 10 July 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the prolonged stay in the damp cave environment, officials were worried about potential [[infection]]s such as [[histoplasmosis]] or [[leptospirosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-accident-cave-medics/mammoth-medical-operation-awaits-trapped-thai-cave-boys-idUSKBN1JX0R6|title=Mammoth medical operation awaits trapped Thai cave boys|last=Tanakasempipat|first=Patpicha|work=Reuters|access-date=11 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of the team members initially visited looking through a window, but if laboratory results proved negative, they would be allowed to visit in person while wearing a medical gown, face mask and hair cap.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/10/thailand-cave-rescue-team-begin-operation-to-free-last-of-trapped-boys|title=Thai cave rescue operation ends with all 12 boys safe|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=10 July 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boys wore sunglasses as a precaution while their eyes adjusted to daylight. Detailed tests of their eyes, nutrition, mental health and blood were carried out. A Health Ministry physician said all the boys showed [[Leukocytosis|an increase in white blood cells]], so preventive [[antibiotic]] doses were given to the entire team.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Responses==

===Local===
Residents of Chiang Rai province volunteered to cook, clean for, and otherwise support the missing team's families and the rescue teams at the encampment by the cave mouth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social media were used to draw attention to the rescue attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Classmates and teachers of the team spent time chanting and praying for the missing boys.&lt;ref name="bangkokpost_classmates" /&gt; Classmates of one of the boys made [[One thousand origami cranes|1,000 paper cranes]] for him, while praying for his safe return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-44818356/thai-cave-rescue-classmates-paper-cranes-of-hope-for-adul|title=Paper cranes of hope for Thai cave rescue|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local schools donated money to help the parents with living costs, as many of them stopped working in order to follow the rescue attempts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

On 29 June, Prime Minister [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] visited the search site and told the families of the boys not to give up hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/thailand-cave-rescue-news-live-updates-form-tham-luang-as-us-and-british-join-search-for-12-missing-a3874151.html|title=Families cling to hope as Thai cave rescue enters day seven|work=London Evening Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629164840/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/thailand-cave-rescue-news-live-updates-form-tham-luang-as-us-and-british-join-search-for-12-missing-a3874151.html|archivedate=29 June 2018|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Saman Kunan, King [[Rama X]] announced that he would sponsor Kunan's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/former-navy-diver-dies-in-thai-cave-while-working-to-re-1827388430|title=Former Navy Diver Dies in Thai Cave While Working to Rescue Trapped Boys|last1=Dvorsky|first1=George|website=Gizmodo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709065038/https://gizmodo.com/former-navy-diver-dies-in-thai-cave-while-working-to-re-1827388430|archivedate=9 July 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rescue was completed, the boys' families, the rescue commander, military officials, and the thousands of volunteers gathered at the cave entrance. The group gave thanks for the lives saved and asked forgiveness from the cave goddess "Jao Mae Tham" for the intrusion of pumps, ropes and people during the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-16/ceremony-to-appease-the-cave-goddess-disturbed-by-thai-rescue/9999324|title=Thais hold ceremony to appease cave goddess disturbed by soccer team's rescue|date=16 July 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=16 July 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Opinions about assistant coach ====
Some observers, primarily in Western media, questioned whether assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong should face criminal charges for leading the group into the caves, despite the warning sign at the entrance stating that it is dangerous to enter between July and November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-16/chided-west-cave-rescued-coach-seen-saintly-thailand|title=Chided in the West, cave-rescued coach is seen as saintly in Thailand|work=Public Radio International|access-date=19 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys had entered the cave on 23 June, one week before the advised period. Local communities, as well as the boys' parents, emphasised that they did not blame the boys or their coach, as the rain had arrived a month earlier than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/thai-cave-rescue-british-divers-intl/index.html|title=British diver on Thai cave rescue: 'Are we heroes? No'|last=CNN|first=Rebecca Wright and Hilary Clarke,|work=CNN|access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, "Nobody’s to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky ... It wasn’t just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels". Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24 June, when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/if-the-brits-hadn-t-been-called-in-it-would-have-been-too-late-qhdpbw8bm|title=Exclusive interview with Thai cave dive hero Vernon Unsworth: ‘If the Brits hadn’t been called in, it would have been too late’|last=Sai|first=Philip Sherwell, Mae|date=15 July 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=15 July 2018|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the police chief told the newspaper ''[[Khao Sod]]'' that he "hadn't ruled out" pressing [[negligence]] charges against the coach for putting the team in danger, no calls were made to take legal action against him. A number of lawyers stated that the coach would probably not face criminal charges, since [[Law of Thailand|Thai law]] also takes into consideration whether a person has malicious intent. In mainstream media, Ekkaphon has widely been held 'a hero' and was a "calm voice [that] helped boys to beat despair in the darkness."&lt;ref name="thetimes_pzl8h8crt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/he-s-the-one-i-trust-coach-praised-as-real-hero-in-thai-cave-saga-20180709-p4zqgc.html|title='He’s the one I trust': Coach praised as 'real hero' in Thai cave saga|last=Massola|first=James|date=9 July 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coach-ekkapol-the-unlikely-stateless-hero-of-thai-cave-drama|title=Coach Ekkapol, the unlikely stateless hero of Thai cave drama|last=Agencies|first=|date=11 July 2018|work=The Straits Times|access-date=15 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coach was reported to have treated the boys with care, giving them his food, helping them remain calm, and instructing them to drink the relatively clean water dripping from the cave walls, instead of the murky floodwaters that trapped them. 

When asked if Ekkaphon should be held legally responsible for negligence, Mongkhon Bunpiam, the father of 12-year-old Mongkhon, rejected the suggestion: “We would never do that...the boys love their coach...and we as parents don’t want it either. Coach Ekk has been good to my boy, and now I hear how he gave them hope, and kept them calm for so many days without food. I have great admiration for him.”&lt;ref name="thetimes_pzl8h8crt"/&gt; Tanawut Vibulrungruang, father of 11-year old Chanin, was reported to be "touched by the actions of the team's coach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">'''''The Immortals''''' is a sequence of novels written by [[Alyson Noël]], focusing on psychics and immortals. The first two books, ''[[Evermore (novel)|Evermore]]'' and ''[[Blue Moon (Noel novel)|Blue Moon]]'', are [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Bestsellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | title=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Since a horrible accident claimed the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever can see auras, hear people’s thoughts, and know a person’s life story by touch. Going out of her way to shield herself from human contact to suppress her abilities has branded her as a freak at her new high school—but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste.

Damen is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets.  Ever doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Damen is equal parts light and dark, and he belongs to an enchanted new world where no one ever dies.

'''Todd Bertuzzi''' (born February 2, 1975) is a Canadian retired professional [[ice hockey]] [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). Known as a [[power forward (ice hockey)|power forward]], he has played in the NHL for the [[New York Islanders]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Florida Panthers]], [[Anaheim Ducks]], [[Calgary Flames]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]].

Selected 23rd overall by the New York Islanders in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]], he played at the [[junior ice hockey|junior]] level with the [[Guelph Storm]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) for four seasons. In [[1995–96 NHL season|1995–96]], he played his rookie season with the Islanders. After two-and-a-half seasons with the Islanders, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Bertuzzi enjoyed the most successful seasons of his career with the Canucks—his longest tenured team in the NHL—including [[NHL All-Star Team|NHL First Team All-Star]] honours in [[2002–03 NHL season|2003]].

After seven-and-a-half seasons with Vancouver, Bertuzzi was dealt to the Florida Panthers, with whom he briefly played for until being traded again to the Red Wings. He then played single seasons with the Anaheim Ducks and the Calgary Flames before returning to Detroit in [[2009–10 NHL season|2009]] and finishing his career there. Internationally, Bertuzzi has competed for [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] at the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], as well as the [[1998 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1998]] and [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2000 World Championships]].

==Playing career==

===Guelph Storm (1991–95)===
After playing for two [[minor ice hockey|minor hockey]] teams based out of [[Sudbury, Ontario]] in 1990–91, Bertuzzi was selected in the first round (fifth overall) by the [[Guelph Storm]] in the 1991 [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) Priority Selection. His future coach with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Marc Crawford]], passed on Bertuzzi during the draft while he was general manager of the [[Cornwall Royals]]; he has recalled not selecting him due to "maturity issues" and that he was "a big kid who hadn't grown into his body yet."&lt;ref name=force/&gt; Bertuzzi started his OHL career for Guelph in [[1991–92 OHL season|1991–92]], recording 21 points over 42 games as a rookie. He missed the last 15 games of the regular season due to suspension as a result of kicking opposing defenceman Brad Barton during a contest between the Storm and [[Kitchener Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simmons |first=Steve |title=Big Bert's a problem |work=Calgary Sun |date=March 11, 2004 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Irrational moment blamed|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/648376651.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+11%2C+2004&amp;author=TOM+CONAWAY&amp;pub=Waterloo+Region+Record&amp;desc=Irrational+moment+blamed&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=April 12, 2011|date=March 11, 2004|work=[[The Toronto Star]]|first=Tom|last=Conaway}}&lt;/ref&gt; After improving to 58 points over 60 games in [[1992–93 OHL season|1992–93]], he was selected 23rd overall by the [[New York Islanders]] in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]]. The [[NHL Central Scouting Bureau]] described Bertuzzi as a physical and strong player with good skating who [[bodycheck|checks]] hard and is offensively effective in close proximity to the net.&lt;ref name=ring/&gt;

Following his NHL draft, he underwent surgery for chipped bones in his left elbow in August 1993.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Islanders Rookie Hopes to Make Impact|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/sports/hockey-an-islander-rookie-hopes-to-make-impact.html|accessdate=June 17, 2010|date=September 9, 1993|author=Joe Lapointe|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was unable to participate in the Islanders' training camp in September and was returned to the OHL.&lt;ref name="of age"/&gt; Playing in his third season for Guelph, he improved to 28 goals and 82 points over 61 games. Bertuzzi competed for an Islanders' roster spot at their 1994 training camp, but was sent back to his junior team after going scoreless in three exhibition games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Owners, players far apart|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qrscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aHwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6481,660962&amp;dq=todd+bertuzzi&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 17, 2010|date=September 21, 1994|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|agency=Associated Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|publisher=Diane McFarlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his last campaign with Guelph in [[1994–95 OHL season|1994–95]], he recorded 119 points – sixth overall in the league.&lt;ref name=1995ohl&gt;{{cite web|title=1994-95 OHL League Leaders|url=http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/top_league.php?lid=ohl1989&amp;sid=1995&amp;leaguenm=OHL|accessdate=February 27, 2011|publisher=Hockeydb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 54 goals established a single-season team record, beating [[Mike Prokopec]]'s mark, set the previous year, by two goals.&lt;ref name="guelph goals record"&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise All-Time Stats Per Season for Guelph Storm|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/team_all-time_stats_per_season.php?team=552&amp;alltime=G|accessdate=February 27, 2011|publisher=EliteProspects.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Storm's forward tandem of Bertuzzi and [[Jeff O'Neill]], who finished fourth in league scoring,&lt;ref name=1995ohl/&gt; led the club to the best regular season record in the league. He went on to add a team-leading 33 points in 14 playoff games, en route to an OHL Finals loss to the [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHL Team Standings 1994-95|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/standings.php?league=OHL&amp;startdate=1994|accessdate=February 27, 2011|publisher=EliteProspects.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four seasons with Guelph, he left the club ranked third all-time in career points with 280, behind O'Neill and [[Martin St. Pierre (ice hockey)|Martin St. Pierre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Franchise All-Time Stats for Guelph Storm|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/team_all-time_stats.php?team=552&amp;alltime=TP|accessdate=February 27, 2011|publisher=EliteProspects.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Islanders (1995–98)===
Two years after his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders had not yet been agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi eligible to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager [[Don Maloney]] made it apparent that he would use the team's second overall pick in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]] to select him again if a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date.&lt;ref name=reluctant&gt;{{cite news|title=A Reluctant Draftee May Have No Choice|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-07-06/sports/17984786_1_salary-cap-islanders-todd-bertuzzi|author=Colin Stephenson|work=[[New York Daily News]]|location=New York|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=July 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, [[United States dollar|US$]]4.6 million contract.&lt;ref name=dynamic&gt;{{cite news|title=Young Duo Is Dynamic to Milbury|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-07-18/sports/17979606_1_mini-camp-islanders-don-maloney|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=July 18, 1995|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman|author=Colin Stephenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect [[Brett Lindros]] – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed the previous summer.&lt;ref name=reluctant/&gt;

During training camp in September 1995, Islanders head coach [[Mike Milbury]] heralded Bertuzzi as the team's best performing forward.&lt;ref name="of age"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertuzzi Comes of Age for Isle|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-09-29/sports/17990008_1_todd-bertuzzi-zigmund-palffy-islanders|author=Colin Stephenson|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman|date=September 29, 1995|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making his NHL debut on October 7, 1995, he scored a [[Glossary of ice hockey terms#W|wrap around]] goal against goaltender [[Blaine Lacher]] in a 4–4 tie with the [[Boston Bruins]].&lt;ref name="top line"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Top Line Shows Promise for Islanders|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/08/sports/hockey-new-top-line-shows-promise-for-islanders.html|accessdate=August 19, 2008|date=October 8, 1995 | work=[[The New York Times]] | location= New York | author=Jason Diamos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in depth"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Depth: Todd Bertuzzi|url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=454389|accessdate=February 27, 2011|date=December 26, 2008|publisher=[[Calgary Flames]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning the season on the team's top line with [[Žigmund Pálffy]] and [[Travis Green]],&lt;ref name="top line"/&gt; Bertuzzi finished his rookie year with 18 goals and 39 points over 76 games. The [[1996–97 NHL season|following season]], Bertuzzi recorded 23 points in 64 games. The Islanders did not qualify for the playoffs in either of his two full seasons with the club, ranking second-last in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] in 1995–96 and 1996–97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1995-96 Standings|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19951996&amp;type=con|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1996-97 Standings|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19961997&amp;type=con|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertuzzi's playing style as a [[power forward (ice hockey)|power forward]] resulted in comparisons to former Islander [[Clark Gillies]]. As a result, the club hired Gillies to personally mentor Bertuzzi. Failing to meet lofty expectations from the club, Gillies once said of Bertuzzi, "If you're built like a freight train, you can't drive around like a Volkswagen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Gillies' night but ex-Isle Bertuzzi is in his heyday|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-12-03/sports/18217123_1_todd-bertuzzi-islanders-freight-train|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=December 3, 2002|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling burdened with the pressure of playing up to the club's expectations while his offensive production diminished, he requested to be traded away at one point during the 1996–97 season. In response, Milbury, who had also taken over general manager duties the previous season, demoted Bertuzzi to the Islanders' minor league affiliate, the [[Utah Grizzlies (1995–2005)|Utah Grizzlies]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL).&lt;ref name=force/&gt; Playing 13 games in the minors, he registered 10 points before being called back up to the NHL. During the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 campaign]], he continued to score below his pace as a rookie. On February 6, 1998, he was traded along with defenceman [[Bryan McCabe]] and a third-round selection in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]] ([[Jarkko Ruutu]]) to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for veteran forward [[Trevor Linden]]. The deal was made prior to the NHL's roster freeze in preparation for the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=linden/&gt;

Bertuzzi and McCabe had both been widely regarded as the players of the future for New York after their respective drafts in 1993.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; While Milbury expressed regret at having to trade McCabe, relations between Bertuzzi and the club were strained. Welcoming the trade, Bertuzzi commented that "things weren't working out [in New York]."&lt;ref name=linden&gt;{{cite news|title=Isles get Linden for 2 Young Players|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C1EFB3B590C748CDDAB0894D0494D81|accessdate=February 14, 2011|date=February 7, 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York|first=Tarik|last=El-Bashir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vancouver Canucks (1998–2006)===
Bertuzzi immediately began producing with Vancouver, tallying 15 points in 22 games after the trade. Combined with his totals from New York, he finished with 33 points over 74 games in [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98]]. Contrasting his strained relationship with Milbury in New York, Canucks head coach [[Mike Keenan]] has recalled his experience with Bertuzzi upon his arrival as positive: "He came as a young player and he was very open-minded about learning about the game."&lt;ref name="in depth"/&gt; Similar to the Islanders, Bertuzzi joined a struggling club in Vancouver; the team finished last in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] in his first two seasons after the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1997-98 Standings|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19971998&amp;type=con|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1998-99 Standings|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19981999&amp;type=con|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beginning the [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99 season]] on the Canucks' top line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Injury-Prone Canucks Lose Mogilny|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/11/22/archive/main23282.shtml|accessdate=June 4, 2008|date=November 22, 1998|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, the first of which was a fractured [[tibia]]. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate [[Mattias Öhlund]] hit him in the leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Forsberg scores first goal|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D1FFE3A5B0C708CDDA80994D0494D81|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=November 4, 1998|location=New York|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His season was later ended with a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999.&lt;ref name=1999contract/&gt; He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a [[restricted free agent]] and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' to be worth a little over $2 million.&lt;ref name=1999contract&gt;{{cite news|title=Canucks re-sign Bertuzzi|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8A1E2FC780BFD5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=September 3, 1999|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from injury the following season, Bertuzzi emerged as one of the Canucks' best offensive contributors, finishing with 25 goals (second on the team to [[Markus Näslund]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vancouver Canucks - Goals 1999-2000|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=20002VANSASAll&amp;sort=goals&amp;viewName=summary|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 50 points in [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000]]. At the end of the season, he received the team's [[Most Exciting Player Award]], as voted by the fans. He received the distinction three more times during his career with the Canucks from 2002 to 2004).&lt;ref name="media guide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vancouver Canucks Media Guide 2008–09|publisher=[[Vancouver Canucks]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Canucks began improving as a team, finishing four points out of a playoff spot in the West in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1999-2000 Standings|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=19992000&amp;type=con|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Bertuzzi recorded his first career NHL [[hat trick]], recording all three goals on the [[power play (sport)|power play]] against [[San Jose Sharks]] goaltender [[Evgeni Nabokov]] in a 6–3 win on December 30, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canucks vs. Sharks|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores100/100365/100365348.htm|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=December 31, 2000|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Company|location=McLean, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertuzzi recorded a second consecutive 25-goal season in [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]], adding 30 assists for 55 points, third in team scoring behind Näslund and [[Andrew Cassels]]. His -18 [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|plus-minus]] rating, however, was a team-worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Canucks 2000–2001 Total Points|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=20012VANSASAll&amp;sort=points&amp;viewName=summary|accessdate=February 14, 2011|publisher=National Hockey League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canucks continued to improve, qualifying for the post-season for the first time in five years. Entering the [[2001 Stanley Cup playoffs|2001 playoffs]] as the final and eighth [[seed (sports)|seed]] in the West, they were eliminated in the first round by the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. Bertuzzi scored two goals and two assists over four games in his first NHL post-season appearance. In the off-season, Bertuzzi filed for [[salary arbitration]] after initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hockey|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5VgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c3ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4634,4351705&amp;dq=todd+bertuzzi+contract&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=July 27, 2001|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=Block Communications|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year deal on July 26, 2001.&lt;ref name=tsn&gt;{{cite web|title=Todd Bertuzzi|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=943|accessdate=March 3, 2011|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Todd Bertuzzi (Canucks).jpg|thumb|left|Bertuzzi spent seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks.]]
In the first month of the [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02 season]], Bertuzzi received an automatic 10-game suspension from the league (forfeiting $118,557 in salary) after leaving the bench to help teammate [[Ed Jovanovski]] in a [[fighting in ice hockey|fight]].

===Binghamton Senators Tryout and Retirement (2015)===
On January 9, 2015 he signed a professional tryout contract with the [[Ottawa Senators]] [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate the [[Binghamton Senators]] in hopes to get a contract with Ottawa.
Bertuzzi was released from his professional tryout offer with Binghamton on January 21, 2015, after posting no points and a minus-3 rating in his 2 games played with the Senators. He subsequently retired that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertuzzi catches the coaching bug|url=http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/2016/01/15/bertuzzi-catches-coaching-bug-after-retirement-bringing-his-oakland-grizzlies-from-michigan-to-peterboroughs-midget-tournament-of-champions-this-weekend|publisher=The Peterborough Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International play==
Bertuzzi debuted internationally for [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] at the [[1998 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1998 World Championships]] in [[Switzerland]].  He was among the youngest players selected to the team, along with Canucks teammate Bryan McCabe and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] forward [[Eric Dazé]], who were all born in 1975 (third-string goaltender [[Christian Bronsard]] was two years younger, but did not play in any games).&lt;ref name=98wc&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 IIHF World Men's Championship|url=http://hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/4726/la_id/1.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In six games, he recorded three points, as Canada failed to qualify for the medal rounds.&lt;ref name=98wc/&gt;

Two years later, Bertuzzi competed at the [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2000 World Championships]] in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. One of five Canucks players chosen to the national team, he was joined by [[Adrian Aucoin]], Ed Jovanovski, Brendan Morrison and [[Peter Schaefer (ice hockey)|Peter Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Team Canada Roster|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/cs/pg000093.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second tournament appearance was more productive, as he scored nine points in nine games – first among Canadian players and fourth overall –&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring Leaders|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/gs/pg000026.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also leading the tournament in penalty minutes with 47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Penalized Players|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/gs/pg000023.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada did not medal, losing to [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] in the bronze medal game by a 2–1 score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Round|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/cs/pg000027.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 63 total penalty minutes from both tournament appearances set an all-time Canadian record for World Championship competitors since 1977 (when Canada resumed competing in the tournament).

In December 2005, Bertuzzi was controversially selected to play for Team Canada at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin, Italy]]. His inclusion, along with that of [[Dany Heatley]] and [[Shane Doan]],{{#tag:ref|Heatley was on probation after pleading guilty to [[vehicular homicide]] in 2005, while Doan had been previously accused of uttering a racial slur at a [[Québécois people|Francophone]] referee during an NHL game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The List of Shame?|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=c0e31e6e-b2b5-48a4-ba0e-ee5a0b8cda95&amp;sponsor=|accessdate=June 8, 2011|date=December 23, 2005|work=[[National Post]]|location=Toronto|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110112948/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=c0e31e6e-b2b5-48a4-ba0e-ee5a0b8cda95&amp;sponsor=|archivedate=November 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} was discussed at length by the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] (COC).

{{main|Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident}}
On February 16, 2004, during a game between Vancouver and Colorado, Avalanche center [[Steve Moore (ice hockey)|Steve Moore]] checked Markus Näslund in the head, causing a minor concussion and a bone chip in his elbow.&lt;ref name="moore statement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Moore's victim impact statement|url=http://swo.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20041223/moore_statement_041223?hub=TorontoNewHome|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=December 23, 2004|publisher=[[CTV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Näslund missed three games as a result of the hit. In a rematch, Bertuzzi began following Moore around the ice, attempting to provoke him into another fight. With Moore ignoring him, Bertuzzi grabbed Moore's jersey from behind and punched him in the back of the head, with Moore's face hitting the ice as they both fell down. Bertuzzi, as well as several other players from both teams, landed atop Moore as he fell to the ice.&lt;ref name="Headfirst"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1756628|title=Suspension amounts to minimum 17 games|accessdate=February 27, 2007|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=March 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertuzzi was assessed a [[penalty (ice hockey)#Match penalty|match penalty]] and ejected from the game.

On March 11, 2004, the league ruled he would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, which ultimately cost him the final 13 games of the regular season plus seven playoff games. The Canucks were additionally fined $250,000.&lt;ref name="Headfirst"/&gt; While the following NHL season was suspended due to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05 lockout]], Bertuzzi intended to play in Europe, but the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) extended his NHL suspension to cover their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IIHF rules Bertuzzi can't play in Europe|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/hockey/2002123533_nhl18.html|accessdate=February 14, 2011|date=December 18, 2004|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=Frank A.

===Legal actions===
After a four-month investigation, the criminal justice branch of the [[Attorney General of British Columbia]] announced formal charges of [[assault causing bodily harm]] against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertuzzi charged with assault|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2004/06/24/bertuzzi040624.html|accessdate=March 3, 2011|date=June 24, 2004|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref name="ontario suit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Moore files another lawsuit against Bertuzzi|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/11373324/|accessdate=February 28, 2011|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a [[plea bargain]] with prosecutors. He was given a [[conditional discharge]] requiring 80 hours of [[community service]] and one year's [[probation]] that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a [[lawsuit]] in a Colorado court against Bertuzzi, numerous individuals within the Canucks organization, including Brad May (Bertuzzi's teammate at the time who was quoted as saying that there would "definitely be a price on Moore's head" after Moore's hit on Näslund), Brian Burke, Marc Crawford, as well as the Canucks organization as a whole and the [[Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment]] company that owned the team.

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed another lawsuit in the [[Ontario Superior Court]] against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and Orca Bay, seeking [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, CAD$1 million for aggravated damages, and CAD$2 million for punitive damages.

==Personal life==
Bertuzzi was born and raised in [[Sudbury, Ontario]]. His father, Albert Bertuzzi, is an [[Italian-Canadian]] who worked in the window-washing business. When Bertuzzi was a teenager, Albert survived a near-fatal car accident in which he was thrown from the vehicle through the windshield. His father has stated that he was proud of his own local reputation as a "dirty player" and referred to it as a "Bertuzzi trait".&lt;ref name=force&gt;{{cite news|title=Force of nature|url=http://espn.go.com/magazine/vol5no21bertuzzi.html|accessdate=February 14, 2011|date=September 30, 2002|work=[[ESPN Magazine]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|location=Bristol, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that Bertuzzi takes after him in regards to his toughness and aggression. Bertuzzi's great-uncle, Larry Bertuzzi, is a [[Toronto]]-based lawyer who has done arbitration work for the NHL, including on the [[Eric Lindros trade]].&lt;ref name=ring&gt;{{cite news|title=Islanders Pick Name With a Ring to It|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/sports/hockey-islanders-pick-name-with-a-ring-to-it.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=June 17, 2010|date=June 27, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up, Bertuzzi played [[minor ice hockey|minor hockey]] with the Nickel Centre and Sudbury Minor Hockey programs. In 1990–91, Bertuzzi played as an underaged player in the major midget ranks with the Sudbury Capitals AAA team. Physically built as a power forward throughout his youth, he stood 6 feet and 2&amp;nbsp;inches (1.88 metres) and weighed 195 pounds (88.5 kilograms) by age 15.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Bertuzzi and his wife, Julie, were married in July 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 IIHF World Championship - Players|url=http://hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/4730/la_id/1.htm|accessdate=February 28, 2011|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182717/http://hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/4730/la_id/1.htm|archivedate=July 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children born one-and-a-half years apart in [[Vancouver]], a son named Tag and a daughter named Jaden.&lt;ref name=force/&gt;&lt;ref name=2003contract/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.canada.com/national/features/raiseareader/story.html?id=3728e46c-bd3b-4261-a021-d322355cabed | title = Bertuzzis know kids' path to success made richer by reading | last = Woodend | first = Dorothy | work = The Vancouver Sun | publisher = Postmedia Network | location = Vancouver | date = October 3, 2002 | accessdate = April 15, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206174543/http://www.canada.com/national/features/raiseareader/story.html?id=3728e46c-bd3b-4261-a021-d322355cabed | archivedate = December 6, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Tag Bertuzzi, was drafted into the OHL by the [[Guelph Storm]], 2nd overall in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://ontariohockeyleague.com/draft&lt;/ref&gt; Bertuzzi is a recreational golfer and has credited the sport with allowing him to relax more as a hockey player. During his 10-game suspension from the NHL in October and November 2001, he played golf to focus his energy. Afterwards, he made it a custom to go to the driving range before every game.&lt;ref name=force/&gt;

Bertuzzi's nephew, [[Tyler Bertuzzi]], is a hockey player for the [[Detroit Red Wings]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5804">'''Æthelwine''' (died 992) was [[ealdorman]] of [[East Anglia]] and one of the leading noblemen in the [[kingdom of England]] in the later 10th century. As with his kinsmen, the principal source for his life is [[Byrhtferth]]'s [[hagiography|life]] of [[Oswald of Worcester]]. Æthelwine founded [[Ramsey Abbey]] in 969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Janet M.|last=Pope|title=Monks and Nobles in the Anglo-Saxon Monastic Reform|pages=166, 170|journal=Anglo-Norman Studies: Proceedings of the Battle Conference|volume=XVII|year=1994|editor-first=Christopher|editor-last=Harper-Brill|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, UK|isbn=0 85115 606 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Byrhtferth and [[Ramsey Abbey]] remembered him as ''Dei amicus'' (friend to God), but the monks of nearby [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] saw him as an enemy who had seized their lands.

Æthelwine was a son of [[Æthelstan Half-King]], but probably not the eldest son as his brother [[Æthelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia|Æthelwald]] seems to have succeeded their father on his retirement in 956. Æthelwine appears to have followed Æthelwald in office from 962. He was a benefactor of the [[New Minster]] at [[Winchester]], and of [[Ramsey Abbey]].

Following the death of King [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], Æthelwine was, with Oswald of Worcester and [[Dunstan]], a leader among the supporters of Edgar's oldest son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward]], which placed him in opposition to his former sister-in-law Dowager Queen [[Ælfthryth, Queen of England|Ælfthryth]] and [[Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia]]. During the anti-monastic reaction in Edward's short reign, Æthelwine is portrayed as a stalwart supporter of the monks, but the record suggests that he took advantage of the weakness of royal government to dispossess the monks of Ely of lands.

Following the death of Ælfhere in 983, and the withdrawal of the queen-mother from court soon after the death of Bishop [[Æthelwald of Winchester]] in 984, Æthelwine became the leading lay figure at the court of the young King [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred]]. His death in 992 probably marks the beginning of Æthelred's personal reign.

Æthelwine's death is recorded by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. Byrhtferth provides more detail, reporting that, perhaps following a lengthy illness, Æthelwine was attended at his death by Germann, Abbot of Ramsey, and [[Alphege|Ælfheah]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. His remains were moved to Ramsey where the monks kept a vigil overnight before he was buried there.

The name of Æthelwine's wife is not recorded, but the names of three sons are known. Byrhtferth mentions Edwin; another son named Leofric appears to have witnessed a will in 986, while Æthelweard was killed fighting for [[Edmund Ironside]] at the [[battle of Ashingdon]] in 1016.
