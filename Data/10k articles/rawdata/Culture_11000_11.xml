'''Artificiality''' (also called '''factitiousness''', or the state of being '''artificial''' or '''man-made''') is the state of being the product of intentional human manufacture, rather than occurring [[nature|naturally]] through processes not involving or requiring human activity.

==Connotations==
Artificiality often carries with it the implication of being false, counterfeit, or deceptive. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'':

{{quote|Naturalness is persuasive, artificiality is the contrary; for our hearers are prejudiced and think we have some design against them, as if we were mixing their wines for them. It is like the difference between the quality of Theodorus' voice and the voices of all other actors: his really seems to be that of the character who is speaking, theirs do not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', (2004, Dover Publications, W.D. Ross, translator), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, artificiality does not necessarily have a negative connotation, as it may also reflect the ability of humans to replicate forms or functions arising in nature, as with an [[artificial heart]] or [[artificial intelligence]]. Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert [[Herbert A. Simon]] observes that "some artificial things are imitations of things in nature, and the imitation may use either the same basic materials as those in the natural object or quite different materials.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;[[Herbert A. Simon]], ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' (1996), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon distinguishes between the artificial and the synthetic, the former being an imitation of something found in nature (for example, an [[artificial sweetener]] which generates [[sweetness]] using a formula not found in nature), and the latter being a replication of something found in nature (for example, a [[sugar]] created in a laboratory that is chemically indistinguishable from a naturally occurring sugar).&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt; Some philosophers have gone further and asserted that, in a [[Determinism|deterministic]] world, "everything is natural and nothing is artificial", because everything in the world (including everything made by humans) is a product of the physical laws of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Qinglai Sheng, ''Philosophical Papers'' (1993), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing natural objects from artificial objects==
[[File:Homebrew reaction diffusion example 512iter.jpg|thumb|right|Pattern resembling a [[Reaction-diffusion]] model, produced using sharpen and blur.]]
It is generally possible for humans, and in some instances, for computers,&lt;ref&gt;''See generally, E.P. Baltsavias, A. Gruen, L. VanGool, ''Automatic Extraction of Man-made Objects from Aerial and Space Images'', Volume 3 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish natural from artificial environments. The artificial environment tends to have more physical regularity both spatially and over time, with natural environments tending to have both irregular structures and structures that change over time.&lt;ref name="Kaken"&gt;Herman Kaken, "Recognition of Natural and Artificial Environments by Computers: Commonalities and Differences", in Juval Portugali, ''Complex Artificial Environments'' (2006), p. 31-48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on close observation it is possible to discern some mathematical structures and [[Patterns in nature|patterns in natural environments]], which can then be replicated to create an artificial environment with a more natural appearance.&lt;ref name="Kaken"/&gt;

For example, by identifying and imitating natural means of [[pattern formation]], some types of [[Finite state machine|automata]] have been used to generate organic-looking [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] for more realistic [[Shader|shading]] of [[3D modeling|3D objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Greg Turk, [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html Reaction-Diffusion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaction-Diffusion Textures|author=Andrew Witkin, Michael Kassy|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf|doi=10.1145/122718.122750|journal=Proceedings of the 18th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|year=1991|pages=299–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30212">In [[literary criticism]], a '''''Bildungsroman''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋs.ʁoˌmaːn}}; "bildung", meaning "education", and "roman", meaning "novel"; [[English language|English]]: "novel of formation, education, culture"; "[[coming-of-age story]]"){{efn|group=lower-alpha|Engel explains that the term has in recent years been applied to very different novels but originally meant a novel of formation of a character, of an individual personality in interaction (including conflict) with society. He also points out that it was, like the "novel of education" (''Erziehungsroman''), a subgenre of the "novel of development" (''Entwicklungsroman'').{{sfn|Engel|2008|pp=263–266}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/65244/bildungsroman |title=Bildungsroman: German literary genre |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the [[protagonist]] from youth to adulthood ([[coming of age]]),{{sfn|Lynch|1999}} in which character change is extremely important.{{sfn|Bakhtin|1996|p=21}}{{sfn|Jeffers|2005|p=2}}

==Origin==
The term was coined in 1819 by [[Philology|philologist]] [[Karl Morgenstern]] in his university lectures, and later famously reprised by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who legitimized it in 1870 and popularized it in 1905.{{sfn|Engel|2008|pp=263–266}}{{sfn|Summerfield|2010|p=1}} The genre is further characterized by a number of formal, topical, and thematic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Iversen |first=Annikin Teines |year=2010 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10037/2486 |title=Change and Continuity; The Bildungsroman in English |location=University of Tromsø |publisher=Munin open research archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''coming-of-age novel'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''Bildungsroman'', but its use is usually wider and less technical.

The birth of the Bildungsroman is normally dated to the publication of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] in 1795–96,{{sfn|Jeffers|2005|p=49}} or, sometimes, to [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s ''Geschichte des Agathon'' of 1767.&lt;ref name="Swales, Martin 1978"&gt;Swales, Martin. ''The German Bildungsroman from Wieland to Hesse''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Bildungsroman'' arose in Germany, it has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world. [[Thomas Carlyle]] translated Goethe's novel into English, and after its publication in 1824, many British authors wrote novels inspired by it.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, J. H. (1974) ''Season of Youth: the Bildungsroman from Dickens to Golding'', Harvard Univ Pr. {{ISBN|978-0-67479-640-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, L.

R. (2006) "Novel Subjects and Enabling Fictions: the Formal Articulation of International Human Rights Law",  ''Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law'', Ch. 2 (2007) Fordham University Press, New York {{ISBN|978-0-82322-817-1}};  {{doi|10.5422/fordham/9780823228171.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre translates fairly directly into cinematic form, the [[coming-of-age film]].

==Plot outline==
A ''Bildungsroman'' relates the growing up or "coming of age" of a sensitive person who goes in search of answers to life's questions with the expectation that these will result in gaining experience of the world. The genre evolved from folklore tales of a [[dunce]] or youngest child going out in the world to seek his fortune.&lt;ref&gt;"Franco Moretti et John Neubauer , historiens de la littérature, ont tous deux insisté sur le rôle fondamental qu’a joué le roman, depuis la fin du XVIIIe siècle jusqu’à la Première Guerre mondiale, dans la construction des âges de la vie, de l’adolescence et la jeunesse. Si, avant cette période, les jeunes sont les laissés-pour-compte de la littérature romanesque, cette entrée tardive est compensée par la place centrale qu’ils occupent dans le roman de formation. Vers la fin du XIXe siècle, quand ce genre entre en crise, les jeunes sont remplacés par les adolescents, nouveaux protagonistes des œuvres de fiction. Après les écrits de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, le roman de formation, ou Bildungsroman, dont l’apogée se situe entre Les années d’apprentissage de Wilhelm Meister de Goethe (1795-1796) et l’Éducation sentimentale de Flaubert (1869), invente la figure littéraire du jeune homme voyageur. C’est à partir donc de cette période qu’il faudra retrouver certains traits des voyages fictionnels, que j’appelle matrices , qui hantent encore notre imaginaire, et que l’on retrouve dans les séjours Erasmus contemporains" (Cicchelli Vincenzo, « Les legs du voyage de formation à la Bildung cosmopolite », Le Télémaque, 2010/2 (n° 38), p. 57-70. DOI : 10.3917/tele.038.0057. URL : https://www.cairn.info/revue-le-telemaque-2010-2-page-57.htm).&lt;/ref&gt; Usually in the beginning of the story there is an emotional loss which makes the protagonist leave on his/her journey. In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he/she is ultimately accepted into society—the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.

[[Franco Moretti]] "argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''Pride and Prejudice''".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Lazzaro-Weis, ''The Female "Bildungsroman": Calling It into Question'', NWSA Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual. An ''Entwicklungsroman'' ("development novel") is a story of general growth rather than self-cultivation. An ''Erziehungsroman'' ("education novel") focuses on training and formal schooling,&lt;ref&gt;David H. Malone, ''Faculty Development, or Faculty Life as a "Bildungsroman"'', Profession (1979), pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt; while a ''[[Künstlerroman]]'' ("artist novel") is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.&lt;ref name="Werlock2010p387"&gt;{{cite book |author=Werlock, James P. |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWuyTK_0eBsC&amp;pg=PA387 |title=The Facts on File companion to the American short story |volume=2 |page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some memoirs and published journals can be regarded as ''Bildungsroman'' although being predominantly factual (e.g. "[[The Dharma Bums]]" by [[Jack Kerouac]] or'' [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' by [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.realteachertutors.com.au/motorcycle-diaries-che-guevara-hsc-english-discovery/ The Motorcycle Diaries by Che Guevara–HSC English Discovery]", ''Real Teacher Tutors''. Retrieved 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also more loosely used to describe [[coming-of-age film]]s and related works in other genres.

The '''Book of Jasher''', also called '''Pseudo-Jasher''', is an 18th-century [[literary forgery]] by [[Jacob Ilive]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional free speech defined and defended Theodore Schroeder - 1970  JACOB ILIVE — 1756.63 Jacob Ilive (1705-1763) was a type founder, printer, publisher of a magazine and a voluminous author, ... fictitious, and chimerical, and as a gross Piece of Forgery and Priestcraft, and thereby to weaken, enervate&lt;/ref&gt; It purports to be an English translation by [[Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus]] of the lost ''[[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]]''. It is sometimes called Pseudo-Jasher to distinguish it from the midrashic [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]] (''Book of the Upright,'' Naples, 1552), which incorporates genuine Jewish legend.

==Details==
Published in November 1751, the title page of the book says: "translated into English by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus, of Britain, Abbot of Canterbury, who went on a pilgrimage into the Holy Land and Persia, where he discovered this volume in the city of Gazna." The book claims to be written by [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Jasher]], son of [[Caleb]], one of [[Moses]]'s lieutenants, who later [[Biblical judges|judged]] [[Israelite|Israel]] at [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]]. The covers biblical history from the creation down to Jasher's own day and was represented as the [[Lost Book of Jasher]] mentioned in the [[Bible]].

The provenance of the text was immediately suspect: [[Alcuin]] of the 8th-century could not have produced a translation in the English of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]]. There is an introductory account by Alcuin of his discovery of the manuscript in Persia and its history since the time of Jasher, and a commendation by [[John Wycliffe]].

== Reception ==
The supposed lost book was declared an obvious hoax by the ''Monthly Review'' in the December of the year of publication, and the printer [[Jacob Ilive]] was sentenced in 1756 to three years in jail for this fraud and for his radical anti-religious pamphlets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1829, a slightly revised and enlarged edition was published in [[Bristol]], provoking attacks against it. A photographic reproduction of this 1829 edition was published in 1934 by the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|Rosicrucians]] in San Jose, California, who declared it an inspired work.

'''''Bubba Ho-Tep''''' is a 1994 [[alternate history]] [[novella]] by American author [[Joe R. Lansdale]]. It was first published on August 1, 1994 in the [[Elvis Presley]] themed anthology ''The King is Dead'' and has since been re-published in various formats.&lt;ref name=AICN&gt;{{cite web|title=Quint on BUBBA HO-TEP + Interview with Coscarelli, Bruce Campbell and Joe Lansdale!!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/12503|publisher=AICN|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film adaptation [[Bubba Ho-Tep|by the same name]] was released in 2002 and starred [[Bruce Campbell]] as the lead character of Elvis.

==Synopsis==
In this story, the real [[Elvis Presley]] switched places years ago with an [[Elvis impersonator]]. Tired of the life of drugs, women, and people who wanted nothing more than his money, he settles in to live a life of obscurity in a [[East Texas]] [[trailer park]], where he becomes the best Elvis impersonator ever. Then his health begins to fail, and he falls from a stage and breaks his hip. His trailer burns down and with it all evidence that proves he was the real Elvis Presley. He ends up in a shabby [[retirement home]], which is where the story starts.

Late at night, Elvis hears scuttling noises and other creepy sounds in the otherwise quiet Mud Creek Shady Grove Convalescence Home. He befriends a black man, who's convinced he's [[John F. Kennedy]], and the two begin to piece together that an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy]] is stalking the halls and sucking up souls in the night. Together the two men confront the monster, as no one will believe them.

==Adaptations==
{{Main|Bubba Ho-Tep}}

A film adaptation of ''Bubba Ho-Tep'' was released in 2002 and was directed by [[Don Coscarelli]], who also wrote the film's [[screenplay]]. Bruce Campbell was brought in to portray the film's lead character of Elvis Presley and [[Ossie Davis]] as Kennedy. Due to a successful [[roadshow theatrical release]] held by Coscarelli, ''Bubba Ho-Tep'' quickly obtained [[Cult film|cult movie]] status.

In 2018, [[IDW Publishing]] released a five-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] prequel, ''Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers''. The series was supervised by Lansdale, written by Joshua Jabcuga, and illustrated by Tadd Galusha.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.idwpublishing.com/elvis-returns-in-bubba-ho-tep-and-the-cosmic-blood-suckers/ Elvis Returns in Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' heavily criticized ''Bubba Ho-Tep'' upon its initial release, as they considered the story to be one of the worst of the Elvis anthology as they thought that Lansdale "spends too much time on The King's hard-ons" and that "too much bad writing leaves the reader all shook up and itchin like a man on a fuzzy tree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE KING IS DEAD (review)|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/paul-m-sammon/the-king-is-dead-2/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rome|Ancient Roman]] culture, '''''cena'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk/romans/food.html|title=Roman Food|website=www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Ancient Roman cuisine#Cena|main meal of the day]]. In earlier times, it was held midday, but later began to be held in evenings. It was a focal point of social life, along with the [[Ancient Roman bathing|public baths]], the frequenting of which often preceded the meal. Seating during dinner was in the [[triclinium]], three couches for reclining arranged as three sides of a square, with a small table for food in the middle of all these.

The cena traditionally consisted of three parts.  The appetizer course often included eggs, olives, and honeyed wine.  The second, main course often included a main meat dish, like roasted pig.  The third and final course included desserts such as fruits or nuts. Only the very wealthy would consume exotic dishes such as giraffe, ostrich, lion, and peacock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|article=Meals|title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568-e-4029|edition=4th|editor-first=Simon|editor-last1=Hornblower|editor-first2=Antony|editor-last2=Spawforth|editor-first3=Esther|editor-last3=Eidinow|registration=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sampot chang kben''' ({{lang-km|សំពត់ចងក្បិន}}; {{lang-th|โจงกระเบน}}, {{RTGS|''chong kraben''}}, {{IPA-th|t͡ɕōːŋ krābēːn|pron}}; {{lang-lo|ຜ້າຫາງ}}, ''pha hang'') is a lower-body, wrap-around cloth worn in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]]. It was the preferred choice of clothing for women of upper and middle classes for daily wear. The practice of daily wear died out at the beginning of the 20th century. Unlike the typical sampot, it is more of a [[Trousers|pant]] than a [[skirt]].  It is a rectangular piece of cloth measuring three meters long and one meter wide. It is worn by wrapping it around the waist, stretching it away from the body, twisting the ends together then pulling the twisted fabric between the legs and tucking it in the back of the waist.

[[File:Kmer Dance..JPG|left|thumb|200px|Khmer woman wearing sampot chang kben]]
[[File:Preah Kô4.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A carving of deva wearing sampot chang kben]]

The history of sampot chang kben dates back to ancient [[Cambodia]], where deities were often portrayed wearing such styles. References to most Khmer elders told a legend related to this garment. It said that a long time ago, the [[Khmer people]] worn sampot chang kben, following the [[India]]n tradition. In those times, India provided many religions, but the most important one was [[Hinduism]], as the Khmer king at that time built the temples such as [[Angkor Wat]], also dedicated to [[Hinduism]]. In the era of the [[Khmer empire]], most of the people were likely to read and see The [[Reamker]] at the [[Angkor Wat]] carving in the first floor as well. The origin of sampot chang kben is known as Indian. Also prayed and blessed to was a deva known as [[Hanuman]], the guard of Prince [[Rama]] in India's famous mythology, ''[[Ramayana]]'', as well as the Khmer adaptation, ''Reamker''. To show its power, Indians preferred to wear the sampot chang kben as their costume but today, countries under the [[Greater India]], such as Cambodia, also wear it for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://sereysotheara.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%BE%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%86%E1%9E%96%E1%9E%8F%E1%9F%8B%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%94%E1%9E%B7%E1%9E%93-%E1%9E%98%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%93%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%86%E1%9E%8E%E1%9E%BE%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%B6/ Sereysothera] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103020917/http://sereysotheara.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%BE%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%86%E1%9E%96%E1%9E%8F%E1%9F%8B%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%94%E1%9E%B7%E1%9E%93-%E1%9E%98%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%93%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%86%E1%9E%8E%E1%9E%BE%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%8F%E1%9E%B6/ |date=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ramayana mythology, Hanuman is a symbol of bravery, cleverness, and power, so the people, when wearing the sampot chang kben, always drop a tail at the back like Hanuman's monkey tail. This practice lead a lot of people to believe that all Indians were guards of Hanuman. The influence of sampot chang kben, known as [[Dhoti]] in [[India]], were strongly sacked into [[Culture of Cambodia|Khmer culture]] from the ancient times to today. Apparently, this fabric is also known to be worn by [[Tamil people]] in [[south India]], as well as [[Khmer people]], till today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veticar.com/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D1216%26Itemid%3D1132 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818200636/http://www.veticar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1216&amp;Itemid=1132 |archivedate=2009-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, sampot chang kben is the tradition of [[southern India]], and was imported to early [[Cambodia]]n Kingdom, [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] by ''King Kaundinya I''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilovekhmer.org/blog/2009/08/%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%9B%E1%9F%80%E1%9E%80%E1%9E%9F%E1%9F%86%E1%9E%96%E1%9E%8F%E1%9F%8B%E1%9E%85%E1%9E%84%E1%9E%80%E1%9F%92%E1%9E%94%E1%9E%B7%E1%9E%93%E1%9E%98%E1%9E%B6%E1%9E%93%E1%9E%96%E1%9E%B8/ Sampot Chang Kben]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 13th and 14th centuries, [[Thai people]] (from [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], known as [[Thailand]] today) and [[Lao people]] (from [[Lan Xang]], known as Lao today) had adopted the wearing of sampot chang kben because they considered it superior for enjoying the special occasions,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} and useful for royalty or monarchy in their local royal palace, because the [[Thai people]] and [[Lao people]] had used sampot chang kben in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;http://neary-khmer.blogspot.com/2009/07/cen-tamil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Khmerlladyinblackandwhite1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Khmer lady wearing sampot chang kben in the 1800s.]]
In ancient times, the sampot chang kben was worn only by men, but in modern times, it is worn by both men and women, especially for a formal celebration. It is, for instance, worn by a bride and groom in a Khmer wedding. The general style of the garment has changed over the years:
*[[Norodom of Cambodia|King Norodom]] (1834–1904), During this time, most people wearing the sampot chang kben kept the length down to the middle of the waist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.budinst.gov.kh/?q=node/307&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sisowath of Cambodia|King Sisowath]] (born 1840, died 1927), During this time, the sampot chang kben was worn higher up, just under the knee, like the model of [[Thai people]]. In [[Cambodia]] before, only men worn the garment, but in [[Thailand]] it was worn by both genders. When people from [[Cambodia]] saw Thai ladies wearing the sampot chang kben, they began to adopt this practice.

Today, the sampot chang kben is worn mostly for formal occasions, or by royalty.

A '''charter school''' is a school that receives government funding but operates independently of the established [[state school]] system in which it is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/04/why-hedge-funds-love-charter-schools/|title=Why hedge funds love charter schools|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISR&gt;{{cite journal|author= Sarah Knopp|year= 2008|title= Charter schools and the attack on public education|journal= International Socialist Review|issue= 62|url= http://www.isreview.org/issues/62/feat-charterschools.shtml|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charter schools are an example of [[Public works|public asset]] [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1991/11/does-privatization-serve-the-public-interest|title=Does Privatization Serve the Public Interest?|date=1991-11-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is ongoing debate on whether charter schools ought to be described as [[private education|private schools]] or [[state school]]s.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Advocates of the charter model state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publiccharters.org/our-work/charter-law-database|title=Charter Law Database {{!}} National Alliance for Public Charter Schools|website=www.publiccharters.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they are public schools because they are open to all students and do not charge tuition, while critics cite charter schools' private operation and loose regulations regarding public accountability and labor issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/12/08/when-public-goes-private-as-trump-wants-what-happens/|title=When Public Goes Private, as Trump Wants: What Happens?|last=Ravitch|first=Diane|date=2016-12-08|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}&lt;/ref&gt; as arguments against the concept.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Emma|title=Are charter schools public or private?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/02/04/are-charter-schools-public-or-private/|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=Washington Post|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By country ==
{{Category see also|Education by country}}

=== Australia ===
All Australian private schools have received some federal government funding since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-30/school-funding-explained-without-mentioning-gonski/8555276|title=Here's how our schools are funded — and we promise not to mention Gonski|date=2017-05-30|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then they have educated approximately 30% of high school students. None of them are charter schools, because they all charge tuition fees. 

Since 2009, the Government of Western Australia has trialed the Independent Public School (IPS) Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-26/independent-public-schools-inquiry-announced/7201496|title=WA's Independent Public Schools initiative to come under parliamentary microscope|date=2016-02-26|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These public schools have greater autonomy and could be regarded as akin to 'charter' Schools (but the term is not used in Australia).

=== Canada ===
The [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]] enacted legislation in 1994 enabling charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.alberta.ca/media/6389667/background%20information%20revised%20jan%207%2011.pdf |title=Action on Research and Innovation: The Future of Charter Schools in Alberta |date=January 2011 |publisher=Government of Alberta |page=1 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first charter schools under the new legislation were established in 1995: New Horizons Charter School, Suzuki Charter School, and the Centre for Academic and Personal Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/innovation-in-action-charter-schools-2.pdf |title=Innovation in Action: An Examination of Charter Schools in Alberta |first=Shawna |last=Ritchie |date=January 2010 |work=the West in Canada Research Series |publisher=CanadaWest Foundation |page=9 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714174024/http://cwf.ca/pdf-docs/publications/innovation-in-action-charter-schools-2.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, Alberta remains the only Canadian province that has enabled charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Primer on Charter Schools|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/a-primer-on-charter-schools|publisher=The Fraser Institute|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 23 charter school campuses operated by 13 [[Alberta charter schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter Schools List|url=https://education.alberta.ca/media/1626467/charterschoolslist_dec42015.pdf|publisher=Alberta Education|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charter Schools in Alberta |url=https://education.alberta.ca/charter-schools/about-alberta-charter-schools/ |publisher=Alberta Education |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of charter schools is limited to a maximum of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School Act: Charter Schools Regulation |url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2002_212.pdf |publisher=Province of Alberts |accessdate=4 June 2018 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
[[Chile]] has a long history of private subsidized schooling, akin to charter schooling in the United States. Before the 1980s, most private subsidized schools were religious and owned by churches or other private parties, but they received support from the central government. In the 1980s, the government of [[Augusto Pinochet]] promoted [[neoliberal]] reforms in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/what-pinochet-did-chile|title=What Pinochet Did for Chile|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 a competitive [[voucher]] system in education was adopted.&lt;ref name="Carnoy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=National Voucher Plans in Chile and Sweden: Did Privatization Reforms Make for Better Education? |first=Martin |last=Carnoy |journal=Comparative Education Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |date=August 1998 |pages=309–337 |jstor=1189163 |doi=10.1086/447510}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vouchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/chiles-school-voucher-system-enabling-choice-or-perpetuating-social-inequality/|title=Chile's School Voucher System: Enabling Choice or Perpetuating Social Inequality?|website=New America|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be used in public schools or private subsidized schools (which can be run for profit). After this reform, the share of private subsidized schools, many of them secular, grew from 18.5% of schools in 1980 to 32.7% of schools in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, nearly 60% of Chilean students study in charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarroud|first= Marianela|title=Chilean student protests point to deep discontent|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/09/pinochets-policies-still-rankle-in-chile/|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
[[Colombia]], like Chile, has a long tradition of religious and private schools. With the economic crisis of religious orders, different levels of the state have had to finance these schools to keep them functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgcenter.com/BGW/ColombianEd.htm|title=Colombian Educational Systems|last=Bgcenter|website=www.bgcenter.com|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in some cities such as Bogotá, there are programs of private schools financed by public resources, giving education access to children from poor sectors. These cases, however, are very small and about 60% of children and young people study in private schools paid for by their families. Moreover, private schools have higher quality than public ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Colombia/Colombia-Guide/Education/Private-education-in-Colombia|title=Private education in Colombia|work=Just Landed|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] established [[grant-maintained school]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="NDAD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Grant Maintained Schools Database | work = The National Digital Archive of Datasets | publisher = [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] | url = http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/CRDA/36/detail.html |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allowed individual schools that were independent of the local school authority. When they were abolished in 1998, most turned into [[foundation school]]s, which are really under their local district authority but still have a high degree of autonomy.

Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], there were about 200 [[Academy (English school)|academies]] (publicly funded schools with a significant degree of autonomy) in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/10161371.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Academies and free schools |date=26 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Academies Act 2010]] aims to vastly increase this number.

=== Germany ===
Due to Art. 7 of the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'' (German constitution), private schools may only be set up if they do not increase the segregation of pupils by their parents' income class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=224215|title=Germany: Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|website=www.wipo.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, all private schools are supported financially by government bodies, comparable to charter schools. The amount of control over school organization, curriculum etc. taken over by the state differs from [[States of Germany|state]] to state and from school to school. Average financial support given by government bodies was 85% of total costs in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/BildungForschungKultur/BildungKulturFinanzen/SchulenfreieTraeger5217110099004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile |title=''Finanzen der Schulen - Schulen in freier Trägerschaft und Schulen des Gesundheitswesens |publisher=Statistisches Bundesamt'' |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, all private schools must lead their students to the ability to attain standardized, government-provided external tests such as the ''[[Abitur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studying-in-germany.org/german-higher-education-entrance-qualification/|title=German Higher Education Entrance Qualification - Abitur - Study in Germany for Free|date=2016-07-22|work=Study in Germany for Free|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter schools in [[New Zealand]], labelled as Partnership schools | kura hourua&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/specific-initiatives/partnership-schools-kura-hourua/|title=Partnership Schools {{!}} Kura Hourua (Charter Schools)|last=Zealand|first=Education in New|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, were allowed for after an agreement between the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and the [[ACT Party]] following the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. The controversial legislation passed with a five-vote majority. A small number of charter schools started in 2013 and 2014. All cater for students who have struggled in the normal state school system. Most of the students have issues with drugs, alcohol, poor attendance and achievement. Most of the students are Maori or Pacific Islander. One of the schools is set up as a military academy. One of the schools ran into major difficulties within weeks of starting. It is now being run by an executive manager from Child, Youth and Family, a government social welfare organization, together with a commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Education. 36 organizations have applied to start charter schools.

As in Sweden, the publicly funded but privately run charter schools in Norway are named ''friskoler'' and was formally instituted in 2003, but dismissed in 2007. Private schools have since medieval times been a part of the education system, and is today consisting of 63 [[Montessori education|Montessori]] and 32 [[Steiner/Waldorf education|Steiner (Waldorf)]] charter schools, some religious schools and 11 non-governmental funded schools like the [[Oslo International School]], the [[German School Max Tau]] and the [[Lycée Français René Cassin d'Oslo|French School Lycée Français]], a total of 195 schools.

All charter schools can have a list of admission priorities, but only the non-governmental funded schools are allowed to select their students and to make a profit. The charter schools cannot have entrance exams, and supplemental fees are very restricted. In 2013, a total of 19,105 children were enrolled in privately run schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/utdanning/statistikker/utgrs |title=Elevar i grunnskolen, 1. oktober 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Education Commission of the States]], "charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract - or charter - details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured. Many charters are exempt from a variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/charter-school-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: Charter School Policies|author=|date=|website=www.ecs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minnesota]] wrote the first charter school law in the United States in 1991. {{As of|2015}}, Minnesota had 165 registered charter schools, with over 41,000 students attending. The first of these to be approved, Bluffview Montessori School in [[Winona, Minnesota]], opened in 1992. The first charter to operate was City Academy in St. Paul. Some specialized Minnesota charter-schools include the Metro Deaf School (1993), [[Community of Peace Academy]] (1995), and the [[Mainstreet School of Performing Arts]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mncharterschools.org/page/1/home.jsp |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826070354/http://www.mncharterschools.org/page/1/home.jsp |archivedate=26 August 2011 |title=Minnesota Charter Schools |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2011 | December}} approximately 5,600 charter schools enrolled an estimated total of more than 2 million students nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/ideas_from_promising_to_proven |author=Zinsmeister, Karl. |title=From Promising to Proven: The charter school boom ahead. |publisher=Philanthropy Magazine. |date=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers equate to a 13% growth in students in just one year, while more than 400,000 students remain on charter school waitlists. Over 500 new charter schools opened their doors in the 2011–12 school year, an estimated increase of 200,000 students. This year marks the largest single-year increase ever recorded in terms of the number of additional students attending charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=30 |author=National Center for Education Statistics |title=Charter School Fast Facts |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_216.20.asp |title=Number and enrollment of public elementary and secondary schools, by school level, type, and charter and magnet |author=Education Digest |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One could argue, the most radical experimentation with charter schools in the United States occurred in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005). {{As of | 2009}} the [[New Orleans Public Schools]] system was engaged in reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre-Katrina public School Board to individual charter school principals and boards, monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable, five-year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding, and parents the choice to enroll their children in almost any school in the district.&lt;ref&gt;''Vallas wants no return to old ways''. ''The Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans). 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans is one of two cities in the United States of America where the majority of school students attend charter schools.&lt;ref name="The Times-Picayune 2009"&gt;''RSD looks at making charters pay rent'', The Times-Picayune, 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 78% of all New Orleans schoolchildren studied in charter schools during the 2011–12 school year.&lt;ref name="The State of Public Education in New Orleans"&gt;''Executive Summary'', http://www.coweninstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SPENO-20121.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523110210/http://www.coweninstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SPENO-20121.pdf# |date=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2014 | May}}, all but five of New Orleans' schools were charter schools rather than public schools.&lt;ref name="New Orleans District Gets Rid of Its Last Traditional Public Schools"&gt;''Rebecca Klein'', Huffington Post, 30 May 2014. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/30/new-orleans-traditional-public-schools_n_5414372.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike their counterparts, laws governing charter schools vary greatly from state to state. In this regard the three states with the highest number of students enrolled in charter schools are California, [[Arizona]], and [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Jeanne M. "Charter Schools." Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education. 2008. SAGE Publications. 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These differences largely relate to what types of public agencies are permitted to authorize the creation of charter schools, whether or not and through what processes private schools can convert to charter schools, and whether or not charter school teachers need to be certified and what that certification consists of.

In [[California]], local school districts are the most frequent granters of school charters. If a local school district denies a charter application, or if the proposed charter school provides services not provided by the local school districts, a county board consisting of superintendents from state schools or the state board of education can grant a charter.&lt;ref name="Premack"&gt;Premack, Eric. "Charter schools: California's education reform 'power tool.'(Special Section on Charter Schools)." Phi Delta Kappan 78.1 (1996): 60+. Academic OneFile. Web. 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arizona State Board for Charter Schools grants charters in Arizona. Local school districts and the state board of education can also grant charters. In contrast, the creation of charter schools in Michigan can be authorized only by local school boards or by the governing school boards of state colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Lacireno-Paquet"&gt;Lacireno-Paquet, Natalie. "Moving Forward or Sliding Backward: The Evolution of Charter School Policies in Michigan and the District of Columbia." Educational policy (Los Altos, Calif.). 21. (2007): 202. Web. 5 December 2011. &lt;Educational policy (Los Altos, Calif.)&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different states with charter-school legislation have adopted widely different positions in regard to the conversion of private schools to charter schools. California, for example, does not allow the conversion of pre-existing private schools into charter schools. Both Arizona and Michigan allow such conversions, but with different requirements. A private school wishing to convert to a charter school in Michigan, for example, must show that at least 25% of its student population is made up of new students. Legislation in Arizona stipulates that private schools that wish to become charter schools within that state must have admission policies that are fair and non-discriminatory. Also, while Michigan and California require teachers at charter schools to hold state certification, those in Arizona do not.

Charter schools were targeted as a major component of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/nclb/choice/charter/charter-faq.html |title=Questions and Answers on No Child Left Behind...Charter Schools |author=US Department of Education |date=November 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the act specifies that students attending schools labeled as under-performing by state standards now have the option to transfer to a different school in the district, whether it is a state, private, or charter school. The act also suggested that if a failing school cannot show adequate yearly progress, it will be designated a charter school.

{{As of | 2005}} there were almost 100 charter schools in North Carolina, the limit passed by legislation in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Meghan. "Cyber Charter Schools: An Analysis of North Carolina's Current Charter School Legislation." North Carolina journal of law . 6. (2005): 395. Web. 6 December 2011. http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ncjl6.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 legislation dictates that there will be no more than five charter schools operating within one school district at any given time. It was passed in order to offer parents options in regard to their children and the school they attend, with most of the cost being covered by tax revenue. After the first several years of permitting charter schools in North Carolina, the authority to grant charters shifted from local boards of education to the State Board of Education. This can also be compared with several other states that have various powers that accept charter school applications.

There is strong demand for charter schools from the [[private sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Charter-School-Demand-and-Effectiveness.pdf |title=Charter School Demand and Effectiveness |author=Sarah R. Cohodes |author2=Elizabeth M. Setren |author3=Christopher R. Walters |author4=Joshua D. Angrist |author5=Parag A. Pathak |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, charter schools operate as nonprofits.{{cn|date=February 2018}} However, the buildings in which they operate are generally owned by private landlords. Accordingly, this asset class is generating interest from real-estate investors who are looking towards the development of new schools. State and local governments have also shown willingness to help with financing. Charter schools have grown in popularity over the recent past. In 2014-2015, 500 new charter schools opened in the country. {{As of | 2015}}, 6,700 charter schools enroll approximately 2.9 million students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Cyber schools ====
{{Main article|Virtual school}}

Charter cyber schools operate like typical charter schools in that they are independently organized schools, but are conducted partly or entirely over the Internet. Proponents say this allows for much more flexibility compared with traditional schools.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Education, Cyber Charter Schools, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2000-2001, studies estimated 40-50,000 online K-12 students nationally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Study of College Admission Officers' Attitudes and Perceptions About Cyber-Charter High School Applicants (doctoral dissertation)|last=Barkovich|first=David|publisher=|year=2014|location=|pages=2–136|quote="Estimations of K-12 online learners in 2000-2001 placed the enrollment nationally at 40- 50,000 students (Clark, 2000) while just a year later The Peak Group (2002) placed the number at 180,000."|via=ProQuest|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/21508/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, a study by Picciano and Seamon (2006) found that over 1 million students were involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These numbers increased to 6.7 million students in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study by Watson, Murin, Vashaw, Gemin, and Rapp found that cyber charter schools are currently (as of 2014) operating in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The increase of these online campuses has caused controversy among the education system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In November 2015 researchers at the [[University of Washington]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[Mathematica Policy Research]] group published the first major study into online charter schools in the United States, the "National Study of Online Charter Schools". It found "significantly weaker academic performance" in mathematics and reading in such schools when compared to conventional ones. The study resulted from research carried out in 17 US states which had online charter schools. It concluded that keeping online pupils focused on their work was the biggest problem faced by online charter schools and that in mathematics the difference in attainment between online pupils and their conventionally-educated peers equated to the cyber pupils missing a whole academic year in school.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online 4 November 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Coughlan |first= Sean |title= Online schools 'worse than traditional teachers'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34671952 | date= 4 November 2015|website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four states have adopted specific legislation tailored to cyber charter schools. One example is Arizona, which has about 3,500 students in cyber schools, about half of them cyber charter schools and the other half governed by traditional, bricks and mortar public school districts. The cyber schools teach students from kindergarten to twelfth grade, and the setting varies from being entirely online in one's home to spending all of the class time in a formal school building while learning over the Internet.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Cyber charter school diplomas have been unevenly valued by post-secondary institutions. Universities sometimes apply additional requirements or have cyber-charter quotas limiting the number of applicants. The US military also classifies non-traditional diplomas at a lower tier, although as of 2012 this could be bypassed by high [[ASVAB]] test scores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Charter Schools and Public Schools ====
Charter schools have gradually become popular since the system was introduced in 1996. The United States Department of Education defined these institutions as “''public schools that do not charge tuition fees established through a charter or agreement between the school and local district school board''.” Through said accord, the charter school gets more autonomy proportional to conventional public schools in exchange for the higher level of accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/data/education/charter-vs-public-school-whats-the-difference/77-461068585|title=Charter vs public school: What's the difference?|work=WTLV|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy statement from the National Education Association implemented by the Representative Assembly in 2017 stated that the NEA vows a strong public schools system for American students. Charter schools are funded by taxpayers so there must be the same liability, transparency, safeguards, and impartiality as public schools. 44 American states along with the District of Columbia implement legislation on state charter schools. However, many states do not compel charters to abide by open meeting statutes as well as prerequisites on conflict of interest that pertain to school districts, boards, and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/16332.htm|title=Charter Schools|work=NEA|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NEA was quoted as declaring that certain state laws, rules, and guidelines may still be relevant to charter schools. These institutions are not supervised by the state but by a board of directors. The establishment of charter schools was meant to promote competition among students and provide parents with more options for enrolling their children. Heightened competition can result in effective educational programs nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/charter-schools-vs-traditional-public-schools-which-one-is-under-performing|title=Charter Schools vs. Traditional Public Schools: Which One is Under-Performing?  {{!}} PublicSchoolReview.com|website=PublicSchoolReview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos espoused “school choice” before accepting the position in President Donald Trump’s administration. School choice refers to spending funds allocated for public charter schools and some private school. DeVos said in a media interview on March 12, 2018, that charter schools can improve the long-established public school system. Betsy DeVos was a campaigner for the American Federation of Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/betsy-devos-on-60-minutes-says-charter-schools-make-public-schools-better-michigan-shows-thats-not-true|title=Betsy DeVos Says Charter Schools Make Public Schools Better.

A '''coffee ceremony''' ({{lang-am|ቡና ማፍላት|bunna maflat}}) is a ritualized form of making and drinking [[coffee]].  The coffee ceremony was first practiced  in Ethiopia and Eritrea. There is a routine of serving coffee on a daily basis, mainly for the purpose of getting together with relatives, neighbors, or other visitors.  If coffee is politely declined, then [[tea]] (''Chai'') will most likely be served.

Loose [[Poaceae|grass]] is spread on the floor where the coffee ceremony is held, often decorated with small yellow flowers. [[Asteraceae|Composite]] flowers are sometimes used, especially around the celebration of [[Meskel]].

The ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household and is considered an honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/05/coffee-traditions-the-ethiopian-coffee-ceremony.html|title=Coffee Traditions: Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113114621/http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/05/coffee-traditions-the-ethiopian-coffee-ceremony.html|archivedate=2016-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over an open flame in a pan .&lt;ref name="laweekly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epicurean" /&gt; This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a [[wooden]] [[mortar and pestle]].&lt;ref name="epicurean" /&gt; The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel which contain boiled water and will be left on an open flame a couple of minutes until it is well mixed with the hot water.&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/experience-a-true-ethiopian-coffee-ceremony-in-las-little-ethiopia-6445661|title=Experience a True Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony in L.A.'s Little Ethiopia|last1=Tavitian|first1=Maral|date=January 5, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016|website=LA Weekly|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112040823/http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/experience-a-true-ethiopian-coffee-ceremony-in-las-little-ethiopia-6445661|archivedate=November 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After grinding, the coffee is put through a sieve several times.&lt;ref name="epicurean" /&gt; The boiling pot ([[jebena]]) is usually made of [[pottery]] and has a spherical base, a [[neck]] and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base.&lt;ref name="epicurean" /&gt; The jebena also has a straw lid.&lt;ref name="epicurean" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6060">'''Cognitive archaeology''' is a [[archaeological theory|theoretical]] perspective in [[archaeology]] which focuses on the ways that ancient societies [[thought]] and the [[symbol]]ic structures that can be perceived in past [[material culture]].

Cognitive archaeologists often [[Research|study]] the role that [[ideology]] and differing organizational approaches would have had on ancient peoples. The way that these abstract ideas are manifested through the remains that these peoples have left can be investigated and debated often by drawing inferences and using approaches developed in fields such as [[semiotics]], [[psychology]] and the wider [[science]]s.

They belong to the minds of man. Unless they were written down, and even then only if they were recorded accurately, we shall find it hard to recapture them."

Humans do not behave under the influence of their senses alone but also through their past experiences such as their upbringing. These experiences contribute to each individual's unique view of the world, a kind of [[cognitive map]] that guides them. Groups of people living together tend to develop a shared view of the world and similar cognitive maps which in turn influence their group material culture.

Archaeologists have always tried to imagine what motivated people but early efforts to understand how they thought were unstructured and speculative. Since the rise of [[processualism]] these approaches have become more scientific, paying close attention to the [[Archaeological context]] of archaeological finds and all possible interpretations. For example, a prehistoric [[bâton de commandement]] served an unknown purpose but using cognitive archaeology to interpret it would involve evaluating all its possible functions using clearly defined procedures and comparisons. By applying logic and experimental evidence, the most likely functions can be isolated.

The multiple interpretations of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], [[archaeological site]] or symbol are affected by the archaeologist's own experiences and ideas as well as those of the distant cultural tradition that created it. [[Cave art]] for example may not have been [[art]] in the modern sense at all but perhaps the product of [[ritual]]. Similarly, it would likely have described activities that were perfectly obvious to the people who created it but the [[symbology]] employed will be different from that used today or at any other time.

Some archaeologists such as [[Lewis Binford]] have critiqued cognitive archaeology, stating that it is only people's actions rather than their thoughts that are preserved in the archaeological record. However it can be argued that even this evidence of actions is still the product of human thought and would have been governed by a multitude of experiences and perspectives. Thus one can see Cognitive Archaeology as a development of [[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]] in that the combination of material culture and actions can be further developed into a study of the ideas which drove action and used objects. This method attempts to avoid the pitfalls of [[Post-processual archaeology|Post-Processual Archaeology]] by retaining the 'scientific' aspects of Processual Archaeology while reaching for the higher social levels of ideas.

==Examples==
Archaeologist [[Thomas Huffman]] defines cognitive archaeology as the study of prehistoric ideology: the ideals, values, and beliefs that constitute a society's worldview. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00438243.1986.9979990|title=Cognitive studies of the iron age in Southern Africa|year=1986|last1=Huffman|first1=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Huffman|journal=World Archaeology|volume=18|pages=84-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive archaeologists use the principles of sociocultural anthropology to investigate such diverse things as material symbols, the use of space, political power, and religion. For example, Huffman uses oral history sources from [[Zimbabwe]] and Portuguese documents to attempt to explain symbols discovered in the ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]], specifically connecting the [[Shona people]]'s historical association of the right with men and the left with women to the placement of entrances to stone structures. This cognitive archaeological approach may be problematic in its logical leaps and incomplete use of archaeological sources, as historian [[David Beach (historian)| David Beach]] has pointed out, demonstrating the care that must be used when attempting to explain deep-time intentionality using archaeological evidence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/204698|title=Cognitive Archaeology and Imaginary History at Great Zimbabwe|year=1998|last1=Beach|first1=David|authorlink=David Beach (historian)|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=39|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cornucopia''''' is a magazine about [[Turkish culture]], [[Turkish art|art]] and [[History of Turkey|history]], published jointly in the United Kingdom and [[Turkey]].

==Content==
''Cornucopia'' was founded by John Scott and [[Berrin Torolsan]] in 1992. It is an English language magazine that concerns Turkish culture. The magazine has a broad scope that covers Turkey’s heritage ([[Prehistory of Anatolia|prehistoric]], [[Byzantine]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Republican]] and that of the [[Turkic peoples]].

The magazine also documents recent auctions and exhibitions of [[Turkish people|Turkish Art]] and [[Islamic art]] around the world. It has a large books section with reviews by prominent contributors.

''Cornucopia'' also carries regular features on food, restaurants and life in Turkey by [[Berrin Torolsan]], [[Andrew Finkel]] and [[Azize Ethem]] respectively.

==Heritage==
Notably, ''Cornucopia'' has brought publicity to some of Turkey's threatened heritage.

* At the end of 1993 it documented the Mocan Yali in the historic area of [[Kuzguncuk]], in ‘The Pink House’ by Andrew Finkel. The wooden building has since been pulled down and rebuilt in concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cornucopia.net/magazine/articles/the-pink-house/ | title=The Pink House | work=Cornucopia 3 | date=1993 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Finkel, Andrew}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1999 article ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ by [[John Carswell (art historian)|John Carswell]] documented the 14th-century tiles of the [[Muradiye Mosque, Edirne|Murad II Mosque]] in [[Edirne]]. These have since been vandalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cornucopia.net/magazine/articles/rhapsody-in-blue/ | title=Rhapsody in Blue | work=Cornucopia 3 | date=1999 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Carswell, John}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both cases this is the only photographic record in print.

* In 1999 [[James Mellaart]] chose to publish his controversial discovery of 9,000-year-old paintings of [[Çatalhüyük]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cornucopia.net/magazine/articles/under-the-volcano/ | title=Under the Volcano | work=Cornucopia 19 | date=1999 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Carswell, John}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
* [[Maureen Freely]], ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Finally, no one should go to Turkey without reading at least a few issues of Cornucopia (cornucopia.net), which has to be one of the most beautiful magazines in the world. Published here, its remit is Turkey - not its sordid politics, but its art, architecture, history and antiquities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/14/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview | title=Friends for Faraway Places | work=The Guardian | date=June 14, 2008 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Freely, Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "Surely one of the most intelligent and beautiful glossy magazines in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/748758/Craig-Brown-Istanbul-with-teenagers.html | title=Istanbul with Teenagers | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=15 February 2008 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Brown, Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tyler Brûlé]], founding editor of ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper*]]'' and ''[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]]'': "Focused on celebrating and chronicling all things [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-inspired and influenced, ''Cornucopia'' is a cross between ''[[World of Interiors]]'' and ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', with a gentle Turkic twist. I've been trying to collect all the missing back issues for years now and still have some annoying gaps in my neatly arranged stacks."&lt;ref&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Travis Elborough]], ''[[The Guardian]]'': "… boasting pages with the sheen of baklava and sumptuous full-colour photography throughout (and the photos, many stunning, do have the edge over the words in amount of space occupied), Cornucopia … doesn't skimp on writing of quality either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/19/7 | title=Crossing the world between covers | work=The Guardian | date=January 19, 2008 | accessdate=November 1, 2017 | author=Elborough, Travis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Caterina Scaramelli, who spent a summer helping out at their İstanbul office, is quoted in ''[[Today's Zaman]]'': “I see articles in Cornucopia as a journey into intriguing aspects of life, culture and history in Turkey; some are secret pearls waiting to be discovered, while others are subjects represented to the public with great attention to detail and accompanied by splendid photos. Cornucopia is a great travel companion, whether the journey is real or imagined. It's published three times a year and distributed both in Turkey and worldwide with around 18,000 copies sold each time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-189910-a-breath-of-fresh-air.html | title=A Breath of Fresh Air | work=Today's Zaman| author=Scaramelli, Caterina| date=October 15, 2009 | accessdate=November 1, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001104408/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=189910| archivedate=October 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuisine of Montevideo''' refers to the food cooked and served in the city of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. The cuisine served in the city is similar to that consumed in the country as a whole with [[beef]] being a staple of the diet and found in a range of foods and ''[[torta frita]]'',  a pan-fried cake. However, given the influx of immigrants and tourists into the capital over the decades and centuries, a range of cultural culinary influences can be found in the city.

In recent years the number of [[restaurant]]s and diversity of cuisine has increased considerably, [[Lonely Planet]] describes the Montevideo culinary scene as "just starting to get exciting" with the variety of restaurants springing up in the city from traditional [[Uruguayan cuisine]] to [[Japanese cuisine]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].&lt;ref name="LP Kazbah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/uruguay/montevideo/restaurants/felafel/kazbah|title=Kazbah|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Restaurant Arcadia'' atop the Plaza Victoria on the 25th floor of the [[Radisson Montevideo Victoria Plaza Hotel]] is widely regarded to be the finest restaurant in the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Cuisine==

==Bars and pubs==
[[File:Grilling sauages in Montevideo.jpg|thumb|Line cooks grilling sausages and other meats in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay.]]
Many of the notable bars in the city are located in the ''barrio'' of Pocitos near the sea. Amongst these pubs of note include the "Tibet Pub", "La Estada", "La Vuelta" and the "Rosh Bistró Bar".

Many bars and pubs are located inside community markets. Customers at markets may sit at bars to order sausages, [[offal]], [[asado]], and other meats that are being grilled right in front of them. Meats, especially cheap cuts of beef and pork such as sausages and organs, are a large part of the ordinary diet in Montevideo. The various meats are served with simple side dishes such as crusty bread, [[tapenade]]s, fried potatoes, and [[tapas]]. During lunch, local [[lager]] beer is the most common choice of accompaniment, although soft drinks such as colas are widely available. In addition to having bars and pubs, markets in Montevideo also sell fresh produce, [[Mate (beverage)|mate]], [[coffee]], kitchen ware, and other basic consumer goods.

[[File:The Shannon Irish Pub.jpg|thumb|230px|left|The Shannon Irish Pub]]
In the old area of the city or the immediate surroundings notable pubs include the "Shannon Irish pub" and "Chains Pub".

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

[[File:Its a bore.jpg|thumb|A cigarette advertisement on a billboard turned into a ''détournement'' by defacing the cowboy image and modifying the text, probably including "Marlboro," to read "It's a bore."]]
A '''détournement''' ({{IPA-fr|detuʁnəmɑ̃|lang}}), meaning "rerouting, hijacking" in [[French language|French]], is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],&lt;ref name="nues8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sami.is.free.fr/Oeuvres/debord_wolman_mode_emploi_detournement.html |title=Mode d'emploi du détournement |last1=Debord |first1=Guy-Ernest |last2=Wolman |first2=Gil J. |date=May 1956 |language=French |publisher=biblioteque-virtuelle |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later adapted by the [[Situationist International]] (SI),&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |journal=Situationist International |number=1 |title=Definitions |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was defined in the SI's inaugural 1958 journal as "[t]he integration of present or past artistic productions into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of those means. In a more elementary sense, ''détournement'' within the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method which reveals the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres."&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ubumexico.centro.org.mx/text/si/Internationale_situationniste_1.pdf |journal=internationale situationiste |title=Définitions |language=French |quote=Intégration de productions actuelles ou passées des arts dans une construction supérieure du milieu. Dans ce sens il ne peut y avoir de peinture ou de musique situationniste, mais un usage situationniste de ces moyens. Dans un sens plus primitif, le détournement à l'intérieur des sphères culturelles anciennes est une méthode de propagande, qui témoigne de l'usure et de la perte d'importance de ces sphères. |page=13 |number=1 |date=June 1958 |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It has been defined elsewhere as "turning expressions of the capitalist system and its [[media culture]] against itself"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Douglas B. Holt: Cultural Strategy Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands, Oxford University Press 2010, p.252&lt;/ref&gt;—as when slogans and logos are turned against their advertisers or the political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaste [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Détournement was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC&amp;pg=PT43 ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote: "...gioco al complotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement'' – inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk – che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, [[Malcolm McLaren]], a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scatenò, con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece è stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''."&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

Its opposite is [[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]], in which radical ideas or the social image of people who are viewed negatively are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.

==Definition==
In general it can be defined as a variation on previous work, in which the newly created work has a meaning that is antagonistic or antithetical to the original. The original media work that is ''détourned''&lt;!-- must check if détourned is syntactically correct --&gt; must be somewhat familiar to the target audience, so that it can appreciate the opposition of the new message. The artist or commentator making the variation can reuse only some of the characteristic elements of the originating work.

Détournement is similar to [[satire|satirical]] [[parody]], but employs more direct reuse or faithful [[mimicry]] of the original works rather than constructing a new work which merely alludes strongly to the original.  It may be contrasted with [[recuperation (sociology)|recuperation]], in which originally subversive works and ideas are themselves [[cultural appropriation|appropriated]] by mainstream media.

One could view détournement as forming the opposite side of the coin to '[[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]]' (where radical ideas and images become safe and commodified), in that images produced by the spectacle get altered and subverted so that rather than supporting the ''status quo'', their meaning becomes changed in order to put across a more radical or oppositional message.

[[Guy Debord]] and [[Gil J Wolman]] categorized détourned elements into two types: ''minor détournements'' and ''deceptive détournements''. Minor détournements are détournements of elements that in themselves are of no real importance such as a snapshot, a press clipping, an everyday object which draw all their meaning from being placed in a new context. Deceptive détournements are when already significant elements such as a major political or philosophical text, great artwork or work of literature take on new meanings or scope by being placed in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm A User's Guide To Détournement May 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

Détournement is the integration of past or present artistic production into a superior construction of a milieu. In this sense there can be no situationist painting or music, but only a situationist use of these means. In a more primitive sense, détournement with the old cultural spheres is a method of propaganda, a method that testifies to the wearing out and loss of importance of those spheres.&lt;ref name="SI58" /&gt;&lt;ref name="si58french"/&gt;

== Examples after the Situationist International ==
In the United States, [[Frank Discussion]] is widely known for his use of détournement in his works dating from the late 1970s through the present, particularly with the [[Feederz]]. The use of détournement by [[Barbara Kruger]] familiarised many with the technique, and it was extensively and effectively used as part of the early [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|HIV/AIDS activism]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Crimp, Douglas.  ''AIDS Demographics''. Bay Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of contemporary detournement include [[Adbusters]]' "[[subvertising|subvertisements]]" and other instances of [[culture jamming]], as well as poems composed collaboratively by [[Marlene Mountain]], [[Paul Conneally]], and others, in which quotations from such famous sources as the [[Ten Commandments]] and quotations by [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] are combined with haiku-like phrases to produce a larger work intended to subvert the original source.  The comic artist [[Brad Neely]]'s reinterpretation of [[Harry Potter]], ''[[Wizard People, Dear Reader|Wizard People]],'' took Warner Brother's first Harry Potter film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|The Sorcerer's Stone]],'' and substituted the original soundtrack with a narration that casts the hero as a [[Nietzschean]] [[Übermensch|superman]].

The concept of détournement has had a popular influence amongst contemporary radicals, and the technique can be seen in action in the present day when looking at the work of [[Culture Jammer]]s including the [[Cacophony Society]], [[Billboard Liberation Front]], [[monochrom]], Occupy Movements&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JD8jNCQ2gw Détournement of Bronzed Historical Icons adorns imaginary John Harvard with a Guy Fawkes mask]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adbusters]], whose 'subvertisements' 'detourn' [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] adverts, for example. In this case, the original advertisement's imagery is altered in order to draw attention to said company's policy of shifting their production base to cheap-labour third-world '[[free trade zone]]s'. However, the line between 'recuperation' and 'détournement' can become thin (or at least very fuzzy) at times, as [[Naomi Klein]] points out in her book ''[[No Logo]]''. Here she details how [[corporation]]s such as Nike, [[Pepsi]] or Diesel have approached Culture Jammers and Adbusters and offered them lucrative contracts in return for partaking in 'ironic' promotional campaigns. She points out further irony by drawing attention to merchandising produced in order to promote Adbusters' [[Buy Nothing Day]], an example of the recuperation of détournement if ever there was one.

Klein's arguments about irony [[wikt:reify|reifying]] rather than breaking down power structures are echoed by [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Žižek argues that the kind of distance opened up by détournement is the condition of possibility for ideology to operate: by attacking and distancing oneself from the sign-systems of capital, the subject creates a fantasy of transgression that "covers up" his/her actual complicity with capitalism as an overarching system. In contrast, scholars are very fond of pointing out the differences between [[hypergraphics]], 'detournement', the [[postmodern]] idea of [[cultural appropriation|appropriation]] and the [[Neoist]] use of [[plagiarism]] as the use of different and similar techniques used for different and similar means, effects and causes.

The [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] has a long history of aggressive détournement of extreme political ideologies, as do several [[industrial music|industrial music groups]], such as [[Die Krupps]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Front 242]].

[[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] uses détournement and [[culture jamming]] extensively in his work, particularly in the British television series ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[Brass Eye]]''.

The [[Istanbul]]-based platform InEnArt, on the occasion of the [[Istanbul Biennial|13th Istanbul Biennial]] 2013, launched  a forum titled Urban Voices focusing on phenomena that are turning expressions of the system and its media culture against itself. The authors of InEnArt are regularly publishing different phenomenas of détournement and invite the online community to participate by uploading similar examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Public Space as a Political Forum|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?page_id=11121|work=InEnArt|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edomite''' was a [[Canaanite language]], very similar to [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], spoken by the [[Edomites]] in southwestern [[Jordan]] and parts of [[Israel]] in the [[1st millennium BC]]. It is known only from a very small corpus. In early times, it seems to have been written with a [[Phoenician alphabet]]. Like [[Moabite language|Moabite]], it retained feminine ''-t''. However, in the 6th century BC, it adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet]]. Meanwhile, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] or [[Arabic]] features such as ''whb'' ("gave") and ''tgr'' ("merchant") entered the language, with ''whb'' becoming especially common in proper names.

According to ''[[Glottolog]]'', referencing Huehnergard &amp; Rubin (2011), Edomite was not a distinct language from Hebrew but a Hebraic dialect.&lt;ref name="Glottolog2" /&gt;

==Description and events==
[[File:Huntly Sees Syria.jpg|thumb|Refugee vigil in [[Huntly]], Aberdeenshire, Scotland.]]
The movement began after the [[death of Alan Kurdi]] whose image made global headlines after he drowned in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], as part of the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugee crisis]]. Candlelight vigils in [[Scotland]] were organized through Facebook  by Alexis Stearns to show solidarity for Syrian refugees and the victims of war.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands attend vigils in Scotland for refugees|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-34227188|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexis Stearns stated that "as a wealthy country, many of our citizens want to register their disgust at how little our government is doing to tackle a very serious situation. We hope that other towns and cities will now be inspired to launch events so that we can send a message from every corner of the world."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

More than 200,000 people have signed a nationwide petition calling on the UK Government to accept more asylum seekers and increase support for refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loxton|first1=Rachel|title=Glasgow pledges solidarity as refugees ask: How many children have to die?|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13645974.Glasgow_pledges_solidarity_as_refugees_ask__How_many_children_have_to_die_/|website=www.eveningtimes.co.uk|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Catholic Church]] in Scotland, the [[Church of Scotland]], the [[Muslim Council of Scotland]], and the [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]] have issued an Interfaith statement on the refugee crisis part of which reads ‘We welcome the UK and Scottish governments’ willingness to offer a safe haven to these desperate people. We urge them to back this with practical action to help as many refugees as possible, and we call on our communities to support this and make them welcome’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Refugee Crisis|url=http://www.st-john-ogilvie.org.uk/jpic.html|website=St John Ogilvie's|publisher=www.st-john-ogilvie.org.uk|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Glasgow]] hosted "Glasgow Hears Syria", a musical response to the refugee crisis.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Funds raised by the event split between [[Amnesty International]] and the Migrant Offshore Aid Agency.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Many financial institutions, governments and independent organizations have developed '''financial literacy curricula'''. A financial literacy [[curriculum]] teaches basic [[financial]] skills to students of various age groups. Some curricula are age specific while others seeks to teach universal principles to those of all ages.

==FDIC Money Smart==
Developed by the U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], Money Smart for Young Adults is a financial literacy curriculum designed for students between the ages of 12 and 20. It has 8 modules, each of which take approximately 110 minutes to complete. Money Smart for Young Adults focuses on saving, debt, home ownership. Money Smart for Young Adults does not currently offer an investing module.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/moneysmart/young.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flowers in the Attic''''' is a 1987 [[psychological horror]] film starring [[Louise Fletcher]], [[Victoria Tennant]], [[Kristy Swanson]], and [[Jeb Stuart Adams]]. It is based on [[V. C. Andrews]]' [[Flowers in the Attic|1979 novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harrington | first = Richard | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Flowers in the Attic | date = November 23, 1987 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/flowersintheatticpg13harrington_a0aa76.html | accessdate = 2007-01-05 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point [[Wes Craven]] was scheduled to direct the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wes Craven FITA Movie Script|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_craven.shtml|website=The V.C Andrews|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he even completed a screenplay draft. Producers were disturbed by his approach to the [[incest]]-laden story, however, and [[Jeffrey Bloom]] ended up with writing and directing duties.

==Plot==
After the sudden death of their father, four children — teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie — find themselves penniless and forced to travel with their mother Corrine to live with her wealthy parents (whom the children had neither met nor been told about before). Corrine informs her children that there has been tension between herself and her parents for many years, but does not elaborate and simply says they had cut her out of their lives for something she had done of which they disapproved. The children trust her, though Cathy is skeptical as she wonders what happened that caused the rift between her mother and her parents.

Corrine's mother, Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes her daughter and her children into her home, though with the harsh condition that the children must be sequestered away in a locked room so that her husband Malcolm (who is dying) will never know of their existence. To that end, the children are shut inside one bedroom of the mansion, only with access to the mansion's attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that their grandmother reveals the shocking truth of what caused Corrine to be disowned and stricken from her father's will years ago: Corrine's husband was really her uncle, her father's half-brother, making their love incestuous and their children the product of incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she had been savagely bullwhipped by her mother as punishment for her marrying her uncle and having children from the union. Corrine confesses to the children that she and their father were niece and uncle, and her parents were livid as they believed Corrine disgraced the family; the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corrine tells the children that her parents made it clear that if she had any children by her uncle she would be disinherited, but because her father doesn't know about them she still has a chance to get the money when he passes away. She says that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, they will be free and they will leave.

The plot focuses on the children's ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their incestuous conception. The children struggle to survive, even as their mother's visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers and are repeating the same incestuous acts like Corrine and her uncle did. Discovering them sleeping in the same bed one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father. After Olivia later discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but Olivia later ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off Cathy's hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn't die of starvation.

As time goes on, the children are often sick, especially Cory and Carrie. Chris and Cathy manage to secretly remove the hinges from their locked door on a few occasions to sneak out of their room, and discover that their mother has been living a life of luxury as well as dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She does eventually come to visit them again, and they confront her about not visiting them anymore and leaving them to suffer at the hands of their grandmother. Corrine is very defensive and acts insulted, cries that they are cruel to think that she is deliberately neglecting them or enjoying life while they are locked up, then storms out. Shortly after, Cory becomes deathly ill. The children ask Olivia and Corrine to take Cory to the hospital, which they do, but later Corrine returns to inform them Cory has died. The children are devastated, but not long after they discover their pet mouse is found dead after eating part of a cookie Cory didn't finish, arousing suspicion in Chris and he investigates the cookie. Chris researches and discovers that Cory and their mouse were killed via arsenic poisoning, mixed in the sugar on the cookies they are served with breakfast, and they believe it's their grandmother who's been poisoning them. The remaining siblings decide to leave the attic once and for all.

Chris sneaks out to steal money before they escape and discovers that their mother is planning to marry Bart Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Though upset, he suggests to Cathy they dress in fancy clothes from the attic, and use the wedding as a cover to sneak out of the house. When Olivia secretly enters their bedroom the next day, hoping to catch them once more doing something "evil", Chris takes her by surprise and beats her unconscious with a bedpost. As they are leaving, Cathy, not wanting her mother to get away with what she did to them and leaving them to suffer by their grandmother's hands, tells Chris they need to find their grandfather and tell him the truth so Corrine would lose her inheritance; they had come across him sleeping in his room once before while out and investigating their mother's absence. However, when they enter his room, they find it empty, with the bed dismantled: their grandfather has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will that was two months old, which reveals a clause that states that if it is ever revealed Corrine had children from her first marriage, even after his death, she will be disinherited and lose all of her money. They realize that Corrine was the one poisoning the cookies, not their grandmother, and their mother was trying to kill them all so no one would know of their existence and secure her inheritance.

The children crash the wedding ceremony and expose their mother to the guests and the groom; Corrine refuses to acknowledge the children as her own, and Cathy and Chris scold their mother for saying that she would come get them after her father died but breaking the promise when he did pass away, and Chris reveals they found the recent will and told her she knew no one could find out about them or she would lose everything, even after her father's death. Corrine denies it, then Chris shows everyone the dead mouse, proving that she tried killing them all, succeeding with Cory, when the new will was made. Cathy demands to know why her mother did those horrible things to them and offers her mother an arsenic-coated cookie as a wedding present, and in fury tries to force her mother to eat it, chasing her out to a balcony. After a brief struggle, Corrine accidentally falls and dies. Afterward, the children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn; the narrator (an older Cathy's voiceover) explains that the children did manage to survive all by themselves, Chris went to medical school and became a doctor, Cathy got a job and started dancing again, although Carrie was "never truly healthy". She wonders aloud if her grandmother is still alive, anticipating Cathy's eventual return to claim the family's fortune.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
[[V. C. Andrews]] herself demanded and, eventually, got script approval when she sold the film rights to producers Thomas Fries and Sy Levin. She turned down five scripts (the violent and graphic screenplay by Wes Craven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wes Craven FITA Movie Script|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_craven.shtml|website=The Complete V.C Andrews|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected by the producers, though), before choosing the script by [[Jeffrey Bloom]], who would also direct. Obviously, Bloom's script was the one that was the closest to the novel, but, as he did not have full control over the matter of the film, the numerous producers and the two studios forcefully made changes in the script, thus stripping from it many plot points and themes of the novel, including the incestuous relationship between the oldest siblings. Bloom said there was a lot of conflict in production but could do nothing to talk the producers out of the many drastic changes made in the script.

Originally, Bloom wanted [[David Shire]] to score the film, but [[Christopher Young]] was chosen by the producers instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Veteran actresses [[Louise Fletcher]] and [[Victoria Tennant]] were cast as the Grandmother and Mother, respectively, while the four children were played by newcomers [[Kristy Swanson]], [[Jeb Stuart Adams]], Ben Ryan Ganger, and [[Lindsay Parker]]. Swanson once claimed when V.C. Andrews met her, she said Swanson was just like she pictured Cathy.

Being a fairly low-budget production, Bloom said, big names were not considered for any role in the film. Jeffrey Bloom had a young [[Sharon Stone]] audition for the film, but he could not convince the producers to give her the part of Corrine, the mother.

===Filming===
Louise Fletcher wanted to get deep inside her role, so she called Andrews one night to ask about the motivation of her character in the film. She was also so into the part, that she stayed strictly within the character of the Grandmother all the time, even when she wasn't shooting. "I couldn't let myself think about distractions like what a beautiful day or what are we going to have for lunch?" she said in an interview.

Andrews was also given a cameo as a maid in Foxworth Hall, scrubbing the glass of a window after Chris and Cathy attempt to escape from the rooftop. Anne Patty, present at the filming of Andrews' scene, said that her part is [[metaphor]]ical. "The writer is a person who wipes the window clean so that the reader can clearly see into the lives of the characters".

Bloom claims that, after the filming was completed, the producers approached him to refilm a new ending, and one of the many ideas was that the siblings accidentally kill Corinne during their escape. Bloom tried to talk them out of it and when he was unable to convince them otherwise, he eventually quit. The new ending, partly inspired by the ending of Wes Craven's own screenplay, was eventually filmed by someone else.

[[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]], a [[Tudor Revival]] mansion in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]] served as Foxworth Hall and was the main location at which nearly all interior and exterior scenes were filmed. The beginning scene shows the children walking towards the front of the house after being dropped off by the bus. In reality the bus stop is at the end of the rolling green where the lawn ends and the ocean begins. The final scene of the film where Cathy pushes her mother Corrine off of the balcony and her bridal veil gets caught in the trellis, strangling her to death, was filmed at [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].

===Post-production===
Jeffrey Bloom had no involvement in the final edit of the film, as he had walked off the set, and the new ending was inserted. He also claimed, regarding scenes involving the incest between Chris and Cathy, scenes were indeed cut.

Bloom's original early cut of the movie was screened to a test audience in December 1986 in San Fernando Valley and it was met with negative reactions, mostly because of the scenes of incest between Cathy and Chris. The test audience, mostly consisting of female adolescents (the same demographic the book series was targeted towards), reported in test cards that they were revolted by the scenes and another where Corrine disrobes in front of her father to be whipped by her mother. They also disliked the original ending where Louise Fletcher's character tries to kill the children with a butcher knife because they found it to be "too horrific".

The producers insisted on a new ending because they thought that the audience for the film would want to see the children take revenge on Corrine, so an unknown director was brought in to film the new ending where Corrine dies (despite the fact that her character lives in the first three books in the series), but the scene was filmed with Victoria Tennant's stunt double since the actress refused to film the scene (She preferred the original ending to the film.) and walked off set. While rest of the movie was filmed in Massachusetts, new ending was filmed in California. Following severe re-cutting of the film, which was done not just to remove "sensitive content" but also to make it shorter to secure more theatrical screenings, as well as the addition of the infamous new ending that writer and director Jeffrey Bloom hated and refused to film, the film was again screened to a test audience in January 1987. This version was met with more positive feedback and was the version that ended up being released in theaters. Due to drastic re-editing, the film was pushed back to November from its original release in March, almost an entire year later after Bloom's original cut was completed and test screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-15/entertainment/ca-20643_1_meat-cleaver|title=No Rose Garden|first=Sheldon|last=Teitelbaum|date=15 November 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the scenes deleted from the final cut of the film was shown in a TV program covering the behind-the-scenes production of the film. It's an extended scene from when Chris and Cathy enter Corrine's bedroom. It shows Cathy going about the room wondering why there are no pictures of Corrine's children or her husband in the room. Another deleted scene was shown being filmed where Corrine and the grandmother confront each other after Cory's death and the grandmother is shown smiling, indicating that she was involved in Cory's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8s-P9Cy6DQ|title=V.C. Andrews Last Interview?|first=|last=amy butchas|date=21 August 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bloom in a 2010 interview, nudity and scenes of incest being cut out wasn't done solely because of negative feedback from test audiences but also because the studio and the producers wanted to secure a lower rating. It got to the point where even the "small shots and small suggestive stuff" were cut out to make sure that the film got a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.&lt;ref&gt;http://natsukashi.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/flowers-in-the-attic-with-director-jeffrey-bloom/ (13:55)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristy Swanson also confirmed in a 2014 interview that there was a test screening which had all scenes of incest included, but when the audience found them to be uncomfortable, they were cut out. Producer Sy Levin also mentioned that one of the cut scenes had Chris watching Cathy through the crack of the door while she was taking off her clothes and getting into a bathtub. Also, test screenings of the film in San Jose and Ohio, after re-editing, were said to include another alternate ending but no further details were reported. According to an LA Times interview (at the time when the movie was released in theaters) with actor Alex Koba who played butler John Hall, just like in Andrews' novel his character also had much bigger role in the original script and also provided a key surprise plot twist. After several rewrites his character was severely reduced and has only one line of dialogue in all the film, "Good evening Mr. Winthrop", and the butler had become little more than a gloomy figure in black who wheels a serving cart back and forth across the screen. And the plot twist was gone. Koba also said about different versions of the endings for the movie: "They had three different endings for that movie, and they picked the worst one, the one you're seeing now." In another, earlier article it was also mentioned that Bloom's original intended ending was very similar to the ending of the original book, and it included the children simply walking out of their attic prison into the sunshine during the wedding, to symbolize growing up, Bloom said, with "the way to freedom clear." It is not known whether this version of the ending was included only in Bloom's original script, or whether it actually was filmed and is the second alternate ending that was shown in some test screenings. Despite interest from fans, no uncut version of the film was released, nor was Bloom's original director's cut, and it is not known if the deleted footage still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/631039-exclusive-interview-kristy-swanson-revisits-flowers-in-the-attic|title=Exclusive Interview: Kristy Swanson Revisits Flowers in the Attic|date=16 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-02/entertainment/ca-17371_1_big-screen|title=Actor's Big Screen 'Splash' Evaporates in Cutting Room|first=JAN|last=HERMAN|date=2 December 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bloom, the original ending went like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Briefly, the surviving children interrupt the wedding ceremony and dramatically confront Corrine. All in attendance are horrified by what the children say about how their mother locked them up and poisoned them. The groom is shocked speechless. The grandmother is outraged. The grandfather is there, in his wheelchair, to hear it all. Corrine denies everything, but it doesn't matter; it's too late. The children's story is bolstered by the fact that they look half dead. They leave the wedding, but before leaving the house the grandmother tries to attack them [with a big knife]. They're saved by John Hall, the butler. The grandmother is subdued by him and the children leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml#altending|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans of the book, who both disliked the film's slow pacing, acting and plot changes. It currently holds a rating of 13% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 8 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flowers_in_the_attic/| title=Flowers in the Attivc (1987)| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] commented that "V.C. Andrews novel of incestuous relationships and confined childhood always has been a superb candidate for a film treatment, but director Jeffrey Bloom has taken narrative and squeezed the life from it. Performances are as stiff and dreary as the attic these children are imprisoned in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/1986/film/reviews/flowers-in-the-attic-1200427264| title=Flowers in the Attic| publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=December 31, 1986| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrington of [[The Washington Post]] said of the time that "it is slow, stiff, stupid and senseless, a film utterly lacking in motivation, development, and nuance, and further marred by embarrassingly flat acting and directing".&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Richard{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp.../movies/.../flowersintheatticpg13harrington_a0aa76.htm| title=Flowers in the Attic| publisher=[[The Washington Post]]| date= 27 November 1987| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Guide]] rated the film at one out of four stars and mentioned that "the film version of Andrews' novel is incredibly tame and downright boring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/flowers-in-the-attic/114974/| title=Flowers in the Attic| publisher=[[TV Guide]]| date=18 February 2014| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (magazine)#Time Out London|Time Out London]] stated that "as fantasy stripped of all the metaphorical trimmings, the sublimely ridiculous plot is more likely to reduce an audience to laughter than to tears"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/flowers-in-the-attic| title=Flowers in the Attic| publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reviews were slightly more mixed; A review published in 2012 on the website Basement Rejects gave the film four and a half stars out of ten and stated that "''Flowers in the Attic'' is in the so-bad-its-good category. It teeters on the edge of just bad, but it has a bit of a kitschy feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.basementrejects.com/review/flowers-in-the-attic-1987| title=Flowers in the Attic (1987)| publisher=Basement Rejects| date=26 January 2012| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A March 2018 review for the website Cinemas Fringes on the upcoming Arrow Films Blu-ray release was somewhat more favorable in which it was more critical of the acting, but mentioned that "''Flowers in the Attic'' is a film with lots of issues but it's still diverting as a piece of 1980s nostalgia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinemasfringes.com/dvd-blu-ray/?post_id=418&amp;title=flowers-in-the-attic-(1987)-starring-louise-fletcher-blu-ray-(arrow)| title=Flowers in the Attic (1987) starring Louise Fletcher Blu Ray (Arrow)| publisher=Cinemas Fringes| date= 8 March 2018| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a positive review on the Cinematic Addiction website, where it was praised for its acting, direction and music and was said that "''Flowers in the Attic'' is a good movie. It's certainly not a film for everyone − it deals with some very disturbing themes − but it is an effective movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cinematicaddiction.com/2017/10/film-review-flowers-in-attic-1987.html| title=Film Review: Flowers in the Attic (1987)| publisher=Cinematic Addiction| date= 3 October 2017| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The movie debuted at No. 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : Disney Loses One to 'Moving'|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-08/entertainment/ca-597_1_box-office|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
The film's reception by fans of the book and critics was mostly negative, but [[Kristy Swanson]] won a [[Young Artist Award]] in 1989 for her portrayal of Cathy Dollanganger, while in 1988, [[Louise Fletcher]] was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for her performance as the Grandmother.

==Sequel==
According to [[Kristy Swanson]] herself, a sequel to the film adaptation based on the novel's sequel, ''[[Petals on the Wind]]'', was planned but eventually it never reached production. Once again, Fries Entertainment was going to be producing the sequel and the script was written by Mark David Perry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = *Mark David Perry website* | date = | year = | url = http://markdavidperry.com/Site/adaptation.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would be based on the same plotline of the sequel novel, with the exception of the lack of Corinne Foxworth's character since she was killed off in the original film.

Kristy Swanson agreed to do the part one more time but she was never contacted again about the film after she was sent the script: "I was sent a script of ''Petals on the Wind'' and it never took off ... I remember running into [[Louise Fletcher]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] about four years ago. She asked me if I had gotten the ''Petals on the Wind'' script, which I had, and she wanted to know if I had read it. I told her I had and that they had called me about it. I was interested but then I didn't hear from them anymore. And apparently the same thing happened with her. It's like they wanted to do it but they couldn't get it off the ground ... When I read the script, I wasn't too thrilled with it. I know Cathy goes through a lot in the next book, and the script was a real "sexfest." She gets pregnant and has so many affairs. There's her brother, Christopher, and then she has an affair with Julian, the dancer, and there's Paul, the doctor. I was actually kind of wondering if I should even do a sequel, you know? I just didn't know if it should be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = *Broken Flowers* [A Dollanganger Series Fansite] | date = | year = | url = http://vcadolls.madhatbox.org/english/cast_crew.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Four O'Clock'''" is episode 94 (season 3, number 29) of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|That's Oliver Crangle, a dealer in petulance and poison. He's rather arbitrarily chosen four o'clock as his personal [[Götterdämmerung]], and we are about to watch the metamorphosis of a twisted fanatic, poisoned by the gangrene of prejudice, to the status of an avenging angel, upright and omniscient, dedicated and fearsome. Whatever your clocks say, it's four o'clock, and wherever you are it happens to be the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
Oliver Crangle is a paranoid fanatic who lives in an apartment with his parrot Pete. He maintains records of people he believes to be "evil". He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world. He settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle's parrot Pete periodically calls out "nut," asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him, not realizing that Pete is also, in effect, calling Crangle a "nut."

His landlady Mrs. Williams arrives, whom he berates and treats horribly to make her leave.  Mrs. Lucas also comes to Crangle's apartment and pleads for Crangle to leave her husband, a doctor, alone. Crangle is convinced that because her husband was unable to save the life of a woman in the ER who died from her injuries, that he is a murderer and evil. Due to Crangle's letter writing to the hospital, her husband's colleagues and coworkers abuse him, which Mrs. Lucas wants Crangle to stop. Crangle simply believes that those people are also evil. Mrs. Lucas leaves realizing that Crangle is insane.

Crangle calls a number of government agencies, and Agent Hall of the FBI is sent to investigate. Crangle tells him of his plan to shrink every evil person at 4:00 that afternoon through sheer force of will, also mentioning that he believes all evil people are collaborating in a worldwide conspiracy. He believes that by shrinking all evil people to two feet tall, that they will be unable carry on their everyday lives, and eventually become extinct. Hall asks Crangle if he has ever had any psychiatric help and tells Crangle that they do not need his kind of help because they have the law. Hall says that both support and help in upholding the law are appreciated, but what Crangle is doing is instead interference. Crangle accuses him of being in on the conspiracy. As Hall leaves, Crangle screams at him that he too will be two feet tall in just 20 minutes.

When 4:00 rolls around, Crangle is horrified to find that he himself has been shrunk to two feet tall. He struggles in vain to get up to his window sill, and one last time Pete calls out the word "nut".

In the [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|radio adaptation]] starring [[Stan Freberg]], the ending was altered to be more gruesome as Pete the parrot mistakes the now-shrunken Crangle for a "nut".&lt;ref&gt;''The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas'' Vol. 4, Blackstone Audio, Inc., {{ISBN|978-1482937022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|At four o'clock, an evil man made his bed and lay in it, a pot called a kettle black, a stone-thrower broke the windows of his glass house. You look for this one under 'F' for fanatic and 'J' for justice in the Twilight Zone.}}

'''"Girls"''' is a [[short story]] written by [[Mrinal Pande]].  It was first published in the Hindi weekly ''[[Dharmyug]]'' in 1983, and in [[English language]] translation in the weekly ''[[Manushi]]'' in the same year.

==Plot==
"Girls" is told from the viewpoint of an eight-year-old girl, and highlights how [[India]]n society takes women for granted and conditions them to accept a secondary role in the family. It also shows that many a times, women themselves are the one's who consider women inferior. In the story, the narrator's father has been shown as a kind man. He wants his daughters to get educated and become something in their lives. The narrator's mother, Lali, has three daughters and is expecting a fourth child, fervently hoping that it is a boy so that she will be rid of the nuisance of going through another pregnancy. Lali, the narrator and her sisters go to Nani's (maternal grandmother's) house for the last months of pregnancy. Throughout the stay there, the narrator notices how the members of the house consider women inferior, and is fed up of the elders' hypocrisy. There occur many incidents that keep remind the narrator of a girl's subjugative position in orthodox Indian society. Only the grandson is allowed to sit on ''Nani's'' lap whereas the girls are sent away. Nani and all the elders of the house pray to the family goddess that the baby born be a son so as to uphold the 'family honor'. The narrator overhears her aunt complaining in whispers to her mother of the problems she has to endure as a woman. Such incidents leave a lasting impact on the already insecure mind of the narrator, who is curious to know why the elders consider women and girls to be inferior. Her innocent curiosity greatly angers Lali, Nani and the others. Lakshmi, the narrator's elder sister, advises her not to ask the elders such questions.
Then comes the holy day when ''kanyakumaris'' or young girls are to be worshipped as goddesses. Nani, who earlier shows herself to be a woman who agrees that women are inferior, now calls her granddaughters lovingly to partake of the prasad and participate in the rituals. The elders' hypocrisy shocks the narrator and is too much for her to bear. She bursts into tears, shouting angrily that if they did not love girls, why did they pretend to worship them?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">'''Goat gland''' was a term applied {{circa|1927–1929}}, during the period of transition from [[silent film]]s to [[sound film]]s.  It referred to an already completed silent film to which one or more talkie sequences were added in an effort to make the otherwise redundant film more suitable for release in the radically altered market conditions. The name was derived by analogy from the treatment devised by [[John R. Brinkley#Goat gland transplantation|Dr. John R. Brinkley]] as an alleged cure for [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]].

The '''Great Industrial Exhibition''' in 1853 was held in [[Dublin]], Ireland. In its day, it was the largest international event to be held in Ireland. The Irish Industrial Exhibition Building, located on the grounds of [[Leinster House]],&lt;ref name="llawn"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=9 November 2016|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/about/history/leinsterhouse/|title=Leinster House, Houses of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed the entire fair. It lasted from the 12 May to 31 October, [[Queen Victoria]] accompanied by the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] and the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], paid an official visit on 29 August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/science-technology/the-1853-international-in/index.xml The 1853 International Industrial Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.lib.umd.edu/worldsfairs?pid=umd:986 Dublin 1853 Main Hall – A Treasury of World's Fair Art &amp; Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
It was entirely funded by [[William Dargan]], entrepreneur and developer of Irish railways. He had planned to donate $100,000 to the effort, but ended up giving $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;*Ingram, J.S.The Centennial Exposition; Described and Illustrated. St. Louis: Hubbard Bros., 1876. p. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the exhibition was to introduce the industrial revolution to Ireland, which was behind some other European countries.

==Irish Industrial Exhibition Building==
Visitors were struck with the richness and splendor of the building more than by any of the objects that it contained.{{original research inline|date=October 2016}} Critics described the large exhibition building and "the rapidity with which it was erected" (a few months), and "the sufficiency of its plans, and the enormous mass of its carefully worked materials."&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, John. Irish Industrial Exhibition 1853. London: William S. Orr &amp; Co., 1854. p. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The building is described by The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue as:

:''Presenting a front to Merrion-square of 300 feet, the main or centre feature of elevation consists of a semicircular projection, which forms the Eastern termination of the Central Hall. This in a noble apartment of 425 feet in length, and 100 feet in height, covered by a semicircular roof trellis robs, in one span of 100 feet. On each side of the Centre upon trellis ribs, in one span of 100 feet. On each side of the Centre Hall, and running parallel to it for the same length, are two halls 50 feet wide, with domed roofs, similar to that which covers the main nave or hall of the building. The Height from the floor to the roof of each of these halls is 65 feet. They are approached through passages from the Centre Hall. In addition to these three halls are four compartments of 25 feet wide, running the whole length of the building; two are placed between the Centre Hall and the side halls, and two on each side of the latter; divided into sections of 25 feet square, forming convenient divisions for the purposes of classification. Over these compartments are spacious galleries, also running the length of the building, which not only afford increased space for exhibition, but form an agreeable promenade from whence the effect of the three halls may be seen to greater advantage. To the south of the Central Hall, left of the spectator, is a hall devoted to foreign contributions; adjacent to which is the Fine Arts Court, corresponding in position to the Machinery Court. The northern and southern courts have galleries running round them, from which the spectator also looks into the Central Court. The ceiling of the halls being divided into panels formed by the trellis ribs, and the other constructive parts of the building, has allowed ample opportunity for effective decoration. Light is admitted from above in one unbroken and equally distributed body. The construction of the building is strongly marked on the elevation, and forms in fact the ornamental character of the design. There are also external galleries which are attractive features. The materials of the building are iron, timber, and glass.''

On 12 May 1853, when the exhibition opened, the architect (who had also been the architect for the [[Irish Industrial Exhibition|industrial exhibition]] held in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] the previous year), [[John Benson (architect)|John Benson]], was granted a [[knighthood]]. Part of the roof blew off during a storm on Christmas Eve, the year before opening.

==Exhibits==
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|The 8th century [[Tara Brooch]] was exhibited at the Exhibition alongside [[Celtic Revival]] jewellery]]
Some limited Irish furniture industry was shown, including the linen and lace industry which the Irish could identify with. Also [[Bog wood]] carvings and [[Celtic Revival]] jewellery and other items were showcased, including the [[Tara Brooch]], displayed with the modern imitations which were already fashionable.  However none of this inspired new Irish Industry.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There were a few American exhibits including [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Singer Corporation|Singer]]. Colt sold 40 pistols to the Irish prison system.

There were also some exhibits from Australia, including examples of gold from several fields.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders's News-Letter and Daily Advertiser [Dublin], 8th June 1853, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first Worlds Fair to exhibit fine arts paintings.  Included in the fine arts section were the calotype photographs which had been taken by Edward King-Tenison, of Castle Tenison, Co. Roscommon of the villages and towns of Spain. E.K. Tenison had developed a technique which enabled him to enlarge his pictures to a size which were appropriate for exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lumenous-lint.com/app/photographer/E_K_Tenison{{deadlink|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British exhibits were limited to those companies who were looking for markets in Ireland, with little success. It was only during its last month that Dargan convinced the railways to offer a very inexpensive excursions rate and combined with an admission ticket for almost nothing, did some of the general Irish public get to see the crystal palace in Dublin.

==Outcome==
The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue commented;
:"''We consider the Great Exhibition held in Dublin in the year 1853, as even a larger contribution to the wealth of these kingdoms, than the Great Exhibition which took place in London in the year 1851; and we do not doubt that His Royal Highness Prince Albert, on visiting the Irish Capital, will earnestly rejoice that his indefatigable exertions and enlightened policy – which made that year memorable – have again borne rich fruitage, and again advanced the best interest of his country.''"&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Dublin Exhibition Catalogue. London: Virtue,1853. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
However, overall attendance was lower than expected at approximately 1.15 million visitors,&lt;ref&gt;Alun C. Davies, Ireland's Crystal Palace, 1853 in J. M. Goldstrom and L. A. Carkson (eds.) Irish Population, Economy and Society (Oxford, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Dargan with a financial loss of approximately £9,000. This has been attributed to the fact the common Irish country person could not identify with much of the technology of the time.{{fact|date=November 2017}} It was also overshadowed by the exhibitions held in New York ([[Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations]]) and London the same year.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''''Hanger''''' is a 2009 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Ryan Nicholson]], and co-written by Patrick Coble. Film is banned in Australia and Germany.

== Plot ==

Unable to bring in anymore money for Leroy, her abusive pimp, the pregnant Rose tries to run away in the middle of the night, but is caught by Leroy. Using a clothes hanger, Leroy performs an impromptu abortion on Rose, unintentionally killing her in the process. Leroy disposes of Rose's baby in a dumpster, where its cries attract the attention of a homeless man, who raises the disfigured child as "Hanger".

On his eighteenth birthday, the vagrant sends Hanger off to live with John, his biological father, who the man had earlier met at a junkyard. John informs Hanger that he has gotten him a job at the junkyard, and that he will be working there and living with Russell, an acquaintance with [[Down syndrome]]. As he drives away with Hanger, John runs over the homeless man (who was defecating in his tent) and joyously tells his long-lost son "Welcome to the rest of your life!" John gives Hanger a picture of Rose, and picks up a prostitute for him to have sex with, but upon seeing Hanger's mutilated face, the woman goes into hysterics, so John crushes her head in his truck door.

While Hanger is watching pornography with Russell in their home, a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] visits, and Hanger mauls and partially eats her while being cheered on by Russell. Later, John drops by, and reveals to Hanger that he has a plan to get revenge on Leroy for what he did to Rose. On his way out, John is approached by Foxy White, Leroy's girlfriend, who offers to help John kill Leroy. John turns down Foxy's offer, but says he will make Leroy suffer "a little extra" if Foxy watches over Hanger.

While Hanger is at work, John is captured by Leroy and a prostitute named Trashy, who disfigure him with a [[blow torch]], and a hanger. Foxy finds John and tries to release him, but Leroy walks in on this, and shoots Foxy in the head. As that occurs, Russell and Hanger are drugged by Phil, a co-worker, who rapes them while wearing a [[Santa suit]]; at one point, Phil inserts his penis into Hanger's leaking [[colostomy]]. Russell and Hanger get their revenge on Phil at the junkyard, knocking him out, and placing him under a pile of garbage. Russell goes home and drinks tea made from used [[tampon]]s, but after getting a call from Hanger, Russell goes to the junkyard, and finds Nicole (the owner's daughter) unconscious in her office, Hanger having knocked her out with Phil's drugs.

Russell takes Nicole's tampon, and she is later found by Leroy, who rapes her while she is unconscious, and threatens her into luring away Russell so Leroy can be alone with Hanger. Once he is in Nicole's office, Russell is seemingly killed by Leroy, who chokes him with one of Nicole's tampons. Outside, Hanger stomps Phil's head in, and is confronted by Leroy, but John (who was left for dead, but recovered and killed Trashy by shoving a [[douche]] up her nose) appears and calls Leroy out. Leroy and John fatally shoot each other, and a distraught Hanger runs off with the hysterical Nicole.

== Reception ==

Film Bizarro found ''Hanger'' to be "a great entertaining trash-fest that has come the closest to being a true throwback to [[grindhouse]] cinema that any movie has so far" despite the ending feeling erratic and anticlimactic. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.filmbizarro.com/view_review.php?review=hanger.php|title = Hanger|last = Carnell|first = Preston|publisher = Film Bizarro|date = |website = filmbizarro.com|accessdate = 11 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; A three and a half was awarded by Severed Cinema, which wrote that "''Hanger'' is as entertaining as it is repulsive" and "the film is a fun campy horror comedy". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://severed-cinema.com/h-reviews/hanger-plotdigger-films-breaking-glass-pictures|title = Hanger - Plotdigger Films - Breaking Glass Pictures|last = Mayo|first = Chris|publisher = Severed Cinema|date = 25 April 2010|website = severedcinema.com|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; Independent Flicks commended the camerawork, editing, gore, and Dan Ellis's performance, but gave a four and half out of seven after deeming the film "a bit too bizarre" and "something of a let down" due to the "cartoonish style" that lessened its impact. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.se/2012/07/dvd-review-hanger-video-2009.html?zx=361a78d199d6e35b|title = Hanger (Video 2009)|last = Lundin|first = Jorgen|publisher = Independent Flicks|date = 21 July 2012|website = daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.se|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A three out of five was awarded by Digital Retribution, which stated "''Hanger'' is hard to rate because it sets out to offend and will probably do so for virtually everyone, but that doesn't make it good" and "I found ''Hanger's'' [[padding]] and surrealism distracting and a bit boring". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.digital-retribution.com/reviews/dvd1/313.php|title = Hanger (2009)|last = Bertsch|first = Devon|publisher = Digital Retribution|date = 5 April 2010|website = digital-retribution.com|accessdate = 17 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; The film was called "Nicholson's nastiest piece of work yet" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which deemed it "worthless" and one of the most "vile" films the website has covered. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/nicholson.html#Hanger|title = Ryan Nicholson|last = |first = |publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|date = |website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 7 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/special.html|title = Special Mention (Most Extreme Movies)|last = |first = |publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|date = |website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 7 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lenong''''' is a traditional theatrical form of the [[Betawi people]] in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.

==Description==
''Lenong'' is a form of [[theatre]] traditional to the [[Betawi people]] of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. Dialogue is generally in the [[Betawi language|Betawi dialect]]. Actions and dialogue are often presented in a humorous manner on top of a stage known as a ''pentas tapal kuda'', so named for the way actors enter the stage from the left and right. Audiences sit in front of the stage.{{sfn|JCG, Lenong}} The number of performers is determined by the needs of the story. Male performers are referred to as ''panjak'', while female performers are known as ''[[ronggeng]]''.{{sfn|JCG, Lenong}} Performers are generally poorly educated.{{Sfn|Shahab|2001|p=133}}

A performance is generally opened with a prayer, known as ''ungkup'', and a ritual offering. The performers are then introduced. ''[[Gambang kromong]]'' is one of the musical genres which may accompany a performance. Musicians may use various instruments, including flutes, gongs, accordions, or drums. The songs are traditionally quite formulaic, and several songs are common in performances, including "Cente Manis" and "Jali-Jali". Chinese musical influences can be seen.{{sfn|JCG, Lenong}}

Performances can be classified under many genres, although most are about heroes or criminals; tales adapted from folklore, such as from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', are also common. In broad strokes there are two main subdivisions of ''lenong'', namely ''lenong denes'' and ''lenong preman''. Stories in ''lenong denes'' focus on the exploits of the nobility, the rich, and the powerful. ''Lenong preman'' stories are always about commoners or folk heroes. The type of performance will affect the costumes worn.{{sfn|JCG, Lenong}} Stories are not memorised from a script. Rather, performers will memorise an orally-presented outline and follow that, with improvisation as necessary.{{sfn|Loven|2008|p=142}}

==History==
''Lenong'' developed from the earlier form ''Gambang Rancag''. In its earlier years, beginning around the turn of the twentieth century, it was promoted by [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]. This has left fairly extensive Chinese influences in the genre.{{sfn|JCG, Lenong}}

''Lenong'' performances from the 1920s and 1930s often focused on the exploits of bandits, including [[Si Pitung]]{{sfn|van Till|1996|p=462}} and [[Tjerita Si Tjonat|Si Tjonat]].{{sfn|Toer|1982|pp=28–9}} These bandits, though portrayed as despicable people by Dutch and ethnic Chinese writers, became more [[Robin Hood]]-like in ''lenong''; Si Pitung, for instance, became a humble person, a good Muslim, a hero of [[Betawi people]], and an upholder of justice.{{sfn|van Till|1996|p=462}}

During the 1950s, Sudiro, the governor of Jakarta, restricted performances of traditional theatre such as ''lenong''. Meanwhile, the booming [[Cinema of Indonesia|domestic film industry]] meant that ''lenong'' performances could not compete on the market.{{sfn|Loven|2008|p=211}} Troupes had to go from ''[[kampung]]'' to ''kampung'', offering performances for money which, ultimately, was not always enough to survive on.{{Sfn|Shahab|2001|p=130}} By the early 1960s ''lenong'' was nearly extinct.{{sfn|Loven|2008|p=211}}

During the 1970s, Governor [[Ali Sadikin]] gave greater freedom to traditional culture.{{sfn|Loven|2008|p=211}} In this atmosphere, cultural critic and film director [[D.&amp;nbsp;Djajakusuma]] worked to promote and preserve ''lenong'', with regular performances at [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]]; as a result, S. M. Ardan considers him as having saved the genre.{{sfn|Ardan 1987, Djaduk Djajakusuma}} Many ''lenong'' actors, including [[Benyamin Sueb]], Madra, and Enung Tile bin Bayan, began making films in the 1970s.{{sfn|Loven|2008|pp=78–79}}

''Lenong'' has been televised before. In the early 1990s, Harry de Fretes combined ''lenong'' and [[sitcom]]s to create ''Lenong Rumpi'' (literally ''Gossip Lenong''), which was broadcast on [[RCTI]] from 1991 to 1992. Unlike stage performances, performers on this televised ''lenong'' were mostly not native Betawi speakers.{{sfn|Loven|2008|pp=168–69}}

NOTE TO EDITORS ABOUT THIS LIST:
Before adding to or re-ordering this list, please make sure you are
using the proper, credible information:

1) Please report the standardized enrollment figures from the Common
Data Set (search the school's website for "Common Data Set" and you 
should find it). The reason to use the CDS is that it makes sure that
all schools calculate enrollment in exactly the same way, so it is the
only good way to compare enrollment counts between schools.

2) This page is for individual campuses only. There is a separate article
for universities, and a separate article for undergraduate enrollment.
Please make sure that the enrollment figures you use are only for a single
campus of a public four-year university.

3) Do not vandalize the list or otherwise edit the information in a manner
which cannot be verified by reputable sources.

*A single Individual campus with a single physical location of a four-year [[public university]] within the [[United States]]
*Enrollment is the sum of the headcount of undergraduate students
*Enrollment is counted by the 21st-day headcount, as provided to the [[United States Department of Education]] under the [[Common Data Set]] program.
*Campuses that have small secondary physical locations that are not reported separately (for extended education, outreach, etc.) are indicated with a footnote.

'''What this list does not include:'''
*[[University system]]s, or universities that have multiple physical campuses.

The novel {{lang|es|'''[[Don Quixote]]'''}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|_|k|iː|ˈ|h|oʊ|t|iː}}; {{Audio-es|Don Quijote|Don Quijote-pronunciation-es 2.ogg}}, fully titled '''''The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha''''', {{lang-es|El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha}}), was written by Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]]. Published in two volumes a decade apart (in 1605 and 1615), ''Don Quixote'' is one of the most influential works of literature from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] in the Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.&lt;ref name="greatest"&gt;{{cite news | title=The top 100 books of all time | url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,711520,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=8 May 2002 | accessdate=1 May 2010}} {{cite news | title=Don Quixote gets authors' votes | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1972609.stm | work=BBC News | date=7 May 2002 | accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the inspiration for a wide array of cultural adaptations.

==Influence on literature==
===Drama===
* 1612 ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' by [[Francis Beaumont]] has been described as "the first English imitation of ''Don Quixote''".&lt;ref&gt;Ardila&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1613 ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'', a lost, presumably [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] play, is believed to be based on an episode in Part One of ''Don Quixote''.&lt;ref&gt;Ardila p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1694 ''[[The Comical History of Don Quixote]]'' is a comic play by [[Thomas D'Urfey]] with music and songs by composers including [[Henry Purcell]]. The play was written in three parts, adding up to more than seven hours of playing time. It is seldom if ever performed today, and never at its full length.
* 1734 ''Don Quixote in England'' by [[Henry Fielding]] was written in 1728 as an attack on Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole]].&lt;ref&gt;Brean Hammond in Ardila, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1785–1787 ''Don Chisciotti e Sanciu Panza'' by [[Giovanni Meli]] is a Sicilian parody of ''Don Quixote''.
* 1864 ''Don Quichotte'', a play in three acts by [[Victorien Sardou]]. Recently (2009) translated into English as "Don Quixote".
* 1953 ''[[Camino Real (play)|Camino Real]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] features a cast of classic literary characters that includes Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.
* 1982 ''Don Quixote'', theatre adaptation by [[Keith Dewhurst]], first performed at [[Royal National Theatre]] with [[Paul Scofield]] in the title role.

===Novels and other literature===
* 1742 ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]] notes on the title page that it is "written in Imitation of the Manner of Cervantes, Author of Don Quixote".
* 1752 ''[[The Female Quixote]]'' (1752), a novel by [[Charlotte Lennox]]. A major influence on Jane Austen's [[Northanger Abbey]].
* 1759–1767 ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] was influenced by Cervantes' novel in several ways, including its genre-defying structure and the Don Quixote-like character of Uncle Toby.  Intentional nods include Sterne's own description of his characters' "Cervantic humour" and naming Parson Yorick's horse '[[Rocinante]]'.
* 1760-1762 ''[[The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves]]'' by [[Tobias Smollett]]. Smollett shows the influence of ''Don Quixote'' in many of his novels (e.g. the character of Lismahago in ''[[Humphry Clinker]]''), but this is his "own explicit version of the D[on] Q[uixote] story." Smollett had also produced his own translation of ''Don Quixote'' in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;''Cervantes Encyclopedia L-Z'' p.682&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1773 ''The Spiritual Quixote'' by [[Richard Graves]] is a satire on [[Methodism]].
* 1856 ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' by [[Gustave Flaubert]] was heavily influenced by ''Don Quixote''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/literary_criticism/Fox.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070520003328/http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/literary_criticism/Fox.htm |archivedate=2007-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the critic Howard Mancing, "of all the many female incarnations of Don Quixote, Emma [Bovary] is the most original, profound and influential. Flaubert's admiration for Cervantes knew no bounds. It has been suggested that it was his reading of ''Don Quixote'' in childhood which convinced Flaubert to become a novelist rather than a dramatist." In ''Madame Bovary'', the heroine, like Don Quixote, tries to escape from the tedium of provincial life through books, in Bovary's case women's romances and historical novels.&lt;ref&gt;''Cervantes Encyclopedia A-K'' p.140&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1869 ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]. Prince Myshkin, the title character of the novel, was explicitly modeled on Don Quixote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguinclassics.co.uk/nf/shared/WebDisplay/0,,213655_1_0,00.html Penguin Classics: Features]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1874 ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat (novel)|The Three-Cornered Hat]]'', by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarcón]], has been compared with ''Don Quijote''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Medina |first=Jeremy T. |title=STRUCTURAL TECHNIQUES OF ALARCÓN'S "EL SOMBRERO DE TRES PICOS" |journal=Romance Notes |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=1972 |pages=83–85 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] for its Department of Romance Studies |jstor=43802521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917-1919 (published posthumously in 1948) "The Truth About Sancho Panza" by [[Franz Kafka]] imagines Sancho as Author. 
* 1914 ''[[Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho]]'' (usually translated into English as ''Our Lord Don Quixote'') by [[Miguel de Unamuno]] often perceived one of the earliest works applying existential elements to ''[[Don Quixote]]''. The book, on Unamuno's own admission, is of mixed genre with elements of personal essay, philosophy and fiction.
* 1927 ''The Return of Don Quixote'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]] tells the tale of the librarian Michael Herne, who, after performing as the lead actor in a medieval theater play, finds contemporaneous realities unacceptable and decides to carry on with medieval costume, then gets elected to a dictatorial real kingship, but disappoints the rich who helped him get there, and then has to roam the country in the fashion of Don Quixote, since persecuted by the police after losing his short-lived power.
* 1939 "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]" by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is a short story about a fictional 20th-century writer who re-authors ''Don Quixote''. According to the story, "The text of Cervantes and that of Menard are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer."
* 1960 ''The Art of the Novel'' by [[Milan Kundera]] extensively references and extols Cervantes' ''Don Quixote'' as the first, and perhaps best, novel.  Kundera writes that his own novels are an homage to Cervantes.
* 1966 ''[[The Order of Things]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]]. Quixote's confusion in Cervantes' novel plays an important part in Foucault's book, serving as an illustration of the transition to a new configuration of thought in the late sixteenth century.
* 1982 ''[[Monsignor Quixote]]'' by [[Graham Greene]] is a [[pastiche]] of Cervantes' novel. Greene's character Monsignor Quixote regards himself as a descendant of Don Quixote.
* 1985 ''City of Glass'' in ''[[The New York Trilogy]]'' by [[Paul Auster]]. In this postmodern detective story, the protagonist, Daniel Quinn, is modeled after Don Quixote. The novella includes an explicit discussion of ''Don Quixote's'' authorship.
* 1986 ''Don Quixote: Which Was a Dream'', a novel by [[Kathy Acker]], revisits the themes of Cervantes' text to highlight contemporary issues.
* 1995 ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'' by [[Salman Rushdie]], with its central themes of the world being remade and reinterpreted, draws inspiration (as well as names and characters) from Cervantes's work.
* 1997 ''[[One Piece]]'', a Japanese manga series by Eiichiro Oda, features Donquixote Doflamingo, an antagonist presumably named after Don Quixote.
* 1998 ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'', a [[Spanglish]] comic novel by [[Giannina Braschi]], features conversations between Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and Dulcinea, who have been transported into 20th-century New York.
* 2009 ''[[The Shadow Dragons]]'', the fourth novel in [[James A. Owen]]'s series ''The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica'', features Don Quixote as one of its major characters.
* 2009 ''[[Going Bovine]]'' by Libba Bray, a YA novel about a 16-year-old high school student with "transmissible spongiform encephalopathy" (mad cow disease) and contains many allusions to “Quixote” in plot, theme and characters.
* 2015 ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' [[Supernatural (season 10)|season 10]]'s ''Book of the Damned'' features protagonist [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] searching for his grace, his angelic essence which turns out to be in a copy of ''Don Quixote'' with the riddle leading to it being the quote "what's the maddest thing a man can do? Let himself die."

==Music, opera and ballet==
* 1719 ''[[Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena]]'' - tragi-comic opera by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Conti]] written for the Viennese court. Highly popular at the time, it was an object for some borrowings from other composers.   
* 1721 ''Les folies de Cardenio'' - ''[[ballet de cour]]'' by [[Michel Richard de Lalande]] based on an episode from the novel; some roles in the ballet were danced by young Louis XV.   
* 1743 ''[[Don Quichotte chez la Duchesse]]'', a short ballet with vocals by [[Joseph Bodin de Boismortier]], was loosely adapted from the novel's chapters dealing with the frivolous Duke and Duchess, who play practical jokes on Quixote.

* 1869 [[Ludwig Minkus]] composed the music for [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'', which was staged for the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow in 1869, and was revised in more elaborate production for the [[Imperial Russian Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of St. Petersburg in 1871. The libretto was based on the same chapters in the novel which attracted Mendelssohn and Telemann. Petipa's ballet was substantially revised by [[Alexander Gorsky]] in 1900 for the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, a version which was staged for the Imperial in 1902. Gorsky's 1902 staging was revisited by several other choreographers in the twentieth century in Soviet Russia, and has since been staged by ballet companies all over the world. In 1972, [[Rudolf Nureyev]] filmed his version of the ballet with the Australian Ballet.
* 1898 (premiere) ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', a [[tone poem]] by [[Richard Strauss]] (subtitled "Fantastic Variations for Large Orchestra on a Theme of Knightly Character").

* 1940–41, ''Don Quixote'', ballet by [[Spain|Spanish]] composer [[Roberto Gerhard]]. The ballet became the source for a number of orchestral suites and Gerhard also used it in the [[incidental music]] he provided for a [[BBC]] radio adaptation of Cervantes's novel by [[Eric Linklater]], ''The Adventures of Don Quixote'' (1940). Gerhard re-wrote the ballet in 1947–49 and it was staged by [[Sadler's Wells Ballet]] at [[Covent Garden Theatre|Covent Garden]] with choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]] and décor by [[Edward Burra]].

==Paintings and illustrations==
''Don Quixote'' has inspired many illustrators, painters and sculptors, including [[Gustave Doré]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Antonio de la Gandara]]. The French artist Honoré Daumier produced 29 paintings and 49 drawings based on the book and characters of Don Quixote, starting with an exhibition at the 1850 [[Paris Salon]], which would later inspire Pablo Picasso. In 1863, Gustave Doré produced a large set of drawings based on ''Don Quixote''. On 10 August 1955, Pablo Picasso drew an illustration of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza for the journal weekly ''Les Lettres françaises'' (week of 18–24 August 1955), which quoted from the Daumier caricature of a century before. Widely reproduced, today it is the iconic image used by the Spanish government to promote Cervantes and ''Don Quixote''.

'''Anti-Portuguese sentiment''' (or '''Lusophobia''') is a hostility toward [[Portugal]], the [[Portuguese people]] or the [[Portuguese language]] and [[Culture of Portugal|culture]].

==Etymology==

Like "[[Lusitanic]]", the word "Lusophobia" ({{lang-pt|lusofobia}}) derives from "[[Lusitania]]", the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Roman province|province]] that comprised what is nowadays [[Portugal|Central and Southern Portugal]], and "[[phobia]]" that means "fear of". The term is used in Portuguese-speaking countries, and its use in English is rare. The opposite concept is lusophilia.

== By country ==
=== Brazil ===
In the 19th century, the term ''lusofobia'' was often used to describe nationalist sentiments in [[Brazil]], a former [[colony]] of the [[Portuguese Empire]], with Liberal politicians in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Pernambuco]] advocating the reduction of immigrant Portuguese involvement in the Brazilian economy, though almost all were themselves of [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese descent]].&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, Jeffrey C. "Political Mobilization, Party Ideology, and Lusophobia in Nineteenth-Century Brazil: Pernambuco, 1822-1850" Hispanic American Historical Review - 80:4, November 2000, pp. 881-912&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], the "Jacobinos", a small national radical group, were the strongest opponents of the ''[[wikt:galego|galegos]]'', the Portuguese immigrants, who were (and still are) also the biggest ethnocultural community in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobinos versus Galegos: Urban Radicals versus [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] Immigrants in Rio de Janeiro in the 1890s, June E. Hahner - Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs, Vol. 18, No. 2 (May, 1976), pp. 125-15, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/174772], [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the abdication of [[Pedro I of Brazil]] in 1831, in favor of his son [[Pedro II of Brazil]], the poor black people, including slaves, staged anti-Portuguese riots in the streets of Brazil's larger cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/evanson/brazilhistory/Bahia.htm |title=Instructional Support Center |publisher= |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121024219/http://isc.temple.edu/evanson/brazilhistory/Bahia.htm |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2007 after three-year-old [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] disappeared from [[Praia da Luz]], in the [[Algarve]] region of southern Portugal, many UK media outlets wrote highly critical articles that were described as having "a touch of arrogant xenophobia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was composed of a series of urban settlements and [[Satellite village|satellite villages]] (suburbs) linked together by a loose trading network,&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march/12/cahokia.htm Metropolitan Life on the Mississippi]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest city being [[Cahokia]], believed to be a major religious center.

The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley (for which it is named).

A number of cultural traits are recognized as being characteristic of the Mississippians. Although not all Mississippian peoples practiced all of the following activities, they were distinct from their ancestors in adoption of some or all of these traits.
#The construction of large, truncated [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] pyramid mounds, or [[platform mound]]s. Such mounds were usually square, rectangular, or occasionally circular. Structures (domestic houses, temples, [[Charnel house#New World|burial buildings]], or other) were usually constructed atop such mounds.
#[[Maize]]-based agriculture. In most places, the development of Mississippian culture coincided with adoption of comparatively large-scale, intensive maize agriculture, which supported larger populations and craft specialization.
#Women typically ate more maize, whereas met ate more animal meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ambrose|first=Stanley H.|last2=Buikstra|first2=Jane|last3=Krueger|first3=Harold W.|date=September 2003|title=Status and gender differences in diet at Mound 72, Cahokia, revealed by isotopic analysis of bone|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0278-4165(03)00036-9|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=217–226|doi=10.1016/s0278-4165(03)00036-9|issn=0278-4165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Shell tempered pottery]]. The adoption and use of riverine (or more rarely marine) shells as tempering agents in [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceramics]].
#Widespread trade networks extending as far west as the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], north to the [[Great Lakes]], south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
#The development of the [[chiefdom]] or complex chiefdom level of social complexity.
#The development of institutionalized [[social inequality]].
#A centralization of control of combined political and religious power in the hands of few or one.
#The beginnings of a [[settlement hierarchy]], in which one major center (with [[mound]]s) has clear influence or control over a number of lesser communities, which may or may not possess a smaller number of mounds.
#The adoption of the paraphernalia of the '''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]''' (SECC), also called the Southern Cult. This is the belief system of the Mississippians as we know it. SECC items are found in Mississippian-culture sites from [[Wisconsin]] (see [[Aztalan State Park]]) to the Gulf Coast, and from [[Florida]] to [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The SECC was frequently tied into ritual game-playing, as with [[chunkey]].

The Mississippians had no [[writing system]] or stone architecture. They worked naturally occurring metal deposits, such as hammering and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] copper for ritual objects like [[Mississippian copper plates]] and other decorations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311000793|title=Metallurgical analysis of copper artifacts from Cahokia|author1= Chastaina, Matthew L.|author2= Deymier-Black, Alix C.|author3=Kelly, John E.|author4=Brown, James A.|author5= Dunand, David C.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume =38|number=7|date=July 2011|pages= 1727–1736|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not smelt iron or practice bronze [[metallurgy]].

==Chronology==

[[File:Ancient Cahokians Mississippian Period Painting Mural At Cahokia Mounds Historic Site Museum Enhanced Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cahokia|Cahokians]] of the [[Illinois]] Mississippian culture in a painting at the [[Cahokia|Cahokia Mounds Historic Site Museum]]]]

The Mississippi stage is usually divided into three or more chronological periods. Each period is an arbitrary historical distinction varying regionally. At a particular site, each period may be considered to begin earlier or later, depending on the speed of adoption or development of given Mississippian traits. The "Mississippi period" should not be confused with the "Mississippian culture". The Mississippi period is the chronological stage, while Mississippian culture refers to the cultural similarities that characterize this society.

*The '''Early Mississippi period''' (c. 1000–1200 CE) had just transitioned from the [[Woodland period|Late Woodland]] period way of life (500–1000). Different groups abandoned [[Tribe|tribal]] lifeways for increasing complexity, sedentism, centralization, and agriculture. Production of surplus corn and attractions of the regional chiefdoms led to rapid population concentrations in major centers.
*The '''Middle Mississippi period''' (c. 1200–1400) is the apex of the Mississippi era. The expansion of the great metropolis and ceremonial complex at [[Cahokia]] (in present-day Illinois), the formation of other complex [[chiefdom]]s, and the spread and development of SECC art and symbolism are characteristic changes of this period. The Mississippian traits listed above came to be widespread throughout the region.
*The '''Late Mississippi period''' (c. 1400–1540) is characterized by increasing warfare, political turmoil, and population movement. The population of Cahokia dispersed early in this period (1350–1400), perhaps migrating to other rising political centers. More defensive structures are often seen at sites, and sometimes a decline in mound-building and large scale, public ceremonialism. Although some areas continued an essentially Middle Mississippian culture until the first significant contact with Europeans, the population of most areas had dispersed or were experiencing severe social stress by 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Pauketat, Timothy R.

Scholars theorize drought and the reduction of maize agriculture, together with possible deforestation and overhunting by the concentrated populations, forced them to move away from major sites. This period ended with European contact in the 16th century.

===Middle Mississippian===

The term ''Middle Mississippian'' is also used to describe the core of the classic Mississippian culture area. This area covers the central Mississippi River Valley, the lower Ohio River Valley, and most of the Mid-South area, including western and central Kentucky, western Tennessee, and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Sites in this area often contain large ceremonial platform mounds, residential complexes and are often encircled by earthen ditches and ramparts or [[palisade]]s.&lt;ref name=SEAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/seac/hnc/outline/05-mississippian/index.htm|title=Southeastern Prehistory:Mississippian and Late Prehistoric Period|accessdate=2011-06-16|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Mississippian cultures, especially the Cahokia polity located near [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], was very influential on neighboring societies. High status artifacts, including [[Mississippian stone statuary#Cahokia Style|stone statuary]] and [[Mississippian culture pottery#Cahokian pottery|elite pottery]] associated with Cahokia, have been found far outside of the Middle Mississippian area. These items, especially the pottery, were also copied by local artists.

*[[Cahokia]]: The largest and most complex Mississippian site and the largest Pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, Cahokia is considered to have been the most influential of the Mississippian culture centers. Discoveries found at the massive site include evidence of copper working ([[Mound 34]]), astronomy ([[Cahokia Woodhenge]] and the symbolic [[Lunar standstill|maximum southern moon rise]] aligned [[Rattlesnake Causeway]]), and [[Retainer sacrifice#United States and Canada|ritual retainer burials]] ([[Mound 72]]).
*[[Angel Mounds]]: A chiefdom in southern [[Indiana]] near [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]. It is thought by some archaeologists that the Late Mississippian [[Caborn-Welborn culture]] developed from the [[Angel Phase]] people around 1400 CE and lasted to around 1700 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caborn-Welborn - Constructing a New Society after the Angel Chiefdom Collapse|author=David Pollack|publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]|year=2004|isbn=0-8173-5126-4|page=24|authorlink=David Pollack (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Appalachian Mississippian===
[[File:Etowah statues HRoe 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Mississippian stone statuary|Stone effigies]] found at the [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Site]]]]
The term ''South Appalachian Province'' was originally used by [[W. H. Holmes]] in 1903 to describe a regional ceramic style in the southeast involving surface decorations applied with a carved wooden paddle. By the late 1960s archaeological investigations had shown the similarity of the culture that produced the pottery and the midwestern ''Mississippian pattern'' defined in 1937 by the [[Midwestern Taxonomic System]]. 

In 1967 [[James Bennett Griffin|James B. Griffin]] coined 'South Appalachian Mississippian' to describe the evolving understanding of the peoples of the Southeast.&lt;ref name=SEAC1974&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.southeasternarchaeology.org/PDF/bulletins/SEAC%20Bulletin%2018.pdf|conference=Thirty First Southeastern Archaeological Conference|location=Atlanta, Georgia|last1=Ferguson|first1=Leland G.|editor-last=Drexel A.|editor-first=Peterson|title=South Appalachian Mississippian: A Definition and Introduction|pages=8–9|date=October 25–26, 1974|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154656/http://www.southeasternarchaeology.org/PDF/bulletins/SEAC%20Bulletin%2018.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Appalachian Mississippian area sites are distributed across a contiguous area including Alabama, Georgia, northern Florida, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina, and Tennessee. Chronologically this area became influenced by Mississippian culture later than the Middle Mississippian area (about 1000 CE as compared to 800 CE) to its northwest. It is believed that the peoples of this area adopted Mississippian traits from their northwestern neighbors.&lt;ref name=SEAC/&gt;

Typical settlements were located on riverine floodplains and included villages with defensive palisades enclosing platform mounds and residential areas.&lt;ref name=SEAC/&gt; [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]], [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]], and [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] are prominent examples of the South Appalachian Mississippian settlements.

===Caddoan Mississippian===
{{Main|Caddoan Mississippian culture}}
[[File:Caddoan Mississippian culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Map of the Caddoan Mississippian culture]]
[[File:Spiro Aerial HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]], in eastern Oklahoma]]
The Caddoan Mississippian area, a regional variant of the Mississippian culture, covered a large territory, including what is now eastern [[Oklahoma]], western [[Arkansas]], northeastern [[East Texas|Texas]], and northwestern [[Louisiana]]. Archaeological evidence has led to a scholarly consensus that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present, and that the  [[Caddo]] and related [[Caddoan languages|Caddo language]] speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact are the direct ancestors of the modern [[Caddo Nation of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=TejasLinguistics&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/languages.html | title=Tejas-Caddo Fundamentals-Caddoan Languages and Peoples | accessdate =2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in this area was drier than areas in the eastern woodlands, hindering maize production, and the lower population on the plains to the west may have meant fewer neighboring competing chiefdoms to contend with. Major sites such as [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] and the [[Battle Mound Site]] are in the [[Arkansas River]] and [[Red River of the South|Red River]] Valleys, the largest and most fertile of the waterways in the Caddoan region, where maize agriculture would have been the most productive.&lt;ref name=Tejas&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/miss.html|title=Tejas-Caddo Fundamentals-Mississippian World|accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites generally lacked wooden [[palisade]] fortifications often found in the major Middle Mississippian towns. Living on the western edge of the Mississippian world, the Caddoans may have faced fewer military threats from their neighbors. Their societies may also have had a somewhat lower level of [[social stratification]].

The Caddoan people were speakers of one of the many [[Caddoan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/languages.html |title=Tejas-Caddo Fundamentals-Caddoan Languages and Peoples|accessdate =2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddoan languages once had a broad geographic distribution, but many are now extinct. The modern languages in the Caddoan family include Caddo and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], now spoken mainly by elderly people.

Hernando de Soto led an expedition into the area in the early 1540s, he [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|encountered several native groups]] now thought to have been Caddoan. Composed of many tribes, the Caddo were organized into three confederacies, the [[Hasinai]], [[Kadohadacho]], and [[Natchitoches people|Natchitoches]], which were all linked by their similar languages.

===Plaquemine Mississippian===
{{Main|Plaquemine culture}}
[[File:Plaquemine culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map showing the geographical extent of the Plaquemine culture and some of its major sites]]
The Plaquemine culture was an [[archaeological culture]] in the lower [[Mississippi River]] Valley in western [[Mississippi]] and eastern [[Louisiana]]. Good examples of this culture are the [[Medora Site]] (the [[type site]] for the culture and period) in [[West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana]], and the [[Anna Site|Anna]], [[Emerald Mound Site|Emerald Mound]], [[Winterville Site|Winterville]] and [[Holly Bluff Site|Holly Bluff]] sites located in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/seac/outline/05-mississippian/index.htm| title = Mississippian and Late Prehistoric Period | accessdate = 2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture at the [[Cahokia]] site near [[St. Louis]], Missouri. It is considered ancestral to the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and [[Taensa]] Peoples.&lt;ref name="The Plaquemine Culture, AD 1000"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bcn.boulder.co.us/environment/cacv/cacvbrvl.htm| title = The Plaquemine Culture, A.D 1000 |publisher=Cedar Mesa Project |accessdate = 2013-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Emerald Mound Site|Emerald Mound]]: A [[Plaquemine culture|Plaquemine Mississippian]] period archaeological site located on the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] near [[Stanton, Mississippi]]. The site dates from the period between 1200 and 1730. The platform mound is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the country, after [[Monks Mound]] at Cahokia.
*[[Grand Village of the Natchez]]: The main village of the [[Natchez people]], with three mounds. The only mound site to be used and maintained into historic times.

Although the Mississippian culture was heavily disrupted before a complete understanding of the political landscape was written down, many Mississippian political bodies were documented and others have been discovered by research.

==Related modern nations==
Mississippian peoples were almost certainly ancestral to the majority of the American Indian nations living in this region in the historic era. The historic and modern day American Indian nations believed to have descended from the overarching Mississippian Culture include: the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apalachee]], [[Caddo]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Catawba people|Catawba]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee Creek]], [[Guale]], [[Hitchiti]], [[Houma people|Houma]], [[Kaw people|Kansa]], [[Missouria]], [[Mabila|Mobilian]], [[Natchez people|Natchez]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Quapaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], [[Yamasee]], and [[Yuchi]].{{Citation needed|reason=15 Nov 2009|date=November 2009}}

==Contact with Europeans==
[[File:DeSoto Map HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A map showing the de Soto route through the Southeast]]
Scholars have studied the records of [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition of 1539–1543 to learn of his contacts with Mississippians, as he traveled through their villages of the Southeast. He visited many villages, in some cases staying for a month or longer. The [[list of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition]] chronicles those villages. Some encounters were violent, while others were relatively peaceable. In some cases, de Soto seems to have been used as a tool or ally in long-standing native feuds. In one example, de Soto negotiated a truce between the [[Pacaha]] and the [[Casqui]].

De Soto's later encounters left about half of the Spaniards and perhaps many hundreds of Native Americans dead. The chronicles of de Soto are among the first documents written about Mississippian peoples, and are an invaluable source of information on their cultural practices. The chronicles of the [[Narváez expedition]] were written before the de Soto expedition; the Narváez expedition informed the Court of de Soto about the New World.

After the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions dramatically changed native societies in the Eastern United States. Because the natives lacked [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to new [[infectious diseases]], such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]], epidemics caused so many fatalities that they undermined the social order of many chiefdoms. Some groups adopted European horses and changed to [[nomadism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bense pp.&amp;nbsp;256–257, 275–279&lt;/ref&gt; Political structures collapsed in many places.

At [[Joara]], near [[Morganton, North Carolina]], Native Americans of the Mississippian culture interacted with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonizers of the [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expedition, who built a base there in 1567 called [[Fort San Juan (Joara)|Fort San Juan]]. Expedition documentation and archaeological evidence of the fort and Native American culture both exist. The soldiers were at the fort about 18 months (1567–1568) before the natives killed them and destroyed the fort. (They killed soldiers stationed at five other forts as well; only one man of 120 survived.) Sixteenth-century Spanish artifacts have been recovered from the site, marking the first European colonization in the interior of what became the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Constance E. Richards, "[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~arch/berrysitepress/amerarchspring2008.pdf Contact and Conflict]", ''American Archaeologist'', Spring 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time more documentary accounts were being written, the Mississippian way of life had changed irrevocably. Some groups maintained an oral tradition link to their mound-building past, such as the late 19th-century Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson pp.&amp;nbsp;334&lt;/ref&gt; Other Native American groups, having migrated many hundreds of miles and lost their elders to diseases, did not know their ancestors had built the mounds dotting the landscape. This contributed to the myth of the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]] as a people distinct from Native Americans, which was rigorously debunked by [[Cyrus Thomas]] in 1894.

According to anthropologist [[Liza Dalby]], ''mizuage'' was an important [[initiation]] to womanhood and the ''geisha'' world. ''Mizuage'' gave way to the next stage of training, the senior ''maiko''. Once the ''mizuage'' patron's function (of deflowering the young maiko) was served, he was to have no further relations with the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Liza Crihfield Dalby. Geisha. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The money acquired for a ''maiko’s'' ''mizuage'' was a great sum and it was used to promote her debut as a ''geisha''.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Downer. ''Geisha: The Secret History of a Vanishing World''. (London: Headline Book Publishing, 2000) Pages 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mineko Iwasaki]], a ''geisha'' that [[Arthur Golden]] met while writing ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' described her experience of ''mizuage'' in her autobiography as being an initiation party, symbolized on the geisha-to-be by a change in hairstyle rather than the loss of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Mineko Iwasaki. ''Geisha, A Life''. (New York: Washington Square Press, 2002)Page 206-210.&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasaki describes it as a celebration of the passage of girl (maiko) to woman (geisha), and associated it with the [[Erikae]] (turning the collar) ceremony when a maiko graduates to dressing as a geisha.

In [[Autobiography of a Geisha]], Sayo Masuda describes her experiences of mizuage as sexual exploitation. Writing in 1956, she explained that she was sold multiple times by her okiya to men for mizuage, in the pretence that she had not yet undergone it, to make them a larger profit. The transaction was explicitly a sexual arrangement. However, as a writer Masuda argued against the outlawing of prostitution in Japan, explaining it could be a valuable way for women to make an independent living and would merely be driven underground.

== In Kyoto ==
After having finished the mizuage, the  Kyoto's ''maiko'' changed their hairstyle from a girl's bun to a mature entertainer's hairstyle. Over time various hair styles such as the girl's bun and the [[Sakkō|sakko]] have signified the transition of a ''maiko'' to a ''geisha''.&lt;ref&gt;相原恭子『京都　舞妓と芸妓の奥座敷（文春新書、平成13年）』184-185頁。溝縁ひろし「舞妓さんの持ち物と髪型」『祇をん市寿々（小学館、2000年）』、京都上七軒市まめ『舞妓のお作法（大和書房、2007年）』56頁、岩崎峰子『芸妓峰子の花いくさ（講談社、2001年）』170-171、192頁、杉田博明『祇園の女　文芸芸妓磯田多佳（新潮社、平成3年）』62頁、杉田博明『京の花街　祇園（淡交社、2003年）』65頁、[http://e-koito.com/2008-05-25-25 「衿替え」宮川町小糸『（宮川町　芸妓さん舞妓さんのページ』]、参照。&lt;/ref&gt; In present day, the ritual of mizuage and the changing of hair occurs without sex.&lt;ref&gt;岩崎峰子『芸妓峰子の花いくさ（講談社、2001年）』170-171頁。なお、[http://e-koito.com/2008-05-25-28 「旦那について」宮川町小糸『宮川町　芸妓さん舞妓さんのページ』] では、初めて旦那を持つことを水揚げだと定義している&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the transitioning of a ''maiko'' to a ''geisha'' is no longer associated with de-flowering.

== In fiction ==
Arthur Golden's novel ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' portrays the ''mizuage'' as a financial arrangement in which a girl's virginity is sold to a "''mizuage'' patron", generally someone who particularly enjoys sex with virgin girls, or merely enjoys the charms of some individual maiko.

A '''music cruise''' is a type of [[Cruise ship|cruise ship tourism]] whose purpose centers around a musician, band, or musical lineup with performances by the act or acts and interaction between the cruise-goers and the stars. Music cruises can be thematic in [[Music genre|genre]], such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], a musical era such as [[1980s in music|the 1980s]], [[Country music|country]], and others, or may center around a particular musician, band or related bands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Music Cruises: From Country To Heavy Metal, Here Are 15 Of The Best Musical Voyages On The High Seas|url = http://www.hngn.com/articles/138694/20151009/music-cruises-country-heavy-metal-here-15-musical-voyages-high.htm|website = Headlines &amp; Global News|date = October 9, 2015|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music cruises feature musical performances by the act or acts, and involve social activities between fans and cruise performers such as [[Meet and Greet]]s, question and answer sessions, and parties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rock out on these music-themed cruises|url = https://nypost.com/2014/05/12/rock-out-on-these-music-themed-cruises/|website = New York Post|access-date = 2016-01-26|first = Hardeep|last = Phull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muthumozhikkanchi'''(Tamil: முதுமொழிக்கஞ்சி) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic work of [[didactic]] nature belonging to the ''[[Pathinenkilkanakku]]'' anthology of [[Tamil literature]]. This belongs to the 'post [[Sangam period|Sangam]] period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. ''Muthumozhikkanchi'' contains 100 poems written by the poet Mathuraikkoodalaar Kilaar who must have lived in [[Madurai]].

The poems of ''Muthumozhikkanchi'' are divided into ten groups of ten poems each and employs simple poetic style to enable the lay person to understand the messages. All the poems start with the same phrase - ஆர்கலி உலகத்து மக்கட் கெல்லாம்  ("For all the people of this world") as a preface and the rest  of the first line qualifies the characteristic dealt by the rest of the ten lines of the section.

In the following poem, the excellence (சிறந்தன்று) of righteous behaviour and chastity are found in the second and third lines:

ஆர்கலி உலகத்து மக்கட் கெல்லாம் &lt;br /&gt;
ஓதலில் சிறந்தன்று ஒழுக்கம் உடைமை, &lt;br /&gt;
காதலில் சிறந்த ன்று கண் அஞ்சப்படுதல்.

'''Northeastern Tasmanian''' is an aboriginal [[language family]] of [[Tasmania]] in the reconstruction of Claire Bowern.&lt;ref name=Bowern&gt;Claire Bowern, September 2012, "The riddle of Tasmanian languages", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'', 279, 4590&amp;ndash;4595, doi: 10.1098/rspb.2012.1842&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis suggests (at either p &lt; 0.15 or p &lt; 0.20) that three Northeastern Tasmanian languages are recorded in the 26 unmixed Tasmanian word lists (out of 35 lists known). According to Bowern's analysis, the Lhotsky and Backhouse/Walker lists, which do not record their provenance, together with the "Eastern" Jorgenson list, attest to a previously unidentified language in the northeastern family, as does the "Norman" list of Charles Sterling. The other lists attest to a single language, though the dialect of the Tamar River region (North Midlands tribe) is divergent, and Dixon &amp; Crowley consider it to be a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=T |author2=Dixon, R. M. W.  |year=1981 |chapter=Tasmanian |editor=Dixon, R. M. W. |editor2=Blake, B. J. |title=Handbook of Australian languages |others=Vol 2 |pages=394&amp;ndash;421 |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian National University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are thus tentatively up to four attested Northeastern Tasmanian languages:

* [[Northeastern Tasmanian language|Northeastern]] (Pyemmairre)
** [[North Midland Tasmanian language|North Midlands]] (Tyerrernotepanner)
* [[Lhotsky/Blackhouse Tasmanian language|Lhotsky/Blackhouse]]
* [["Norman" Tasmanian language|"Norman"]]

These languages cannot be shown to be related to other Tasmanian languages based on existing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowern (2012), supplement&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the word lists reported to be from Oyster Bay (see [[Eastern Tasmanian languages]]) contain substantial Northeastern admixture, as the authors traveled along the coast collecting "Tasmanian" words, which Bowern believes to be responsible for several classifications linking the languages of the east coast. However, once that admixture is accounted for, the apparent links disappear.&lt;ref name=Bowern/&gt;

[[Image:Bust Attis CdM.jpg|thumb|Head of [[Attis]] wearing a Phrygian cap ([[Parian marble]], 2nd century AD).]]
The '''Phrygian cap''' or '''liberty cap''' is a soft conical [[hat|cap]] with the top pulled forward, associated in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] with several peoples in Eastern Europe and [[Anatolia]], including [[Phrygia]], [[Dacia]], and the [[Balkans]]. In early modern Europe it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty through a confusion with the ''[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]'', the felt cap of [[manumission|manumitted]] (emancipated) slaves of [[ancient Rome]]. In artistic representations it signifies freedom and the pursuit of liberty.

It is used in the coat of arms of certain Republics or of republican State institutions in the place where otherwise a Crown would be used (in the heraldry of monarchies). It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, in particular France's [[Marianne]], are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.

==In antiquity==

===In the early Hellenistic world===

By the 4th century BC (early [[Hellenistic period]]) the Phrygian cap was associated with [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[Attis]], the consort of [[Cybele]], the cult of which had by then become graecified. At around the same time, the cap appears in depictions of the legendary king [[King Midas|Midas]] and other Phrygians in Greek [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-painting]]s and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "The Legend of Midas", ''Classical Antiquity,'' '''2'''.2 (October 1983:299–313) p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap.

By extension, the Phrygian cap came to be applied to several other non-Greek-speaking peoples ("[[barbarian]]s" in the classical sense) as well. Most notable of these extended senses of "Phrygian" were the [[Troy|Trojan]]s and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Aeneas]], and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict [[Amazons]] and so-called "Scythian" archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from "[[Phrygian helmet]]s" by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as "barbarians" by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian [[Tanagra figurine]]s of an effeminate [[Eros]], and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the [[Commagene]], in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of [[Thrace|Thracians]] also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably [[Bendis]], the Thracian goddess of the moon and the hunt, and [[Orpheus]], a legendary Thracian poet and musician.

While the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called "[[Phrygian helmet]]s" (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in [[black-figure pottery|black-figure]] or [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (''cf.'' [[Peltast]]s of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear – aside from the traditional ''[[alopekis]]'' caps of fox skin – also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones.

===In the Roman world===
The Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term "Phrygian"), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On [[Trajan's Column]], which commemorated Trajan's epic wars with the [[Dacians]] (101–102 and 105–106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Trajan's Dacian prisoners. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century [[Arch of Septimius Severus]], which commemorates Roman victories over the [[Parthian Empire]]. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the [[4th century]] [[Arch of Constantine]].

The Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion [[Mithraism]]. This astrology-centric [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Roman mystery cult]] ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]) projected itself with [[Zoroaster#In classical antiquity|pseudo-Oriental]] trappings (known as ''perserie'' in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called "[[tauroctony]]" [[cult image]]s), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers [[Cautes and Cautopates]] are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its ''perserie''.

[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] art (and continuing well into the [[Middle Ages]]) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his "Magi" as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the "[[Biblical Magi|three wise men]]" (that follow [[Star of Bethlehem|a ''star'']]) with Phrygian caps.

==As a symbol of liberty{{anchor|bonnet_rouge|liberty_cap}}==

===From Phrygian to liberty cap===
In late [[Republican Rome]], a soft felt cap called the ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'' served as a symbol of freemen (i.e. non-slaves), and was symbolically given to slaves upon [[manumission]], thereby granting them not only their personal liberty, but also ''libertas''— freedom as citizens, with the right to vote (if male). Following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the ''pileus'' to signify the end of Caesar's dictatorship and a return to the (Roman) republican system.&lt;ref name="CMc"&gt;{{citation|last=Harden|first=J. David|title=Liberty caps and liberty trees|journal=Past and Present|volume=146|issue=1|year=1995|pages=66–102|doi=10.1093/past/146.1.66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

These Roman associations of the ''pileus'' with liberty and republicanism were carried forward to the 18th-century, when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, with the Phrygian cap then becoming a symbol of those values.&lt;ref name="YK"&gt;{{citation|title=The Liberty Cap as a Revolutionary Symbol in America and France|first=Yvonne|last=Korshak|journal=Smithsonian Studies in American Art|volume=1|issue=2|year=1987|pages=52–69|doi=10.1086/424051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France's ''bonnet rouge''===
{{main article|Symbolism in the French Revolution#Liberty cap}} 
[[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|French revolutionaries wearing ''bonnets rouges'' and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s.]]
; In revolutionary France
In 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility [[revolt of the papier timbré|Stamp-Paper revolt]] erupted in [[Brittany]] and north-western France, where it became known as the ''bonnets rouges'' uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. [[Robespierre]] would later object to the color, but was ignored.

The use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Mathiez, ''Les Origines des cultures révolutionnaires, 1789–1792'' (Paris 1904:34).&lt;/ref&gt; To this day the national allegory of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, "Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the French Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

By wearing the ''bonnet rouge'' and ''[[sans-culottes]]'' ("without silk breeches"), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the ''bonnet rouge'' as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as "the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration." On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, [[François Christophe Kellermann]], 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the ''bonnet rouge'' as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris city council]] declared it the official hairstyle of all its members.

The ''bonnet rouge'' on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the [[National Convention]]. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when [[Louis XVI]] was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the ''bonnet rouge''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1981:284, fig. 1. Most of the details that follow are drawn from Ms. Harris.&lt;/ref&gt; The bust of [[Voltaire]] was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' at the [[Comédie-Française]] in March 1792.

During the period of the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 1793 – July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as ''[[tricoteuse]]s'', who sat beside the [[guillotine]] during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions.&lt;ref name="CMc" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}} The spire of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] was crowned with a ''bonnet rouge'' in order to prevent it from being torn down in 1794.

; During the Restoration
In 1814, the ''[[Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur]]'' decision formally deposed the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartes&lt;!-- Napoleon had abdicated to his son Napoleon II, but who never reigned--&gt;]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|restored the Bourbon]] regime, who in turn proscribed the ''bonnet rouge'', ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and [[Bastille Day]] celebrations. The symbols reappeared briefly in March–July 1815 during "[[Hundred Days|Napoleon's Hundred Days]]", but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of [[Louis XVIII]] on 8 July 1815.

The symbols resurfaced again during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal [[July Monarchy]] of [[Louis Philippe I]], and the revolutionary symbols{{mdash}}anthem, holiday, and ''bonnet rouge''{{mdash}}became "constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public."&lt;ref name=
"Nord"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Republican Moment: Struggles for Democracy in Nineteenth-Century France|author=Philip G. Nord|year=1995|publisher=President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; In modern France 
The republican associations with the ''bonnet rouge'' were adopted as the [[: File: Le Bonnet Rouge c. 1914.jpg|name and emblem]] of a French satirical republican and anarchist periodical published between 1913 and 1922 by [[Miguel Almereyda]] that targeted the [[Action française]], a royalist, counter-revolutionary movement on the extreme right.

The anti-tax associations with the ''bonnet rouge'' were revived in October 2013, when a French tax-protest movement called the ''[[Bonnets Rouges]]'' used the red revolution-era Phrygian cap as a protest symbol. By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax.

===In the United States===
[[File:Seal of the United States Senate.svg|thumb|right|upright|A Phrygian cap on the [[Seal of the United States Senate|Seal of the U.S. Senate]].]]
In the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]. In the years just prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]] of independence from Great Britain, Americans copied or emulated some of those prints in an attempt to visually defend their inherited liberties as Englishmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeiler|first= Frank |year=2014|title= Visuelle Rechtsverteidigung im Nordamerikakonflikt. Ein Beitrag zur Rezeption der englischen Freiheits- und Verfassungssymbolik in nordamerikanischen Druckgraphiken der Jahre 1765-1783, Signa Ivris, Vol. 13 (2014), pp. 315-346|url=https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/11157|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the symbol of republicanism and anti-monarchial sentiment appeared in the United States as headgear of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]],&lt;ref name="EMF"&gt;{{citation|last=McClung Fleming|first=E.|chapter=Symbols of the United States: From Indian Queen to Uncle Sam|title=Frontiers of American Culture|year=1968|publisher=Purdue Research Foundation|pages=1–25}}, at pp. 12, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] herself. The cap reappears in association with Columbia in the early years of the republic, for example, on the obverse of the 1785 ''Immune Columbia'' pattern coin, which shows the goddess with a helmet seated on a globe holding in a right hand a furled U.S. flag topped by the liberty cap.&lt;ref name="EMF" /&gt;

Starting in 1793, U.S. coinage frequently showed Columbia/Liberty wearing the cap. The anti-federalist movement likewise instrumentalized the figure, as in a cartoon from 1796 in which Columbia is overwhelmed by a huge American eagle holding a [[Liberty Pole]] under its wings.&lt;ref name="EMF" /&gt; The cap's last appearance on circulating coinage was the [[Walking Liberty Half Dollar]], which was minted through 1947 (and reused on the current [[bullion]] [[American Silver Eagle]]).

The [[U.S. Army]] has, since 1778, utilized a "[[Department of the Army Seal and Emblem|War Office Seal]]" in which the motto "This We'll Defend" is displayed directly over a Phrygian cap on an upturned [[sword]]. It also appears on the state flags of [[flag of West Virginia|West Virginia]] (as part of its official seal), [[Flag of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Flag of New York (state)|New York]], as well as the official seal of the [[United States Senate]], the state of [[Seal of Iowa|Iowa]], the state of [[Seal of North Carolina|North Carolina]] (as well as the arms of its [[North Carolina Senate|Senate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=Senate of North Carolina|title=College of Arms Newsletter, No. 8 (March 2006)|place=London|publisher =[[College of Arms]]|id=|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2006
|accessdate =13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and on the reverse side of the [[Seal of Virginia]].

In 1854, when sculptor [[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]] was preparing models for sculpture for the [[United States Capitol]], Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]] (a slaveowner and later the President of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]) insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'', on the grounds that "''American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave''". The cap was not included in the final bronze version that is now in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, Robert L. (1964), ''Thomas Crawford: American Sculptor'', [[University of Pittsburgh Press]], [[Pittsburgh]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Latin America===
[[File:Coat of arms of Haiti.svg|thumb|The [[coat of arms of Haiti]] includes a Phrygian cap on top of a palm tree, commemorating that country's foundation in a slave revolt.]]
[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Colombia.svg|thumb| [[Coat of arms of Colombia]] includes a Phrygian cap as a symbol of liberty and freedom.]]

Many of the [[Latin American wars of independence|anti-colonial revolutions in Latin America]] were heavily inspired by the imagery and slogans of the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s. As a result, the cap has appeared on the [[coats of arms]] of many Latin American nations. The [[coat of arms of Haiti]] includes a Phrygian cap to commemorate that country's foundation by rebellious slaves.

The cap had also been displayed on certain Mexican coins (most notably the old 8-[[Mexican real|reales]] coin) through the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. Today, it is featured on the [[coats of arms]] or [[national flag]]s of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Paraguay.

The '''Sandur hoard''' of the [[Faroe Islands]] was found in [[Sandur, Faroe Islands|Sandur]] in 1863 and consists of 98 medieval silver [[coin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savn.fo/00271/00298/ Savn.fo, Myntskatturin av Sandi]&lt;/ref&gt; which were probably buried between 1070 and 1080. The [[hoard]] is the oldest and only coin hoard found on the [[archipelago]].

The coin hoard from Sandur is interesting not only due to the age of the coins, but also due to their origin, because it indicates with which countries the Faroers already traded in the 11th century. It is generally assumed the [[Viking age]] ended on the Faroe Islands in 1035. In the following time period, the Faroe Islands came increasingly under the influence of [[Norway]], which then led to the actual monetary system of the Faroe Islands.

Today the coins are located at the [[National Museum of the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Føroya Fornminnissavn}}) in [[Tórshavn]] and are among the main attractions there.

==Find location and owner==
The coins were found in 1863 purely by accident. [[Gravedigger]]s were digging a grave in the cemetery of Sandur, which had to be particularly deep in order to bury the bodies of two [[Bubonic plague|plague]] victims.

The find location was at the spot where the [[altar]] of the first church of Sandur (the second church ever on the Faroe Island) stood. Today historians conjecture that this church was the private chapel of a wealthy farmer, since in the immediate neighborhood a Viking cemetery was excavated. It could be that this treasure belonged to the wealthy farmer and not to the church.

If the coins were from a wealthy farmer, the large number of coins from Germany point towards the export of Faroese wool there and/or to [[Reseller|middlemen]], who traded using these coins.

==Index of the coins==
*The following coins came from [[England]] :
**3 from [[Ethelred II of England|Ethelred II]] (978 - 1013 and 1014–1016)
**9 from [[Canute the Great]] (1016–1035), one of which was counterfeit
**3 from [[Harold Harefoot]] (1035–1040)
**8 from [[Edward the Confessor]] (1042–1066)
**1 not further identifiable counterfeit
*One coin from [[Ireland]] which couldn't be exactly dated, but is from ca. 1050
*From [[Denmark]] :
**2 from [[Harthacanute|Canute III]] (1035–1042)
**1 from the period between 1050 and 1095
**2 counterfeits
*17 coins were of Norwegian origin :
**1 from the co-reign of [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] and [[Harald III of Norway|Harald III]] (1046–1047)
**2 from the time of Harald III (1047–1066)
**4 from the co-reign from [[Magnus II of Norway|Magnus II]] and [[Olaf III of Norway|Olaf III]] (1066–1069)
**10 not further datable coins, either from the above co-reign, or from the time of Olaf III (1069–1093)
*50 coins originated from [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]:
**1 from [[Conrad II of the Holy Roman Empire|Conrad II]] (1024–1039)
**2 from Bruno III of Brunswick (1038–1057)
**1 from Teoderik of Lorraine (959 - 1032)
**1 from Bishop Eberhard I of Augsburg (1029–1047) with the likeness of Conrad II
**1 from Bishop Bernold von Utrecht (1027–1054)
**1 coin of uncertain origin of the same type, as the above named coin from [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (today the [[Netherlands]])
**1 from [[Breisach]]
**1 from [[Celle]]
**1 from [[Deventer]] (today the Netherlands)
**1 from [[Duisburg]]
**1 from [[Goslar]]
**1 from [[Hoya, Germany|Hoya]]
**1 from [[Magdeburg]]
**1 from [[Remagen]]
**1 from [[Speyer]]
**1 from [[Tiel]] (today the Netherlands)
**1 from [[Würzburg]]
**29 others, which could not be classified (as of 1979)
*As well as one coin from [[Hungary]] from the time of [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] (997 - 1038)

In [[literature]] and [[writing]], '''stylistic elements''' are the use of any of a variety of techniques to give an [[:wikt:auxiliary|auxiliary]] meaning, idea, or feeling to the literal or written.

{{TOC right}}

== Figurative language ==
A [[figure of speech]] is any way of saying something other than the ordinary way. Figurative language is language using figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simile===
The easiest stylistic device to identify is a [[simile]], signaled by use of the words "like" or "as". A simile is a comparison used to attract the reader's attention and describe something in descriptive terms.
:'''Example: '''"From up here on the fourteenth floor, my brother Charley looks ''like'' an insect scurrying among other insects." (from "Sweet Potato Pie," Eugenia Collier)
:'''Example: '''The beast had eyes as big as baseballs and teeth as long ''as'' knives.
:'''Example: '''She put her hand to the boy's head, which was steaming ''like'' a hot train.

===Metaphor===
A [[metaphor]] is a comparison which does not use the words "like" or "as". Metaphors can span over multiple sentences.

'''Example:''' "That boy is like a machine." is a simile but "That boy is a machine!" is a metaphor.

===Synecdoche===
[[Synecdoche]] occurs when a part of something is used to refer to the whole.&lt;ref name="AJ712"&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples of synecdoche are idioms, common to the language.
:'''Example: '''Workers can be referred to as 'pairs of hands', and a vehicle as one's 'wheels'.

===Metonymy===
[[Metonymy]] is similar to synecdoche, but instead of a part representing the whole, a related object or part of a related object is used to represent the whole.&lt;ref name="AJ712"/&gt; Often it is used to represent the whole of an abstract idea.
:'''Example: '''The phrase "The king's guns were aimed at the enemy," using 'guns' to represent infantry.
:'''Example: '''The word 'crown' may be used metonymically to refer to the king or queen, and at times to the law of the land.

===Personification===
{{main article|Personification}}
Giving human or animal characteristics to inanimate objects.

:'''Example:''' The wind whistled through the trees. (Wind cannot whistle, humans whistle.)

===Apostrophe===
{{main article|Apostrophe (figure of speech)}}
Similar to 'personification' but direct. The speaker addresses someone absent or dead, or addresses an inanimate or abstract object as if it were human.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charactonym===
This is when the name of a character has a symbolic meaning. For example, in Dickens' ''Great Expectations'', Miss Havisham has a sham, or lives a life full of pretense. In Hawthorne's ''The Scarlet Letter'', Rev. Dimmesdale metaphorically fades away (dims) as the novel progresses, while Chillingworth has a cold (chilled) heart.

===Symbol===
A symbol may be an object, a person, a situation, an action, a word, or an idea that has literal meaning in the story as well as an alternative identity that represents something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|pp=284, 726}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an expressive way to depict an idea. The symbol generally conveys an emotional response far beyond what the word, idea, or image itself dictates.
:'''Example:''' A heart standing for love. (One might say "It broke my heart" rather than "I was really upset")
:'''Example:''' A sunrise portraying new hope. ("All their fears melted in the face of the newly risen sun.")

===Allegory===
An [[allegory]] is a story that has a second meaning, usually by endowing characters, objects or events with symbolic significance. The entire story functions symbolically; often a pattern relates each literal item to a corresponding abstract idea or principle. Although the surface story may have its own interest, the author's major interest is in the ulterior meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|pp=291, 734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery===
{{main article|Imagery}}
This is when the author invokes sensory details. Often, this is simply to draw a reader more deeply into a story by helping the reader visualize what is being described. However, imagery may also symbolize important ideas in a story.

For example, in [[Saki#"The Interlopers"|Saki's "The Interlopers"]], two men engaged in a generational feud become trapped beneath a fallen tree in a storm: "Ulrich von Gradwitz found himself stretched on the ground, one arm numb beneath him and the other held almost as helplessly in a tight tangle of forked branches, while both legs were pinned beneath the fallen mass." Readers can not only visualize the scene, but may infer from it that it is actually the feud that has trapped him. Note also the diction used within the imagery: words like "forked" and "fallen" imply a kind of hell that he is trapped in.

===Motif===
{{main article|Motif (narrative)}}
When a word, phrase, image, or idea is repeated throughout a work or several works of literature.

For example, in Ray Bradbury's short story, "There Will Come Soft Rains", he describes a futuristic "smart house" in a post-nuclear-war time period. All life is dead except for one dog, which dies in the course of the story. However, Bradbury mentions mice, snakes, robins, swallows, giraffes, antelopes, and many other animals in the course of the story. This animal motif establishes a contrast between the past, when life was flourishing, and the story's present, when all life is dead.

Motifs may also be used to establish mood (as the blood motif in Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]''), for foreshadowing (as when Mary Shelley, in ''Frankenstein'', mentions the moon almost every time the creature is about to appear), to support the theme (as when, in Sophocles' drama ''Oedipus Rex'', the motif of prophecy strengthens the theme of the irresistibility of the gods), or for other purposes.

===Paradox===
In literary terminology, a [[paradox]] is an apparent [[contradiction]] that is nevertheless somehow true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|pp=749–751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradox can take the form of an [[oxymoron]], overstatement or understatement. Paradox can blend into [[irony]].

== Sound techniques ==

===Rhyme===
{{main article|Rhyme}}
The repetition of identical or similar sounds, usually accented vowel sounds and succeeding consonant sounds at the end of words, and often at the ends of lines of prose or poetry.&lt;ref name="AJ820"&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the following lines from a [[poem]] by [[A.E. Housman]], the last words of both lines rhyme with each other.
:Loveliest of trees, the cherry '''now'''
:Is hung with bloom along the '''bough'''

===Alliteration===

[[Alliteration]] is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words.
:''Example:'' "...'''m'''any a '''m'''an is '''m'''aking friends with death/ Even as I speak, for '''l'''ack of '''l'''ove a'''l'''one." (Edna St. Vincent Millay's "Sonnet 30").

Alliteration is used by an author to create emphasis, to add beauty to the writing style, and occasionally to aid in shaping the mood. It is also used to create a rhythm and musical effect on the reader's mind as well.

===Assonance===
{{main article|Assonance}}
Similar to alliteration, in which vowel sounds are repeated. They are usually in the middle of a word.&lt;ref name="AJ820"/&gt;
:''Example:'' "batter that mattered", "the blue bulging plug."

===Consonance===
{{main article|Literary consonance}}
Similar to alliteration, but the consonants are at the ends of words.&lt;ref name="AJ820"/&gt;

:''Example:'' "odds and ends", "short and sweet".

===Rhythm===
It is most important in poetry, but also used in prose for emphasis and aesthetic gain.

''Example:'' The fallibly irrevocable cat met its intrinsic match in the oppositional form of a dog.

===Onomatopoeia===
{{main article|Onomatopoeia}}
This includes words that sound like their meaning, or imitations of sounds.

''Example:'' "The bees were buzzing"

== Structure ==

===Formal structure===
Formal structure refers to the '''forms''' of a text. In the first place, a text is either a [[novel]], a [[drama]], a [[poem]], or some other "form" of literature. However, this term can also refer to the length of lines, [[stanza]]s, or [[canto]]s in poems, as well as sentences, paragraphs, or chapters in prose. Furthermore, such visible structures as dialogue versus narration are also considered part of formal structure.

===Storyline and plot===
The storyline is the chronological account of events that follow each other in the narrative. Plot includes the storyline, and is more; it includes the way in which elements in the story interact to create complexity, intrigue, and surprise. Plot is often created by having separate threads of storyline interact at critical times and in unpredictable ways, creating unexpected twists and turns in the overall storyline.

===Plot structure===
Plot structure refers to the configuration of a plot in terms of its exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution/denouement. For example, [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'' is noted for having only a single page of exposition before the rising action begins, while ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] has an unusually lengthy falling action. Plot can also be structured by use of devices such as flashbacks, framing and epistolary elements.

====Flashback====
A [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] (which is one of the most easily recognized utilization of plot structure) is a scene in a writing which occurs outside of the current timeline, before the events that are actually occurring in the story. It is used to explain plot elements, give background and context to a scene, or explain characteristics of characters or events.

For instance, one chapter may be at the present time in a character's life, and then the next chapter might be the character's life years ago. The second chapter gives meaning to the first, as it explains other events the character experienced and thus puts present events in context. In [[Khaled Hosseini]]'s ''The Kite Runner'', the first short chapter occurs in the narrative's real time; most of the remainder of the book is a flashback.

====Frame story====
When there is a lengthy flashback comprising more than half of the text, a [[frame story]] is the portion outside the flashback. For example, [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''Frankenstein'' uses the adventures of a sea captain as a frame story for the famous tale of the scientist and his creation. Occasionally, an author will have an unfinished frame, such as in [[Henry James]]'s "The Turn of the Screw". The lack of a finishing frame in this story has the effect of leaving the reader disoriented, adding to the disturbed mood of the story.

===Foreshadowing===
{{main article|Foreshadowing}}
This is when the author drops clues about what is to come in a story, which builds tension and the reader's suspense throughout the book.
:'''Example:''' The boy kissed his mother and warmly embraced her, oblivious to the fact that this was the last time he would ever see her.

===Allusion===
[[Allusion]] is a reference to something from history or literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Irony ==
{{main|Irony}}

===Verbal irony===
This is the simplest form of irony, in which the speaker says the opposite of what he or she intends. There are several forms, including [[euphemism]], [[understatement]], [[sarcasm]], and some forms of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
This is when the author creates a surprise that is the perfect opposite of what one would expect, often creating either humor or an eerie feeling. For example, in Steinbeck's novel ''The Pearl'', one would think that Kino and Juana would have become happy and successful after discovering the "Pearl of the World", with all its value. However, their lives changed dramatically for the worse after discovering it.

Similarly, in Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', the title character almost kills King Claudius at one point, but resists because Claudius is praying and therefore may go to heaven. As Hamlet wants Claudius to go to hell, he waits. A few moments later, after Hamlet leaves the stage, Claudius reveals that he doesn't really mean his prayers ("words without thoughts never to heaven go"), so Hamlet should have killed him after all.

The way to remember the name is that it's for an ''ironic situation''.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic Irony is when the reader knows something important about the story that one or more characters in the story do not know. For example, in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', the drama of Act V comes from the fact that the audience knows Juliet is alive, but Romeo thinks she's dead. If the audience had thought, like Romeo, that she was dead, the scene would not have had anywhere near the same power.

Likewise, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "The Tell-Tale Heart", the energy at the end of the story comes from the fact that we know the narrator killed the old man, while the guests are oblivious. If we were as oblivious as the guests, there would be virtually no point to the story.

The way to remember the name is that dramatic irony adds to the ''drama'' of the story.

See [[Irony]] for a more detailed discussion, and definitions of other forms of irony.

== Register ==

===Diction===
[[Diction]] is the choice of specific words to communicate not only meaning, but emotion as well. Authors writing their texts consider not only a word's denotation, but also its connotation. For example, a person may be described as stubborn or tenacious, both of which have the same basic meaning, but are opposite in terms of their emotional background (the first is an insult, while the second is a compliment). Similarly, a bargain-seeker may be described as either thrifty (compliment) or stingy (insult). An author's diction is extremely important in discovering the narrator's tone, or attitude.

===Syntax===
{{main article|Syntax}}
Sentences can be long or short, written in the [[active voice]] or [[passive voice]], composed as simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. They may also include such techniques as inversion or such structures as appositive phrases, verbal phrases (gerund, participle, and infinitive), and subordinate clauses (noun, adjective, and adverb). These tools can be highly effective in achieving an author's purpose.

'''Example''': The ghetto was ruled by neither German nor Jew; it was ruled by delusion. (from ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'', by [[Elie Wiesel]])

In this sentence, [[Elie Wiesel|Wiesel]] uses two parallel independent clauses written in the passive voice. The first clause establishes suspense about who actually rules the ghetto, and then the first few words of the second clause set up the reader with the expectation of an answer, which is metaphorically revealed only in the final word of the sentence.

===Voice===
In [[grammar]], there are two [[Voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. These terms can be applied to whole sentences or to verbs.
Verbs also have tense, aspect and mode.
There are three tenses: past, present and future.
There are two main aspects: perfect and progressive. Some grammarians refer to aspects as tenses, but this is not strictly correct, as the perfect and progressive aspects convey information other than time.
There are many modes (also called moods). Some important ones are: declarative, affirmative, negative, emphatic, conditional, imperative, interrogative and subjunctive.

===Tone===
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] expresses the writer's or speaker's attitude toward the subject, the reader, or herself or himself.&lt;ref&gt;A{{harvp|Arp|Johnson|2009|p=800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamu Samaj''' ("Tamu Society") is a society of [[Gurung people|Tamus]] (also known as Gurung), an [[ethnic group]] from [[Nepal]]. The Tamu societies are created around the world as a means to preserve Tamu's unique culture outside of Nepal. They organise cultural events, such as festivals of dance, music, and food. They also engage in [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]], social and educational activities. There are a number of Tamu Samajs around the world, including: Tamu Samaj Sydney, Tamu Samaj Victoria, Tamu Samaj UK, but some inherit different names such as "Gurung Tamu Society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamusamaj.com/category/organizations/ |title=Organizations – Tamu Samaj, Tamu History, Tamu Culture, About Tamu, Gurungs |website=Tamusamaj.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501051147/http://www.tamusamaj.com/category/organizations/ |archivedate=1 May 2017 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
 
Tamu Samajs were originally formed to spread a sense of solidarity among [[Gurung people|Tamus]] living in Nepal and abroad. They are a central part of the community's social gatherings, activities and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurungs.org/ |title=Gurungs Online &amp;#124; Tamu Nasa – An Online Village of Gurung People |website=Gurungs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamusamajuk.com/about-us/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; हाम्रो बारे |publisher=Tamu Samaj Uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1958, [[Bernard Pignede]], a French student of [[anthropology]] came to Nepal to study about [[Gurung people|Gurungs]]. He spent seven months in a Gurung village [[Mohoriyakot|Mohoriya]] (Kaski, Gandaki) and traveled through many neighboring Gurung villages to do his research. He learned to speak [[tamu-kuwei]] (gurung dialect) and documented pretty much everything about the gurungs – their social structure, culture, religion, history, occupations, legends and myths. He translated pae, a ritual and religious practice that one gurung generation has passed down to another for thousands of years. Pae conveys the oral history of gurungs and is considered very sacred. Unfortunately, Pignede died in 1961 at age of 29. After his death, Professor Louis Dumont published Pegnedes work in 1966. The book was immediately recognized as a major contribution to the anthropology of the [[Himalayas]]. Later, two noted [[anthropologist]]s – [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]] and [[Alan Macfarlane]] translated it in English and published the first English version in 1993. Harrison and Macfarlane studied further of gurungs and added more to Pignede’s work. The English version of this book is called “The Gurungs”, which is probably the most acclaimed research on Gurungs so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamusamaj.com/2015/12/02/tamu-history/|title=Tamu History|website=Tamu Samaj, Tamu History, Tamu Culture, About Tamu, Gurungs|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The Gurungs are famous for their culture. Various studies today have, however, shown that this division is an [[imposition]] from outside, and the Gurungs are divided into various [[subgroup]]s; and they did not conform to the caste system. In Gurung society Chima holds the main responsibility for managing the village [[Public administration|administration]] and also settles disputes in the village. [[Rodhighar]] is among the major identity of the social system of Gurung. Some have called the Rodhighar a house to thread wool, while others have called it a place to settle for the night. The Rodhighar is a good example of cooperation, assistance, better relation and collective spirits among the Gurungs.

[[File:Seattle - Nova school 03.jpg|thumb|The former Horace Mann School, site of Nova for most of its history.]]
'''The Nova Project''', also known as '''Nova''', is a small public [[alternative school|alternative]] [[high school]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], operated by the [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle Public School District]]. Its goal is to be a "democratically governed learning community of broadly educated, creative, and independent thinkers who work collaboratively and demonstrate a high degree of individual responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;"School History - The Nova Project", http://www.novafolios.com/school-history&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==

Nova was founded by a group of students, parents and teachers in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Loveless, Douglas, Sullivan, Pamela, Dredger, Katie, Burns, Jim. ''Deconstructing the Education-Industrial Complex in the Digital Age'', p. 16-17. https://books.google.com/books?id=O5vgDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is multidisciplinary and project-oriented, with an emphasis on individualized learning contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, Chuck, ''Learning Contracts: Facilitating Academic Change,'' p. 7. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED080107&lt;/ref&gt; internships and community service.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Joe; Febey, Karen. ''Smaller, Safer, Saner, Successful Schools'', p. 53-54. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED455680&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nova functions through student-run, teacher-supported "committees" that decide school budgeting, the hiring and review process of staff, orientation of new students, and cultural affairs. 

The grading system is competency-based and is credit/no credit with 80% mastery required for credit. Each student works with a coordinator to design a personal learning plan to graduate. Nova students have the option of creating "independent contracts" with their teachers to earn credit for extracurricular goals and activities they commit to. It is common for Nova students to co-teach classes with their teachers, generating curriculum and building facilitation skills in line with Nova's student-led philosophy. Like other Seattle Public Schools students, Nova students may participate in the [[Running Start]] program and take classes at a local [[community college]]. 

In early summer of 2009, Nova was relocated from the Mann Building to the Meany Middle School site, where it was co-housed with the World School. Nova returned to the newly remodeled Mann Building in 2015.

'''''The Saint and The Sow''''' ("O Santo e a Porca", in the original title) is a very popular [[Brazil]]ian play written by [[Ariano Suassuna]] that was first published in 1957. The play, according to Suassuna, is a "[[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] imitation" from the play ''[[Aulularia]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Pot's Comedy''), from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[writer]] [[Plautus]].

==Plot==
The story focuses in '''Eurico Árabe''', who is called '''Euricão Engole-Cobra''' (something like ''Euricão Swallows-Snake'') by his employees. Eurico is a "rich" and niggard man who has a beautiful and courteous daughter called '''Margarida''' and two employees: a smart housemaid called '''Caroba''' and his "Official Servant" '''Dódó''', who is Margarida's secret boyfriend.

One day, a man called '''Pinhão''' (who is Caroba's secret boyfriend) arrives in Eurico's house with a letter from the rich and powerful '''[[Colonel]] Eudoro'''. It was written in the letter:

"''My dear and honored Eurico: I expect you have being enjoying your peace and prosperty! Above all, I desire that your charming daughter Margarida be fine and healthy like she was in the days that she spent in my house, if you remember. I sent this letter with my loyal employee Pinhão to advise you of the visit I will make to your home soon and I fear that I will steal your most precious treasure.''"

Then, Eurico becomes mad thinking that Eudoro will steal his coffer (that is in the form of a pig - in this case, a sow) and tries to "stop" Eudoro's robbery. But Caroba, in a secret meeting with Margarida, Pinhão and Dodó, tells them that the "most precious treasure" in the letter referred to Margarida and that Eudoro was going to marry her. Then they make a plan to try to reconcile Eudoro with his old love, '''Benona'''. But they will have to take care about Eurico, who is trying to protect his "sow coffer".

==The Saint==
A despite of being part of the title, the saint is not important to the play. In fact, the saint is a statue of [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Antonio]], to whom Eurico prays a lot (usually asking for more money or for protection of his "sow coffer").

==The Play==
The play is divided in three acts:
*'''First Act''': the arrival of the letter and the elaboration of Caroba's plan to reconcile Colonel Eudoro and his old love, Benona;
*'''Second Act''': Caroba's plan is in progress, but lots of unexpected events happen (usually caused by Eurico, who is trying to protect his coffer) and Caroba has to improvise her plan;
*'''Third Act''': a huge mass is made at the end but everything ends well for everyone (except for Eurico, who discovers that he lost his "fortune" in his "sow coffer").

==Reputation in Brazil==
The play is considered, by the Brazilian critics, as being Suassuna's second best play
{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, only behind his classic '''''O Auto da Compadecida'''''.

Peltz (1995) claims it has been modified to represent a female human figure, identifying it as a possible [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] made by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' of the later [[Acheulean]], in the early [[Middle Paleolithic]]. The term "Venus" follows the convention for labelling the unrelated [[Venus figurine]]s of the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. The claim is contested.

==The object==
The base object is an anthropomorphic red [[tuff|tufic]] pebble, 35&amp;nbsp;mm (1.4&amp;nbsp;in) long, which has had at least three grooves, possibly incised on it by a sharp-edged stone. One is a deep groove that encircles the narrower, more rounded end of the pebble, two shallower, curved grooves run down the sides. These grooves can be interpreted as marking the neck and arms of a figure. They closely resemble marks made in similar material by sharp-edged tools during exercises in [[experimental archaeology]].{{cite-needed|date=June 2016}}

==Interpretations==
The claim that the pebble has been incised to represent a human figure has been questioned in three ways:
*Whether the scratched marks were made by humans/hominids at all.
*If they were, whether they had any representational intent.
*If they did, whether they were intended to represent a female figure.

It is disputed whether these can be clearly distinguished from naturally-created lines. In 1997, American researcher [[Alexander Marshack]] argued using microscopic analysis that the grooves around the "neck" and down the "arms" were human made.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bahn, A very short introduction to Archaeology, Oxford University Press, 2000, pages 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Steven Mithen]] in 1999 argued that Marshack's arguments "do not demonstrate that the lines are indeed intentional and that if they were that they were intended to represent a female figure". He took the view that research was yet to be done to determine whether "[[scoria]] found in non-archaeological contexts" could "carry incisions that might be confused with stone tools"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen in Robin Ian MacDonald Dunbar, Chris Knight, Camilla Power, ''The evolution of culture: an interdisciplinary view'', Edinburgh University Press, 1999, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains uncertain whether or not the pebble has been modified by human action. If it has, there is the separate question of whether the scratches had any artistic or symbolic intent, and if so, whether they sought to make the object resemble the female form, as do the much later and rather different Venus figurines of the Upper Palaeolithic.

In 2000, d'Errico and Nowell argued that the incisions could be reliably identified as human-made, but a practical function related to tool-making could not be ruled out: "the use of different types of raw materials to produce a varied tool kit seems well documented." However, some of the abrasions "are not necessarily consistent with a functional use of the object", suggesting that symbolic intent is a serious possibility. They conclude that it is "problematic" to identify a human body, as the cognitive and cultural context is so alien, saying that probably there will never be any agreement about what was intended by the marks.&lt;ref&gt;d'Errico, F. and Nowell, A, 2000, "A new look at the Berekhat Ram figurine: implications for the origins of symbolism", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'' '''10''', 123-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it was found between two layers of ash, it has been dated by [[tephrochronology]] to at least 230,000 years before the present. If the artifact was intended to replicate a female figure, it would be the earliest example of representational art in the archaeological record. Rather than being made by modern humans, it would have been made by [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]] or perhaps by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', hunter-gatherers and [[Acheulean]] tool users. There is some other evidence of an aesthetic sensibility during the period although compelling examples do not appear in the archaeological record until the emergence of [[behaviorally modern human]]s around 50,000 years ago.

'''Weddings in Myanmar''', considered auspicious occasions in [[Burmese culture]], reflect various ethnic, religious, and regional traditions. Depending on personal preferences and economic status, Burmese weddings can be religious or secular, and extravagant or simple.  

== Traditions by ethnicity ==
[[File:Burmese_wedding_procession.jpg|thumb|A wedding procession, with the groom and bride dressed in traditional Bamar wedding costume, reminiscent of royal attire.]]

=== Bamar traditions ===
The wedding traditions of the [[Bamar people]] (Burmans), who comprise the majority of Myanmar's population, incorporate a number of rituals and practices. Wedding expenses are typically borne by the groom's family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/first-born-first-go.html|title=First born, first to go|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowries are typically unheard of, and [[arranged marriage]] is not a custom of the Burmese. 

Traditional Burmese folklore considers love to be destiny, as the Hindu god [[Brahma]] writes one's destiny in love on a child's brow when he or she is six days old, called ''na hpuza'' ({{my|နဖူးစာ}}, lit. "destiny on the forehead"). 

Buddhist monks are not present to conduct the wedding and solemnise the marriage, as they are forbidden to officiate weddings, which are considered a worldly affair (''lokiya'').&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismyanmar.com/myanmars/b-wedding.htm|title=Burmese Wedding|last=U Harry Than Htut|date=23 February 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927192058/http://www.thisismyanmar.com/myanmars/b-wedding.htm|archivedate=27 September 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=12 September 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may be invited to bless the newly wed couple and recite a protective ''[[paritta]]''. Typically, the bride and groom arrange an almsgiving feast called ''mingala hsun'' (မင်္ဂလာဆွမ်း) to monks the morning of the wedding.&lt;ref name="bw" /&gt;

Traditionally, a marriage is recognised with or without a ceremony when the man's [[longyi]] (sarong) is seen hanging from a rail of the house or if the couple eats from the same plate. A more extravagant wedding requires months of preparation, including consultation with an astrologer in choosing the most auspicious date and time in accordance with the [[Burmese calendar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The traditional Burmese months of [[Tagu]], [[Kason]], [[Nayon]], [[Thadingyut]], [[Tazaungmon]], and [[Tabodwe]] are considered auspicious for weddings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/171-wedding-bliss/8335-getting-married-in-myanmar-traditions-and-beliefs.html|title=Getting married in Myanmar: traditions and beliefs|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weddings are traditionally avoided during the [[Vassa|Buddhist lent]], which lasts three months from July to October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no390/t001.htm|title=Yangon hotels prepare for post-Lent wedding rush|author=Aye Sapay Phyu|date=29 October 2007|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=22 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518000301/http://www.mmtimes.com/no390/t001.htm|archivedate=18 May 2012|deadurl=yes|author2=Yadana Htun|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IMG banana-offering.JPG|thumb|''Ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe''.]]

The groom's family formally asks the bride's family for their blessing by offering a receptacle of a green coconut with its stalk intact encircled by bunches of green bananas called ''ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe'' (ငှက်ပျောပွဲအုန်းပွဲ).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wedding details are negotiated between the families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some Bamar families invite a spirit medium to protect the couple under the care of the household [[nat (spirit)]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also, a master of ceremonies (ဘိသိက်ဆရာ), typically a [[brahmin]], consecrates the ceremony. More elaborate wedding receptions include entertainment from musicians, and the wedding is ended with a speech by a guest of higher social standing. In urban areas, wedding receptions tend to be held at hotels. In rural areas, wedding pavilions are temporarily erected to host the festivities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/171-wedding-bliss/8332-as-villages-grow-wedding-traditions-change.html|title=As villages grow, wedding traditions change|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gift-giving is an important element of Bamar weddings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A traditional Bamar wedding ceremony is divided into seven chapters, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://myanmar.mmtimes.com/news/102056.html|title=အစဉ်အလာတွေထဲက မင်္ဂလာဆောင်အခမ်းအနား|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=my}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Invoking the Buddha (ဘုရားပင့်ခန်း)
#''[[Gadaw]]'' of the Five Infinite Venerables (အနန္တငါးပါးကန်တော့ခန်း)

Throughout the ceremony, the bride and groom sit on cushions next to each other. At the beginning of the wedding, the Brahmin blows a conch shell to commence the ceremony. Offerings of ''ohn bwe ngapyaw bwe'', and six ceremonial trays containing rice, popcorn, grated betel nut and coconut, jasmine flowers, and red and white steamed glutinous rice cakes and 7 fried whole fish, are prepared for the ceremony.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mrtv English Channel|title=Myanmar Traditional Wedding Ceremony (1)|date=2013-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Setr0zD_aIQ|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple pays obeisance to the Buddha, spirits and parents, holding a bouquet of eugenia sprigs and flowers chosen according to the birthdays of the couple.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The master of ceremony joins the palms of the couple, wraps them in white cloth, and dips the joined palms in a silver or gold bowl. The Burmese word "to marry" is ''let htat'' ({{my|လက်ထပ်}}), which literally means "to join palms together." After chanting a few [[Sanskrit]] mantras, the brahmin takes the couple's joined palms out of the bowl and blows the [[conch shell]] to end the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Traditional weddings victim of convenience|last=Win|first=Nyunt|date=30 October 2006|work=The Myanmar Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are ten commonly observed Bamar wedding rites:

# ''Paso tan tin'' (ပုဆိုးတန်းတင်) - The groom's family visits the bride's family bearing wedding gifts, including a new longyi.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/226-weddings-2016/21687-a-land-of-plenty-in-wedding-traditions-too.html|title=A land of plenty – in wedding traditions too|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bride remains in her bedroom during the exchange of gifts, while the groom remains at his home.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Afterwards, the groom's [[longyi]] or shawl is hung on a clothesline in another room to serve as the newlywed's new room, signifying the marriage.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thutazone.net/2017/11/27/%E1%80%BB%E1%80%99%E1%80%94%E1%80%B9%E1%80%99%E1%80%AC%E1%80%B7%E1%80%9B%E1%80%AF%E1%80%AD%E1%80%B8%E1%80%9B%E1%80%AC-%E1%80%9C%E1%80%80%E1%80%B9%E1%80%91%E1%80%95%E1%80%B9%E1%80%BB%E1%80%81%E1%80%84/|title=မြန်မာ့ရိုးရာ လက်ထပ်ခြင်း (၁၀) ပါး|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thutazone.net|language=my|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Sulya yitpat'' (စုလျားရစ်ပတ်) - a white shawl called ''sulya'' (စုလျား), about 6 cubits long and 2 cubits wide, which is worn by the bride, is wrapped around the couple.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mon traditions ===
The [[Mon people]] have a number of unique wedding traditions. The groom's family traditionally bears the wedding costs.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mrtv English Channel|title=Mon Traditional Wedding|date=2013-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXMAaY7Rd0A|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding itself is preceded by an engagement ceremony, in which 5 elders from the bride's family host 5 set of parents from the groom's family to negotiate the financial terms of the marriage, including a dowry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/whats-mon-got-do-it.html|title=What’s Mon got to do with it?|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties also negotiate the details of the wedding ceremony, including the food to be served and the date. The Mon exclusively wed during the Burmese months of [[Tazaungmon]] and [[Tabaung]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the wedding details are finalized, young virgins are dispatched to invite wedding attendees in nearby areas, bearing wedding cards and gifts of [[Betel Nut]] or l[[Lahpet|ahpet]] (pickled tea leaves).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

In the lead-up to the wedding, the bride's family home, which serves as the ceremonial venue, is decorated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On the eve of the wedding, three virgins send gifts of pumpkin, coconut, papaya and [[khanom chin]] (vermicelli) to the bride's home, and the bride reciprocates the gifts with cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On the wedding day, the groom's family leads a procession to the bride's family home. The groom's eldest sister bears a gift basket containing a coconut sapling, areca palm, area nuts, betel leaves, pickled tea leaves, and household items including pepper, onion, rice, oil, and salt, while the youngest daughters carry lacquerware to the venue.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both the bride and groom are splashed with water using Eugenia leaves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The wedding ceremony continues with an exchange of gifts. Following the ceremony, the newlywed couple spend 7 days in each other's family homes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Rakhine traditions ===
The [[Rakhine people]] practice a wedding ceremony called ''thamet tet pwe'' (သမက်တက်ပွဲ), literally "ceremony of the son-in-law's ascent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modins.net/tourinfo/ethnic/rakhine/rakhine.htm|title=Tour Information|website=www.modins.net|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mrtv English Channel|title=Rakhine Traditional Wedding Ceremony|date=2013-11-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBeZGC0MjkI|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groom dons a ''taungshay paso'' and [[gaung baung]], while the bride wears an outfit including a [[Htaingmathein|''htaingmathein'']] jacket embroidered with celestial beings, birds, and a lion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A wedding table is set for the ceremony, sprinkled with paddy seeds and silver coins symbolizing prosperity and fertility.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A platter of steamed sticky rice, signifying the couple's unity, is placed on the table.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Atop the sticky rice are a pair of cooked prawns, fried whole fish, boiled duck eggs and sweet potatoes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The couple then don ceremonial wedding headdresses (ဦးသျှောင်). Holy thread is then encircled and tied around the wedding table nine times.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The couple partake in offering morsels of food to their parents. Then, the bride and groom take off their headdresses. The groom places his headdress on the bride's head, solemnizing the wedding.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Chin traditions ===
The [[Chin people]] have a wide-ranging number of wedding traditions. The engagement is initiated by the groom's parents, who gift a bottle of alcohol to the bride's family in a rite called ''zuthawl pia''.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/149-your-wedding/2777-traditional-weddings-remain-popular-for-chin.html|title=Traditional weddings remain popular for Chin|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiating the wedding details, ta ''mopina'' ceremony is held to take the bride from her family home.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The families haggle and exchange cash, and the bride's family equips their daughter with a basket, blanket, mattock, axe, and bottle (or in modern times, money and jewels).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The introduction of Christianity has displaced some traditional Chin rites.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

Among the Asho Chin, shaman called ''pasung saya'' officiate and organize traditional wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/lifestyle/26282-chin-pasung-sayar-facing-extinction.html|title=Chin Pasung Sayar facing extinction|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a significant wedding rite, a pig is slaughtered at dawn and its liver is extracted for examination.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The ''pasung'' ''saya'' examines the liver to read the couple's future as a married couple.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''Word guessing''' refers to a method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] where a beginner reader doesn't know what a word is in a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], so he/she guesses what the word is and reads the rest of the sentence to confirm their guess, e.g. The fox jumped over the dog. If you didn't know the word "jumped" then you might read it as: "joo-mp-ed" then you would read the rest of the sentence and realise that it was actually "jumped".{{or|date=July 2012}}

The '''Zócalo''' ({{IPA-es|'so.ka.lo}}) is the common name of the [[town square|main square]] in central [[Mexico City]]. Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial period]], it was the main ceremonial center in the Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]].

Many other Mexican towns and cities, such as [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], [[Mérida, Yucatán|Merida]] and [[Guadalajara]], have adopted the word ''zócalo'' to refer to their main plazas, but not all.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lonely Planet Mexico City |last=Noble |first=John |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=Oakland CA |isbn=978-1-86450-087-5 |pages=108–109 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been a gathering place for Mexicans since [[Aztec]] times, having been the site of [[Mexica]] ceremonies, the swearing in of [[viceroy]]s, royal proclamations, military parades, Independence ceremonies and modern religious events such as the festivals of [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]] and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It has received foreign heads of state and is the main venue for both national celebration and national protest.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2000 |title = |encyclopedia= Enciclopedia de Mexico |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Mexico City |pages=8273–8280 |volume= 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zocalo and surrounding blocks have played a central role in the city's planning and geography for almost 700 years. The site is just one block southwest of the Templo Mayor which, according to Aztec legend and mythology, was considered the center of the universe.

==History==

===Pre-conquest===
[[File:Zocalo temple mayor metro.jpg|thumb|right|Model of {{lang|es|[[Templo Mayor]]}} and {{lang|es|Zócalo|italic=no}} prior to the conquest. [[Mexico City Metro]] {{lang|es|[[Metro Zócalo|Zócalo]]|italic=no}} station.]]
Prior to the conquest, the area that the {{lang|es|Zócalo|italic=no}} occupies was open space, in the center of the Aztec capital {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}}. It was bordered to the east by {{lang|nci|[[Moctezuma II]]|italic=no}}'s "New Houses" or Palace (which would become the National Palace) and to the west by the "Old Houses", the palace of {{lang|nci|[[Axayacatl]]|italic=no}} (1469–1481) where the Emperor {{lang|nci|[[Ahuitzotl]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|nci|Moctezuma|italic=no}}'s uncle and immediate predecessor also lived.&lt;ref name="EncMex1993"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Palacio Nacional |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-968-457-180-8 |pages= 6141–2 |volume=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A European-style plaza was not part of the conquered [[Aztecs|Aztec]] {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}; the old city had a sacred precinct or {{lang|nci|[[teocalli]]}} which was the absolute center of the city (and the universe, according to Aztec belief), but it was located to the immediate north and northeast of the modern-day {{lang|es|Zócalo|italic=no}}.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;

The current {{lang|es|Zócalo|italic=no}} occupies a space south-southwest of the intersection of roads that oriented {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The north–south road was called {{lang|nci|[[Tepeyac]]–[[Iztapalapa]]|italic=no}} (for the locations north and south it led to). The {{lang|nci|[[Tlacopan]]|italic=no}} road led west and stretched east a little before leading into the lake that surrounded the city at the time. These roads were the width of three [[jousting]] [[lance]]s according to {{lang|es|[[Hernán Cortés]]|italic=no}}. This intersection divided the city into four neighborhoods. The sacred precinct, containing the {{lang|es|[[Templo Mayor]]}}, was located to the northeast of this intersection and walled off from the open area for commoners. As to this area's relationship to the {{lang|nci|teocalli}} proper, some historians say that it was part of it, but others say no.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

===Post-conquest (1519–1821)===

The modern plaza of Mexico City was placed by Alonso Garcia Bravo shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|invasion]] when he laid out what is now the [[Centro (Mexico City)|historic center]]. After the destruction of Tenochtitlan, Cortés had the city redesigned for symbolic purposes. He kept the four major neighborhoods or "capullis" but he had a church, now the Cathedral of Mexico City, built at the place the four adjoined. He had the Temo become the Cathedral). The southern half was called the "Plaza Mayor" (Main Square) and the northern one was called the "Plaza Chica" (Small Square). Fairly early in the colonial period, the Plaza Chica would be swallowed up by the growing city.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

During early colonial times, the Plaza was bordered to the north by the new church, and to the east by Cortés's new palace, built over and with the ruins of Moctezuma's palace. On the west side of the plaza, the [[Old Portal de Mercaderes (Mexico City)|Portales de Mercaderes]] (Merchants’ Portals) were built, south of Cortés’ other palace, the Palace of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca. On the south side, was the Portal of the Flowers (Flores), named so after its owner, Maria Gutierrez Flores de Caballerias. Next to this portal was the House of the [[Ayuntamiento]], a government building for the city. Both of these were behind a small drainage canal that ran east-west.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

Flooding was always an issue for the Plaza and the city in general. The plaza was flooded in 1629 with water two meters deep, ruining many of the merchants located there and requiring many of the portals to be rebuilt.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt; The project to control flooding, known as the ''desagüe'' drafted Indian men over nearly the whole colonial period, to work on this major infrastructure project. Controlling flooding meant health benefits for Mexico City residents by preventing human waste from polluting the city during floods and controlling mosquitoes, which spread disease. It also changed the ecological system that supported birds and fish populations and allowed for Indian cultivation of crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Pearson 2003:106-107, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de México - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|right|thumb|View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico city (ca. 1695) by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]]]
After the Cathedral was constructed in the latter half of the 16th century, the look of the Plaza changed. The old church faced east and not to the Plaza itself. The new Cathedral's three portals towered south over the Plaza and giving the area a north-south orientation, which exists to this day.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

Over much of the 17th century, the Plaza became overrun with market stalls. After a mob burned the Viceregal Palace in the 1692, depicted in the famous 1696 painting by [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], authorities attempted to completely clear the Plaza to make way for the "Parian", a set of shops set in the southwest corner of the Plaza used to warehouse and sell products brought by [[galleon]]s from Europe and Asia. This was opened in 1703. The Parián is shown at the bottom of Villalpando's painting; it was later destroyed in an 1828 riot.&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Cope, "Parián", in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 313. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, did not keep the rest of the Plaza from becoming filled again with makeshift stalls such as the group known as "San José" located next to the Parian itself. This prompted historian Francisco Sedano to comment that it was ugly and unsightly. He claimed it was very difficult to walk around here at the time because of its uneven pavement, mud in the rainy season, aggressive street dogs, mounds of trash and human excrement tossed among the corn husks and other discarded wrappings.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;
[[File:ModelZocaloWParian.JPG|thumb|right|Model of Mexico City in early 19th century, with Parian and statue of Charles IV in the Zócalo]]
Again the Plaza was cleared (with exception of the Parian) by proclamation of [[Charles IV of Spain]] in December 1789. Then-viceroy [[Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Juan Vicente Güemes Pacheco]] had the Plaza repaved and the open gutters covered with stone blocks. He also had a fountain installed in each corner. During this work, the [[Aztec calendar stone|Aztec Calendar]] was unearthed,&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zedillo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/welcome/pages/culture/note_pal.html |title=The National Place: A Traveling, Unmovable Structure |accessdate=2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a statue of the goddess [[Coatlicue]]. The Calendar was put on display on the west side of the Cathedral, where it remained until about 1890 when it was moved to the old "Centro Museum". It now resides in the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|Museum of Anthropology]]. The statue eventually made its way to this museum, but not until it was practically buried in one of the back patios of the [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico|Royal and Pontifical University]] until after [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]].&lt;ref name="guia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Guia turistica de Mexico - Centro III Distrito Federal |last=Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promex |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-968-34-0319-3 |pages= 50–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former merchants of the Plaza were moved primarily to a new building called the ''Mercado de Volador'' (Market of the Flyer), located southeast of the Plaza where the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court]] building stands today.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

The Plaza was converted into public space with 64 lamps. The Cathedral was separated from the Plaza by iron grating; 124 stone benches were placed and the Plaza was marked off by low iron poles connected by an iron chain. The main feature of the redesigned plaza was an equestrian statue of Charles IV by [[Manuel Tolsá]]. It was first placed in the southeastern corner of the Plaza, first on a gilded wood base to inaugurate it in December 1803. When the monument was completely finished, the wooden base was replaced by an oval one of stone measuring 113 meters by 95.5 meters, with its own [[balustrade]] and fountains at the corners created by José del Mazo.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

This was the backdrop when Viceroy Don [[Felix Maria Calleja]], other authorities and assembled people swore allegiance to the Constitution of Cadiz, and fealty to the Spanish Crown on 22 May 1813 as the [[Mexican War of Independence]] raged. This event also resulted in renaming the square as the "Plaza of the Constitution." The last changes to the Plaza before Independence in 1821 were done by [[Manuel Tolsá]] placing the Cross of Mañozca at the southeast corner and placing another, similar cross to the northwest. Both of these were set on stone [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] pedestals.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

===Independence and the 1828 Parián Riot===
[[File:El_Parian_-_18th_century_in_New_Spain.jpg|thumb|The Parián Market, completed in 1703]]
A symbolic move upon Independence was the dismantling and removal of the equestrian monument to Charles IV from Plaza. The statue itself can still be seen in front of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Art Museum]] where its current, and much smaller, base states that it is preserved solely for its artistic value.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;  The statue's former oval base was moved to what was then the University building and the balustrade was moved to the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]]. This left the Plaza bare except for the Parian.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

On 4 and 5 December 1828, the Parián market, the most active of Mexico City's markets, was looted and damaged by a popular uprising. A number of merchants died and most were ruined.&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Cope, "Parián" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' vol.4, p. 313. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Arrom, "Popular Politics in Mexico City: The Parián Riot 1828," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 68 (1985): 245-270.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] finally had the Parián demolished in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, "Parián", p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Plaza bare again, except for some [[ash tree]]s and flower gardens that were planted and protected by stone borders. Santa Anna wanted to build a monument to Mexican Independence in the center of the Plaza but his project got only as far as the base (zócalo), which stayed there for decades and gave the Plaza its current popular name. It stayed this way until 1866 when the Paseo (path) del Zócalo was created in response to the numbers of people who were using the plaza to take walks. A garden with footpaths was created; fountains were placed at each corner; 72 iron benches were installed and the area was lighted by hydrogen gas lamps. Santa Anna's base, however, was not removed.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

===Era of the Porfiriato===
[[File:ModelDF1910Zocalo.JPG|thumb|right|Model of the Zócalo circa 1910 with gardens and footpaths]]
In 1878, [[Antonio Escandon]] donated a kiosk to the city which was set over and on top of Santa Anna's base. It was lit with four large iron [[candelabra]]s and designed to be similar to one in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris. Soon afterward, the company ''Ferrocarriles del Distrito Federal'' ("Trains of the Federal District") converted part of the Zócalo into a streetcar station with ticket kiosk and stand. The streetcars and lighting were converted to electric power in 1894, and the Zócalo's paths were paved with [[asphalt]] in 1891.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

From the latter half of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, the Zócalo again filled with market stalls, including the "Centro Mercantil" which sold fabric, clothing, and [[Art Nouveau]] stonework. The other stalls concentrated on more mundane merchandise. This caused pedestrians to take their walks on Alameda Central or on San Francisco and Madero streets, to the west of the Zócalo.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Zocalo ciudad de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the ''Zócalo'', taken between 1918 and 1920.]]
During the [[La decena trágica|''Decena Trágica'']] (the ten days from 9 to 19 February 1913), the National Palace was bombarded from the nearby military fort, incidentally damaging the ''Zócalo''. In 1914, the ash trees planted in the previous century (which meanwhile had grown considerably) were taken out; new footpaths, grassy areas, and garden space were created; and palm trees were planted in each corner of the plaza.

The ''Zócalo'' was a meeting place for protests for 1 May. In 1968, students protested against the [[Tlatelolco Massacre|authoritarian measures]] taken by then-president [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]]. It was also the starting point of the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|marathon]] run in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1968/ATH/mens-marathon.html Sports-reference.com Mexico City Summer Olympics athletics 20 October 1968 men's marathon results.] Accessed 4 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the plaza deteriorated until, by the 1970s, all that was left were light poles and a large flagpole in the middle. Then the ground was leveled again, the train tracks taken out, and the whole plaza cemented over. Automobile parking was prohibited and the plaza's shape was squared to 200 meters on each side. Later in the 1970s, the ''Zócalo'' was repaved with pink cobblestones; small trees protected by metal grates were planted, and small areas of grass were seeded around the flagpole.&lt;ref name="EncMex2000"/&gt;

As the end of the twentieth century neared, the ''Zócalo'', along with most of the city center (called the ''Colonia Centro'') was in massive disrepair. This caused ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine to remark that the ''Zócalo'' and the area surrounding it "... should be one of the most compelling architectural destinations in the Americas. Instead, much of it is a slum of gutted buildings, dark and dirty streets blocked by milling vendors, and garbage-strewn vacant lots."&lt;ref name="belated"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2002 |title=Centre of belated attention |journal=Economist |volume=364 |issue=8290 |pages=37 |id=00130613 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], then mayor of [[Mexico City]], and Dr. Rene Coulomb, general director of the Historic Center Trust, launched a $300,000,000 renovation of the ''Zócalo'' and the surrounding city center, with the aim of attracting businesses and residents back to the area. There were plans to remove the iron grating separating the Cathedral from the ''Zócalo'', but there was so much public opposition to the idea that it was eventually scrapped.&lt;ref name="face"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Ron |authorlink= |date=November–December 1999 |title=A New Face for the Zocalo |journal=Americas |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=4–6 |id=03790940 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st century ==
Recently, former mayor [[Marcelo Ebrard]] launched a campaign to perform maintenance works in the Historic Center (which, because of Congressional reduction of the annual budget of the local government, was largely supported with the money collected in the streets for that purpose by government officials). The campaign had satisfactory results.&lt;ref name="SECTURDF"&gt;{{cite news |title= Lanzará GDF campaña "Yo quiero al Centro Histórico" |url=http://www.mexicocity.gob.mx/contenidos.php?cat=41400&amp;sub=212 |work= |publisher=Secretaría de Turismo. Ciudad de México |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a replica of the [[Angel de la Independencia]] was brought to Zócalo as a way of spreading out the protesters from the original Angel site. This is because the original site of the Angel is located in a financial area, with a high traffic flow, making policing more difficult than the Zócalo.

==As political hub==
[[File:Exèrcit al Zócalo-28 d'agost.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters and Mexican army during [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 protests]].]]
[[File:Protesta-AMLO-2006-11-20.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters supporting [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] in 2006]]
The Zócalo is the center of government of both the nation and of the capital, where the powers-that-be are. This makes it a popular place for protests, and it is often dotted with protesters in makeshift camps and banners.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;  As the plaza can hold more than 100,000 people, it is also the scene of major political rallies. Thousands rallied here in protest when Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas lost against [[Carlos Salinas]] in a presidential election widely believed to have been rigged in 1988.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=August 1994 |title=Also ran |journal=Economist |volume=332 |issue=7875 |pages=36–38 |id=00130613 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, followers of [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] leader [[Subcomandante Marcos]], mostly poor [[Chiapas|Chiapan]] indigenous people, marched into the Zócalo to support a bill that would give them greater political autonomy.&lt;ref name="Masks"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=October 2001 |title=Masks of Rebellion |journal=Current Events |volume=101 |issue=8 |pages=1–5 |id=00113492 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Cárdenas’ lead,  [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] staged major protests here after the [[Mexican general election 2006 controversies|2006 Mexican presidential elections]]&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= Leftist's supporters paralyze Mexico City Center |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14119697/  |work= |publisher=MSNBC |date=1 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a rally with thousands of participants against [[Felipe Calderón|President Calderón]]'s initiative to allow private and foreign investment in Mexico's state-owned energy company, [[PEMEX]].&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Hawley |authorlink= |title=Mexicans protest plan to end oil monopoly |url= |work= |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2008, a peaceful protest against crime and violence filled the Zócalo to capacity.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= Mexicans protest nationwide against crime wave |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,414064,00.html |work= |publisher=Fox News |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaza is also home to regularly occurring political events. Just before 11 pm on each 15 September, the [[president of Mexico]] comes out onto the central balcony of the National Palace to perform the [[Grito de Dolores]] to the crowd gathered in the plaza.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  Even this is sometimes subject to the political winds of the country. For the 2006 Grito, the crowd in the Zócalo was addressed not by then-President [[Vicente Fox]], who had gone to [[Dolores Hidalgo]], [[Guanajuato]] to deliver the Grito, but by [[Alejandro Encinas]], then-mayor of Mexico City. This was done to avoid mass protests in the Zócalo following the disputed presidential election between Felipe Calderón and López Obrador.&lt;ref name="Dissent"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaramillo |first=Angel |authorlink= |date=Winter 2007 |title= Angel Jaramillo In the Mexican Labyrinth: The elections, the Left and the fight for the Mexican soul |journal=Dissent |volume= |issue= |pages=17–22 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1353/dss.2007.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the unpopular rule of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], the ceremony has been subjected to widespread criticism —mostly from left-leaning sources— for the government's notorious use of ''acarreados'' (people who are literally carried into the square by bus and paid for with food or other minor goods) in order to boost attendance numbers and simulate popular enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/09/acarreados-zocalo-cdmx-grito/|title=Llegan camiones de acarreados al Zócalo previo al Grito|website=www.animalpolitico.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative expression of Mexican pride is the celebration of the [[spring equinox]] on the Zócalo. This is done by groups looking to reassert the superiority of indigenous ethnic bloodlines ([[La Raza]]) and pre-Hispanic culture. They choose to do the ceremony here not only because it is close to where such rites used to be performed before the Spaniards came, but also because they are right next to the symbols of "Spanish" ecclesiastical and secular power (The Cathedral and National Palace, respectively), which they oppose.&lt;ref name="Aztec"&gt;{{cite paper | last= Galinier| first=Jacques | author= | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=From Savage to the Imperial Indian: Identity Quests in Contemporary Mexico | version= | pages=223–231 | publisher=History and Anthropology | year=2004 | volume=15 | url= | format= | id= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zócalo area has been, since 2014, where large rallies have been held in the aftermath of the [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping]], an event that has become symbolic for the climate of widespread criminality, impunity and governmental corruption that many feel the country faces.

==As artistic venue==
[[File:DanzantezocaloDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Dancer readying for performance next to the ''Zócalo'']]
[[File:MexicanArmyBandDF.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Mexican army]] band performs in the Zócalo]]
Since 1982, due to efforts to revitalize the city center, the Zócalo has become the scene of a number of artistic and cultural events.
