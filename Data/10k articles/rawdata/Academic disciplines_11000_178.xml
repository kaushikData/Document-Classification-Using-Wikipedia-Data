'''Alpine lakes''' are classified as [[lake]]s or [[reservoir]]s at high altitudes, usually starting around 5,000 feet (1524 metres) in elevation above sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Henry B.|last2=Marsh|first2=C.

Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lakes at lower elevations due to the colder water which decreases the speed and amount of [[algae]] and [[moss]] growth in the water.  Often these lakes are surrounded by varieties of [[pine tree]]s, [[aspen]]s, and other high altitude trees.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Ashton Nichols''' is the current Walter E. Beach ’56 Distinguished Chair in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols teaches courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of "epiphany" and his coinage of the phrase "urbanatural roosting," an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way birds do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.

== Academic background ==

Nichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of Cora Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]]&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[University College London]] in from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with John Beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Beer]]&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Robert Langbaum&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Langbaum]]&lt;/ref&gt; was entitled, “The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment.” It was later revised for publication with the same title, as his first book.

Nichols's time at Dickinson is punctuated by active membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He is a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism&lt;/ref&gt; a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included Bill McKibben&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben]]&lt;/ref&gt; (author and climate activist), Lisa P. Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa P. Jackson]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Barack Obama's first EPA administrator), James Balog&lt;ref&gt;[[James Balog]]&lt;/ref&gt; (video and still photographer of melting glaciers and icecaps), Mark Ruffalo&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Ruffalo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (actor and river activist), Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kolbert]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pulitzer Prize-winning environmental writer for ''The New Yorker'' and professor at Williams College), Brett Jenks&lt;ref&gt;[[Rare (conservation organization)|Rare]]&lt;/ref&gt; (CEO and president of conservation organization ''Rare''), and Our Children's Trust&lt;ref&gt;[[Our Children's Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; the organization that supports 21 young people--aged 11-22--who have brought suit against the federal U. S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). In addition to his current joint appointment in the Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as the English, departments, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both of these departments. He has also been an Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.

== Recognition ==

Nichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching &amp;#124; Dickinson College |publisher=Archives.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993-1994). Speaking to his ability to reach students, this award is given by members of the senior class prior to graduation. He has also won the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006135309/http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |archivedate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1992-1993); selected by fellow faculty members, it recognizes superior educators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. His most recent book, ''Beyond Romantic Ecocriticism: Toward Urbanatural Roosting''&lt;ref&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism/AshtonNichols&lt;/ref&gt; has been widely praised, from ''Choice'': "Combining literary, anecdotal, and philosophical perspectives, this invaluable book crossbreeds political, spiritual, scientific, and aesthetic elements within the outworn dichotomy of town and country. Summing Up: Essential"&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"&gt;http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/2011/07/20/new-york-times-review/&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Sierra'' Club Magazine: "Both critically and artfully, Nichols explores how our conceptions of nature have derived from Enlightenment-era ideas (humans and nature are separate) and Romantic poetry (humans and nature are connected). Relying heavily on poetic examples, Nichols also envisions an 'urbanatural' future in which we see ourselves as part of the earth.";&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"/&gt; the book was released in paperback in 2012. Nichols is now at work on a follow-up to ''Urbanatural Roosting'', entitled ''Humanature: 21st-Century Challenges to ''Homo sapiens'' in a World of Plants and Animals''.

[[The Teaching Company]] selected Nichols as one of the approximately 100 professors chosen to video and audio tape (also download) as part of their ''Great Courses''&lt;ref&gt;[[The Great Courses]]&lt;/ref&gt; Program; he has so far produced 24 lectures on "Emerson, Thoreau and American Transcendentalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Transcendentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in ''Who's Who in America'' in 2000 and ''Who's in the World'' in 2002. In recent years, he has delivered keynote speeches and lectures in countries around the world: in England, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Portugal, France, Italy, Morocco, Cameroon, India, China, and Japan.

== Research ==

His ongoing writing and research includes a website that organizes and analyzes sources of eco-criticism and natural history to explore the definition of nature.&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat |title=Romantic Natural History &amp;#124; A survey of relationships between literary works &amp; natural history in the century before Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' (1859) |publisher=Blogs.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarah Freierman, of ''The New York Times'', says of the project:

:''A Romantic Natural History, maintained by Dr. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English at Dickinson College, examines the way artists, writers and scientists viewed nature in the century before Charles Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. The timeline offers wonderful juxtapositions, like the publication of Jane Austen’s ”Sense and Sensibility” and the ”New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain,” a paper by Charles Bell, in 1811; and the 1832 posthumous publication of ”Faust, Part II,” by Goethe, followed by an 1834 entry noting the invention of the first computer, an ”analytical engine” by Charles Babbage.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelly Freierman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/technology/news-watch-views-of-nature-before-darwin-jumped-into-the-debate.html |title=NEWS WATCH; Views of Nature Before Darwin Jumped Into the Debate - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
  
The multidisciplinary application of Nichols' research has been praised not only by literary critics and environmentalists but also by urban planners and architects such as Charles Morris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture#Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt; This link between "urbanature" and architecture is evident in urban design projects such as The Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |title=Olympic Sculpture Park, Seattle Art Museum |publisher=World Buildings Directory |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA and Project Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/327179/world-class-soccer-stadium-underway-in-haiti/ |title=World-Class Soccer Stadium Underway in Haiti |publisher=ArchDaily |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a soccer stadium in Haiti.

Most recently, Nichols has established a blog on [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/ urbanatural roosting], also accessible at this superscript&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site offers practical applications and descriptions of urbanatural roosting in cities ([[Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Baltimore]], for example) as well as in natural areas (The [[Adirondacks]], [[Cape Cod]], the [[Chesapeake Bay]], and the like). These examples show how modern cities have naturalized themselves to produce sustainable forms of energy (sunlight electricity, wind energy, hydroelectric power), to grow food (greenroofs, greenwalls), and to increase the size of natural environment in urban spaces ([[Central Park]], [[Boston Common]], the [[Baltimore Inner Harbor]], etc.). Likewise, the site shows how human culture and urban ideas have helped to make natural spaces more livable: strict architectural regulations in the Adirondacks and in national and state parks, careful use of roads and trails throughout natural areas nationwide, and detailed rules for living with nonhuman species in wild and wilderness areas (hunting and trapping regulations, catch-and-release fishing streams, and strict protections for even the wildest species: rattlesnakes, wolves, and grizzly bears). In addition to other nature writing—currently for the [http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols Thoreau Farm blog "The Roost"] in Concord, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols&lt;/ref&gt;—Nichols has also published poetry and short fiction.

== Personal ==

Nichols has been married since 1975 (to the calligrapher Kimberley Anne Smith), with whom he has four daughters (born 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984), three granddaughters and three grandsons.

'''Baroque painting''' is the [[painting]] associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]]. The movement is often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]], the [[Counter Reformation]] and Catholic Revival,&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=2008-12-11 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of important Baroque art and [[Baroque architecture|architecture]] in non-absolutist and [[Protestant]] states throughout Western Europe underscores its widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, California: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting encompasses a great range of styles, as most important and major painting during the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, and into the early 18th century is identified today as [[Baroque]] painting. In its most typical manifestations, Baroque art is characterized by great drama, rich, deep colour, and intense light and dark shadows, but the [[classicism]] of French Baroque painters like [[Poussin]] and Dutch [[genre painters]] such as [[Vermeer]] are also covered by the term, at least in English.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in French calling Poussin Baroque would be generally rejected&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[Renaissance art]], which usually showed the moment before an event took place, Baroque artists chose the most dramatic point, the moment when the action was occurring: [[Michelangelo]], working in the [[High Renaissance]], shows his [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] composed and still before he battles [[Goliath]]; [[Bernini]]'s Baroque [[David (Bernini)|David]] is caught in the act of hurling the stone at the giant. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance.

Among the greatest painters of the [[Baroque]] period are [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Caravaggio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 |title=Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name |publisher=Getty.edu |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]],&lt;ref name="Gombrich, p. 420"&gt;Gombrich, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.  Poussin's other contemporary biographer was [[André Félibien]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermeer]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque painting often dramatizes scenes using [[chiaroscuro]] light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]] and [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]].
The Flemish painter [[Anthony van Dyck]] developed a graceful but imposing portrait style that was very influential, especially in England.

The prosperity of 17th century Holland led to an enormous production of art by large numbers of painters who were mostly highly specialized and painted only [[genre painting|genre scenes]], [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[Still-life]]s, [[portrait]]s or [[History painting]]s.  Technical standards were very high, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] established a new repertoire of subjects that was very influential until the arrival of [[Modernism]].

== History ==
[[File:JosefaObidos1.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity of Jesus|''Nativity'']] by [[Josefa de Óbidos]], 1669, [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], [[Lisbon]]]]
The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|addressed the representational arts]] in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees.  This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by a number of clerical authors like [[Molanus]], who demanded that [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].
This return toward a [[Populism|populist]] conception of the function of ecclesiastical art is seen by many [[Art history|art historians]] as driving the innovations of [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] and the [[The Carracci|Carracci]] brothers, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600, although unlike the Carracci, Caravaggio persistently was criticised for lack of decorum in his work.
However, although [[sacred art|religious painting]], [[history painting]], [[allegories]], and [[portraits]] were still considered the most noble subjects, [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[still life]], and genre scenes were also becoming more common in Catholic countries, and were the main genres in Protestant ones.

===The term===
The term "Baroque" was initially used with a derogatory meaning, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. Others derive it from the mnemonic term "Baroco" denoting, in logical ''Scholastica'', a supposedly laboured form of [[syllogism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | title=What is Baroque? |  journal=Three Essays on Style| publisher=The MIT Press | year=1995 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the Renaissance.  It was first rehabilitated by the [[Switzerland|Swiss-born]] [[Art History|art historian]], [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in his ''Renaissance und Barock'' (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to [[Renaissance]] art. He did not make the distinctions between [[Mannerism]] and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Writers in French and English did not begin to treat Baroque as a respectable study until Wölfflin's influence had made German scholarship pre-eminent.

==National variations==
Led by Italy, Mediterranean countries, slowly followed by most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and [[Central Europe]], generally adopted a full-blooded Baroque approach. 

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  Most Dutch art lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including the neighbouring [[Flemish Baroque painting]] which shared a part in Dutch trends, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories in a more clearly Baroque style.

In France a dignified and graceful classicism gave a distinctive flavour to Baroque painting, where the later 17th century is also regarded as a golden age for painting.  Two of the most important artists, [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], remained based in Rome, where their work, almost all in [[easel painting]]s, was much appreciated by Italian as well as French patrons.

'''''Bend Over Boyfriend''''' ('''''BOB''''') is a series of [[sex education]] videos covering the practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]] (known as [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]]). The first of the two videos, which was released in 1998, became the best-selling video to date for [[Good Vibrations (sex shop)|Good Vibrations]], a sex-toy business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/sodomy-masses|title=Sodomy for the Masses|publisher=''[[The Nation]]''|author=Nathan, Debbie|date=1999-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was also featured on ''[[The Daily Show]]''. The videos promote the idea, as ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' puts it, that "fucking your boyfriend in the ass is fun".&lt;ref name="eye"/&gt;

The videos star [[sexologist]] [[Carol Queen]], who discusses pegging and also demonstrates the practice with her lover. The videos also contain footage of other couples engaging in the practice. The porn star [[Chloe (actress)|Chloe]] appears in the second video; as she is best known as an [[anal queen]], her use of a strap-on dildo is a "role reversal".&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex educator wants you to bend over, boyfriend|publisher=''[[Eye Weekly]]''|author=Sasha|date=2002-10-03|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/archived/archived/article/25153|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522154249/http://www.eyeweekly.com/archived/archived/article/25153|archivedate=2011-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bend Over Boyfriend'' (1998) and ''Bend Over Boyfriend 2'' (1999) were created, produced, and directed by lesbian couple Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, owners and founders of SIR Video Productions. The movies feature real life couples. BOB was co-produced with Nan Kinney of Fatale Media and was nominated for Best Specialty Release at the 1999 [[AVN Awards]].

[[Dan Savage]], who popularized the term pegging, originally offered "bob" (short for "Bend over Boyfriend") as one of two alternatives for the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We Have a Winner!|author=Savage, Dan|date=2001-07-21|publisher=Savage Love|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Savage]] was the guest on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on November 29, 2010. During the interview, Savage educates Colbert on the practice of [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].

==Reception==
Some reviewers, such as ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', said the tapes are instructional to a fault, saying the presentation "made anal sex seem more distasteful rather than more attractive". Queen herself said she'd been told the first video was "like watching a driving-instruction video" and the subtitle of ''Bend Over Boyfriend 2: Less Talkin', More Rockin''' attempts to address this concern.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt;

[[Tristan Taormino]], writing for the ''[[Village Voice]]'', credits the video as an archetype for a substantial cultural shift: "The roles of active initiator and penetrator are no longer solely the domain of men, nor are the qualities of receptivity and passivity for girls only. Nowhere is this more apparent than in what I identify as the Bend Over Boyfriend Archetype."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0319,taormino,43795,24.html |publisher=''[[Village Voice]]'' |title=The Queer Heterosexual |author=Taormino, Tristan |date=2003-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203233044/http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0319%2Ctaormino%2C43795%2C24.html |archivedate=2007-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taormino also went on to add that the video makers were resistant to visualizing or showing close-ups of the male buttocks in this video.

A '''building code''' (also '''building control''' or '''building regulations''') is a set of rules that specify the standards for constructed objects such as [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure]]s. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain [[planning permission]], usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is to protect [[public health]], safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and structures.  The building code becomes [[law]] of a particular jurisdiction when formally [[enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the appropriate governmental or private authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=danQCwAAQBAJ|title=Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2015 International Building Code|last=Ching|first=Francis D.

Building codes are generally intended to be applied by [[architect]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, constructors and [[regulatory agency|regulators]] but are also used for various purposes by [[fire safety inspector|safety inspectors]], [[environmental scientist]]s, [[real estate developer]]s, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials, [[insurance]] companies, facility managers, [[leasehold estate|tenants]], and others. Codes regulate the design and construction of structures where adopted into law.

Examples of building codes began in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |title=Hammurabi's Code of Laws |date= |publisher= |accessdate=2008-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192326/http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the main codes are the [[International Building Code|International Commercial or Residential Code [ICC/IRC]]], electrical codes and plumbing, mechanical codes.

The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies considerably among nations.  In some countries building codes are developed by the government agencies or quasi-governmental [[standards organizations]] and then enforced across the country by the [[central government]]. Such codes are known as the '''national building codes''' (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide application).

In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire [[safety]] is vested in [[local authorities]], a system of [[model building code]]s is used. Model building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as ''adoption by reference''. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any portions of the [[model building code|model code]] adopted, it is usually required by the [[model building code|model code]] developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications can be documented for legal purposes.

There are instances when some [[local authorities|local jurisdictions]] choose to develop their own building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the [[United States]] had their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country have chosen to adopt [[model building code|model codes]] instead. For example, in 2008 New York City abandoned its proprietary ''1968 New York City Building Code'' in favor of a customized version of the [[International Building Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml NYC Construction Codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702014751/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/model/model.shtml |date=July 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanguardnewyork.com/building-code/|title=Building Code|last=|first=|date=|website=Vanguard New York|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of [[Chicago]] remains the only [[municipality]] in America that continues to use a building code the city developed on its own as part of the ''[[Municipal Code of Chicago]]''.

In Europe, the [[Eurocode]] is a pan-European building code that has superseded the older national building codes.  Each country now has National Annexes to localize the contents of the Eurocode.

Similarly, in [[India]], each municipality and urban development authority has its own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a [http://www.bis.org.in/sf/nbc.htm National Building Code], which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating building construction activity.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is included in the [[Code of Hammurabi]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which dates from circa 1772 BC.

The book of [[Deuteronomy]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] stipulated that [[parapet]]s must be constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation.&lt;ref&gt;'Charles II, 1666: An Act for rebuilding the City of London.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819), pp. 603–12. URL: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47390 british-history.ac.uk], date accessed: 08 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn up by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], the Act regulated the rebuilding of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and authorised the [[City of London Corporation]] to reopen and widen roads.&lt;ref&gt;'Book 1, Ch. 15: From the Fire to the death of Charles II', A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 230–55. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46732. Date accessed: 07 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laws of the Indies]] were passed in the 1680s by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] to regulate the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain's worldwide imperial possessions.

The first systematic national building standard was established with the London Building Act of 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of [[chimney]]s, [[fireplace]]s and [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npt.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=478|title=A Brief History of Building Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Buildings Office]] was formed to regulate the construction and use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]].

The City of [[Baltimore]] passed its first building code in 1859. The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] occurred in February, 1904. Subsequent changes were made that matched other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore: The Building of an American City, Sherry H. Olson, Published 1997, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (Md.), {{ISBN|0-8018-5640-X}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.

In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire (1852–70)]], great blocks of apartments were erected&lt;ref name="New International Encyclopedia"&gt;[[New International Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the height of buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.

== Scope ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Hageman, Jack M., and Brian E. P. Beeston. ''Contractor's guide to the building code''. 6th ed. Carlsbad, CA: Craftsman Book Co., 2008. 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Harry J., and Richard Peck. ''Housing and local government: a research guide for policy makers and planners''. Lexington, Mass. u.a.: Lexington Books, 1974. 53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Building codes generally include:
* Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies, fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms, foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site drainage &amp; storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy rules, and swimming pool regulations.
* Rules regarding [[parking]] and [[traffic]] impact
* [[Fire code]] rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe evacuation in the event of such an emergency[citation needed]
* Requirements for [[earthquake]] ([[seismic code]]), [[hurricane]], [[flood]], and [[tsunami]] resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure would be catastrophic{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
* Energy provisions and consumption
* [[Grandfathering]] provisions: Unless the building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
* [[Specification]]s on components
* Allowable installation methodologies
* Minimum and maximum room and exit sizes and location
* Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
* For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft

Building codes are generally separate from [[zoning]] ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to [[dwelling]]s or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, [[pedestrian]] walkways, [[parking lot]]s, and radio and [[television antenna]]s.

== Current Codes ==
===Energy codes in the United States===

The energy codes of the United States are adopted at the state and municipal levels and are based on the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC). Previously, they were based on the Model Energy Code (MEC).

As of March 2017, the following residential codes have been partially or fully adopted by states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcapcodes.org/code-status/residential/|title=Residential Code Status {{!}} The Building Codes Assistance Project|website=bcapcodes.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012 IECC or equivalent (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas)
* 2009 IECC or equivalent (Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin)
* 2006 IECC or equivalent (Utah)

The chain rule{{cn|date=July 2014}} for [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is an analogue of the chain rule for [[information entropy]], which states:

:&lt;math&gt;
H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X)
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the combined [[randomness]] of two sequences ''X'' and ''Y'' is the sum of the randomness of ''X'' plus whatever randomness is left in ''Y'' once we know ''X''.
This follows immediately from the definitions of [[conditional entropy|conditional]] and [[joint entropy]], and the fact from [[probability theory]] that the [[joint probability]] is the product of the [[marginal probability|marginal]] and [[conditional probability]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y|X)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Rightarrow \log P(X,Y) = \log P(X) + \log P(Y|X)
&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent statement for Kolmogorov complexity does not hold exactly; it is true only up to a [[logarithm]]ic term:

:&lt;math&gt;
K(x,y) = K(x) + K(y|x) + O(\log(K(x,y)))
&lt;/math&gt;

(An exact version, ''KP''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''KP''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''KP''(''y''|''x''*)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;O(1),
holds for the prefix complexity ''KP'', where  ''x*'' is a shortest program for ''x''.)

It states that the shortest program printing ''X'' and ''Y'' is obtained by concatenating a shortest program printing ''X'' with a program printing ''Y'' given ''X'', plus [[Big-O notation|at most]] a logarithmic factor. The results implies that  [[Mutual information#Absolute mutual information|algorithmic mutual information]], an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity is symmetric: ''I(x:y) = I(y:x) + O(log K(x,y))'' for all ''x,y''.

==Proof==

The ≤ direction is obvious: we can write a program to produce ''x'' and ''y'' by concatenating a program to produce ''x'', a program to produce ''y'' given
access to ''x'', and (whence the log term) the length of one of the programs, so
that we know where to separate the two programs for ''x'' and ''y''|''x'' (log(''K''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')) upper-bounds this length).

For the ≥ direction, it suffices to show that for all k,l such that k+l = K(x,y) we have that either

      ''K(x|k,l) ≤ k + O(1)''   or   ''K(y|x,k,l) ≤ l + O(1)''.

Consider the list ''(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., (a&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)'' of all pairs ''(a,b)'' produced by programs of length exactly ''K(x,y)'' [hence K(a,b) ≤ K(x,y)]. Note that this list
* contains the pair ''(x,y)'',
* can be [[recursively enumerable|enumerated]] given ''k'' and ''l'' (by running all programs of length ''K(x,y)'' in parallel),
* has at most ''2&lt;sup&gt;K(x,y)&lt;/sup&gt;'' elements (because there are at most 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; programs of length n).

First, suppose that ''x'' appears less than ''2&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' times as first element. We can specify ''y'' given ''x,k,l'' by enumerating ''(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ...'' and then selecting ''(x,y)'' in the sub-list of pairs ''(x,b)''. By assumption, the index of ''(x,y)'' in this sub-list is less than ''2&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' and hence, there is a program for ''y'' given ''x,k,l'' of length ''l + O(1)''.
Now, suppose that ''x'' appears at least ''2&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' times as first element. This can happen for at most ''2&lt;sup&gt;K(x,y)-l&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' different strings. These strings can be enumerated given ''k,l'' and hence ''x'' can be specified by its index in this enumeration. The corresponding program for ''x'' has size ''k + O(1)''. Theorem proved.

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

[[Personalized medicine]] involves [[Medicine|medical treatments]] based on the characteristics of individual patients, including their [[medical history]], [[family history]], and [[genetics]]. Although personal genetic information is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, there is a lack of sufficient education in [[medical genetics]] among physicians and the general public.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = N.

==Training==
As of 2009, the majority of primary care physicians did not have adequate training in genetics or [[genomics]].&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt; Although medical school curricula typically include medical genetics, fewer than half offer a standalone course, and the emphasis on practical applications is weak.&lt;ref name="Lamb2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salari2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurston2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thurston | first1 = V.

==Personal genotyping and education==
In 2010, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered entering students a genetic test for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] affecting alcohol, lactose, and folate metabolism.&lt;ref name="Nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DNA education |author= |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7300/full/465845b.html |newspaper=Nature |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013 |volume=465 |issue=7300 |doi=10.1038/465845b |pages=845–846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=College bound, DNA swab in hand |author=Tamar Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/education/19dna.html|newspaper=Nature |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was “to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works, the results of the students' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate.”&lt;ref name="Jabr2010"/&gt; However, criticism of the program led to an informational hearing by the California State Committee on Higher Education, and a bill was introduced by [[Chris Norby]] to prevent California state universities from genetically testing their students.&lt;ref name="Gross2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=UC Berkeley DNA testing goes before state committee |author=Rachel Gross |url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/08/11/dna-testing-at-u-c-berkeley-goes-before-state-committee/ |newspaper=Berkeleyside |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genome2010b"&gt;{{cite news |title=California Legislation Seeks to Bar UC Berkeley's Genetic Testing Plans |author= |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/california-legislation-seeks-bar-uc-berkeleys-genetic-testing-plans |newspaper=Genome Web Daily News |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Department of Public Health concluded that the program constituted clinical testing, and the university released only aggregate information instead of personal results.&lt;ref name="NNB2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=State halts UC Berkeley’s gene testing plans |author=Alla Katsnelson |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/08/state_halts_uc_berkeleys_gene_1.html |newspaper=Nature News Blog |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Right Type: Personal Genetic Testing in the Medical School Curriculum |author=Gina Shaw |url=https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/feb2012/273822/genetic-testing.html |newspaper=AAMC Reporter |date=February 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the preceding section, in some courses on personalized medicine, students have been able to study their personal genetic information. For the Stanford course, which was designed for graduate and medical students, a review was conducted in 2009-2010 by a “joint genotyping task force” including research and clinical faculty, biomedical ethicists, genetic counselors, and legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2010"/&gt; The recommendations adopted included: making genetic testing optional (with instructors blinded to the choice of the students), strict data confidentiality (only aggregate data was made available during discussions), incorporation of lectures discussing issues related to personal genotyping, and availability of genetic counseling to students if necessary.&lt;ref name="Salari2011"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''feature'''  is the assignment of [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] or [[unary operation|unary]] conditions which act as constraints.{{what|date=January 2015}}

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Fountas &amp; Pinnell reading levels''' (commonly referred to as "Fountas &amp; Pinnell") are a system of reading levels developed by Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell to support their [[guided reading]] method.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Fountas, I. C. &amp; Pinnell, G. S. (1996). Guided reading: Good first teaching for all children. Portsmith: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading text is classified according to various parameters, such as word count, number of different words, number of [[high-frequency word]]s, sentence length, sentence complexity, word repetitions, illustration support, etc. While classification is guided by these parameters, syllable type, an important consideration in beginning reading, is not considered as part of the leveling system. Small books containing a combination of text and illustrations are then provided to educators for each level.&lt;ref name="books"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/fountasandpinnell/ Level books at heinemann.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

While young children display a wide distribution of reading skills, each level is tentatively associated with a school grade. Some schools adopt target reading levels for their pupils. This is the grade-level equivalence chart recommended by Fountas &amp; Pinnell.&lt;ref name="chart"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/shared/supportingMaterials/benchmark/GradeLevelEquivalenceChart.pdf  Level equivalence chart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fountasandpinnell.com/textlevelgradient/ F&amp;P Text Level Gradient™]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;

|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Although the term "coordinate system" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term "coordinate system" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

[[File:Thomas Rowlandson (35).jpg|thumb|Artist [[Thomas Rowlandson|Thomas Rowlandson's]], [[hetaera]]s in the [[harem]]]]
A '''gang bang''' is a situation in which several people engage in physical [[sexual activity]] with one specific individual sequentially or at the same time.&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]|pages=327, 995|isbn=0415212588|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; That specific individual is the central focus of the sexual activity;&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt; for example, it could be one woman surrounded by several men or a man with multiple women. Rather than serial couplings by two people, the gang bang is defined by the number and simultaneity of the various sex acts, such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex or [[Double penetration#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] or triple penetration.

==Practice==
The largest gang bangs are sponsored by [[pornographic]] film companies, and [[Gang bang pornography|recorded]], but a gang bang is not unusual in the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] community. It is more often considered to have multiple men and one woman, while a so-called "reverse gang-bang" (one man and many women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Swingland: Between the Sheets of the Secretive, Sometimes Messy, but Always Adventurous Swinging Lifestyle|page=296|isbn=1476732531|year=2013|author=Daniel Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in pornography, is rare in real life.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Male-on-male gangbangs also happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=86|title=Gay-2-Zee: A Dictionary of Sex, Subtext, and the Sublime|author=Donald F. Reuter|isbn=0312354274|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang bangs are not defined by the precise number of participants, but usually involve more than three people and may involve a dozen or more. When the gang bang is organized specifically to culminate with the (near) simultaneous or rapid serial ejaculations of all male participants on the central man or woman, then it may be referred to by the Japanese term ''[[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]].&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt;

By contrast, three people engaged in sex is normally referred to as a ''[[threesome]]'', and four people are normally referred to as a ''[[Foursome (group sex)|foursome]].'' Gang bangs also differ from [[group sex]], such as threesomes and foursomes, in that most (if not all) sexual acts during a gang bang are centered on or performed with just the central person. Although the participants of a gang bang may know each other, the spontaneity and anonymity of participants is often part of the attraction. Additionally, the other participants normally do not engage in sex acts with each other, but may stand nearby and masturbate while waiting for an opportunity to engage in sexual activity.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Pornography==
Though there have been numerous gang bang [[pornographic film]]s since the 1980s, they usually involved no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. However, starting with ''[[World's Biggest Gang Bang|The World's Biggest Gangbang]]'' (1995) starring [[Annabel Chong]], the [[pornographic]] industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gangbang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/08/31/houston "The gang's all here (Hope flickers at the World's Biggest Gangbang)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011064309/http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/08/31/houston/ |date=2009-10-11 }}, Kevin Bisch, ''[[Salon Magazine]]'', August 31, 1999, Retrieved June 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These kinds of films were financially successful, winning [[AVN Awards]] for the best selling pornographic films of their year; however, the events were effectively unofficiated and the record-breaking claims often misleading.&lt;ref name=VillageVoice&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0003,taormino,11859,24.html "The ABCs of Porn"], [[Tristan Taormino]], ''[[The Village Voice]]'', January 19–25, 2000, Retrieved June 22, 2007{{Dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasmin St. Claire]] described her "record", purportedly set with 300 men in ''World's Biggest Gang Bang 2'', as "among the biggest cons ever pulled off in the porn business", with merely about 30 men "strategically placed and filmed," only ten of whom were actually able to perform sexually on camera.&lt;ref&gt;''"What The Hell Was I Thinking?!!" - Confessions of the World's Most Controversial Sex Symbol'', Jasmin St. Claire &amp; Jake Brown, BearManor Media, 2010, P. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">[[File:beetle.svg|thumb|340px|[[Vector graphics]] consists of geometrical primitives]]
The term '''geometric primitive''', or '''prim''', in [[computer graphics]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD systems]] is used in various senses, with the common meaning of the simplest (i.e. 'atomic' or irreducible) geometric objects that the system can handle (draw, store). Sometimes the [[subroutine]]s that draw the corresponding objects are called "geometric primitives" as well. The most "primitive" primitives are point and straight line segment, which were all that early [[vector graphics]] systems had.

In [[constructive solid geometry]], primitives are simple [[geometry|geometric]] shapes such as a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], [[cone (geometry)|cone]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], [[torus]].

Modern [[2D computer graphics]] systems may operate with primitives which are lines (segments of straight lines, circles and more complicated curves), as well as shapes (boxes, arbitrary polygons, circles).

A common set of two-dimensional primitives includes lines, points, and [[polygon]]s, although some people prefer to consider triangles primitives, because every polygon can be constructed from triangles. All other graphic elements are built up from these primitives. In three dimensions, triangles or polygons positioned in three-dimensional space can be used as primitives to model more complex 3D forms. In some cases, curves (such as [[Bézier curve]]s, [[circle]]s, etc.) may be considered primitives; in other cases, curves are complex forms created from many straight, primitive shapes.

== In 3D modelling ==

In CAD software or [[3D modelling]], the interface may present the user with the ability to create primitives which may be further modified by edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3d studio primitives|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-66152BDE-BA64-423F-8472-C1F0EB409E16-htm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example in the practice of [[box modelling]] the user will start with a cuboid, then use extrusion and other operations to create the model. In this use the primitive is just a convenient starting point, rather than the fundamental unit of modelling.

== In graphics hardware ==

Various [[graphics accelerator]]s exist with [[hardware acceleration]] for rendering specific primitives such as lines or triangles, frequently with [[texture mapping]] and [[shader]]s. Modern 3D accelerators typically accept sequences of triangles as [[triangle strip]]s.

'''Hat puzzles''' are [[logic problem]]s that date back to as early as 1961. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Alan D. | year = 2008 | title = An introduction to Infinite Hat Problems | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | url = http://www.math.union.edu/~hardinc/pub/introinf.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120405023010/http://www.math.union.edu/~hardinc/pub/introinf.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such hat puzzles, frequently contextualized as '''prisoners and hats puzzles''', are [[induction puzzles]] (a kind of [[logic puzzle]]) that involve reasoning about the actions of other people, drawing in aspects of [[Game theory]] sometimes called the [[hierarchy of beliefs]]. There are many variations, but the central theme remains the same.

A number of players are each wearing a hat, which may be of various specified colours.  Players can see the colours of at least some other players' hats, but not that of their own.  With highly restricted communication or none, some of the players must guess the colour of their hat.  The problem is to find a strategy for the players to determine the colours of their hats based on the hats they see and what the other players do.  In some versions, they compete to be the first to guess correctly; in others, they can work out a strategy beforehand to cooperate and maximize the probability of correct guesses.&lt;ref name=B&amp;T&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Ezra | last2 = Tanton | first2 = James | date = April 2009 | title = A Dozen Hat Problems |journal = Math Horizons |pages= 22–25 | url = http://www.math.vt.edu/people/brown/doc/dozen_hats.pdf | accessdate = 2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One variation received some new publicity as a result of Todd Ebert's 1998 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[thesis]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Peter|title=Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection|year=2004|publisher=A K Peters|pages=125–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6qkdCHM7_EC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=hat%20puzzle%20todd&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=hat%20puzzle%20todd&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a strategy question about a [[cooperative game]], which has connections to [[algebraic coding theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/cecs/views/personnel/fulltime/ebert.shtml Biography of Todd Ebert at California State University, Long Beach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==A competitive version==
Three players are told that each of them will receive either a red hat or a blue hat.  They are to raise their hands if they see a red hat on another player as they stand in a circle facing each other.  The first to guess the colour of his or her hat correctly wins.

All three players raise their hands. After the players have seen each other for a few minutes without guessing, one player announces "Red", and wins.  How did the winner do it, and what is the color of everyone's hats?

First, if two people had blue hats, not everyone's hand would have been raised. Next, if player 1 had seen a blue hat on player 2 &amp; a red hat on player 3, then player 1 would have known immediately that his own hat must be red. Thus any player who sees a blue hat can guess at once. Finally, the winner realizes that since no one guesses at once, there must be no blue hats, so every hat must be red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | year = 1978 | title = Aha! Insight | publisher = Scientific American | page = 102 | isbn = 0-89454-001-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EV2y4z95_KQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A cooperative version==
In the case where every player has to make a guess, but they are free to choose when to guess, there is a cooperative strategy that allows every player to guess correctly unless all the hats are the same colour.  Each player should act as follows:

# Count the numbers ''b'' of black hats and ''w'' of white hats that you see.
# Wait ''b'' seconds or ''w'' seconds, whichever is sooner.
# If nobody has yet spoken, guess that your hat is black if you can see fewer black hats than white hats, or white if you can see fewer white hats than black hats.
# If you have not yet spoken, guess that your hat is of the opposite colour to that of one of the first people to speak.

Suppose that in total there are ''B'' black hats and ''W'' white hats.  There are three cases.

If ''B'' = ''W'' then those players wearing black hats see ''B−1'' black hats and ''B'' white hats, so wait ''B''−1 seconds then correctly guess that they are wearing a black hat.  Similarly, those players wearing a white hat will wait ''W''−1 seconds before guessing correctly that they are wearing a white hat.  So all players make a correct guess at the same time.

If ''B'' &lt; ''W'' then those wearing a black hat will see ''B''−1 black hats and ''W'' white hats, whilst those wearing a white hat will see ''B'' black hats and ''W''−1 white hats.  Since ''B''−1 &lt; ''B'' ≤ ''W''−1, those players wearing a black hat will be the first to speak, guessing correctly that their hat is black.  The other players then guess correctly that their hat is white.

The case where ''W'' &lt; ''B'' is similar.

==Prisoners and hats puzzle==
According to the story, four [[prison]]ers are arrested for a [[crime]], but the jail is full and the jailer has nowhere to put them. He eventually comes up with the solution of giving them a puzzle so if they succeed they can go free but if they fail they are executed.

[https://xaben.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/4men.gif?e7d560]

The jailer seats three of the men into a line. B faces the wall, C faces B, and D faces C and B. The fourth man, A, is put behind a screen (or in a separate room). The jailer gives all four men party hats. He explains that there are two black hats and two white hats, that each prisoner is wearing one of the hats, and that each of the prisoners see only the hats in front of him but neither on himself nor behind him. The fourth man behind the screen can't see or be seen by any other prisoner. No communication among the prisoners is allowed.

If any prisoner can figure out what color hat he has on his own head with 100% certainty (without guessing) and tell the jailer, ''all four prisoners go free''. If any prisoner suggests an incorrect answer, all four prisoners are executed. The puzzle is to find how the prisoners can escape.

=== The solution ===

The prisoners know that there are only two hats of each color. So if D observes that B and C have hats of the same color, D would deduce that his own hat is the opposite color. However, if B and C have hats of different colors, then D can say nothing. The key is that prisoner C, after allowing an appropriate interval, and knowing what D would do, can deduce that if D says nothing the hats on B and C must be different; able to see B's hat, he can deduce his own hat color.

In common with many puzzles of this type, the solution relies upon the assumption that all participants are totally rational and intelligent enough to make the appropriate deductions.

After solving this puzzle, some insight into the nature of [[communication]] can be gained by pondering whether the meaningful silence of prisoner D violates the "No communication" rule (given that communication is usually defined as the "transfer of information").

===Four-Hat Variant===
In a variant of this puzzle, the prisoners know that there are 3 hats of one color and only 1 hat of another (e.g. 3 black and 1 white), and the 3 prisoners can see each other i.e. D sees B &amp; C, B sees D &amp; C, and C sees D &amp; B. (A again cannot be seen and is only there to wear the last hat.)

====The solution====
There are two cases: in the trivial case, one of the three prisoners wears the single off-color hat. Each of the other two prisoners can see that one prisoner is wearing the off-color hat.
In the non-trivial case, the three prisoners wear hats of the same color, while A wears the off-color hat.
After a while, all three prisoners should be able to deduce that, because neither of the others was able to state the color of his own hat, A must wear the off-color hat.

===Five-Hat Variant===
In another variant, only three prisoners and five hats (supposedly two black and three white) are involved. 
The three prisoners are ordered to stand in a straight line facing the front, with A in front and C at the back. They are told that there will be two black hats and three white hats. One hat is then put on each prisoner's head; each prisoner can only see the hats of the people in front of him and not on his own. The first prisoner that is able to announce the color of his hat correctly will be released. No communication between the prisoners is allowed.

====The solution====
Assume that A wears a black hat: 
*If B wears a black hat as well, C can immediately tell that he is wearing a white hat after looking at the two black hats in front of him.
*If B wears a white hat, C will be unable to tell the color of his hat (because there is a black and a white). So B can quickly deduce from A's black hat and C's lack of response that he (B) is wearing a white hat.
So if A wears a black hat there will be a fairly quick response from B or C.

Assume that A wears a white hat: 
*C does not see two black hats, so he is unable to tell his hat color.
*B sees only a white hat, so he can't tell anything about his hat.
In this case A, B and C would remain silent for some time, until A finally deduces that he must have a white hat because C and B have remained silent for some time.

As mentioned, there are three white hats and two black hats in total, and the three prisoners know this. In this riddle, you can assume that all three prisoners are very clever and very smart. If C could not guess the color of his own hat that is because he saw either two white hats or one of each color. If he saw two black hats, he could have deduced that he was wearing a white hat.

===Three-Hat Variant===
In this variant there are 3 prisoners and 3 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue. In all, there are three red hats and two blue. Each person can see the hats of two others, but not their own. On a cue, they each have to guess their own hat color or pass. They win release if at least one person guessed correctly and none guessed incorrectly (passing is neither correct nor incorrect).

This puzzle doesn't have a 100% winning strategy, so the question is: What is the best strategy? Which strategy has the highest probability of winning?

If you think of colors of hats as bits, this problem has some important applications in [[coding theory]].

The solution and the discussion of this puzzle can be found [http://www.relisoft.com/science/hats.html here] (also a solution to the analogous 7-hat puzzle) and other 3 variants are available on this [http://brainden.com/logic-puzzles.htm Logic Puzzles] page (they are called Masters of Logic I-IV).

===Ten-Hat Variant===
In this variant there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats.  Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners.  The prisoners will be lined up single file where each can see the hats in front of him but not behind.  Starting with the prisoner in the back of the line and moving forward, they must each, in turn, say only one word which must be "red" or "blue".  If the word matches their hat color they are released, if not, they are killed on the spot.  A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand and tells them that they can formulate a plan where by following the stated rules, 9 of the 10 prisoners will definitely survive, and 1 has a 50/50 chance of survival.  What is the plan to achieve the goal?

==== The solution====
The prisoners agree that if the first prisoner sees an odd number of red hats, he will say "red". This way, the nine other prisoners will know their own hat color after the prisoner behind them responds.

===Ten-Hat Variant without Hearing===
As before, there are 10 prisoners and 10 hats.  Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners.  The prisoners are distributed in the room such that they can see the hats of the others but not their own.  Now, they must each, simultaneously, say only one word which must be "red" or "blue".  If the word matches their hat color they are released, and if enough prisoners resume their liberty they can rescue the others. A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand.  If they can formulate a plan following the stated rules, 5 of the 10 prisoners will definitely be released and be able to rescue the others.  What is the plan to achieve the goal?

====The solution====
The prisoners pair off. In a pair (A,B) of the prisoners A says the color he can see on the head of B, who says the opposite color he sees on the head of A. Then, if both wear hats with the same color, A is released (and B is not), if the colors are different, B is released (and A is not). In total, 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.  This assumes the pair can communicate who is A and who is B, which may not be allowed.

Alternatively, the prisoners build two groups of 5. One group assumes that the number of red hats is even, the other assumes that there is an odd number of red hats. Similar to the variant with hearing, they can deduce their hat color out of this assumption. Exactly one group will be right, so 5 prisoners answer correctly and 5 do not.

Note that the prisoners cannot find a strategy guaranteeing the release of more than 5 prisoners. Indeed, for a single prisoner, there are as many distributions of hat colors where he says the correct answer than there are where he does not. Hence, there are as many distributions of hat colors where 6 or more prisoners say the correct answer than there are where 4 or fewer do so.

===Countably Infinite-Hat Variant without Hearing===
In this variant, a [[countable|countably infinite]] number of prisoners, each with an unknown and randomly assigned red or blue hat line up single file line.  Each prisoner faces away from the beginning of the line, and each prisoner can see all the hats in front of him, and none of the hats behind.  Starting from the beginning of the line, each prisoner must correctly identify the color of his hat or he is killed on the spot.  As before, the prisoners have a chance to meet beforehand, but unlike before, once in line, no prisoner can hear what the other prisoners say.  The question is, is there a way to ensure that only finitely many prisoners are killed?

====The solution====
If one accepts the [[axiom of choice]], and assumes the prisoners each have the (unrealistic) ability to memorize an [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] amount of information and perform computations with uncountably infinite [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], the answer is yes. In fact, even if we allow an [[uncountable set|uncountable]] number of different colors for the hats and an uncountable number of prisoners, the axiom of choice provides a solution that guarantees that only finitely many prisoners must die provided that each prisoner can see the hats of every other prisoner (not just those ahead of them in a line), or at least that each prisoner can see all but finitely many of the other hats. The solution for the two color case is as follows, and the solution for the uncountably infinite color case is essentially the same:

The prisoners standing in line form a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 is taken to represent blue, and 1 is taken to represent red.  Before they are put into the line, the prisoners define the following [[equivalence relation]] over all possible sequences that they might be put into:  Two sequences are equivalent if they are identical after a finite number of entries.  From this equivalence relation, the prisoners get a collection of equivalence classes.  Assuming the axiom of choice, there exists a set of representative sequences—one from each equivalence class. ([[Almost everywhere|Almost every specific value]] is impossible to compute, but the axiom of choice implies that ''some'' set of values exists, so we assume that the prisoners have access to an [[Oracle machine|oracle]].)

When they are put into their line, each prisoner can see all but a finite number of hats, and can therefore see which equivalence class the ''actual'' sequence of hats belongs to. (This assumes that each prisoner can perform an ''uncountably infinite'' number of comparisons to find a match, with each class comparison requiring a ''countably infinite'' number of individual hat-comparisons).  They then proceed guessing their hat color as if they were in the ''representative'' sequence from the appropriate equivalence class.  Because the actual sequence and the representative sequence are in the same equivalence class, their entries are the same after some finite number ''N'' of prisoners.  All prisoners after these first ''N'' prisoners are saved.

Because the prisoners have no information about the color of their own hat and would make the same guess whichever color it has, each prisoner has a 50% chance of being killed. It may seem paradoxical that an infinite number of prisoners each have an even chance of being killed and yet it is certain that only a finite number are killed. However, there is no contradiction here, because this finite number can be arbitrarily large, and no probability can be assigned to any particular number being killed.

This is easiest to see for the case of zero prisoners being killed. This happens [[if and only if]] the actual sequence is one of the selected representative sequences. If the sequences of 0s and 1s are viewed as binary representations of a real number between 0 and 1, the representative sequences form a [[non-measurable set]]. (This set is similar to a [[Vitali set]], the only difference being that equivalence classes are formed with respect to numbers with finite binary representations rather than all rational numbers.) Hence no probability can be assigned to the event of zero prisoners being killed. The argument is similar for other finite numbers of prisoners being killed, corresponding to a finite number of variations of each representative.

===Countably Infinite Hat Problem with Hearing===
This variant is the same as the last one except that prisoners can hear the colors called out by other prisoners.  The question is, what is the optimal strategy for the prisoners such that the fewest of them die in the worst case?

====The solution====
It turns out that, if one allows the prisoners to hear the colors called out by the other prisoners, it is possible to guarantee the life of every prisoner except the first, who dies with a 50% probability.

To do this, we define the same equivalence relation as above and again select a representative sequence from each equivalence class.  Now, we label every sequence in each class with either a 0 or a 1.  First, we label the representative sequence with a 0.  Then, we label any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an even number of places with a 0, and any sequence which differs from the representative sequence in an odd number of places with a 1.  In this manner, we have labeled every possible infinite sequence with a 0 or a 1 with the important property that any two sequences which differ by only one digit have opposite labels.

Now, when the warden asks the first person to say a color, or in our new interpretation, a 0 or a 1, he simply calls out the label of the sequence he sees.  Given this information, everyone after him can determine exactly what his own hat color is.  The second person sees all but the first digit of the sequence that the first person sees. Thus, as far as he knows, there are two possible sequences the first person could have been labeling: one starting with a 0, and one starting with a 1.  Because of our labeling scheme, these two sequences would receive opposite labels, so based on what the first person says, the second person can determine which of the two possible strings the first person saw, and thus he can determine his own hat color.  Similarly, every later person in the line knows every digit of the sequence except the one corresponding to his own hat color.  He knows those before him because they were called out, and those after him because he can see them.  With this information, he can use the label called out by the first person to determine his own hat color.  Thus, everyone except the first person always guesses correctly.

==Ebert's version and Hamming codes==
Ebert's version of the problem states that all players who guess must guess at the same predetermined time, but that not all players are required to guess.  Now not all players can guess correctly, so the players win if at least one player guesses and all of those who guess do so correctly.  How can the players maximise their chance of winning?

One strategy for solving this version of the hat problem employs [[Hamming code]]s, which are commonly used to detect and correct errors in [[data transmission]]. The probability for winning will be much higher than 50%, depending on the number of players in the puzzle configuration: for example, a winning probability of 87.5% for 7 players.

Similar strategies can be applied to team sizes of ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 and achieve a win rate (2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-1)/2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the Hamming code strategy yields greater win rates for larger values of ''N''.

In this version of the problem, any individual guess has a 50% chance of being right. However, the Hamming code approach works by concentrating wrong guesses together onto certain distributions of hats.  For some cases, all the players will guess incorrectly; whereas for the other cases, only one player will guess, but correctly.  While half of all guesses are still incorrect, this results in the players winning more than 50% of the time.

A simple example of this type of solution with three players is instructive.  With three players, there are eight possibilities; in two of them all players have the same colour hat, and in the other six, two players have one colour and the other player has the other colour.

The players can guarantee that they win in the latter cases (75% of the time) with the following strategy:
# Any player who observes two hats of two different colours remains silent.
# Any player who observes two hats of the same colour guesses the opposite colour.

In the two cases when all three players have the same hat colour, they will all guess incorrectly.  But in the other six cases, only one player will guess, and correctly, that his hat is the opposite of his fellow players'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Havil | first = Julian | year = 2008 | title = Impossible?

A '''hot spare''' or '''warm spare''' or '''hot standby''' is used as a [[failover]] mechanism to provide reliability in [[system configuration]]s.  The hot spare is active and connected as part of a working system.  When a key component fails, the hot spare is switched into operation. More generally, a hot standby can be used to refer to any device or system that is held in readiness to overcome an otherwise significant start-up delay.

==Examples==
Examples of hot spares are components such as [[A/V switch]]es, [[computer]]s, [[network printer]]s, and [[hard disk]]s.  The equipment is powered on, or considered "hot," but not actively functioning in (i.e. used by) the system.

[[Electrical generator]]s may be held on hot standby, or a steam train may be held at the shed fired up (literally hot) ready to replace a possible failure of an engine in service.

==Explanation==
In designing a reliable system, it is recognized that there will be failures. At the extreme, a complete system can be duplicated and kept up to date—so in the event of the primary system failing, the secondary system can be switched in with little or no interruption. More often, a hot spare is a single vital component without which the entire system would fail. The spare component is integrated into the system in such a way that in the event of a problem, the system can be altered to use the spare component. This may be done automatically or manually, but in either case it is normal to have some means of error detection. A hot spare does not necessarily give 100% availability or protect against temporary loss of the system during the switching process; it is designed to significantly reduce the time that the system is unavailable.

Hot standby may have a slightly different connotation of being active but not productive to hot spare, that is it is a state rather than object. For example, in a national power grid, the supply of power needs to be balanced to demand over a short term. It can take many hours to bring a coal-fired power station up to productive temperatures. To allow for load balancing, generator turbines may be kept running with the generators switched off so as peaks of demand occur, the generators can rapidly be switched on to balance the load. Being in the state of being ready to run is known as hot standby. Though it is not a modern phenomenon, steam train operators might hold a spare steam engine at a terminus fired up, as starting an engine cold would take a significant amount of time.

The spare may be similar component or system, or it may be a system of reduced performance, designed to cope for the duration of the time to repair and recover the original component. In high availability systems, it is common to design so that not only is there a spare that can quickly be switched in, but also that the failed component can be repaired or replaced without stopping the system - this is known as [[hot swapping]]. It may be considered that the probability of a second failure is low, and therefore the system is designed simply to allow operation to continue until a suitable maintenance period. The appropriate solution is normally determined by balancing the costs of implementing the availability against the likelihood of a problem and the severity of that problem. there are two types of hot standby:
1. hot standby master - slave
2. hot standby in shearing mode

==Computer usage==
A '''hot spare disk''' is a disk or group of disks used to automatically or manually, depending upon the hot spare policy, replace a failing or failed disk in a [[RAID]] configuration. The hot spare disk reduces the [[mean time to recovery]] (MTTR) for the [[RAID]] redundancy group, thus reducing the probability of a second disk failure and the resultant data loss that would occur in any singly redundant RAID (e.g., RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-10). Typically, a hot spare is available to replace a number of different disks and systems employing a hot spare normally require a redundant group to allow time for the data to be generated onto the spare disk. During this time the system is exposed to data loss due to a subsequent failure, and therefore the automatic switching to a spare disk reduces the time of exposure to that risk compared to manual discovery and implementation.

The concept of hot spares is not limited to hardware, but also software systems can be held in a state of readiness, for example a database server may have a software copy on hot standby, possibly even on the same machine to cope with the various factors that make a database unreliable, such as the impact of disc failure, poorly written queries or database software errors.

==Hot standby operation in railway signalling==

At least two units of the same type will be powered up, receiving the same set of inputs, performing identical computations and producing identical outputs in a nearly-synchronous manner. The outputs are typically physical outputs (individual ON/OFF type digital signals, or analog signals), or serial data messages wrapped in suitable protocols depending upon the nature of their intended use. Outputs from only one unit (designated as the master or on-line unit, via application logic) are used to control external devices (such as switches, signals, on-board propulsion/braking control devices, etc.) or simply to provide displays. The other unit is a hot-standby or a hot spare unit, ready to take over if the master unit fails. When the master unit fails, an automatic failover to the hot spare occurs within a very short time and the outputs from the hot spare, now the master unit, are delivered to the controlled devices and displays. The controlled devices and displays may experience a short blip or disturbance during the failover time.  However, they can be designed to tolerate/ignore the disturbances so that the overall system operation is not affected.

==Hot standby operation of vacuum tubes==
This means that a device, or section of a device, that may need to be activated instantly, is kept with the [[vacuum tube]]s (pre-)heated but the anode voltage supply switched off. This causes normal [[Hot cathode|cathode coatings]] to fail prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reprise.com/host/tektronix/reference/cathode.asp Cathode interface]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hydrothermal vent microbial community''' encompasses all unicellular organisms that live and reproduce in a chemically distinct area around [[Hydrothermal vent|Hydrothermal vents]]. These include organisms in the [[microbial mat]], free floating cells, or bacteria in an [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] relationship with animals. Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria derive nutrients and energy from the geological activity at Hydrothermal vents to fix carbon into organic forms. Viruses are also a part of the hydrothermal vent microbial community and their influence on the microbial ecology in these ecosystems is a burgeoning field of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Rika E.|last2=Brazelton|first2=William J.|last3=Baross|first3=John A.|date=2011|title=Is the genetic landscape of the deep subsurface biosphere affected by viruses?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22084639|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=2|pages=219|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2011.00219|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3211056|pmid=22084639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal vents are located where the tectonic plates are moving apart and spreading. This allows water from the ocean to enter into the crust of the earth where it is heated by the magma. The increasing pressure and temperature forces the water back out of these openings, on the way out, the water accumulates dissolved minerals and chemicals from the rocks that it encounters. There are generally three kinds of vents that occur and are all characterized by its temperature and chemical composition. Diffuse vents release clear water typically up to 30°C. White smoker vents emit a milky coloured water that are approximately 200-330°C, black smoker vents generally release water hotter than the others between 300-400°C. The waters from black smokers are darkened by the precipitates of sulfide that are accumulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Richard A.|last2=Kennish|first2=Michael J.|date=1993|title=Ecology of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities: A review|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=211|doi=10.1029/93rg01280|issn=8755-1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to there not being any sunlight at these ocean depths, energy is provided by [[chemosynthesis]] where symbiotic bacteria and archaea form the bottom of the food chain and are able to support a variety of organisms such as Riftia pachyptila and Alvinella pompejana. These organisms utilize this symbiotic relationship in order to utilize and obtain the chemical energy that is released at these hydrothermal vent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kádár|first=Enikõ|last2=Costa|first2=Valentina|last3=Santos|first3=Ricardo S.|last4=Powell|first4=Jonathan J.|date=July 2006|title=Tissue partitioning of micro-essential metals in the vent bivalve Bathymodiolus azoricus and associated organisms (endosymbiont bacteria and a parasite polychaete) from geochemically distinct vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2006.01.002|journal=Journal of Sea Research|volume=56|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1016/j.seares.2006.01.002|issn=1385-1101}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Environmental Properties ==
[[File:Expl1296 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|236x236px|A cloud of effluent being expelled by a hydrothermal vent violently.|alt=|left]]Although there is a large variation in temperatures at the surface of the water with the changing depths of the [[thermocline]] seasonally, the temperatures underneath the thermocline and the waters near the deep sea are relatively constant. There aren’t any changes that are brought about by seasonal effects or annual changes. These temperatures stay in the range of 0-3°C with the exception of the waters immediately surrounding the hydrothermal vents which can get as high as 407°C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windows2universe.org/?page=/earth/water/temp.html|title=Temperature of Ocean Water - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haase|first=K.

With increasing depth, the effects of pressure start to occur. The pressure is due to the weight of water above pushing down. The approximate rate of pressure increase in the ocean is 10Mega-pascals (MPa) for every kilometre that is traveled towards the seafloor. This means that [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] can reach up to 110MPa at the depths of the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jebbar|first=Mohamed|last2=Franzetti|first2=Bruno|last3=Girard|first3=Eric|last4=Oger|first4=Philippe|date=2015-06-23|title=Microbial diversity and adaptation to high hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea hydrothermal vents prokaryotes|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00792-015-0760-3|journal=Extremophiles|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=721–740|doi=10.1007/s00792-015-0760-3|issn=1431-0651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinity stay relatively constant within the deep seas communities around the world at 35parts per thousand (ppt).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no light in the hydrothermal vent environment so there are no organisms that can create energy from photosynthesis. Instead, the energy that the majority of organisms utilize comes from chemosynthesis. The organisms utilize the minerals and chemicals that come out of the vents.

== Adaptations ==
Extreme conditions in the hydrothermal vent environment means that microbial communities that inhabit these areas need to adapt to them. Microbes that live here are known to be hyperthermophiles which by definition are microorganisms that grow at temperatures above 90°C. These organisms are found where the fluids from the vents are expelled and mixed with the surrounding water. These hyperthermophilic microbes are thought to contain proteins that have extended stability at higher temperatures due to intramolecular interactions but the exact mechanisms are not clear yet. The stabilization mechanisms for DNA are not as unknown and the denaturation of DNA are thought to be minimized through high salt concentrations, more specifically Mg, K, and PO4 which are highly concentrated in hyperthermophiles. Along with this, many of the microbes have proteins similar to histones that are bound to the DNA and can offer protection against the high temperatures. Microbes are also found to be in symbiotic relationships with other organisms in the hydrothermal vent environment due to their ability to have a detoxification mechanism which allows them to metabolize the sulfide-rich waters which would otherwise be toxic to the organisms and the microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zierenberg|first=Robert A.|last2=Adams|first2=Michael W.

== Microbial Biogeochemistry ==

=== Introduction ===
[[File:Deep sea vent chemistry diagram.jpg|right|thumb|388x388px|A diagram showing the process of how seawater becomes a part of the hydrothermal effluent including the elements that are added and precipitated.]]Microbial communities at hydrothermal vents mediate the transformation of energy and minerals produced by geological activity into [[Organic matter|organic material]]. Organic matter produced by [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] bacteria is then used to support the upper [[Trophic level|trophic levels]]. The hydrothermal vent fluid and the surrounding ocean water is rich in elements such as [[iron]], [[manganese]] and various species of sulfur including [[sulfide]], [[sulfite]], [[sulfate]], [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]] from which they can derive energy or nutrients.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kletzin|first=Arnulf|last2=Urich|first2=Tim|last3=Müller|first3=Fabian|last4=Bandeiras|first4=Tiago M.|last5=Gomes|first5=Cláudio M.|date=February 2004|title=Dissimilatory oxidation and reduction of elemental sulfur in thermophilic archaea|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15168612|journal=Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes|volume=36|issue=1|pages=77–91|issn=0145-479X|pmid=15168612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbes derive energy by [[Redox|oxidizing or reducing]] elements. Different microbial species utilize different [[chemical species]] of an element in their [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes. For example, some microbe species oxidize sulfide to sulfate and another species will reduce sulfate to elemental sulfur. As a result, a web of chemical pathways mediated by different microbial species transform elements such as carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen, from one species to another. Their activity alters the original chemical composition produced by geological activity of the hydrothermal vent environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Carbon Cycle ===
Refer to [[Carbon cycle|Carbon Cycle]]

Geological activity at hydrothermal vents produce an abundance of [[Compounds of carbon|carbon compounds]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hydrothermal vent plumes contain high concentrations of [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]] with methane concentration reaching 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; times of the surrounding ocean water.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Deep ocean water]] is also a large reservoir of carbon and concentration of carbon dioxide species such as dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; around 2.2mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunk|first=Rachel M.|last2=Peltzer|first2=Edward T.|last3=Walz|first3=Peter M.|last4=Brewer|first4=Peter G.|date=2005-12-15|title=Seeing a deep ocean CO2 enrichment experiment in a new light: laser raman detection of dissolved CO2 in seawater|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16475344|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=39|issue=24|pages=9630–9636|issn=0013-936X|pmid=16475344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bountiful carbon and electron acceptors produced by geological activity support an oasis of [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophic]] microbial communities that fix inorganic carbon, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; using energy from sources such as oxidation of sulfur, iron, manganese, hydrogen and methane.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These bacteria supply a large portion of organic carbon that support [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic]] life at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

==== Carbon Fixation ====
[[Carbon fixation]] is the incorporation of inorganic carbon into organic matter. Unlike the surface of the planet where light is a major source of energy for carbon fixation, hydrothermal vent chemolithotrophic bacteria rely on chemical oxidation to obtain the energy required.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is observed in members of [[Gammaproteobacteria|gammaproteobacterial]], [[epsilonproteobacteria]], [[alphaproteobacteria]], and members of [[Archaea]] domain at hydrothermal vents. Four major [[Metabolic pathway|metabolic pathways]] for carbon fixation found in microbial vent communities include the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) cycle and reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakagawa|first=Satoshi|last2=Takai|first2=Ken|date=July 2008|title=Deep-sea vent chemoautotrophs: diversity, biochemistry and ecological significance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18503548|journal=FEMS microbiology ecology|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00502.x|issn=0168-6496|pmid=18503548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Carbon Fixation Metabolic Pathways =====
:'''Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB)'''

::The [[Light-independent reactions|Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB)]] cycle is the most common CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation pathway found among autotrophs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The key [[enzyme]] is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ([[RuBisCO]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[RuBisCO]] has been identified in members of the microbial community such as ''Thiomicrospira, [[Beggiatoa]]''[[Beggiatoa|,]] ''[[Zetaproteobacteria|zetaproteobacterium]]'', and [[Gammaproteobacteria|gammaproteobacterial]] [[Endosymbiont|endosymbionts]] of [[Tube worm|tubeworms]], [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], and [[Gastropoda|gastropods]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

:'''Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA)'''

::The [[Reverse Krebs cycle|Reductive Carboxylic Acid Cycle (rTCA)]] is the second most commonly found carbon fixation pathway at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=Teresa|last2=Barroso|first2=Cristina|last3=Froufe|first3=Hugo|last4=Egas|first4=Conceição|last5=Bettencourt|first5=Raul|date=August 2018|title=Metagenomic Signatures of Microbial Communities in Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Sediments of Azores Vent Fields|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354879|journal=Microbial Ecology|volume=76|issue=2|pages=387–403|doi=10.1007/s00248-018-1144-x|issn=1432-184X|pmid=29354879}}&lt;/ref&gt; rTCA cycle is essentially a reversed [[Citric acid cycle|TCA or Kreb cycle]] heterotrophs use to oxidize organic matter. Organism that use the rTCA cycle prefer to inhabit [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] zones in the hydrothermal vent system because some enzymes in the rTCA cycle are sensitive to the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is found in sulfate reducing [[Deltaproteobacteria|deltaproteobacterium]] such as some members of ''[[Desulfobacterium|Desulfobacter]]'', ''[[Aquificae|Aquificales]]'' and ''[[Aquifex]]'' and ''[[Thermoproteales]]''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

:'''3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB cycles'''

::The key enzymes of [[3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB]] cycles are acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, malonyl-CoA reductase and propionyl-CoA synthase. Most of the organisms that use this pathway are [[Mixotroph|mixotrophs]] with the ability to utilize organic carbon in addition to carbon fixation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

:'''Reductive Acetyl CoA pathway'''

::The [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway|Reductive Acetyl CoA]] pathway has only been found in chemoautotrophs. This pathway does not require [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as the pathway is directly coupled to the reduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Organisms that have been found with this pathway prefer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rich areas. Species include deltaproteobacterium such as ''[[Dulfobacterium autotrophicum]],'' [[acetogen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Methanogen|methanogenic]] ''Archaea''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Methane Metabolism ====
Hydrothermal vents produce high quantities of [[methane]] which can originate from both geological and biological processes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;de Angelis, M. A. (1989).

Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/303750552&lt;/ref&gt; Methane concentrations in hydrothermal vent plumes can exceed 300µM in concentration depending on the vent. In comparison, the vent fluid contains 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; times more methane than the surrounding deep ocean water, of which methane ranges between 0.2-0.3nM in concentration.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Microbial communities utilize the high concentrations of methane as an energy source and a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Methanotroph|Methanotrophy]], where a species uses methane both as an energy and carbon source, have been observed with the presence of [[gammaproteobacteria]] in the ''[[Methylococcaceae]]'' lineages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Methanotrophs convert methane into carbon dioxide and organic carbon.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; They are typically characterized by the presence of intercellular membranes and microbes with intercellular membranes were observed to make up 20% of the [[microbial mat]] at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===== Methane Oxidation =====
Energy generation via methane oxidation yields the next best source of energy after sulfur oxidation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been suggested that microbial oxidation facilitates rapid turnover at hydrothermal vents, thus much of the methane is oxidize within short distance of the vent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In hydrothermal vent communities, aerobic oxidation of methane is commonly found in [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] microbes of vent animals.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=William|last2=Baross|first2=John|last3=Kelley|first3=Deborah|last4=Russell|first4=Michael J.|date=November 2008|title=Hydrothermal vents and the origin of life|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820700|journal=Nature Reviews.

Microbial communities at hydrothermal vent convert sulfur such as [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] produced by geological activity into other forms such as [[sulfite]], [[sulfate]], and [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]] for energy or [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] into [[Organic compound|organic molecules]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sulfide is plentiful at Hydrothermal Vents, with concentrations from one to tens of mM, whereas the surrounding ocean water usually only contains a few nano molars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford-Knoery|first=Joël|last2=German|first2=C.

Reduced sulfur compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S produced by the hydrothermal vents are a major source of energy for sulfur metabolism in microbes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Redox|Oxidation]] of reduced sulfur compounds into forms such as [[sulfite]], [[thiosulfate]], and elemental sulfur is used to produce energy for microbe metabolism such as synthesis of [[Organic compound|organic compounds]] from [[Compounds of carbon|inorganic carbon]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The major metabolic pathways used for sulfur oxidation includes the [[Microbial oxidation of sulfur#%20Biochemistry|''SOX'' pathway]] and dissimilatory oxidation.

==== Sulfur Reduction ====
[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction|Sulfur reduction]] uses sulfate as an electron acceptor for the [[Sulfur assimilation|assimilation of sulfur]]. Microbes that perform sulfate reduction typically use [[hydrogen]], [[methane]] or organic matter as an [[electron donor]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM) often use sulfate as electron acceptor.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This method is favoured by organisms living in highly [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] areas of the hydrothermal vent,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; thus are one of the predominate processes that occur within the sediments.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Species that reduce sulfate have been identified in [[Archaea]] and members of [[Deltaproteobacteria]] such as ''[[Desulfovibrio]], [[Desulfobulbus propionicus|Desulfobulbus]], [[Desulfobacteraceae|Desulfobacteria]], and [[Desulfuromonas]]'' at hydrothermal vents&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Kiana L.|last2=Rogers|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Olins|first3=Heather C.|last4=Vidoudez|first4=Charles|last5=Girguis|first5=Peter R.|date=July 2013|title=Characterizing the distribution and rates of microbial sulfate reduction at Middle Valley hydrothermal vents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535916|journal=The ISME journal|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1391–1401|doi=10.1038/ismej.2013.17|issn=1751-7370|pmc=3695286|pmid=23535916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrogen Cycle  ===
Refer to [[Nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen Cycle]]

Deep ocean water contains the largest reservoir of [[nitrogen]] available to hydrothermal vents with around 0.59 mM of dissolved [[Nitrogen|Nitrogen gas]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Mausmi P.|last2=Butterfield|first2=David A.|last3=Baross|first3=John A.|date=February 2003|title=Phylogenetic diversity of nitrogenase (nifH) genes in deep-sea and hydrothermal vent environments of the Juan de Fuca Ridge|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571018|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=69|issue=2|pages=960–970|doi=10.1128/AEM.69.2.960-970.2003|issn=0099-2240|pmc=143675|pmid=12571018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourbonnais|first=Annie|last2=Lehmann|first2=Moritz F.|last3=Butterfield|first3=David A.|last4=Juniper|first4=S.

The study of the [[Nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen Cycle]] in hydrothermal vent microbial communities still requires more comprehensive research.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; However, [[isotope]] data suggests that microorganism influence dissolved inorganic nitrogen quantities and compositions and all pathways of the nitrogen cycle are likely to be found at hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Biological [[nitrogen fixation]] is important to provide some of the biologically available nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle especially at unsedimented hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrogen fixation is done by many different microbes including [[methanogen]] in the orders ''[[Methanomicrobiales]]'', ''[[Methanococcales]]'', and ''[[Methanobacteriales]]''&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;''.'' [[Thermophile|Thermophilic]] microbes have been found to be able to fix nitrogen at higher temperatures such as 92°C.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrogen fixation may be especially prevalent in [[Microbial mat|microbial mats]] and [[Pelagic sediment|particulate material]] where biologically available levels of nitrogen are low, due to high microbe density and anaerobic environment allows the function of [[nitrogenase]], a nitrogen fixing enzyme.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Evidence have also been detected of [[Nitrogen assimilation|assimilation]], [[nitrification]], [[denitrification]], [[Anammox|anamox]], [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] and [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; For example, [[sulfur oxidizing bacteria]] like ''Begiatoa'' species, perform denitrification and reduces nitrate to oxidize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Nitrate assimilation is done by symbiotic species of [[Riftia pachyptila|''Riftia pachyptil''a]] tubeworm&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Bacterial Diversity ==
The most abundant bacteria in hydrothermal vents are chemolithotrophs. These bacteria use reduced chemical species, most often sulfur, as sources of energy to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jannasch|first=Holger W.|last2=Mottl|first2=Michael J.|date=1985|title=Geomicrobiology of Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vents|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1696097|journal=Science|volume=229|issue=4715|pages=717–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemolithotrophic abundance in a hydrothermal vent environment is determined by the available energy sources; different temperature vents have different concentrations of nutrients, suggesting large variation between vents. In general, large microbial populations are found in warm vent water plumes (25°C), the surfaces exposed to warm vent plumes and in symbiotic tissues within certain vent invertebrates in the vicinity of the vent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sulfur-oxidizing ===
These bacteria use various forms of available sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the presence of oxygen. They are the predominant population in the majority of hydrothermal vents because their source of energy is widely available, and chemosynthesis rates increase in aerobic conditions. The bacteria at hydrothermal vents are similar to the types of sulfur bacteria found in other H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich environments - except ''Thiomicrospira'' has replaced ''Thiobacillus.'' Other common species are ''Thiothrix'' and ''Beggiatoa,'' which is of particular importance because of its ability to fix nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Methane-oxidizing ===
Methane is a substantial source of energy in certain hydrothermal vents, but not others: methane is more abundant in warm vents (25°C) than hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many types of methanotrophic bacteria exist, which require oxygen and fix CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and other C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; compounds, including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO, if present in vent water.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These type of bacteria are also found in ''[[Riftia pachyptila|Riftia]]'' trophosome, indicating a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Here, methane-oxidizing bacteria refers to [[Methanotroph|methanotrophs]], which are not the same as [[Methanogen|methanogens]]: ''[[Methanococcus]]'' and ''[[Methanocaldococcus jannaschii]]'' are examples methanogens,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which are found in hydrothermal vents; whereas ''[[Methylocystaceae]]'' are methanotrophs, which have been discovered in hydrothermal vent communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skennerton|first=Connor T.|last2=Ward|first2=Lewis M.|last3=Michel|first3=Alice|last4=Metcalfe|first4=Kyle|last5=Valiente|first5=Chanel|last6=Mullin|first6=Sean|last7=Chan|first7=Ken Y.|last8=Gradinaru|first8=Viviana|last9=Orphan|first9=Victoria J.|date=2015|title=Genomic Reconstruction of an Uncultured Hydrothermal Vent Gammaproteobacterial Methanotroph (Family Methylothermaceae) Indicates Multiple Adaptations to Oxygen Limitation|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01425/full|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01425|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4688376|pmid=26779119}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Hydrogen-oxidizing ===
Little is known about microbes that use hydrogen as a source of energy, however, studies have shown that they are aerobic, and also symbiotic with ''Riftia'' (see below).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These bacteria are important in the primary production of organic carbon because the geothermally-produced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is taken up for this process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Hydrogen-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria may be abundant in vents where NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-containing bottom seawater mixes with hydrothermal fluid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Desulfonauticus submarinus'' is a [[hydrogenotroph]] that reduces sulfur-compounds in warm vents and has been found in tube worms ''R. pachyptila'' and ''Alvinella pompejana.'' &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Audiffrin|first=Carine|last2=Cayol|first2=Jean-Luc|last3=Joulian|first3=Catherine|last4=Casalot|first4=Laurence|last5=Thomas|first5=Pierre|last6=Garcia|first6=Jean-Louis|last7=Ollivier|first7=Bernard|date=2003|title=Desulfonauticus submarinus gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel sulfate-reducing bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent|url=http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.02551-0|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1585–1590|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.02551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron- and manganese-oxidizing ===
These bacteria are commonly found in iron and manganese deposits on surfaces exposed intermittently to plumes of hydrothermal and bottom seawater. However, due to the rapid oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral and alkaline waters (i.e. freshwater and seawater), bacteria responsible for the oxidative deposition of iron would be more commonly found in acidic waters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Manganese-oxidizing bacteria would be more abundant in freshwater and seawater compared to iron-oxidizing bacteria due to the higher concentration of available metal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Ecology ===

==== Symbiotic Relationships ====
[[Symbiosis|Symbiotic]] [[chemosynthesis]] is an important process for hydrothermal vent communities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At warm vents, common symbionts for bacteria are deep-sea clams, ''[[Calyptogena magnifica|Calpytogena magnifica]],'' mussels such as ''[[Bathymodiolus thermophilus|Bathyomodiolus thermophilus]]'' and pogonophoran tube worms, ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]'', and ''[[Alvinella pompejana]]''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Hydrothermal_vents|title=Hydrothermal vents - microbewiki|website=microbewiki.kenyon.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;The [[trophosome]] of these animals are specified organs for symbionts that contains valuable molecules for chemosynthesis. These organisms have become so reliant on their symbionts that they have lost all morphological features relating to ingestion and digestion, though the bacteria are provided with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, methane-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from ''C. magnifica'' and ''R. pachyptila,'' which indicate that methane assimilation may take place within the trophosome of these organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Deep-sea hydrothermal vents were found to have high numbers of viruses indicating high viral production.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortmann|first=Alice C.|last2=Suttle|first2=Curtis A.|date=August 2005|title=High abundances of viruses in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent system indicates viral mediated microbial mortality|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967063705001032|journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1515–1527|doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2005.04.002|issn=0967-0637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples from the [[Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents]] off the coast southwest British Columbia showed that active venting [[black smokers]] had viral abundances from 1.45x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 9.90x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; per mL with a drop-off in abundance found in the hydrothermal-vent plume (3.5x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; per mL) and outside the venting system (2.94x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; per mL). The high number-density of viruses and therefore viral production (in comparison to surrounding deep-sea waters) implies that viruses are a significant source of microbial mortality at the vents.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Like in other marine environments, deep-sea hydrothermal viruses affect abundance and diversity of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] and therefore impact microbial biogeochemical cycling by [[Lysis|lysing]] their hosts to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breitbart|first=Mya|date=2012-01-15|title=Marine Viruses: Truth or Dare|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=425–448|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142805|issn=1941-1405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to their role as a source of mortality and population control, viruses have also been postulated to enhance survival of prokaryotes in extreme environments, acting as reservoirs of genetic information.

A review of viral work at hydrothermal vents published in 2015 stated that vents harbour a significant proportion of lysogenic hosts and that a large proportion of viruses are temperate indicating that the vent environments may provide an advantage to the prophage.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272147017_Viral_evolution_at_the_limits|title=(PDF) Viral evolution at the limits|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of virus-host interactions in diffuse-flow hydrothermal vent environments found that the high-incidence of lysogenic hosts and large populations of temperate viruses was unique in its magnitude and that these viruses are likely critical to the systems ecology of prokaryotes. The same study's genetic analysis found that 51% of the viral [[Metagenomics|metagenome]] sequences were unknown (lacking [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to sequenced data), with high diversity across vent environments but lower diversity for specific vent sites which indicates high specificity for viral targets.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; 

A metagenomic analysis of deep-sea hydrothermal vent [[Virome|viromes]] showed that viral genes manipulated bacterial [[metabolism]], participating in metabolic pathways as well as forming branched pathways in microbial metabolism which facilitated adaptation to the extreme environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Tianliang|last2=Li|first2=Hongyun|last3=Zhang|first3=Xiaobo|date=2017-09-06|title=Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Viruses Compensate for Microbial Metabolism in Virus-Host Interactions|url=https://mbio.asm.org/content/8/4/e00893-17|journal=mBio|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e00893–17|doi=10.1128/mBio.00893-17|issn=2150-7511|pmc=5513705|pmid=28698277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that 15 of 18 viral genomes sequenced from samples of vent plumes contained genes closely related to an enzyme that the SUP05 [[Chemolithoautotroph|chemolithoautotrophs]] use to extract energy from sulfur compounds. The authors concluded that such phage genes ([[auxiliary metabolic genes]]) that are able to enhance the sulfur oxidation metabolism in their hosts could provide selective advantages to viruses (continued infection and replication).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anantharaman|first=Karthik|last2=Duhaime|first2=Melissa B.|last3=Breier|first3=John A.|last4=Wendt|first4=Kathleen A.|last5=Toner|first5=Brandy M.|last6=Dick|first6=Gregory J.|date=2014-05-16|title=Sulfur Oxidation Genes in Diverse Deep-Sea Viruses|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6185/757|journal=Science|language=en|volume=344|issue=6185|pages=757–760|doi=10.1126/science.1252229|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24789974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity in viral and SUP05 genes for the sulfur metabolism implies an exchange of genes in the past and could implicate the viruses as agents of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/05/02/3996620.htm|title=Viruses make zombies of deep sea vent bacteria|date=2014-05-02|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metagenomic study found that viral genes had relatively high proportion of metabolism, [[Vitamin|vitamins]] and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] genes, indicating that viral genomes encode auxiliary metabolic genes. Coupled with the observations of a high proportion of lysogenic viruses, this indicates that viruses are selected to be integrated [[Provirus|pro-viruses]] rather than free floating viruses and that the auxiliary genes can be expressed to benefit both the host and the integrated virus. The viruses enhance fitness by boosting metabolism or offering greater metabolic flexibility to the hosts they’re within. The evidence suggests that deep-sea hydrothermal vent viral evolutionary strategies promote prolonged host integration, favoring a form of mutualism to classic parasitism.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

As hydrothermal vents outlets for sub-seafloor material, there is also likely a connection between vent viruses and those in the crust.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20590">In [[computer graphics]], '''image tracing''', '''raster-to-vector conversion''' or '''vectorization''' is the conversion of [[raster graphics]] into [[vector graphics]].

==Background==
[[File:Bitmap VS SVG.svg|right|300px|thumb|This image illustrates the difference between bitmap and vector images. The bitmap image is composed of a fixed set of pixels, while the vector image is composed of a fixed set of shapes. In the picture, scaling the bitmap reveals the pixels while scaling the vector image preserves the shapes.]]

An image does not have any structure: it is just a collection of marks on paper, grains in film, or pixels in a [[bitmap]]. While such an image is useful, it has some limits. If the image is magnified enough, its artifacts appear. The halftone dots, film grains and pixels become apparent. Images of sharp edges become fuzzy or jagged. See, for example, [[pixelation]]. Ideally, a vector image does not have the same problem. Edges and filled areas are represented as mathematical curves or gradients, and they can be magnified arbitrarily.

The task in vectorization is to convert a two-dimensional image into a two-dimensional vector representation of the image. It is not examining the image and attempting to recognize or extract a three-dimensional model which may be depicted; i.e. it is not a [[Computer vision|vision system]]. For most applications, vectorization also does not involve [[optical character recognition]]; characters are treated as lines, curves, or filled objects without attaching any significance to them. In vectorization the shape of the character is preserved, so artistic embellishments remain.

Synthetic images such as maps, cartoons, logos, clip art, and technical drawings are suitable for vectorization. Those images could have been originally made as vector images because they are based on geometric shapes or drawn with simple curves.

Continuous tone photographs (such as live portraits) are not good candidates for vectorization. 

The input to vectorization is an image, but an image may come in many forms such as a photograph, a drawing on paper, or one of several [[Image_file_formats#Raster_formats|raster file formats]]. Programs that do raster-to-vector conversion may accept bitmap formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]].

The output is a [[Image_file_formats#Vector_formats|vector file format]]. Common vector formats are [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[Enhanced Metafile Format|EMF]] and [[Adobe Illustrator|AI]].

Vectorization can be used to update images or recover work. Personal computers often come with a simple paint program that produces a bitmap output file. These programs allow users to make simple illustrations by adding text, drawing outlines, and filling outline with a specific color. Only the results of these operations (the pixels) are saved in the resulting bitmap; the drawing and filling operations are discarded. Vectorization can be used to recapture some of the information that was lost.

Vectorization is also used to recover information that was originally in a vector format but has been lost or has become unavailable. A company may have commissioned a logo from a graphic arts firm. Although the graphics firm used a vector format, the client company may not have received a copy of that format. The company may then acquire a vector format by scanning and vectorizing a paper copy of the logo.

==Process==
[[File:Proton proton cycle.png|thumb|Original PNG file (37 kB)]]
[[File:Proton proton cycle.svg|thumb|Hand converted to SVG (9 kB)]]

Vectorization starts with an image.

===Manual===

The image can be vectorized manually. A person could look at the image, make some measurements, and then write the output file by hand. That was the case for the vectorization of a technical illustration about neutrinos. The illustration has a few geometric shapes and a lot of text; it was relatively easy to convert the shapes, and the SVG vector format allows the text (even subscripts and superscripts) to be entered easily.

The original image did not have any curves (except for the text), so the conversion is straightforward. Curves make the conversion more complicated. Manual vectorization of complicated shapes can be facilitated by the tracing function built into some [[Vector_graphics_editor|vector graphics editing programs]].

If the image is not yet in machine readable form, then has to be scanned into a usable file format.

Once there is a machine-readable bitmap, the image can be imported into a [[Comparison of vector graphics editors|graphics editing program]] (such as [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDRAW]], or [[Inkscape]]).  Then a person can manually trace the elements of the image using the program's editing features. Curves in the original image can be approximated with lines, arcs, and Bézier curves. An illustration program allows spline knots to be adjusted for a close fit. Manual vectorization is possible, but it can be tedious.

Although graphics drawing programs have been around for a long time, artists may find the freehand drawing facilities are awkward even when a drawing tablet is used. Instead of using a program, {{Harvtxt|Pepper|2005}} recommends making an initial sketch on paper. Instead of scanning the sketch and tracing it freehand in the computer, Pepper states: "Those proficient with a graphic tablet and stylus could make the following changes directly in CorelDRAW by using a scan of the sketch as an underlay and drawing over it. I prefer to use pen and ink, and a light table"; most of the final image was traced by hand in ink. Later the line-drawing image was scanned at 600&amp;nbsp;dpi, cleaned up in a paint program, and then automatically traced with a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pepper|2005|pp=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the black and white image was in the graphics program, some other elements were added and the figure was colored.

Similarly, {{harvtxt|Ploch|2005}} recreated a design from a digital photograph. The JPEG was imported and some "basic shapes" were traced by hand and colored in the graphics drawing program; more complex shapes were handled differently. Ploch used a bitmap editor to remove the background and crop the more complex image components. He then printed the image and traced it by hand onto tracing paper to get a clean black and white line drawing. That drawing was scanned and then vectorized with a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ploch|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic===
There are programs that automate the vectorization process.  Example programs are [[Adobe Streamline]] (discontinued), Corel's PowerTRACE, and [[Potrace]]. Some of these programs have a command line interface while others are interactive that allow the user to adjust the conversion settings and view the result. Adobe Streamline is not only an interactive program, but it also allows a user to manually edit the input bitmap and the output curves. Corel's PowerTRACE is accessed through CorelDRAW; CorelDRAW can be used to modify the input bitmap and edit the output curves. Adobe Illustrator has a facility to trace individual curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1998|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated programs can have mixed results. A program (PowerTRACE) was used to convert a PNG map to SVG. The program did a good job on the map boundaries (the most tedious task in the tracing) and the settings dropped out all the text (small objects). The text was manually re-inserted.

[[File:StrekenProvincieUtrecht.png|thumb|320px|left|Map in PNG format (13 kB)]]
[[File:StrekenProvincieUtrecht1.svg|thumb|320px|left|Map after automated conversion and touch up to re-add the labels and adjust colors. (Note: Wikipedia's SVG conversion tools currently do not handle a text baseline alignment option, so the text is displaced downward.) (18 kB)]]

Other conversions may not go as well. The results depend on having high-quality scans, reasonable settings, and good algorithms.

Scanned images often have a lot of noise. The bitmap image may need a lot of work to clean it up. Erase stray marks and fill in lines and areas.

Corel advice: Put image on a light table, cover with [[vellum]] ([[tracing paper]]), and then manually ink the desired outlines. Then scan the vellum and use automated raster-to-vector conversion program on that scan.

==Options==
[[File:Lines on Vellum 600dpi.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Although these lines may look solid, they are far from perfect. The lines were drawn on [[vellum]] with a fountain pen, a 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm gel pen, and a 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm HB pencil. The images were scanned at 600 pixels per inch with 24-bit RGB. The line widths end up being 10 to 14 pixels wide. The ink colors are not uniform and have [[specular reflection]]s that put light pixels within the lines. The pencil lines also have interior defects due to the roughness (tooth) of the paper. The scan also has some [[unsharp masking]] artifacts.]]

There are many different image styles and possibilities, and no single vectorization method works well on all images. Consequently, vectorization programs have many options that influence the result.

One issue is what the predominant shapes are. If the image is of a fill-in form, then it will probably have just vertical and horizontal lines of a constant width. The program's vectorization should take that into account. On the other hand, a CAD drawing may have lines at any angle, there may be curved lines, and there may be several line weights (thick for objects and thin for dimension lines). Instead of (or in addition to) curves, the image may contain outlines filled with the same color. Adobe Streamline allows users to select a combination of line recognition (horizontal and vertical lines), centerline recognition, or outline recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1992|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streamline also allows outline shapes that are small to be thrown out; the notion is such small shapes are noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1992|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user may set the noise level between 0 and 1000; an outline that has fewer pixels than that setting is discarded.

Another issue is the number of colors in the image. Even images that were created as black on white drawings may end up with many shades of gray. Some line-drawing routines employ anti-aliasing; a pixel completely covered by the line will be black, but a pixel that is only partially covered will be gray. If the original image is on paper and is scanned, there is a similar result: edge pixels will be gray. Sometimes images are compressed (e.g., JPEG images), and the compression will introduce gray levels.

Many of the vectorization programs will group same-color pixels into lines, curves, or outlined shapes.  If each possible color is grouped into its own object, there can be an enormous number of objects. Instead, the user is asked to select a finite number of colors (usually less than 256), the image is reduced to using that many colors (this step is [[color quantization]]), and then the vectorization is done on the reduced image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1992|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; For continuous tone images such as photographs, the result of color quantization is [[posterization]]. Gradient fills will also be posterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adobe|1998|pp=348–350}} discusses [[colour banding|color banding]] in gradient fills.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the number of colors in an image is often aided with a histogram. The most common colors may be selected as the representatives, and other colors are mapped to their closest representative. When the number of colors is set to two, the user may be asked to make threshold and contrast setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1992|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrast setting looks for significant changes in pixel color rather than a particular color; consequently, it may ignore the gradual color variations in a [[color gradient|gradient fill]]. Once the outline has been extracted, the user could manually reintroduce the gradient fill.

The vectorization program will want to group a region of the same color into a single object. It can clearly do that by making the region boundary exactly follow the pixel boundaries, but the result will be a boundary of often short orthogonal lines. The resulting conversion will also have the same pixelation problems that a bitmap has when it is magnified. Instead, the vectorization program needs to approximate the region boundary with lines and curves that closely follow the pixel boundaries but are not exactly the pixel boundaries. A tolerance parameter tells the program how closely it should follow the pixel boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adobe|1992|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result of many vectorization programs are curves consisting of cubic [[Bézier curve]]s. A region boundary is approximated with several curve segments. To keep a curve smooth, the joints of two curves is constrained so the tangents match. One problem is determining where a curve bends so sharply that it should not be smooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Itoh|Ohno|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smooth portions of a curve are then approximated with a Bézier curve fitting procedure. Successive division may be used. Such a fitting procedure tries to fit the curve with a single cubic curve; if the fit is acceptable, then the procedure stops. Otherwise, it selects some advantageous point along the curve and breaks the curve into two parts. It then fits the parts while keeping the joint tangent. If the fit is still unacceptable, then it breaks the curve into more parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some vectorizers are standalone programs, but many have interactive interfaces that allow a user to adjust the program parameters and quickly see the result. PowerTRACE, for example, can display the original image and preview the converted image so the user may compare them; the program also reports information such as the number of curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corel|2005|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=400px style="text-align:left"&gt;
File:Radula diagram3.png|Original artwork in PNG format; 115 kB.
File:Radula diagram3 traced.svg|Traced with PowerTRACE using detailed logo, smoothing 40, detail +2.5; result: 50 colors, 94 curves, 2452 nodes, 96 kB.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

On the right is an illustration showing the operation of the [[radula]] in mollusks. The upper portion is mostly a one-pen-width filled outline diagram, but it has a mesh gradient fill along the bottom of the shell and along the bottom of food. It also has some artistic brushes on the upper left of the shell. The bottom portion of the illustration has four line weights and some small characters; the color fill is simple except for a gradient at the jagged lines.

The 531&amp;times;879 pixel image was traced; 50 colors were used. Most (if not all) lines were lost; they were turned into black regions, and their effective line widths vary. The black outline around the blue food in upper part disappeared. The gradient fills and brushed spots were lost to color quantization/posterization; some brush spots disappeared. Some letters survived the vectorization with distortion, but most letters were discarded. Losing the letters is not a big issue; post conversion editing would want to delete the annotation and replace it with text rather than curves. Thin lines crossing at a shallow angle made filled regions, and intersecting outlines of filled region became confused; see lower right corner. The tracing also has some odd features. Many black outlines touch, so they become a large, complicated, object rather than just outlines for specific regions. Instead of just background, a rectangular white region separates the two outlined rectangles. The objects labeled ''op'', ''rp'', and ''rr'' are not simple layered shapes; the desired result would have ''rr'' overlaid by ''rp'' which is overlaid by ''op''.

== Usage domains ==
*In [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) drawings ([[blueprint]]s etc.) are scanned, vectorized and written as CAD files in a process called ''paper-to-CAD conversion'' or ''drawing conversion''.
*In [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) satellite or aerial images are vectorized to create [[geographical map|maps]].
*In [[graphic design]] and [[photography]], graphics can be vectorized for easier usage and resizing.
*Vectorization is often the first step in [[Optical Character Recognition|OCR]] solutions for handwritten text or [[signature]]s.

Vectorization is effective on single colored, non gradient input data, like signatures.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Continuous tone images===
Vectorization is usually inappropriate for continuous tone images such as portraits. The result is often poor. For example, many different image tracing algorithms were applied to a 25&amp;nbsp;kB JPEG image. The resulting vector images are at least a factor of ten larger and may have pronounced posterization effects when a small number of colors are used.

The '''Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR)''' is an organization founded in 1987 by [[Heidi Hartmann]] to meet the need for [[women]]-centered, policy-oriented research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=10903&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was co-founded by current IWPR President Heidi Hartmann in 1986. IWPR has informed policy by putting relevant, high quality facts in the hands of thousands of local leaders and advocates, increasing their ability to shape and implement legislation that benefits women and their families. IWPR has published hundreds of reports, fact sheets, and research-in-briefs that place women as the central point of analysis. The research serves as a reliable resource to policymakers, providing background and context for present and future policy agendas impacting women in the United States and around the world. IWPR’s research addresses issues of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In addition, IWPR research focuses specifically on policies that help or hurt women in their efforts to achieve social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwpr.org/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Areas==
===Employment, Economic Change &amp; Education===
IWPR examines the quality of jobs across a diverse range of workers and job types as well as produces research that explores access to employment benefits.

On average, women earn less than men in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufficient data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio. IWPR tracks the gender wage gap over time. Given the existing gender wage gap, educational attainment is especially crucial for women, as women need more education to reach the same average income levels as men.

===Democracy and Society===
IWPR seeks to identify successful strategies to encourage women’s participation in civic and political life by analyzing data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels.

===Poverty, Welfare and Income Security===
Around the world, research shows that women tend to be in poverty at greater rates than men. IWPR has served as a resource on women’s poverty issues by producing research on income security and suggesting improvements to planning and policies that take into consideration the welfare of women.

===Work and Family===
For most Americans, work and family go hand in hand. Early care and education programs are crucial to a thriving economy, not only because they allow parents to work, but because the child care sector is large and purchases numerous goods and services. IWPR aims to improve access to child care, measure workplace flexibility and determine whether the defining characteristics of a good job are being implemented in American society.

===Health and Safety===
Women have specific concerns when it comes to health. More often than not, women make the majority of health care-related decisions regarding health issues for their families, are the primary caregivers, and spend more than their male counterparts on health (KFF 2009; Agency for 2004). IWPR’s research on women’s health and safety informs policy decisions by identifying gender and racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes and access to health care services in addition to highlighting opportunities for improvement.

==IWPR Projects and Initiatives==
===Status of Women in the States Reports=== 
IWPR has analyzed data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels, including demographics, economic security, educational attainment, reproductive rights, political participation, civic engagement, and access to health care and work support in order to publish a collection of comprehensive reports. Each report offers policy recommendations shaped by the research findings for that state, city or area.

===Women and Social Security===
Women are more likely to rely on Social Security because they have fewer alternative sources of income, often outlive their husbands, and are more likely to be left to rear children when their husbands die or become disabled. Specifically, adult women are 57 percent of all social security beneficiaries aged 65 and older. IWPR produces and disseminates materials to keep women involved on the ongoing Social Security debate and to ensure that women’s concerns are addressed when or if any changes to the system take place.

===Student Parent Success Initiative=== 
The Student Parent Success Initiative focuses on supporting students with dependent children who are pursuing college education. Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the project gives IWPR the opportunity to initiate new research and foster communication and collaboration among advocates, policymakers, and practitioners invested in the success of student parents in postsecondary education.

[[Image:Jackshaft two belt pulleys.png|thumb|A two-pulley jackshaft redirecting belt power from horizontal to vertical.]]

A '''jackshaft''', also called a ''countershaft'', is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it.  In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting [[Horsepower|power]] from a driving shaft to a driven shaft.

==History==
===Jackshaft===
The oldest uses of the term ''jackshaft'' appear to involve shafts that were intermediate between [[water wheel]]s or [[stationary steam engine]]s and the [[line shaft]]s of 19th century mills.&lt;ref&gt;James Emerson, Report of Water-Wheel Tests at Lowell and Other Places, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIII, No. 3 (March, 1872); pages 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holyoke Warter Power Co., Experiments with Gears, Belts and Draft Tubes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HD1EAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 Holyoke Hydrodynamic Experiments], Weaver Shipman and Co., Springfield, Mass., 1880; pages 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early sources from [[New England]] mills in 1872 and 1880, the term ''"jack shaft"'' always appears in quotes.  Another 1872 author wrote "Gear wheels are used in England to transmit the power of the engine to what is usually called the jack shaft."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872"&gt;Coleman Sellers, Transmission of Motion, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNgGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIV, No. 5 (Nov. 1872); pages 305-319, ''countershaft'' is defined on page 314, ''jack shaft'' on page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission], [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219-224, see particularly figure 1 and the discussion of it on pages 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills or power plants were frequently connected to the shaft with [[clutch]]es.  For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two [[Corliss engine]]s and five [[dynamo]]s, linked through a jackshaft.  Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed any or all of the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Flather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q5dKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=42 Rope-Driving:  A treatise on the transmission of power by means of fibrous ropes], Wiley, New York, 1895; pages 42-43. Fig. 21 shows part of the jack-shaft.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[Chain drive#Automobiles|chain-drive vehicles]], the term ''jackshaft'' was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth on the inside of the rims of the drive wheels,&lt;ref&gt;The Darling Steam Carriage, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IVMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316 The Horseless Age], Vol. 5, No. 2 (Oct. 11, 1899); page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some New American Steam Carriages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojofAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565 The Motor Car Journal], Vol I, No. 36 (Nov. 10, 1899); page 565.&lt;/ref&gt; or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.&lt;ref&gt;The Grout Steam Tonneau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J0eOQXpW6MEC&amp;pg=PA55 Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal] Vol II, No. 8 (Feb 1, 1902) ;pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the term ''jackshaft'' in the context of railroad equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower.  In his electric-motor driven [[railroad truck]], the motor was geared to a jackshaft mounted between the side frames.  A sliding [[Dog clutch]] inside the jackshaft was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Mower, Electric-Motor Mechanism, {{US patent|450970}}, issued Apr. 21, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using [[side rod]]s; see [[Jackshaft (locomotive)]] for details.
===Countershaft===
The term ''countershaft'' is somewhat older.  In 1828, the term was used to refer to an intermediate horizontal shaft in a [[gristmill]] driven through gearing by the [[waterwheel]] and driving the [[millstones]] through bevel gears.&lt;ref&gt;James Hindman and William Hindman, Improvement in the Grist Mill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaM1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 The American Journal of Improvements in the Useful Arts and Mirror of the Patent Office in the United States], Vol I, No. 3 (July, Aug. and Sept. 1828); page 324.  This reads like a patent application, there is no record of a corresponding patent.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a [[Belt drive|belt]] from the [[line shaft]] and driving the spindle of a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] through additional belts.  The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter [[pulley]]s for speed control.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Willis, Part the Third, Chapter II -- To Alter the Velocity Ratio by Determinate Changes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty84AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 Principles of Mechanism Designed for the Use of Students in the Universities and for Engineering Students Generally], John W. Parker, London, 1841; page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, this definition was given:  "The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line &lt;nowiki&gt;[shaft]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872" /&gt;
;Modern uses
Modern jackshafts and countershafts are often hidden inside large machinery as components of the larger overall device.

[[Image:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|thumb|A PTO Shaft or jackshaft with a protective shield to prevent entanglement.]]
In farm equipment, a spinning output shaft on the rear of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the ''[[power take-off|Power Take-Off]]'' or PTO, and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a ''PTO shaft'', but is also a jackshaft.

==Definitions==
[[Robert J. Sampson|Sampson]] and Bartusch (1998) defined legal cynicism as ""[[anomie]]" about law".&lt;ref name=sb1998/&gt; Based on Sampson &amp; Bartusch's work, and on that of [[Leo Srole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srole |first=Leo |date=1956 |title=Social Integration and Certain Corollaries: An Exploratory Study |jstor=2088422 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=709–716 |doi=10.2307/2088422}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Piquero|Piquero]] et al. (2005) defined it based on respondents' answers to a five-question survey. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank, on a four-point scale, the extent to which they agreed with each of these statements: 
{{blockquote|
# Laws are meant to be broken, 
#It is okay to do anything you want, 
#There are no right or wrong ways to make money, 
#If I have a fight with someone, it is no one else's business, and 
#A person has to live without thinking about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=PIQUERO |first=ALEX R. |last2=FAGAN |first2=JEFFREY |last3=MULVEY |first3=EDWARD P. |last4=STEINBERG |first4=LAURENCE |last5=ODGERS |first5=CANDICE |date=2005-09-01 |title=DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF LEGAL SOCIALIZATION AMONG SERIOUS ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776646/ |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=267–298 |issn=0091-4169 |pmc=2776646 |pmid=19915683}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Causes and correlates==
Legal cynicism can be exacerbated when police engage in aggressive misconduct in a community, which can lead to greater violence and less cooperation between the community's citizens and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/30/13115224/crime-violent-reduce-ferguson-murder-fbi-ucr |title=The surge in violent crime is overblown — but here's how to combat it |last=Abt |first=Thomas |date=2016-09-30 |website=Vox |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be higher in neighborhoods with higher levels of [[concentrated disadvantage]], even after controlling for demographic factors and crime rates.&lt;ref name=sb1998&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sampson |first=Robert J. |last2=Bartusch |first2=Dawn Jeglum |date=1998 |title=Legal Cynicism and (Subcultural?)

'''Lucideon (formerly Ceram)''' is an independent materials development, testing and assurance company based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and in the US. Lucideon owns testing facilities around the world.

==History==
The British Refractories Research Association was formed in 1920. The pottery industry was required by the [[Import Duties Act 1932|Import Duties Advisory Committee]] in 1937 to create a [[research association]], so the British Pottery Research Association was formed in 1937. The two combined in April 1948 as the '''British Ceramic Research Association'''.

The main building on Queens Road in [[Penkhull]] was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in December 1951. In May 1986 it changed its name to British Ceramic Research Ltd, having been incorporated as a company on 18 November 1985.

From the late 1990s the company traded under the abbreviated name Ceram. On 1 February 2014 the company name changed to Lucideon Limited.

==Structure==
Lucideon is situated south of the [[University Hospital of North Staffordshire]].

Lucideon incorporates:
* [https://www.lucideon.com UK Headquarters] - (formerly CERAM Research Ltd)
* [https://www.lucideon.com/assurance Assurance Services] - Lucideon CICS Limited
* [https://www.lucideon.com US Laboratories] - (formerly M+P Labs) based in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]] and offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]

Lucideon's laboratories and techniques are accredited by the [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service]] (UKAS).

==Function==
Lucideon provides materials development, technologies, consultancy and testing and analysis to a diverse range of industries; principally healthcare, construction, ceramics, aerospace, nuclear and power generation.

{{refimprove|date = August 2011}}
The '''mechanical philosophy''' is a [[natural philosophy]] describing the universe as similar to a large-scale mechanism. Mechanical philosophy is associated with the [[scientific revolution]] of [[Early Modern]] Europe. One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published in 1651.

Some [[Intellectual history |intellectual historians]] and [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to [[disenchantment]] and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or [[angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Merchant |first= Carolyn|date= 1990 |title= The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o_l2uMk2KjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Harper Collins |chapter= Chapters 4, 9, 10 |isbn= 0062505955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[Christianity]] and [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | chapter = Chapter 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism and determinism ==
Some ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. This view was closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of "mechanical laws": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a [[determinism]].  If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.

==Development of the mechanical philosophy==
{{details|corpuscularianism}}
The natural philosophers directly concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[René Descartes]]. Also involved were the English thinkers [[Sir Kenelm Digby]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Walter Charleton]]; and the Dutch natural philosopher [[Isaac Beeckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret J. Osler|title=Divine Will and the Mechanical Philosophy: Gassendi and Descartes on Contingency and Necessity in the Created World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtPISpxGacAC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=7 June 2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-52492-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] used "mechanical philosophers" to refer both to those with a theory of "corpuscles" or [[atom]]s of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the [[clockwork universe]] view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and [[Galileo Galilei]]; it would include [[Nicolas Lemery]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of "mechanical philosophy" dates back to 1952 and [[Marie Boas Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Fisher|title=Pierre Gassendi's Philosophy And Science: Atomism for Empiricists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fLSO6y6DhUC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11996-3|pages=205 with note 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the [[Royal Society]]. In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy Porter|author2=Katharine Park|author3=Lorraine Daston|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 July 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57244-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbes and the mechanical philosophy===
One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) by Hobbes (1651); the book's second chapter invokes the [[principle of inertia]], foundational for the mechanical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Patricia Springborg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes's Leviathan |date= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-54521-1 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. [[Richard Westfall]] deems him a mechanical philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sophie. Roux|author2=Daniel Garber|title=The Mechanization of Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USOoK5tRabAC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-4345-8|page=11 note 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental [[physics]] with [[geometry]]; and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Janiak|author2=Eric Schliesser|title=Interpreting Newton: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IskjtmGJoC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76618-0|page=34 with note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and the mechanical philosophy===
Descartes was also a mechanist. A [[substance dualist]], he argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

===Beeckman and the mechanical philosophy===
Isaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books ''Centuria'' and ''Journal'' is grounded in two components: matter and motion.  To explain matter, Beeckman relied on  atomism philosophy which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life.  To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkel|first=Klaas|date=2013|title=Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion : Mechanical Philosophy in the Making|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3318707.|journal=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=|pages=76-77|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton and the mechanical philosophy===
[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies|his occult research]] have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]].

==The mechanist thesis==
The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

'''''Myths to Live By''''' is a 1972 book, a collection of essays, originally given as lectures at the [[Cooper Union]] Forum, by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] between 1958 and 1971. The work has an introduction by Johnson E. Fairchild.

The deep power of [[mythology|myth]] on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages (including our own age) is the common theme running throughout all of the essays in the collection. Campbell explains the differences between western and oriental myths and rites. He shows how fundamental universal thoughts are adapted to local requirements of legitimation. A typical form of adaptation of the ''hero'' is the American image of the ''lone rider'' who dispels evil.&lt;ref&gt;Edition London 1985, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The New Mobility Agenda''' is an international institution which, although a virtual and open collaborative project today, was originally set up by an international working group meeting at the [[Royaumont Abbey|Abbey de Royaumont]] near [[Paris]] in 1974 with the support of the Parisian [[OECD]] to challenge old ideas and practices in the field of urban transport through a long term collaborative program of information exchange, education and peer support. The Agenda today draws together the experience, expertise and support of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide in an open collaborative peer network. One of the original proponents of this approach, Professor [[Mikoto Usui]] then director of the OECD Development Centre, referred to it in the founding meeting at the "Abbé de Royaumont as an "invisible college".  Drawing together the experience and expertise of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide, who are networked via a combination of websites, discussion groups and fora, and collaborative projects, the Agenda takes an approach to transportation planning, policy and practice that has gained considerable force over the last two decades—provides a leading-edge alternative to earlier (20th century) methods of looking at and providing mobility for people and goods in cities.  The Agenda has received prestigious awards for its contributions, including the [[Stockholm Environment Challenge Prize]] (2000) and the [[World Technology Environment Award]] (2002).

Like the [[sustainable transportation]] movement,  to which it is closely related, it differs from previous methods (which in fact still dominate planning, policy, investment and operations in most parts of the world) in that it takes a global or broad [[systemic approach]] to the challenges of how to get around in cities, and is especially sensitive not only to pure transport efficiency (which traditionally is interpreted in pure engineering terms as speed and volume of vehicle throughput) but equally to matters of [[sustainable development]], [[pollution]] and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]]—including matters relating to [[climate change]], the reduction of [[Greenhouse gas]]es, [[resource efficiency]], [[energy conservation]], [[public health]], both personal and public economics, overall [[time saving]]s, [[public spaces]], and [[quality of life]] in communities, including relations between people in public spaces – with particular attention to [[social justice]] and the unmet needs of women, children, and others with mobility or economic or health disadvantages which are not being properly served in our present mainly [[car-based systems]] and thinking, in which other forms of transport, including  [[public transport]], play only residual roles.

== New Mobility vs. Sustainable Transportation ==
These two are closely related but not identical concepts. The term "[[Sustainable Transportation]]" had it origins in the mid-eighties and has developed over time and for the most part with particular emphasis on informing transport and environmental policy, with support from a number of university programs, NGOs and from some international and government organizations. By contrast the term New Mobility Agenda takes the issues of sustainable transportation the other way around: by emphasizing the supply side—and specifically targets projects and programs which demonstrate and achieve the basic principles behind sustainable transportation.

== Targeted near-term improvements ==
A distinguishing aspect of the new mobility approach is its emphasis on the importance of targeted near-term improvements. It does not give up at all on long term thinking, but in response to what are increasingly understood to be unacceptable levels of pressure coming from current transportation arrangements, and the speed with which this degradation is taking place, there is a growing consensus that projects and measures should be targeting substantial improvements within a period of two or four years.  In most places this also coincides with the electoral terms of those in office, thus giving those elected an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to more sustainable transportation arrangements.

== New Mobility and New Urbanism ==
These two movements share a common base of concern about the importance of bringing new approaches to the manner in which we structure our cities.   Both key on facilitating the move to more economically and environmentally efficient higher density communities.  Collaboration between the two independent programs is just getting underway

== In Brief ==
The New Mobility Agenda looks for and coordinates a complex ''bouquet'' of overlapping mobility services in an attempt to offer a high quality multi-level alternative – or complement – to the mostly car-based transport system of the city. Services most often incorporated into this multi-level alternative transport system include: [[Travel avoidance]], [[land use planning]], [[mixed use]], [[Transportation Demand Management]], [[Telecommuting]], [[Telework]], [[e-work]], [[Public space]] management, [[Shared space]], [[Human-powered transport]], [[Walking]] and [[Walkability]] , [[Pedestrianization]], [[Promenadology]], [[Traffic Calming]], [[Cycling]], [[public bicycle systems]], [[utility cycling]], [[public transit priority systems]], [[Bus rapid transit]], [[Car diets/reduction plans]],  [[HOV]], [[Intelligent transportation system]], LOV ([[Low-Occupancy Vehicle]]), [[Park and ride]], [[Parking]], [[Road diets]], [[Single-occupancy vehicle|SOV]], [[Single Occupancy Vehicle]], [[Toll roads]],   [[Car rental]] , [[Car Free Days]], [[Carpooling]], [[Carsharing]],  [[flexible working]], [[flextime]], [[Hitch-hiking]],   [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]], [[Midibus]], [[Mini-bus]], [[xTransit]],   [[Public transport]], [[Ride sharing]], [[economic instruments]], [[Congestion charging]], [[road pricing]], [[Full cost pricing]],  [[Roller skating]], [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks]], [[Share taxi]]s, [[Taxicab]],  [[Vanpooling]].

The individual components of ‘new mobility’, transportation modes and policies including those listed just above, are in generally broadly well understood and defined, at least at the leading edge. But what makes the whole an "agenda" stems from the fact that new mobility policies are based on the development and orchestration of extensive packages of measures which need to be brought on line over time and as experience and demonstrated competence with these new approaches develops. Hence the totality is referred to as an "agenda"

Continental Europe is leading the way in understanding and implementing the New Mobility Agenda, and the increasingly higher quality of their transportation systems performance and their life quality and environmental impacts are immediately visible to both visitors and those who live there.  German, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian, Danish, and increasingly the cities of France, Belgium, Northern Italy, and the rest of Scandinavia are joining in the new mobility/quality of life sweepstakes, driven as much by pride and strong local leadership as by purely negative factors (those these are many and important movers as well). A process has been engaged in Europe which other parts of the world are looking at and starting to emulate: cities increasingly looking at themselves and each other scanning for good ideas that they can take home and adapt for their communities.  This is thus an example of a virtuous spiral.  The [[European Commission]] has played an important supporting role in this process.

== Terminology ==
To appreciate fully what "[[new mobility]]" means, it is useful to see how it differs from "Old Mobility" (often defined as being stuck in traffic, waiting in the rain for a bus that may never come, or paying large amounts of taxpayer dollars for "improvements" that ultimately find us still late for work or waiting for that bus. (See the multi-media presentation of  A Day In The Life of New Mobility for one characterization of how it might look in day-to-day life in one city.)

What we now call  "old mobility’ thinking and practice is in effect the dominant paradigm of 20th century visions and practices. It is/was essentially oriented to the search for engineering, technological and infrastructural solutions for increasing speed and throughput capacity in specific links and at key points (including bottlenecks). The old mobility paradigm was one that has been characterized as "forecast (growth) and build".  Old mobility solutions more often than not cost a lot of money, and created a broadly shared mind-set in which the main limit to providing for yet further capacity increases within the system was constrained only by funding limitations from public sources. The old system was and is essentially hierarchical and "expert oriented and controlled". It is still dominant in many cities and parts of the world today.

(Since this entry is still in progress, here is an attempt to characterize the present arrangements and constraints that form it very broadly. By understanding these – if (a) true and (b) really a problem – we have a base for fine-tuning our proposed new solutions.  So, here is how old mobility looks from the specific vantage of the proponents of the New Mobility Agenda:

# Based on an essentially closed system (looking at "transport" in isolation from the rest)
# Hierarchical
# Top-down
# Centralized
# Statistics based (historical)
# Bounded
# Reductive
# End-state solution oriented
# Authoritarian
# Supply oriented
# Oriented to maximizing vehicle throughput and speeds
# Expert based
# Engineering-based (i.e., working "within the box", but with high technical competence)
# Binary: i.e., either "private" (i.e., car-based) or "public" transport (and nothing of importance in between)
# De facto car-based
# Costly to the community (unnecessarily)
# Costly to individuals (unnecessarily)
# Resource intensive (unnecessarily)
# Total dependence on costly imported fossil fuels (unnecessarily)
# Highly polluting
# Massive public health menace
# Destroys urban fabric
# Hardware and build solutions, technology oriented
# Treats ex-car solutions as (very!) poor cousins
# Offers poor service/economic package to elderly, handicapped, poor and young
# Sharp divide between planning, policy and operations
# Obscure (to the public) decision making processes
# Focuses on bottlenecks impeding traffic flows (i.e., builds for &gt; traffic)
# Attempts to anticipate them and build to forestall
# Searches for large projects to "solve" the problems
# These large projects and the substantial amounts involved often lead to corruption and waste of public moneys
# Still too much separation from underlying land use realities.
# Inadequate attention to transportation substitutes or complements
# Increasingly technical and tool oriented (this to the good)
# Anachronistic,
# Not doing the job that we need in 2005 and beyond!, and finally and worst of all. . .
# Creates a climate of passive citizenry and thus undermines participatory democracy and collective involvement and problem solving

The heart of new mobility policy by contrast is [[systemic complexity]], diversity, participation, wide outreach and a wide array of [[partnerships]] and other forms of synergistic interaction and collaboration.  It more often involves the orchestration of a large number of measures and policies, many of which often very small in themselves, in order to provide a dispersed modern city encompassing many different types of people and mobility needs – as opposed to the "big solution" approaches often favored in the past (whether major highway or [[road building]] or extensions, new [[Rapid transit]] ([[metros]], [[Subway (rail)|subways]] or other expensive [[rail systems]], massive central parking structures, and the like).  The goal of the planners and authorities changes radically with this new paradigm, such that rather than "solving problems" with centrally planned and executed engineering and measurement; they start to get more involved in multi-level complex problem-solving, which brings them to such quite different kinds of approaches such as community outreach and orchestration of services and the participation of a much larger number of actors and players.

The New Mobility Agenda addresses the issues on both the supply and demand sides. It thus combines Transportation Demand Management [[Transportation Demand Management|TDM]] strategies and measures for containing, channeling and limiting wasteful and encumbering private car traffic in cities, with coordinated support of a wide "bouquet" of alternative transportation arrangements.  These include various forms of [[Human-powered transport]], [[utility cycling]], [[walking]], [[public space]] improvement, electronic substitutes for travel (such as [[telework]], [[telecommuting]] or [[e-work]]) and a variety of shared and [[public transport]] strategies, new and old, including [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicles), [[carpooling]], [[ride sharing]], [[car rentals]], [[taxicab]], [[Share taxi]], [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]]s, and the list goes on (see long list of modes and component parts in '''Internal Links''' below).

== History ==
What is today known as the New Mobility Agenda has had many antecedents and both before and since has proceeded in many places and on many fronts as [[traffic congestion]] and more generally the weight and poor performance—environmental, economic, social, and destruction of urban fabric—of the old, mainly car-based mobility system has increasingly made itself felt in city after city around the world.  Unsurprisingly the worst problems we are seeing today are in the cities of the developing countries, and most of all in their megacities – in most of which the old mobility thinking continues to carry the day in policy and investment circles who are proving slow to adjust. Over the last two decades this movement has steadily gained force to the point where  a growing array of programs and authorities are coming together in an attempt to create more balanced transportation systems, better equipped for dealing with the highly diverse mobility needs of people of all social and economic classes in the 21st century. (See references below for some of these.)

The '''New Mobility Agenda''' provides an example of a focused, international [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Network]] applied to the challenges of transport in cities. And while its antecedents are as old as the first time anyone got stuck in traffic and wondered about how things might be better organized, the actual "New Mobility Agenda" by that name was formally kicked off in 1996 during the [[OECD]] International Conference in [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]] (24–27 March 1996) under the title ''Towards Sustainable Transportation''.

In the wake of the 1996 ''Towards Sustainable Transportation'' conference, two things happened immediately which started to give concrete expression to this new movement.

* Working in cooperation with the [[OECD]]'s program [[EST – Environmentally Sustainable Transportation]] program a long-standing open expert forum organized on the topic area under [[The Commons: Open Society Sustainability Initiative]] in 1974 decided to relaunch their existing STEP program (Sustainable Transportation Emergency Program) with the name ''New Mobility Agenda''.  This program and its extensions today  bring together more than four thousand international experts and activists working in this area, and is guided by an  International Advisory Council. These individuals and groups are at work to develop a common frame of information and understanding mediated by a collection of exchange mechanisms, including a whole series of web sites, blogs, newsgroups, and periodic conferences, both physical and using the latest low cost video and voice conferencing techniques.
* In parallel the City of [[Toronto]] launched a program, Moving the Economy with an explicit  "New Mobility" Strategy, which continues to be active.  The City has also created its own New Mobility HUB Network, which is supported by a New Mobility HUB Survey which can be usefully applied with only minor adaptations to any other community.

== Collaborative New Mobility city projects, 1 Sept. 2007 update ==

Recent collaborative projects that are presently (early 2007) getting considerable attention in specialist and policy circles around the world, include the relaunching of the Journal of World Transport Policy and Practice include the continuation of the [[Toronto]] (Canada) New Mobility Hub regional network and their latest Seamless Link program. In parallel the open group has launched the New Mobility Advisory/Briefs program which is aimed specifically to engage mayors and city leaders to give more attention to low cost remedial measures and projects offering near term relief. The Agenda has also recently created a handful of open video libraries which can be accessed via ''New Mobility Video Library.''

The New Mobility program is in its work supporting the 1 August 2006 call of  the Clinton Climate Initiative for 80% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions in cities over the next ten – fifteen years.  While not affiliated with the Clinton project, that is primarily looking at technology-based reforms in the largest world cities, the New Mobility program is concentrating on strategies to bring about major institutional  reforms and a massive repartitioning of the transportation arrangements of cities of all sizes, including in the high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sprawl areas that surround center cites.

The following cities are currently looking at eventual New Mobility projects and strategies: Paris, Stuttgart, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Vancouver, Santa Barbara (CA).

New Mobility is based on a "bouquet" of arrangements and services which in place after place seeks to find the right mix of the following:

=== Supply (New Mobility Building Blocks) ===
One point that needs to be made concerning these building blocks, is that in any given city these will involve at least ''hundreds'' of coordinated actions, many of which carried out by or requiring the active support of groups outside of the traditional public and transport sector.

A '''nickel sulfide inclusion''', (also abbreviated to NiS), occurs during the process of manufacturing [[float glass]] (normal window glass).

==Occurrence==
In a batch of [[glass]], contaminants that contain [[nickel]] might be present, (e.g. [[stainless steel]].) 
These can combine with [[sulfur]] to form [[nickel sulfide]] inclusions. [[Furnaces]] produce hundreds of tons of glass every day, so it is difficult to completely eliminate any contaminants. This causes a problem later in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name="NiS and spontaneous breakage"&gt;[http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/96/ NiS and spontaneous breakage]&lt;/ref&gt;

While total elimination is difficult, specific controlled processes can significantly reduce the formation of NiS in the float glass.  These are actions taken by US flat glass manufacturers supplying to the automotive industry in the early 1990s:
a) all green sand (silica, transported by railroads from Wyoming USA) shipments were processed through multiple screens (to filter out any nickel bearing materials either mineral or stainless steel tools, nuts, bolts, washers) since stainless steel cannot be detected by magnets.
b) all other bulk materials including recycled glass were inspected similarly to (a).
c) every maintenance procedure and all training was very focused on the need for every worker to prevent contamination of the float furnace or the float glass tank with NiS.
d) use of any nickel containing tool or material anywhere in the Ford Glass float facility was closely controlled to prevent contamination.
e) any float glass suspected to have NiS (it could only be found with a Scanning Electron Microscope) was destroyed and landfilled as it could not be re-introduced to glass used for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Experience of Ronald A. Hayes while Purchasing Facilitator at AP Technoglass in Elizabethtown Kentucky from 1989 to 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of tempering [[float glass]] can cause a NiS to change from its normal state (known as a low-temperature structure) to a different high-temperature, [[crystalline structure]]. When the [[glass]] is cooled quickly (as part of the process) the NiS particle is unable to change back to its original form. 
Over a certain period of time NiS will slowly convert to the original low temperature structure. This means the NiS increases in size, and the [[mechanical stress]]es caused by this cause the tempered pane to shatter, for no apparent reason (hence [[spontaneous glass breakage]]).&lt;ref name="NiS and spontaneous breakage"/&gt;

'''Pepperwood Preserve''' is a 3,117 acre plot of land owned by the Pepperwood Foundation, located in the [[Mayacamas Mountains]] in the coast ranges of California near the towns of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] and [[Healdsburg]] in [[Sonoma County]]. The preserve includes the headwaters of Mark West Creek, Franz Creek, and Brooks Creek all of which feed into the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]]. The highest point on the preserve is 1,560 feet.

==Management==

The [[California Academy of Science]] sold the preserve in 2005 to Healdsburg residents Herb and Jane Dwight, who sit on the five-member Pepperwood Foundation board of directors and have donated over $20 million for land and facilities at the preserve.  Herb Dwight is the former CEO of Optical Coating Laboratory in Santa Rosa.  The facilities include a $9 million, 9,400 square foot, solar-powered center for environmental research and education.  The preserve has an agreement with [[Santa Rosa Junior College and Sonoma State University]] to use the site for field studies.  Lisa Micheli, with a Ph.D. in geomorphology, was hired as executive director in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Climate==
Pepperwood has a Mediterranean climate that includes cool wet winters (Nov-Apr) and hot dry summers (May-Oct). Streams are intermittent. During the wet winter, standing water can be found in numerous small ponds.

==Geological history==
Pepperwood's geology is complex with exposures of Glen Ellen sediments, Sonoma volcanics and Franciscan metamorphics. There are several areas with serpentine soils.

==Vegetation==
Pepperwood includes redwood and Douglas-fir forests on mesic sites and grassland, woodland, and chaparral on xeric sites. Wetlands are composed of riparian forests, springs, marshes, ponds, and vernal pools.

The '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia''' is being pursued at local and state/territory level rather than nationally, with [[plastic bag]] bans implemented or pending in all [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] except [[New South Wales]]. Environmental groups have expressed their concern that [[Australia]] was lagging other countries in the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], including Botswana, Somalia and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="cormack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Australia falling behind third world on global map of plastic bag bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/australia-falling-behind-third-world-on-global-map-of-plastic-bag-bans-20160407-go18ec.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was estimated that of the 5 billion plastic bags used annually by Australians, 150 million ended up as litter.&lt;ref name="cormack" /&gt;

In 2003 the [[Tasmania]]n town of [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] announced the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to [[cost of living]] concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.&lt;ref name="abc-2008-garrett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garrett calls time on plastic bags|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-10/garrett-calls-time-on-plastic-bags/1008452|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2008|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Battle to bag the plastic goes on|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/battle-to-bag-the-plastic-goes-on-20081226-75l4.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.&lt;ref name="2010-tas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darby|first1=Andrew|title=Ban on plastic bags spreads to Tasmania|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/ban-on-plastic-bags-spreads-to-tasmania-20101111-17pgm.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to the first statewide lightweight bag ban being introduced in October 2008. It is estimated that this move has saved 400 million bags annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent jurisdiction to announce a ban on plastic bags is [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to commence on a date to be announced in early 2018.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban" /&gt;

Since 2018, the country's two largest supermarket chains, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], voluntarily removed free lightweight plastic bags from their stores and began charging for reusable bags instead.&lt;ref name="coles-woolies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out single-use plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/14/woolworths-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-bags-over-12-months|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reusable bags are sold at 15 cents in both chains.

In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004&lt;ref name="bag problems"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecorecycle.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Plastic_Bag_Free_Challenge_-_Factsheet.pdf| title=Plastic Bag Fact Sheet | date=9 November 2005| publisher=Sustainability Victoria| accessdate=1 July 2012|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; According to [[Keep Australia Beautiful]]'s 2015-16 National Litter Index, plastic bags made up 1% of the country's litter.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Trevor |title=In banning plastic bags we need to make sure we're not creating new problems |url=https://theconversation.com/in-banning-plastic-bags-we-need-to-make-sure-were-not-creating-new-problems-81253 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=21 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notreadysbs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Natasha |title=Why Australia may not be ready to ban plastic bags |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-australia-may-not-be-ready-to-ban-plastic-bags |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=SBS News |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and [[Clean Up Australia]] launched a [[Change.org]] petition for the premiers of the three states without plastic bag bans - Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia - to "ban the bag".&lt;ref name="banthebag-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waleed Aly calls for nationwide ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/ban-the-bag-waleed-aly-calls-on-three-australian-premiers-to-ban-plastic-bags/news-story/7d8b5b5944bf7ec77fc6791380f15531|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a segment on ''The Project'' about the petition, #BanTheBag became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="banthebag-news" /&gt; In February 2018, a motion was put in the Australian Federal Parliament calling for a nationwide ban of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/8f8fb221-5f56-4e53-b69a-e109f7156d20/0473/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf|title=Plastic bag ban motion in Federal Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate inquiries into recycling and marine plastic pollution also led to tripartisan recommendations by the Liberal, Labor and Greens parties to ban all single-use plastics in the country by 2023 and for all states and territories to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref name="zhou-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhou |first1=Naaman |title=All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cormack-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cormack |first1=Lucy |title=Plastic bag ban among recommendations by marine plastic senate inquiry |url=https://www.smh.com.au/environment/plastic-bag-ban-among-recommendations-by-marine-plastic-senate-inquiry-20160420-gob2lb.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 April 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Australia===
The ''Plastic Shopping Bags (Waste Avoidance) Bill'' passed the [[Parliament of South Australia]] on 13 November 2008, with a transitional period of 1 January to 4 May 2009.&lt;ref name="GLM-SA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Melanie|title=South Australia bans plastic shopping bags|url=http://www.greenlifestylemag.com.au/news/427/south-australia-bans-plastic-shopping-bags|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=G-Online|publisher=Green Lifestyle Magazine|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an official start date of 4 May 2009, South Australia was the first state or territory in Australia to ban plastic bags at the checkout, with retailers facing fines of up to $5,000 for distributing banned bags and retailer suppliers fined up to $20,000.&lt;ref name="sa20k"&gt;{{cite news|title=$20,000 for the wrong shopping bag|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/for-the-wrong-shopping-bag/news-story/1cc21937d58709af7c2870cdc4031c8d|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban does not extend to heavier plastic bags or fruit and vegetable bags.&lt;ref name="sa20k"/&gt;

Two attempts by the [[City of Fremantle]] in 2013 and 2015 to introduce a citywide plastic bag ban were blocked through disallowance motions moved in the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagi|first1=Jacon|title=Fremantle plastic bag ban binned again in WA Parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-14/fremantle-plastic-bag-bag-blocked-by-state-parliament-again/6852518|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 October 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Western Australian Government announced it would commence a statewide plastic bag ban on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="abc-wa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trigger|first1=Rebecca|title=How will WA's plastic bag ban work?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-12/plastic-bag-ban-announced-in-wa-but-how-will-it-work/8895770|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa-toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA to ban plastic bags next year|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/environment/wa-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year-ng-s-1772065|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The West Australian|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In mid-2017, Victoria's state government expressed its preference for a national ban, while confirming it would be open to a state-level ban in future.&lt;ref name="vic-fed-alone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Daniel Andrews]] stated that Victoria would introduce a ban on plastic bags, with the start date to be announced in early 2018 after consultation with industry and the community.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preiss|first1=Benjamin|title=Lightweight plastic bags to be banned in Victoria|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lightweight-plastic-bags-to-be-banned-in-victoria-20171017-gz2s4i.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Age|agency=Fairfax Media|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation-vic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Trevor|title=Victoria's plastic bag ban: a good start, but we can do more|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-plastic-bag-ban-a-good-start-but-we-can-do-more-86149|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government subsequently announced the plastic bag ban would commence by late 2019.&lt;ref name="theage-vic2019date"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cunningham |first1=Melissa |last2=Preiss |first2=Benjamin |title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags by next year |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-by-next-year-20180627-p4znxv.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government currently has no plans to introduce a ban. In 2017 Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] stated that no regulation was needed because retailers responsible for 80% of plastic bags in the state (Coles, Woolworths and [[Harris Farm Markets|Harris Farm]]) would voluntarily stop providing free plastic bags themselves.&lt;ref name="nsw-not-needed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Plastic bag ban across NSW not needed if supermarkets act themselves: Premier|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/plastic-bag-ban-across-nsw-not-needed-if-supermarkets-act-themselves-premier-20170724-gxhfbx.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the country's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that they would stop providing free plastic bags to customers nationwide in 2018, and would sell thicker plastic bags for 15 cents each.&lt;ref name="ww-coles-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dulaney |first1=Michael |title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out plastic bags around the country |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-14/woolworths-to-phase-out-plastic-bags-around-the-country/8709336 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing free bags is expected to save the retailers $170 million per year in reduced packaging costs while creating a revenue stream from selling thicker plastic bags.&lt;ref name="windfall" /&gt;

==Alternatives to plastic bags==
A side-effect of the plastic bag ban observed in South Australia was the increased use of [[bin bag|bin liners]], which have a greater environmental impact than plastic bags as they do not break down well in modern landfills.&lt;ref name="binliner2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Plastic bag ban: 'You don't actually need a plastic bin liner to put your rubbish out'|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/plastic-bag-ban-you-dont-actually-need-a-plastic-bin-liner-to-put-your-rubbish-out/news-story/629abba62ae7d5174208ca36d43615f2|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=News.com.au|agency=NewsCorp Australia|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally-friendly alternatives suggested instead of bin liners include [[composting]] food scraps and using free [[community newspaper]]s as liners instead.&lt;ref name="binliner2017" /&gt;

A 2007 report into shopping bag alternatives&lt;ref name=2007report&gt;{{cite report | last= Dili | first= Rae | date = 18 April 2007 | title = Comparison of existing life cycle analysis of shopping bag alternatives: Final Report | url = http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/upload/resources/publications/plastic-bag-phase-out/LCA_shopping_bags_full_report%5B2%5D_2.pdf | publisher = Sustainability Victoria | format = PDF | access-date = 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that paper bags were less environmentally friendly than plastic bags due to a higher [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="wired-adler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Ben|title=Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right?

Concern has been expressed about potential unintended adverse health outcomes associated with the plastic bag ban rollout due to the lack of care by consumers in maintaining alternative shopping bags in a clean and healthy condition.  Overseas experiences in locations such as [[San Francisco]], where increased illness and even deaths were reported in the aftermath of similar bans to those in Australian states, suggest that this is a real concern.&lt;ref name="health-outcomes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study links plastic bag ban with increase in food-related deaths|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/study-links-plastic-bag-ban-with-increase-in-foodrelated-deaths-20130208-2e2zf.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Canberra Times|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MaiNessun.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of a vocal score ([[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Turandot]]'').]]
A '''vocal score''' or '''piano-vocal score''' is a [[Sheet music|music score]] of an [[opera]], or a [[vocal]] or [[choral]] composition written for [[orchestra]]l accompaniment, such as an [[oratorio]] or [[cantata]]. In a piano-vocal score, the vocal parts are written out in full, but the [[accompaniment]] is reduced and adapted for keyboard (usually piano). The music is usually reduced to two [[staff (music)|staves]]; however, more staves, a second keyboardist ([[Piano four hands|piano-four-hands]]), or a second keyboard part can be added, as needed. 

There are two main types of piano-vocal scores. The first kind consists of those scores created by a composer in the process of composing, usually as a harmonic map or "sketch" of the piece to be later [[orchestration|orchestrated]]. The second category includes scores that are arrangements or transcriptions made after the completion of the work, usually by someone other than the composer. 

Piano-vocal scores are generally created to enable a conductor or choir leader to rehearse the singers with a piano accompanist before the choir begins rehearsals with the orchestra. The cost of rehearsing with a professional orchestra is so high that choirs typically hold a number of rehearsals with piano accompaniment to prepare the choir, as the cost of hiring a single piano accompanist is much lower than hiring 50-100 orchestral musicians. 

Piano-vocal scores are also used by music students, singers and conductors to study the compositional structure of the score. Before the widespread availability of sound recordings, piano-vocal scores were also sold for amateur home performance or small-scale professional performance of the piece, where a full orchestra would not be feasible from an economic or performance space perspective.

== Piano-conductor scores ==

While piano-vocal scores tend to consist of the vocal lines and a [[Reduction (music)|piano reduction]] of the whole orchestra onto two staves, '''piano-conductor scores''' tend to consist of the vocal lines and one of the orchestral piano parts that already exists, coupled with another staff containing the rest of the orchestral reduction (in contrast to a piano-vocal score, where the piano and other orchestral parts cannot be easily separated at sight). In a piano-conductor score, orchestral part entries are usually visibly tagged in the third staff.

While piano-vocal scores provide a full accompaniment for rehearsals, reduced performances, etc., piano-conductor scores give the conductor a more direct view of the activity of the orchestra, without being as complex as a full orchestral score. This is especially relevant when the conductor is conducting not from the podium, but from the piano while playing the indicated piano part (often seen in [[musical theatre]] orchestras).

{{political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology}}
'''Political anthropology''' concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. 

==History of political anthropology==
===Origins===
Political anthropology has its roots in the 19th century. At that time, thinkers such as [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and [[Sir Henry Maine]] tried to trace the evolution of human society from 'primitive' or 'savage' societies to more 'advanced' ones. These early approaches were ethnocentric, speculative, and often racist. Nevertheless, they laid the basis for political anthropology by undertaking a modern study inspired by modern science, and in particular Darwin. In a move that would be influential for future anthropology, they focused on [[kinship]] as the key to understanding political organization, and emphasized the role of the 'gens' or lineage as an object of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewellen|first=Ted|title=Political Anthropology: An Introduction|year=1983|publisher=Bergin and Garvey|location=Boston, MA|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political anthropology can be traced back to the 1940 publication ''[[African Political Systems]]'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] and [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]. They rejected the speculative historical reconstruction of earlier authors and argued that "a scientific study of political institutions must be inductive and comparative and aim solely at establishing and explaining the uniformities found among them and their interdependencies with other features of social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortes|first=Meyer|title=African Political Systems|year=1940|publisher=Keegan Paul International|location=London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]: to classify societies into a small number of discrete categories, and then compare them in order to make generalizations about them. The contributors of this book were influenced by [[Radcliffe-Brown]] and [[structural functionalism]]. As a result, they assumed that all societies were well-defined entities which sought to maintain their equilibrium and social order. Although the authors recognized that "Most of these societies have been conquered or have submitted to European rule from fear of invasion. They would not acquiesce in it if the threat of force were withdrawn; and this fact determines the part now played in their political life by European administration"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortes|year=1940|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors in the volume tended in practice to examine African political systems in terms of their own internal structures, and ignored the broader historical and political context of colonialism.

Several authors reacted to this early work. In his work ''Political Systems of Highland Burma'' (1954) [[Edmund Leach]] argued that it was necessary to understand how societies changed through time rather than remaining static and in equilibrium. A special version of conflict oriented political anthropology was developed in the so-called ‘Manchester school’, started by [[Max Gluckman]]. Gluckman focused on social process and an analysis of structures and systems based on their relative stability. In his view, conflict maintained the stability of political systems through the establishment and re-establishment of crosscutting ties among social actors. Gluckman even suggested that a certain degree of conflict was necessary to uphold society, and that conflict was constitutive of social and political order.

By the 1960s this transition work developed into a full-fledged subdiscipline which was canonized in volumes such as ''Political Anthropology'' (1966) edited by [[Victor Turner]] and [[Marc Swartz]]. By the late 1960s, political anthropology was a flourishing subfield: in 1969 there were two hundred anthropologists listing the subdicipline as one of their areas of interests, and a quarter of all British anthropologists listed politics as a topic that they studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Joan|title=Anthropology and Politics|year=1990|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political anthropology developed in a very different way in the United States. There, authors such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of Morgan, and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

From the 1960s a ‘process approach’ developed, stressing the role of agents (Bailey 1969; Barth 1969). It was a meaningful development as anthropologists started to work in situations where the colonial system was dismantling. The focus on conflict and social reproduction was carried over into Marxist approaches that came to dominate French political anthropology from the 1960s. [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s work on the Kabyle (1977) was strongly inspired by this development, and his early work was a marriage between French post-structuralism, Marxism and process approach.

Interest in anthropology grew in the 1970s. A session on anthropology was organized at the Ninth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in 1973, the proceedings of which were eventually published in 1979 as ''Political Anthropology: The State of the Art''. A newsletter was created shortly thereafter, which developed over time into the journal ''[http://polarjournal.org/ PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review]''.

===Anthropology as a discipline concerned with states and their institutions===
While for a whole century (1860 to 1960 roughly) political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more “complex” social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. This was not the result of a sudden development or any sudden “discovery” of contextuality. From the 1950s anthropologists who studied peasant societies in Latin America and Asia, had increasingly started to incorporate their local setting (the village) into its larger context, as in Redfield’s famous distinction between ‘small’ and ‘big’ traditions (Redfield 1941). The 1970s also witnessed the emergence of Europe as a category of anthropological investigation. Boissevain’s essay, “towards an anthropology of Europe” (Boissevain and Friedl 1975) was perhaps the first systematic attempt to launch a comparative study of cultural forms in Europe; an anthropology not only carried out in Europe, but an anthropology of Europe.

The turn toward the study of complex society made anthropology inherently more political. First, it was no longer possible to carry out fieldwork in say, Spain, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Algeria or India without taking into account the way in which all aspects of local society were tied to state and market. It is true that early ethnographies in Europe had sometimes done just that: carried out fieldwork in villages of Southern Europe, as if they were isolated units or ‘islands’. However, from the 1970s that tendency was openly criticised, and Jeremy Boissevain (Boissevain and Friedl 1975) said it most clearly: anthropologists had “tribalised Europe” and if they wanted to produce relevant ethnography they could no longer afford to do so. Contrary to what is often heard from colleagues in the political and social sciences, anthropologists have for nearly half a century been very careful to link their ethnographic focus to wider social, economic and political structures. This does not mean to abandon an ethnographic focus on very local phenomena, the care for detail.

In a more direct way, the turn towards complex society also signified that political themes increasingly were taken up as the main focus of study, and at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz’s comparative work on the Balinese state is an early, famous example. There is today a rich canon of anthropological studies of the state (see for example Abeles 1990). Hastings Donnan, Thomas Wilson and others started in the early 1990s a productive subfield, an “anthropology of borders”, which addresses the ways in which state borders affect local populations, and how people from border areas shape and direct state discourse and state formation (see for example Alvarez, 1996; Thomassen, 1996; Vereni, 1996; Donnan and Wilson, 1994; 1999; 2003).

From the 1980s a heavy focus on ethnicity and nationalism developed. ‘Identity’ and ‘identity politics’ soon became defining themes of the discipline, partially replacing earlier focus on kinship and social organization. This made anthropology even more obviously political. Nationalism is to some extent simply state-produced culture, and to be studied as such. And ethnicity is to some extent simply the political organization of cultural difference (Barth 1969). Benedict Anderson’s book ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' discusses why nationalism came into being. He sees the invention of the printing press as the main spark, enabling shared national emotions, characteristics, events and history to be imagined through common readership of newspapers.

The interest in cultural/political identity construction also went beyond the nation-state dimension. By now, several ethnographies have been carried out in the international organizations (like the EU) studying the ''fonctionnaires'' as a cultural group with special codes of conduct, dressing, interaction etc. (Abélès, 1992; Wright, 1994; Bellier, 1995; Zabusky, 1995; MacDonald, 1996; Rhodes, ‘t Hart, and Noordegraaf, 2007). Increasingly, anthropological fieldwork is today carried out inside bureaucratic structures or in companies. And bureaucracy can in fact only be studied by living in it – it is far from the rational system we and the practitioners like to think, as Weber himself had indeed pointed out long ago (Herzfeld 1992&lt;ref&gt;Herzfeld is also one of the few anthropologists who has analysed political elections. This is still a relatively neglected field of enquiry, despite the evident fact that it is exactly during election campaigns that alliances and local strategies of power come to the fore (see for example Spencer 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;).

The concern with political institutions has also fostered a focus on institutionally driven political agency. There is now an anthropology of policy making (Shore and Wright 1997). This focus has been most evident in [[Development anthropology]] or the [[anthropology of development]], which over the last decades has established as one of the discipline’s largest subfields. Political actors like states, governmental institutions, NGOs, International Organizations or business corporations are here the primary subjects of analysis. In their ethnographic work anthropologists have cast a critical eye on discourses and practices produced by institutional agents of development in their encounter with ‘local culture’ (see for example Ferguson 1994). Development anthropology is tied to global [[Political Economy in anthropology|political economy]] and [[economic anthropology]] as it concerns the management and redistribution of both ideational and real resources (see for example Hart 1982). In this vein, Escobar (1995) famously argued that international development largely helped to reproduce the former colonial power structures.

Many other themes have over the last two decades been opened up which, taken together, are making anthropology increasingly political: [[post-colonialism]], post-communism, gender, multiculturalism, migration, not to forget the umbrella term of globalization. It thus makes sense to say that while anthropology was always to some extent about politics, this is even more evidently the case today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

The '''Russian and Eurasian Security Network (RES)''' was an open-source service that encouraged the exchange of information among [[international relations]] and security professionals worldwide. It maintained a large digital library of documents related to Russia and Eurasia and provided the framework for studies of security-related developments in Russia and the states of the Eurasian region ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]).

It was based at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] and was part of the [[International Relations and Security Network]] (ISN) and the [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]]. The RES website was closed down in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;ISN website,[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Communities-and-Partners/Partner-Network/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=44522 Communities and Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two RES in-house publications were migrated to the website of the Center for Security Studies:  

*The '''Russian Analytical Digest''', an electronic journal covering political, economic and social developments in Russia and its regions. 
*The '''Caucasus Analytical Digest (CAD)''', a monthly internet publication analyzing the political, economic, and social situation in the three South Caucasus states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia within the context of international and security dimensions of this region’s development.

{{Distinguish|Sanitation engineering}}
'''Sanitary engineering''', also known as '''public health engineering''', is the application of engineering methods to improve [[sanitation]] of human communities, primarily by providing the removal and disposal of human waste, and in addition to the supply of safe [[potable water]]. Traditionally a branch of civil engineering, in the mid-19th century, the discipline concentrated on the reduction of disease, then thought to be caused by [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. This was accomplished mainly by the collection and segregation of sewerage flow in [[London]] specifically, and Great Britain generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/britlit/sanitary.html Sanitary Reform of London], The Working Collection of [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], British and Commonwealth Literary Studies, [[Green Library]], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These and later regulatory improvements were reported in the United States as early as 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/31/news/european-sanitary-reform-the-british-sanitary-legislation.html EUROPEAN SANITARY REFORM.; The British Sanitary Legislation], [[The New York Times]], July 31, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not concerned with environmental factors that do not have an immediate and clearly understood effect on public health.  Areas outside the purview of sanitary engineering include [[traffic]] management, concerns about [[noise pollution]] or [[light pollution]], aesthetic concerns such as [[landscaping]], and [[environmental conservation]] as it pertains to [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Skills within this field are usually employed for the primary goal of [[disease]] prevention within [[human beings]] by assuring a supply of healthy [[drinking water]], treatment of waste water, removing [[Waste|garbage]] from inhabited areas, and so on.

Compared to (for example) [[electrical engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]] which are concerned primarily with [[closed system]]s, sanitary engineering is a very [[interdisciplinary]] field which may involve such elements as [[hydraulics]], constructive modelling, [[information technology]], project design, [[microbiology]], [[pathology]] and the many divisions within [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].  In some cases, considerations that fall within the field of [[social sciences]] and urban planning must be factored in as well.

Although sanitary engineering may be most associated with the design of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage treatment]] and [[waste water treatment]] facilities, [[recycling]] centers, [[landfill|public landfills]] and other things which are constructed, the term applies equally to (for example) a plan of action to reverse the effects of [[water pollution]] or [[soil contamination]] in a specific area.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering.  As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct.  The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinbeck|first1=SG|title=An Abridged History of  Onsite Wastewater: Early Years to Present|url=http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/oet/docs/cit/oswpmod/HistoryOfOSWW.pdf|website=REHS Onsite Water Protection Branch|publisher=Environmental Health Section, Division of Public Health, NC Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat.  By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London's Victorian sewer system|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/10092.htm|website=Thames Water|publisher=Tames Water|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid  were spread via the contaminated water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Anne|title=Water and the Search for Public Health in London in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|journal=Medical History|date=1984|volume=28|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139446/pdf/medhist00078-0028.pdf|pmc=1139446|pmid=6390024|pages=250–82|doi=10.1017/s0025727300035936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.

During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsuo|first1=Tomonori|title=Civil Engineering Vol. I|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/E6-37-01-03.pdf|website=Wastewater Management Engineering|publisher=Encyclodedia of Life Support Systems|accessdate=April 3, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces.  Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.

Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat [[Water Pollution]] in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.

==Municipalities==
Generally, sanitary engineers work for municipalities and are highly trained professionals with a diverse range of engineering skills.  Some are involved with a specific area of concern such as [[waste collection]] or the maintenance of [[waste water]] facilities and  [[storm water]] [[drainage]] systems within a district.

Others cover a broader scope of activities that might include the two just listed as well as such maintenance of the public [[water supply]], collection of residential yard waste program, disposal of  [[hazardous waste]], recycling strategies and even community programs where individuals or businesses "adopt" an area and either maintain it themselves or donate funds for doing so.

==Wastewater==
'''Wastewater engineering''' is not usually its own degree course but a specialization from degrees such as [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], Bio-chemical engineering or [[chemical engineering]]. Wastewater engineering deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]], and irrigation water. [[Wastewater treatment]] and [[water reclamation]] are areas of concern in this field.

Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection, design pipe and pumped collection systems, and design treatment processes for collected wastewater.

===Job description and typical tasks===
Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of  mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.&lt;ref name=Onet&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report for: 17-2081.01 - Water/Wastewater Engineers|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01|website=O*net Online|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.

Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the  construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems.  They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components.  They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairfax County Department of Human Resources|title=Wastewater Plant Operations Manager Classification Specification|url=http://agency.governmentjobs.com/fairfaxcounty/default.cfm?action=viewclassspec&amp;classSpecID=969985&amp;viewOnly=yes|website=Fairfax County Classifications|publisher=Fairfax County, VA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical employers===
Wastewater engineers work for private companies, state and local governments, and special districts. As of 2012 there were 53,000 wastewater engineers employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/water-and-wastewater-treatment-plant-and-system-operators.htm|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern challenges: climate change===
Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifers since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Water Resource Mapping|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/36118.html|website=New York State Department of Resource Conservation|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.

Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cakir|first1=FY|title=Greenhouse gas production: A comparison between aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technology|journal=Water Research|date=September 26, 2005|volume=39|issue=17|pages=4197–4203|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effects of global warming]] on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and [[reclaimed water]] Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.

Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by [[water scarcity]]. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|journal=Desalination|date=2008|volume=220|issue=1|pages=1–15|accessdate=April 20, 2015

===Education necessary for the job===
Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], environmental engineering, or a [[facilities engineering]] degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.

Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.

Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Environmental Protection Agency|title=Operator Certification Requirements TABLE|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_table.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board uses a five level classification system to classify
water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served
and the complexity of the treatment system.

The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years.  To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment Plant Classification, Operator Certification, and Contract Operator Registration |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_clean.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).  Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.

Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-engineering-careers/engineering/environmental-engineer#education|website=Science Buddies|publisher=Science Buddies, Inc.|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer: Career Profile|url=http://study.com/articles/Environmental_Engineer_Career_Profile.html|website=Study.com|publisher=Study.com, Mountain View, CA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Onet"/&gt;  The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages and Employment Trends|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01#WagesEmployment|website=Onetonline.org|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1207">The '''Social Research Association''' (usually abbreviated '''SRA'''), founded in 1978 by Janet Lewis and Malcolm Cross, and supported by an active Board that included Roger Jowell, is a [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] organisation open to practitioners and researchers interested in all branches of social research.  It is a [[Learned society]] member of the UK [[Academy of Social Sciences]].  In addition to the umbrella organisation, it has branches that cater specifically to researchers in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and Ireland (including both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]).  Among other activities, it publishes a code of conduct for social researchers which is widely adopted as a standard of [[research ethics]] by funding agencies in the social sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25017">'''Social accounting''' (also known as ''[[social accounting and auditing]]'', ''[[social accountability]]'', ''social and environmental accounting'', ''corporate social reporting'', ''corporate social responsibility reporting'', ''non-financial reporting'' or ''accounting'') is the process of communicating the social and environmental effects of organizations' economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Gray, D.L. Owen &amp; K.T. Maunders, ''Corporate Social Reporting: Accounting and accountability'' (Hemel Hempstead: Prentice Hall, 1987)p. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Accounting is different from [[public interest accounting]] as well as from  [[critical accounting]].

Social accounting is commonly used in the context of business, or [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR), although any organisation, including [[NGO]]s, [[charities]], and [[government agencies]] may engage in social accounting. Social Accounting can also be used in conjunction with [[community-based monitoring]] (CBM).

Social accounting emphasises the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. D. Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as "an approach to reporting a firm’s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behaviour, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques."&lt;ref&gt;D. Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'' (London: Financial Times Prentice Hall, 2000), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important step in helping companies independently develop CSR programs which are shown to be much more effective than government mandated CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=1 December 2012|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social accounting is often used as an [[umbrella term]] to describe a broad field of research and practice. The use of more narrow terms to express a specific interest is thus not uncommon. Environmental accounting may e.g. specifically refer to the research or practice of accounting for an organisation's impact on the [[natural environment]]. [[Sustainability accounting]] is often used to express the measuring and the quantitative analysis of social and economic [[sustainability]]. [[National accounting]] is a narrower usage in concentrating on the [[nation]] as the aggregable unit of analysis and [[economics]] as a method of analysis.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"&gt;Nancy  D. Ruggles, 1987. "social accounting," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 377–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Social accounting challenges conventional accounting, in particular [[financial accounting]], for giving a narrow image of the interaction between [[society]] and [[organizations]], and thus artificially constraining the subject of accounting.

Social accounting, a largely [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] concept, seeks to broaden the scope of accounting in the sense that it should:
* concern itself with more than only economic events;
* not be exclusively expressed in financial terms;
* be accountable to a broader group of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]];
* broaden its purpose beyond reporting financial success.

It points to the fact that [[companies]] influence their external environment ( some times positively and many a times
negatively) through their actions and should therefore account for these effects as part of their standard
accounting practices. Social accounting is in this sense closely related to the economic concept of [[externality]].

Social accounting offers an alternative account of significant economic entities. It has the "potential to expose the tension between pursuing [[economic profit]] and the pursuit of social and environmental objectives".&lt;ref name="Gray_etal_1996_ch1"&gt;Gray R.H., D.L. Owen &amp; C. Adams (1996) Accounting and Accountability: Changes and Challenges in Corporate Social and Environmental Reporting (London: Prentice Hall), Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of social accounting can be approached from two different angles, namely for management control purposes or [[accountability]] purposes.

===Accountability vs authority enjoyed===

Social accounting for accountability purposes is designed to support and facilitate the pursuit of society's objectives. 
These objectives can be manifold but can typically be described in terms of social and environmental desirability and [[sustainability]]. In order to make informed choices on these objectives, the flow of information in society in general, and in accounting in particular, needs to cater for democratic decision-making. In democratic systems, Gray argues, there must then be flows of information in which those controlling the resources provide accounts to society of their use of those resources: a system of corporate accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Gray ''et al.'' (1996), esp Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Society is seen to profit from implementing a social and environmental approach to accounting in a number of ways, e.g.:

* Honoring stakeholders' rights of information;
* Balancing corporate power with corporate responsibility;
* Increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of corporate activity;
* Identifying social and environmental costs of economic success.

===Management control===
Social accounting for the purpose of management control is designed to support and facilitate the achievement of an organization's own objectives.&lt;br /&gt; 
Because social accounting is concerned with substantial self-reporting on a systemic level, individual reports are often referred to as social audits.  The first complete internal model for social accounting and audit, 1981, was designed for social enterprises to help plan and measure their social, environmental and financial progress towards achieving their planned objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Freer Spreckley, [http://www.locallivelihoods.com/cmsms/uploads/PDFs/Social%20Audit%20Toolkit%20-%204th%20Edition%202008.pdf Social Audit Toolkit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations are seen to benefit from implementing social accounting practices in a number of ways, e.g.:&lt;ref&gt;See R.H. Gray, 'Current Developments and Trends in Social and Environmental Auditing, Reporting &amp; Attestation' , International Journal of Auditing 4(3) (2000): pp247-268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'', esp Ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased information for decision-making;

* Enhanced image management and [[Public Relations]];
* Identification of social responsibilities;
* Identification of market development opportunities;
* Maintaining [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]].

According to [[Business in the Community|BITC]] the "process of reporting on responsible businesses performance to stakeholders" (i.e. social accounting) helps integrate such practices into business practices, as well as identifying future risks and opportunities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html Corporate responsibility reporting - Business in the Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815220804/http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html |date=August 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The management control view thus focuses on the individual organization.

Critics of this approach point out that the benign nature of companies is assumed. Here, responsibility, and accountability, is largely left in the hands of the organization concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

===Formal accountability===

In social accounting the focus tends to be on larger organisations such as [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), and their visible, external accounts rather than informally produced accounts or accounts for internal use. The need for formality in making MNCs accountability is given by the spatial, financial and cultural distance of these organisations to those who are affecting and affected by it.&lt;ref name="Gray_etal_1996_ch1"/&gt;

Social accounting also questions the reduction of all meaningful information to financial form. Financial data is seen as only one element of the accounting language.&lt;ref&gt;See M.R. Mathews,'Towards a Mega-Theory of Accounting' in: Gray and Guthrie, ''Social Accounting, Mega Accounting and Beyond: A Festschrift in Honour of MR Mathews'' (CSEAR Publishing, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reporting and third party audits===
In most countries, existing legislation only regulates a fraction of accounting for socially relevant corporate activity. In consequence, most available social, environmental and sustainability reports are [[voluntary disclosure|produced voluntarily]] by organisations and in that sense often resemble [[financial statements]]. While companies' efforts in this regard are usually commended, there seems to be a tension between voluntary reporting and accountability, for companies are likely to produce reports favouring their interests.&lt;ref name="Gray_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/1467-8608.00207 |title=Thirty Years of Social Accounting, Reporting and Auditing: what (if anything) have we learnt? |author=R.H. Gray |year=2001 |journal=[[Business Ethics: A European Review]] |volume=10|issue=1|pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-arrangement of social and environmental data that companies already produce as part of their normal reporting practice into an independent social audit is called a '''silent or shadow account'''.

An alternative phenomenon is the creation of '''external social audits''' by groups or individuals independent of the accountable organisation and typically without its encouragement. External social audits thus also attempt to blur the boundaries between organisations and society and to establish social accounting as a fluid two-way communication process. Companies are sought to be held accountable regardless of their approval.&lt;ref name="Gray_2001"/&gt;{{rp|10}} It is in this sense that external audits part with attempts to establish social accounting as an intrinsic feature of organisational behaviour. The reports of [[Social Audit Ltd]] in the 1970s on e.g. Tube Investments, Avon Rubber and Coalite and Chemical, laid the foundations for much of the later work on social audits.&lt;ref name="Gray_2001"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Reporting areas===
Unlike in financial accounting, the matter of interest is by definition less clear-cut in social accounting; this is due to an aspired all-encompassing approach to corporate activity.
It is generally agreed that social accounting will cover an organisation's relationship with the [[natural environment]], its employees, and ethical issues concentrating upon consumers and products, as well as local and international communities. Other issues include corporate action on questions of [[ethnicity]] and [[gender]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gray et al., ''Accountability'', Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience===
Social accounting supersedes the traditional audit audience, which is mainly composed of a company's [[shareholders]] and the financial community, by providing information to all of the organisation's stakeholders.
A [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] of an organisation is anyone who can influence or is influenced by the organisation. This often includes, but is not limited to, suppliers of inputs, employees and [[trade unions]], [[consumer]]s, members of local communities, society at large and [[governments]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
Different stakeholders have different rights of information. These rights can be stipulated by [[law]], but also by non-legal codes, corporate values, mission statements and [[natural and legal rights|moral rights]].
The rights of information are thus determined by "society, the organisation and its stakeholders".&lt;ref name="Gray_2001"/&gt;

==Some Social Accountability Tools==
* Social Audit
* Public Audit
* Public Hearing
* Citizen Score Card (CSC)
* Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS)
* Use of Citizen Charter
* Use of Complaint Box

==Environmental accounting==
{{main|Environmental accounting}}

Environmental accounting, which is a subset of social accounting, focuses on the cost structure and environmental performance of a company. It principally describes the preparation, presentation, and communication of information related to an organisation’s interaction with the [[natural environment]]. Although environmental accounting is most commonly undertaken as voluntary self-reporting by companies, third-party reports by government agencies, NGOs and other bodies posit to pressure for environmental accountability.

Accounting for impacts on the environment may occur within a company’s [[financial statements]], relating to [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]], commitments and contingencies for the remediation of contaminated lands or other financial concerns arising from [[pollution]]. Such reporting essentially expresses financial issues arising from environmental legislation.
More typically, environmental accounting describes the reporting of quantitative and detailed environmental data within the non-financial sections of the [[annual report]] or in separate (including online) environmental reports. Such reports may account for pollution emissions, resources used, or [[wildlife habitat]] damaged or re-established.

In their reports, large companies commonly place primary emphasis on [[eco-efficiency]], referring to the reduction of resource and energy use and waste production per unit of product or service. A complete picture which accounts for all inputs, outputs and wastes of the organisation, must not necessarily emerge. Whilst companies can often demonstrate great success in eco-efficiency, their [[ecological footprint]], that is an estimate of total environmental impact, may move independently following changes in output.

Legislation for compulsory environmental reporting exists in some form e.g. in [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Australia]], the [[UK]] and [[Korea]]. In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring all UK companies listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange - around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies - to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year. [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Juliette|first=Jowit|title=New emissions policy will force biggest UK firms to reveal CO2 figures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/19/emissions-policy-firms-reveal-co2|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guide to UK Mandatory Carbon Reporting. http://ecometrica.com/products/our-impacts/mandatory-carbon-reporting/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the date was eventually moved back to 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecometrica.com/products/our-impacts/mandatory-carbon-reporting/|title=Reporting Modules - Ecometrica|author=|date=|website=ecometrica.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has been highly involved in the adoption of environmental accounting practices, most notably in the United Nations Division for Sustainable Development publication "Environmental Management Accounting Procedures and Principles".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/proceduresandprinciples.pdf  Environmental Management Accounting Procedures and Principles (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Social accounting is a widespread practice in a number of large organisations in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[BP]], [[British Telecom]], [[The Co-operative Bank]], [[The Body Shop]], and [[United Utilities]] all publish independently audited social and sustainability accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Shell Sustainability Report 2007: http://www.shell.com/static/responsible_energy/downloads/sustainability_reports/shell_sustainability_report_2007.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BP Sustainability Reports: http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=6914&amp;contentId=7042803
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BT Society &amp; Environment Report: http://www.btplc.com/Societyandenvironment/Socialandenvironmentreport/index.aspx
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Co-operative Bank Sustainability Reporting: http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1168506355583&amp;pagename=Corp/Page/tplCorp
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop Values Report 2007: http://valuesreport.thebodyshop.net/index.asp?lvl1=0&amp;lvl2=0&amp;lvl3=0&amp;lvl4=0
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Utilities Sustainable Development: http://www.unitedutilities.com/?OBH=5349
&lt;/ref&gt;
In many instances the reports are produced in (partial or full) compliance with the sustainability reporting guidelines set by the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) and indexes including [[EthicalQuote|EthicalQuote (CEQ)]] (reputation tracking of the world’s largest companies on Environmental, 
Social, Governance (ESG), Corporate Social Responsibility, ethics and 
sustainability).

[[Traidcraft]] plc, the fair trade organisation, claims to be the first [[public limited company]] to publish audited social accounts in the UK, starting in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Traidcraft |url=http://www.traidcraft.co.uk/about_traidcraft/social_accounts/social_accounts.htm |title=Social accounts &amp;#124; About |publisher=Traidcraft |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See C. Dey, 'Social accounting at Traidcraft plc: A struggle for the meaning of fair trade',
''Accounting, Auditing &amp; Accountability Journal 20(3)'' (2007): pp.423 - 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

The website of the [[Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research]] contains a collection of [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~csearweb/aptopractice/index.html exemplary reporting practices and social audits.]

===Areas ===

Companies and other organisations (such as [[NGO]]s) may publish annual corporate responsibility reports, in print or online. The reporting format can also include summary or overview documents for certain [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], a corporate responsibility or sustainability section on its corporate website, or integrate social accounting into its annual report and accounts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Companies may seek to adopt a social accounting format that is audience specific and appropriate. For example, [[H&amp;M]], asks stakeholders how they would like to receive reports on its website; [[Vodafone]] publishes separate reports for 11 of its operating companies as well as publishing an internal report in 2005; [[Weyerhaeuser]] produced a tabloid-size, four-page mini-report in addition to its full sustainability report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=4772 Ethical Corporation: Report Reviews - Reporting review of the year – Corporate responsibility reporting – The best of times, the worst of times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821060832/http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=4772 |date=August 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Modern forms of social accounting first produced widespread interest in the 1970s. Its concepts received serious consideration from professional and academic accounting bodies, e.g. the [[Accounting Standards Board]]'s predecessor, the [[American Accounting Association]] and the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].&lt;ref&gt;See Accounting Standards Committee, ''The Corporate Report'' (London: ICAEW, 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Accounting Association, 'Report of the Committee on Human Resource Accounting', ''The Accounting Review Supplement to Vol. XLVIII''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, ''The Measurement of Corporate Social Performance'' (New York: AICPA, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
Business-representative bodies, e.g. the [[Confederation of British Industry]], likewise approached the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Confederation of British Industry. ''The Responsibility of the British Public Company'' (London: CBI, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Freer Spreckley produced a short book entitled ''Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working''&lt;ref&gt;Freer Spreckley, ''[http://www.locallivelihoods.com/cmsms/uploads/PDFs/Social%20Audit%20-%20A%20Management%20Tool.pdf Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working].&lt;/ref&gt; designed as an internal organisational social accounting and audit model specifically for social enterprises who wished to measure their social, environmental and financial performance.  This was the basis for the Co-operative Bank and Shell Corporation's social performance reports in the UK and subsequently many other private sector companies social responsibility reporting.

[[Abt Associates]], the American consultancy firm, is one of the most cited early examples of businesses that experimented with social accounting. In the 1970s Abt Associates conducted a series of social audits incorporated into its annual reports. The social concerns addressed included "productivity, contribution to knowledge, employment security, fairness of employment opportunities, health, education and self-development, physical security, transportation, recreation, and environment".&lt;ref&gt;Abt Associates Annual Report and Social Audit 1974, quoted in D. Blake, W. Frederick, M. Myers, ''Social Auditing'', (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1976), p.149.
&lt;/ref&gt; The social audits expressed Abt Associates performance in this areas in financial terms and thus aspired to determine the company's net social impact in balance sheet form.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Bauer and D. H. Fenn, What is a corporate social audit?, Harvard Business Review, 1973, pp.42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of early applications include Laventhol and Horwath, then a reputable accounting firm, and the First National Bank of Minneapolis (now U.S. Bancorp).&lt;ref&gt;Blake et al., ''Social Auditing'', p. 149. '&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet social accounting practices were only rarely codified in legislation; notable exceptions include the French [[bilan social]] and the British [[2006 Companies Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucost.com/pressreleases/CompaniesAct.html Press Release - Changes to the Companies Act 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in social accounting cooled off in the 1980s and was only resurrected in the mid-1990s, partly nurtured by growing ecological and environmental awareness.&lt;ref name="Gray_2001"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3734">[[File:Anatomy dog.png|thumb|This dog's stifle joint is labeled 12]]
The '''stifle joint''' (often simply '''stifle''') is a complex joint in the [[hind limb]]s of [[quadruped]] [[mammal]]s such as the [[sheep]], [[horse]] or [[dog]]. It is the equivalent of the human [[knee]] and is often the largest [[synovial joint]] in the animal's body. The stifle joint joins three bones: the [[femur]], [[patella]], and [[tibia]]. The joint consists of three smaller ones: the femoropatellar joint, medial femorotibial joint, and lateral femorotibial joint.

The stifle joint consists of the femorotibial articulation ([[femoral condyle|femoral]] and [[Medial condyle of tibia|tibial condyles]]), femoropatellar articulation (femoral [[trochlea of humerus|trochlea]] and the [[patella]]), and the proximal tibiofibular articulation.

The joint is stabilized by paired collateral ligaments which act to prevent abduction/adduction at the joint, as well as paired [[cruciate ligaments]].  The [[cranial cruciate ligament]] and the [[caudal cruciate ligament]] restrict cranial and caudal translation (respectively) of the [[tibia]] on the [[femur]]. The cranial cruciate also resists over-extension and inward rotation, and is the most commonly damaged stifle ligament in dogs.

'Cushioning' of the joint is provided by two C-shaped pieces of cartilage called menisci which sit between the medial and lateral condyles of the distal femur and the tibial plateau. The main biomechanical function of the menisci is probably to divide the joint into two functional units—the 'femoromeniscal joint' for flexion/extension movements and the 'meniscotibial joint' for rotation—a function analogous to that of the disc dividing the temporomandibular (jaw) joint. The menisci also contain nerve endings which are used to assist in proprioreception.

The menisci are attached via a variety of ligaments: two meniscotibial ligaments for each meniscus, the meniscofemoral from the lateral meniscus to the femur, the meniscocollateral from the medial meniscus to the medial collateral ligament, and the transverse ligament (or intermeniscal) which runs between the two menisci. 

There are between one and four sesamoid bones associated with the stifle joint in different species. These sesamoids assist with the smooth movement of tendon/muscle over the joint. The most well-known sesamoid bone is the patella, more commonly known as the 'knee cap'. It is located cranially to the joint and sits in the trochlear groove of the femur. It guides the patellar ligament of the quadriceps over the knee joint to its point of insertion on the tibia. Caudal to the joint, in the dog for example, are the two fabellae, which lie in the two tendons of origin of gastrocnemius. Fourth, there is often a small sesamoid bone in the tendon of origin of popliteus in many species. Humans possess only the patella.

In the horse and ox, the distal part of the tendon of insertion of quadriceps ('below' the patella) is divided into three parts. An elaborate twisting movement of the patella allows the stifle to 'lock' in extension when the medial portion of the tendon is 'hooked' over the bulbous medial trochlear ridge of the distal femur.  This locking mechanism enables these animals to sleep while standing up.

The '''All-Earth Ecobot Challenge''' (or Ecobots) is a competition that occurs yearly for students throughout [[Texas]] in grades 5-8 that started in 2009. It encourages students to be creative, learn more about [[robots]], learn about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and how to help protect it, and prepares them for future jobs. The Ecobot Challenge uses various [[Lego]] pieces, [[Lego NXT|Lego NXT sets]], and [[PowerPoint]].

The All Earth Ecobot Challenge happens once a year for students in Texas. It started in 2009 and is for grades 5-8 It helps students learn about the environment, robots, creativity, and preparation for their future careers.

==Preparation==
Usually, a teacher from each school helps coaches teams that come before and/or after school to prepare by programming their [[Lego NXT|NXT]] and sometimes creating their Marketing Presentation(which could also be done at home, but not the [[Lego NXT|NXT]] programming)  in that teacher's classroom. Usually, the team starts to program and make their presentation in early March of earlier.

==Competition==
The competition held yearly consists of two sections: the Robotics section and the Marketing section. They are two separate parts to the competition. The competition is usually help around mid-April. The robot in the competition is only allowed to be touched in "Home". Home is where the robot starts and ends when completing challenges.

===Robotics===
This section requires students to program a [[Lego NXT]] to complete various tasks that change each year. The more tasks students complete, the more points they get (for a maximum of 300 points). To complete the various tasks, students build [[Lego]] attachments usually attached to the motors included in the  Lego NXT kit.

===Marketing===
This section requires students to think of and to make a PowerPoint presentation about an imaginary [[robot]] that will help the Earth environmentally. They present their presentation to judges who score them.

===Sponsors===
The Lego NXT sets and the competition is costly. Ecobots rely on [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] to fund the competition. For a list of sponsors, go to their [http://www.ecobotchallenge.com/sponsors.shtml sponsor list page].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">'''Transcendental anatomy''', also known as '''philosophical anatomy''', was a form of [[comparative anatomy]] that sought to find ideal patterns and structures common to all organisms in nature.&lt;ref name="Bates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Bates|title=The Anatomy of Robert Knox: Murder, Mad Science and Medical Regulation in Nineteenth-Century Edinburgh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1kBF3mfIZMC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-381-2|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated from [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist philosophy]] in the German provinces, and culminated in Britain especially by scholars [[Robert Knox]] and [[Richard Owen]], who drew from [[Goethe]] and [[Lorenz Oken]].&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; From the 1820s to 1859, it persisted as the medical expression of natural philosophy before the [[Darwinian_revolution#1859.E2.80.931930s:_Darwin_and_his_legacy|Darwinian revolution]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janis McLarren Caldwell|title=Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: From Mary Shelley to George Eliot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPvTSjOmYooC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=18 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45664-7|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst its various definitions, transcendental anatomy has four main tenets:
* the presupposition of an Ideal Plan among the multiplicity of visible structures in the animal and plant kingdom, and that the Plan determines function 
* the Ideal Plan acted as a force for the maintenance of anatomical uniformity (as opposed to diversity-inducing forces of Nature)
* the belief that this ''a priori'' Plan was discoverable
* the desire to discover universal Laws underlying anatomical differences.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==History==
Johann Wolfgang Goethe was one of many naturalists and anatomists in the nineteenth century who was in search of an Ideal Plan in nature. In Germany, this was known as ''Urpflanze'' for the plant kingdom and ''Urtier'' for animals. He popularized the term "[[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]" for this search. Transcendental anatomy first derived from the naturalist philosophy known as ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref name="Richards2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Richards|title=The Meaning of Evolution: The Morphological Construction and Ideological Reconstruction of Darwin's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-72dKSIciEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=2 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71205-5|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s, French anatomist Etienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786–1868) popularized the term ''transcendental anatomy'' to refer to the collective morphological of animal development.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Romanticism and the Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=28 June 1990|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-35685-5|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonymous expressions such as philosophical anatomy, higher anatomy, and transcendental morphology also arose at this time.

Some advocates regarded transcendental anatomy as the ultimate explanation for biological structures, while others saw it as one of several necessary explanatory devices.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==Vertebral theory==
[[File:SkullFromTheFront.JPG|150px|thumbnail|right|The osteology of the human skull was an important theory for transcendental anatomists.]]
Transcendental anatomists theorized that the bones of the skull were "cranial vertebra", or modified bones from the vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; Owen ardently supported the theory as major evidence for his theory of [[homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref name="Gregorio2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario a Di Gregorio|title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZK004HREqgC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-56972-6|pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has since been discredited.

{{distinguish|Tremelo}}
[[File:Tremolo notation.svg|thumb|Tremolo notation {{audio|Tremolo notation.mid|Play}} and compare with {{audio|Tremolo notation regular.mid|normal technique}}.]]
In music, '''''tremolo''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtrɛːmolo}}), or '''''tremolando''''' ({{IPA-it|tremoˈlando|}}), is a trembling effect. There are two types of tremolo.

The first is a rapid reiteration:
* of a single [[Musical note|note]], particularly used on [[String instrument#Bowing|bowed string instruments]], by rapidly moving the bow back and forth; plucked strings such as on a [[harp]], where it is called ''[[wikt:bisbigliando|bisbigliando]]'' ({{IPA-it|bizbiʎˈʎando}}) or "whispering"; and [[tremolo picking]], in which a single note is repeated extremely rapidly with a [[plectrum]] (or "pick") on traditionally plucked string instruments such as guitar, mandolin, etc.
* between two notes or chords in alternation, an imitation (not to be confused with a [[trill (music)|trill]]) of the preceding that is more common on [[keyboard instrument]]s. Mallet instruments such as the [[marimba]] are capable of either method.
* a [[drum roll|roll]] on any [[percussion instrument]], whether tuned or untuned.
[[File:Fuse Electronics Tremolo MK-III Quick Demo.ogg|thumb|Video of a tremolo [[Effects unit|effect pedal]], producing a cycling variation of volume, played with an [[electric guitar]].]]
A second type of tremolo is a variation in [[amplitude]]:
* as produced on organs by [[tremulant]]s
* using electronic effects in guitar amplifiers and effects pedals which rapidly turn the volume of a signal up and down, creating a "shuddering" effect
* an imitation of the same by strings in which pulsations are taken in the same bow direction
* a [[vocal technique]] involving a wide or slow [[vibrato]], not to be confused with the [[Trill (music)#Trillo|trillo]] or "Monteverdi trill"

Some [[electric guitar]]s use a (misnamed) lever called a "tremolo arm" or "[[whammy bar]]" that allows a performer to lower or raise the pitch of a note or chord, an effect properly termed [[vibrato]] or "pitch bend". This non-standard use of the term "tremolo" refers to pitch rather than amplitude. True tremolo for an electric guitar, [[electronic organ]], or any electronic signal would normally be produced by a simple [[amplitude modulation]] [[electronic circuit]]. Electronic tremolo effects were available on many early [[guitar amplifier]]s. Tremolo effects pedals are also widely used to achieve this effect.

==History==
Although it had already been employed as early as 1617 by [[Biagio Marini]] and again in 1621 by [[Giovanni Battista Riccio]],&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, "Tremolo (i)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, {{ISBN|9781561592395}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the bowed tremolo was invented in 1624 by the early 17th-century composer [[Claudio Monteverdi]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Piero Weiss|Weiss]] and [[Richard Taruskin|Taruskin]] (1984). ''Music in the Western World: A History in Documents'', p. 146. {{ISBN|0-02-872900-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forsyth" /&gt; and, written as repeated semiquavers ([[sixteenth note]]s), used for the ''[[stile concitato]]'' effects in ''[[Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]''. The ''measured tremolo'', presumably played with rhythmic regularity, was invented to add dramatic intensity to string accompaniment and contrast with regular [[tenuto]] strokes.&lt;ref name="Forsyth"&gt;[[Cecil Forsyth]] (1982). ''Orchestration'', p. 348. {{ISBN|0-486-24383-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not till the time of Gluck that the real tremolo{{Clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--Several different kinds of tremolo are described in this article, but no one of them is defined as more "real" than any other. Which is meant here?--&gt; became an accepted method of tone production.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1982), p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; Four other types of historical tremolos include the obsolete ''undulating tremolo'', the ''bowed tremolo'', the ''fingered tremolo'' (or slurred tremolo), and the ''bowed-and-fingered tremolo''.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1982), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

The undulating tremolo was produced through the fingers of the right hand alternately exerting and relaxing pressure upon the bow to create a "very uncertain–undulating effect ... But it must be said that, unless violinists have wholly lost the art of this particular stroke, the result is disappointing and futile in the extreme," though it has been suggested that rather than as a legato stroke it was done as a series of ''jetés''.&lt;ref name="Forsyth" /&gt;

There is some speculation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittaker|first1=Paul|title=British Museum, Additional MS 14905; An Interpretation and Re-examination of the Music and Text|url=https://www.bangor.ac.uk/music/CAWMS/documents/Chapter3.pdf|website=Music of the Robert ap Huw Manuscript|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tremolo was employed in medieval Welsh harp music, as indicated in the transcription by [[Robert ap Huw]].

==Notation==
In [[musical notation]], tremolo is usually notated as regular repeated demisemiquavers ([[thirty-second note]]s), using strokes through the stems of the notes. Generally, there are three strokes, except on note which already have beams or flags: quavers ([[eighth note]]s) then take two additional slashes, and semiquavers ([[sixteenth note]]s) take one.
:[[File:Tremolo notation.svg]]
In the case of semibreves ([[whole note]]s), which lack stems, the strokes or slashes are drawn above or below the note, where the stem would be if there were one.

Because there is ambiguity as to whether an unmeasured tremolo or regular repeated demisemiquavers ([[thirty-second note]]s) should be played, the word ''tremolo'' or the abbreviation ''trem.'', is sometimes added. In slower music when there is a real chance of confusion, additional strokes can be used.

If the tremolo is between two or more notes, both notes are given the full value of the passage and the bars are drawn between them:
:[[File:Tremolo notation two notes.svg]]
In some music a minim-based ([[half note]]) tremolo is drawn with the strokes connecting the two notes together as if they were beams.

===Bowed string instruments===
Violin fingered tremolo; notice the joining of strokes and stems is different for different time values, and that some notes shorter than eighth notes are written out, such as the last thirty-second notes on the last beat of [[bar (music)|measure]] three:
:[[File:Fingered-tremolo.png|thumb|none|500px|Fingered tremolo notation&lt;ref name="Forsyth 358"&gt;Forsyth (1982), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Violin bowed-and-fingered tremolo, notated the same as fingered tremolo but without slurs and with ''stacc.'' above the staff:
:[[File:Bowed-and-fingered-tremolo.png|thumb|none|500px|Bowed-and-fingered tremolo notation&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1982), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Vaccinia virus''' ('''VACV''' or '''VV''') is a large, complex, [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] [[virus]] belonging to the [[poxvirus]] family.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a linear, double-stranded [[DNA]] [[genome]] approximately 190 [[base pair|kbp]] in length, and which encodes approximately 250 [[gene]]s. The dimensions of the [[virion]] are roughly 360 × 270 × 250&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], with a mass of approximately 5-10 fg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = L.| first2 = A.

[[Smallpox]] was the first disease to be widely prevented by vaccination due to pioneering work by the English physician and scientist [[Edward Jenner]], in the eighteenth century, using [[cowpox]] virus. Vaccinia virus is the active constituent of the [[smallpox vaccine|vaccine that eradicated smallpox]], making it the first human disease to be eradicated. This endeavour was carried out by the [[World Health Organization]] under the [[Smallpox vaccine#Eradication of smallpox|Smallpox Eradication Program]]. Post eradication of smallpox, scientists study vaccinia virus to use as a tool for delivering genes into biological tissues ([[gene therapy]] and [[genetic engineering]]) and because of concerns about smallpox being used as an agent for [[bioterrorism]].

== Classification of vaccinia infections ==
In addition to the morbidity of uncomplicated primary vaccination, transfer of infection to other sites by scratching, and  post vaccinial [[encephalitis]], other complications of vaccinia infections may be divided into the following types:&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|391}}

:* [[Generalized vaccinia]]
:* [[Eczema vaccinatum]]
:* [[Progressive vaccinia]] (Vaccinia gangrenosum, Vaccinia necrosum)
:* [[Roseola vaccinia]]

==Origin==
Vaccinia virus is closely related to the virus that causes [[cowpox]]; historically the two were often considered to be one and the same.&lt;ref name=Huygelen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huygelen C |title=Jenner's cowpox vaccine in light of current vaccinology |language=Dutch |journal=Verh. K. Acad. Geneeskd. Belg. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=479–536; discussion 537–8 |year=1996 |pmid=9027132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise origin of vaccinia virus is unknown due to the lack of record-keeping, as the virus was repeatedly cultivated and [[Serial passage|passaged]] in research laboratories for many decades.&lt;ref name=Henderson_1999&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Henderson DA, Moss B |veditors=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA | title = Vaccines | origyear = 1988 | edition = 3rd | year = 1999 | publisher = WB Saunders | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | isbn = 978-0-7216-7443-8 | chapter = Smallpox and Vaccinia | chapterurl = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common notion is that vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and [[variola]] virus (the causative agent of smallpox) were all derived from a common ancestral virus. There is also speculation that vaccinia virus was originally isolated from [[horse]]s,&lt;ref name=Huygelen /&gt; and analysis of DNA from an early (1902) sample of smallpox vaccine showed that it was 99.7% similar to horsepox virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1056/NEJMc1707600|pmid= 29020595|title= An Early American Smallpox Vaccine Based on Horsepox|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 377|issue= 15|pages= 1491–1492|year= 2017|last1= Schrick|first1= Livia|last2= Tausch|first2= Simon H|last3= Dabrowski|first3= P. Wojciech|last4= Damaso|first4= Clarissa R|last5= Esparza|first5= José|last6= Nitsche|first6= Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virology==
Poxviruses are unique among [[DNA virus]]es because they [[DNA replication|replicate]] only in the [[cytoplasm]] of the [[Host (biology)|host cell]], outside of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolonen N, Doglio L, Schleich S, Krijnse Locker J |title=Vaccinia Virus DNA Replication Occurs in Endoplasmic Reticulum-enclosed Cytoplasmic Mini-Nuclei |journal=Mol. Biol. Cell |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=2031–46 |date=1 July 2001|pmid=11452001 |url=http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/content/full/12/7/2031 |pmc=55651 |doi=10.1091/mbc.12.7.2031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the large genome is required for encoding various [[enzymes]] and proteins involved in viral DNA replication and gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. During its replication cycle, VV produces four infectious forms which differ in their outer [[cell membrane|membranes]]: intracellular mature virion (IMV), the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV), the cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV) and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=[[Geoffrey L. Smith|Smith GL]], Vanderplasschen A, Law M |title=The formation and function of extracellular enveloped Vaccinia virus |journal=J. Gen. Virol. |volume=83 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=2915–31 |date=1 December 2002|pmid=12466468 |url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/83/12/2915 |doi=10.1099/0022-1317-83-12-2915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the issue remains contentious, the prevailing view is that the IMV consists of a single [[lipoprotein]] membrane, while the CEV and EEV are both surrounded by two membrane layers and the IEV has three envelopes. The IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts. On the other hand, the CEV is believed to play a role in cell-to-cell spread and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organism.

==Multiplicity reactivation==
Vaccinia virus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation (MR).&lt;ref name=Abel&gt;{{cite journal |author=ABEL P |title=Multiplicity reactivation and marker rescue with vaccinia virus |journal=Virology |volume=17 |issue= 4|pages=511–9 |date=August 1962 |pmid=13858909 |doi= 10.1016/0042-6822(62)90150-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MR is the process by which two, or more, virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome.  Abel&lt;ref name=Abel /&gt; found that vaccinia viruses  exposed to doses of UV light sufficient to prevent progeny formation when single virus particles infected host chick embryo cells, could still produce viable progeny viruses when host cells were infected by two or more of these inactivated viruses; that is, MR could occur.  Kim and Sharp demonstrated MR of vaccinia virus after treatment with UV-light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharp DG, Kim KS |title=Multiplicity reactivation and radiation survival of aggregated vaccinia virus.

==Host resistance==
Vaccinia contains within its genome genes for several [[protein]]s that give the virus resistance to [[interferon]]s :
* K3L is a protein with [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to the protein ''[[eIF-2|eukaryotic initiation factor 2]]'' (eIF-2alpha). K3L protein inhibits the action of [[Protein kinase R|PKR]], an activator of interferons.&lt;ref name=Davies1993/&gt; 
* E3L is another protein encoded by Vaccinia. E3L also inhibits PKR activation; and is also able to bind to double stranded RNA.&lt;ref name=Davies1993&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies MV, Chang HW, Jacobs BL, Kaufman RJ |title=The E3L and K3L vaccinia virus gene products stimulate translation through inhibition of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase by different mechanisms |journal=J. Virol. |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=1688–92 |date=1 March 1993|pmid=8094759 |pmc=237544 |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8094759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as a vaccine==
[[Image:Smallpox vaccine site.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Site of a vaccinia injection, several days later.]]
A Vaccinia virus infection is very mild and is typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, but it may cause a mild rash and [[fever]]. Immune responses generated from a Vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal [[smallpox]] infection. For this reason, Vaccinia virus was, and is still being used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against, the Vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus. However, certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise. The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are [[immunocompromised]]. Approximately one in one million individuals will develop a fatal response to the [[vaccination]].

Currently, the vaccine is only administered to health care workers or research personnel who have a high risk of contracting the [[variola]] virus, and to the military personnel of the [[United States|United States of America]]. Due to the threat of smallpox [[bioterrorism]], there is a possibility the vaccine may have to be widely administered again in the future. Therefore, scientists are currently developing novel vaccine strategies against smallpox which are safer and much faster to deploy during a bioterrorism event.

On September 1, 2007, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) licensed a new [[vaccine]] [[ACAM2000]] against [[smallpox]] which can be produced quickly upon need. Manufactured by [[Sanofi Pasteur]], the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stockpiled 192.5 million doses of the new vaccine (see list of common strains below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/FDA-approves-new-smallpox-vaccine-1833591.php |title=FDA approves new smallpox vaccine |last=Heilprin |first=John |agency=AP |website=Houston Chronicle |date=1 September 2007 |access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new smallpox vaccine, [[Imvanex]], which is based on a modified strain of vaccinia; [[Modified vaccinia Ankara]] was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002596/human_med_001666.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 |title=European public assessment report summary: Imvanex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vaccinia'' is also used in recombinant [[vaccines]], as a vector for expression of foreign genes within a host, in order to generate an immune response. Other [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] are also used as live recombinant vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanderplasschen |first1=A. |last2=Pastoret |first2=P.-P. |title=The Uses of Poxviruses as Vectors |journal=Current Gene Therapy |volume=3 |number=6 |date=December 2003 |pages=583–595 |doi=10.2174/1566523034578168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original vaccine for smallpox, and the origin of the idea of vaccination, was [[Cowpox]], described by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1798. The [[Latin]] term used for Cowpox was ''Variolae vaccinae'',  Jenner's own translation of "smallpox of the cow".  That term lent its name to the whole idea of vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9987167|year=1999|last1=Baxby|first1=D|title=Edward Jenner's Inquiry; a bicentenary analysis|volume=17|issue=4|pages=301–7|journal=Vaccine|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(98)00207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was realized that the virus used in smallpox vaccination was not, or was no longer, the same as cowpox virus, the name 'vaccinia' was used for the virus in smallpox vaccine. (See OED.) Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable. The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight, and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine. Another method employed was the "arm to arm" method. This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms, then to another, etc. This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine, and usually employed orphans as carriers. However, this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases, such as hepatitis and syphilis.  In 1861, 41 Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the arm to arm method.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Jonathan B. "Scourge : The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox." New York: Grove/Atlantic Inc., 2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of pig [[cornea]]l [[tissue culture]].&lt;ref name="Steinhardt_1913"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steinhardt E, Israeli C, Lambert RA | title = Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia | journal = J.

In 1939  [[Allan Watt Downie]] showed that the smallpox vaccines being used in the 20th century and cowpox virus were not the same, but were immunologically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2065307|year=1939|last1=Downie|first1=AW|title=The Immunological Relationship of the Virus of Spontaneous Cowpox to Vaccinia Virus|volume=20|issue=2|pages=158–176|journal=British Journal of Experimental Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tyrrell | first1 = D.

==Recent cases==
In March 2007, a 2-year-old Indiana boy and his mother contracted a life-threatening vaccinia infection from the boy's father.&lt;ref name=MMWR&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Household transmission of vaccinia virus from contact with a military smallpox vaccinee—Illinois and Indiana, 2007 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=56 |issue=19 |pages=478–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17510612 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5619a4.htm?s_cid=mm5619a4_e}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy developed the telltale rash over 80 percent of his body after coming into close contact with his father, who was vaccinated for smallpox before being deployed overseas by the [[United States Army]]. The United States military resumed smallpox vaccinations in 2002. The child acquired the infection due to [[eczema]], which is a known risk factor for vaccinia infection. The boy was treated with [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[cidofovir]], and [[Tecovirimat]] (ST-246), a (then) experimental drug developed by [[SIGA Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = SIGA's Smallpox Drug Candidate Administered to Critically Ill Human Patient | publisher = SIGA Technologies | date = 2007-03-17 | url =https://investor.siga.com/node/7346 | accessdate = 2018-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2007, he was sent home with no after effects except for possible scarring of the skin.&lt;ref name=MMWR/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that a woman in Washington had contracted vaccinia virus infection after digital vaginal contact with her boyfriend, a military member who had recently been vaccinated for smallpox. The woman had a history of childhood eczema, but she had not been symptomatic as an adult. The CDC indicated that it was aware of four similar cases in the preceding 12 months of vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a recent military vaccinee.&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Vaccinia Virus Infection After Sexual Contact with a Military Smallpox Vaccinee—Washington, 2010 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=59 |issue=25 |pages=773–75 |year=2010 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5925a2.htm?s_cid=mm5925a2_w}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further cases—also in patients with a history of eczema—occurred in 2012.&lt;ref name=MMWR3&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |title=Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee—San Diego, California, 2012 |journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=145–7 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23446513 |pmc=4604863 |doi= |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6208a2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common strains==
This is a list of some of the well-characterized vaccinia strains used for research and vaccination.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A '''vacuum chamber''' is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a [[vacuum pump]]. This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a [[vacuum]]. A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in [[outer space]] (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating. Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, [[frequency]], [[resistivity]], and [[Permeation|permeability]] of the material used. Only [[Materials for use in vacuum|some materials]] are suitable for vacuum use.

Chambers often have multiple ports, covered with [[vacuum flange]]s, to allow instruments or windows to be installed in the walls of the chamber. In low to medium-vacuum applications, these are sealed with [[elastomer]] [[o-ring]]s. In higher vacuum applications, the flanges have knife edges machined onto them, which cut into a copper [[gasket]] when the flange is bolted on.

A type of vacuum chamber frequently used in the field of [[spacecraft]] engineering is a [[thermal vacuum chamber]], which provides a thermal environment representing what a spacecraft would experience in space.

==Vacuum chamber materials==
Vacuum chambers can be constructed of many materials. "Metals are arguably the most prevalent vacuum chamber materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danielson|first=PHil|title=Choosing the Right Vacuum Materials|url=http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|publisher=The Vacuum Lab|accessdate=February 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724150040/http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|archive-date=July 24, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength, pressure, and permeability are considerations for selecting chamber material.
Common materials are:
* Stainless Steel
* Aluminum
* Mild Steel
* Brass
* High density ceramic
* Glass
* Acrylic
*hard steel

==Vacuum degassing==
"Vacuum degassing is the process of using vacuum to remove gases from compounds which become entrapped in the
mixture when mixing the components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Degassing Epoxy &amp; Silicone|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1013%20revA1%20(App%2006-14%20Vacuum%20Degassing%20Epoxy%20and%20Silicone).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assure a bubble-free mold when mixing resin and silicone rubbers and slower-setting harder resins, a vacuum chamber is required. A small vacuum chamber is needed for de-airing (eliminating air bubbles) for materials prior to their setting. The process is fairly straightforward. The casting or molding material is mixed according to the manufacturers directions.

===Process===
Since the material may expand 4–5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must be large enough to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill over the top of the container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches {{nowrap|29 inches}} (at sea level) of mercury, the material will begin to rise (resembling [[foam]]). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.

Though a maximum vacuum one can theoretically achieve at sea level is 29.921 inches of mercury (Hg,) this will vary significantly as altitude increases. For example, for a mold making in ''[[Denver, Colorado]]'', which sits at 5280 feet above sea level, one can only achieve a vacuum on the mercury scale of 24.896 Hg in their vacuum chamber. 

To keep the material air-free, it must be slowly poured in a high and narrow stream starting from the corner of the mold box, or mold, letting the material flow freely into the box or mold cavity. Usually, this method will not introduce any new bubbles into the vacuumed material. To ensure that the material is totally devoid of air bubbles, the entire mold/mold box may be placed in the chamber for an additional few minutes; this will assist the material in flowing into difficult areas of the mold/mold box.

==Vacuum drying==
Water and other liquids may accumulate on a product during the production process. "Vacuum is often employed as a process for removing bulk and absorbed water (or other solvents) from a product. Combined
with heat, vacuum can be an effective method for drying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Drying|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1011%20revA1%20(App%2005-07%20Vacuum%20Drying).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World's largest vacuum chamber==

[[NASA]]'s [[Space_Power_Facility#Thermal-Vacuum_Test_Chamber|Space Power Facility]] houses the world's largest vacuum chamber. It was built in 1969 and stands {{convert|122|ft|m}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, enclosing a [[bullet]]-shaped space. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. Recently, it was recommissioned for use in testing [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.

== Early life, education and diplomacy ==
Tejera attended St. Mary's College in [[Southampton|Southampton, England]], a boarding school, from 1930-1938, receiving his Matriculate (university entry status certificate) in London in 1939. He received a fellowship to study at [[Columbia University]] in the U.S., completing his Bachelor of Arts degree at the undergraduate college in philosophy ([[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1948 and his doctorate at the graduate school in philosophy in 1956 with a dissertation on "Philosophy and the Art of Poetry". He also completed his ''docente'' (teacher's training) at the Central University of Venezuela in 1951.
 
In his early career, Tejera held the following diplomatic posts:

== Intellectual influences and academic career ==

=== Years at Columbia ===
As a student at Columbia University, some of the principal teachers and direct influences on his work included the renowned intellectual and cultural historians [[John Herman Randall Jr.|John H.

His early philosophic passion was Greek Philosophy, and he received instruction in Classical Greek from [[Fred Householder]]. He studied History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Literary Theory. He also attended summer sessions in the late 1940's at the Kenyon School of English. He was profoundly affected by the writings of [[John Dewey]] and [[George Santayana]], as well as by the work and literature of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] [[John Crowe Ransom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowe_Ransom|title=John Crowe Ransom|last=Ransom|first=John|date=|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ivor Winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvor_Winters|title=Ivor Winters|last=Winters|first=Ivor|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His art and literary interests in New York City enabled encounters with noted artists, writers, and poets of the beat generation such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Fritz Stern]], and artist [[Jacob Kainen]], with whom he formed an enduring friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/jacob-kainen-papers-9025|title=Papers of Jacob Kainen|last=Kainen|first=Jacob|date=|website=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified as the character 'Victor Villanueva' in Kerouac's ''[[On the Road]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beatbookcovers.com/kercomp/ontheroad.htm|title=Beat Book Covers "On the Road"|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat Book Covers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Latin American poet. Tejera published and translated poems as well.

A portrait of a gathering at Columbia mid-century with Tejera was printed in Fritz Stern's autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/chapters/1008-1st-ster.html|title=The Five Germanys I Have Known|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the authors, and republished in the New York Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/review/Reiss.t.html|title=Can It Happen Here?|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic highlights ===
Above all, Tejera felt strongly influenced by Justus Buchler's metaphysics of literary art (metaphysics of human production) and the exhibitive nature of philosophy reflected in Buchler's ''Metaphysics of Natural Complexes''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaphysics of Natural Complexes|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Main of Light.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Main of Light|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of Buchler is one of the most apparent in Tejera's published works. Buchler was his dissertation adviser at Columbia when he wrote ''Philosophy and the Art of Poetry'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1941882|title=Philosophy and the Art of Poetry|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Dissertation|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tejera|first=V|date=December 1956|title=Doctoral Dissertations 1956|jstor=20123579|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume= 10| issue = 2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and longtime colleague and correspondent.

Tejera lectured in History at Georgetown University from 1951 to 1954, and then taught Philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic from 1956 to 1960, Farleigh Dickinson University 1960 to 1961, and Howard University from 1961 to 1966. Afterward he accepted a permanent position of Professor of Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the State University of New York (SUNY) campus at Stony Brook. He was conferred the title of Stony Brook University Professor of Humanities in 1991, and has since received the title of University Professor Emeritus (1996).

At Stony Brook, he taught Ancient Greek Philosophy, History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, Classical Political Philosophy, American Philosophy, Ancient Greek, Philosophy of History, and [[Plato]]'s Dialogues, in a teaching career spanning 40 years.

== Research and publications ==
Tejera's extensive and varied research in the Humanities culminated in books including:

* ''Modes of Greek Thought'' (1971),&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
*''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' (1997),&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Contributions to Classic American philosophy ===
Tejera is the first American philosopher to apply Justus Buchler's modes of judgment to the study of history&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and aesthetics. Along with Beth J. Singer, [[Thelma Z. Lavine]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Horace S. Thayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-962?rskey=J6gYfy&amp;result=6|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|last=Thayer|first=Horace S.|date=|website=Oxford Reference|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-20|title=Horace Standish Thayer|url=https://sk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horace_Standish_Thayer&amp;oldid=1025944|journal=Wikipédia|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; he helped revive interest in classic American thought via the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP). He renewed interest in a John Dewey's philosophy of culture with an emphasis on poetics and rhetoric, Buchler's coordinative analysis, and philosophic historiography.

He contributed to the recovery of the [[Semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], especially its application to literary theory and philosophy ([[Semiotic literary criticism|Semiotics of Literature]]). Tejera's Semiotics books are a significant effort to mend the gap between scholars engaged in literary discourse and those who work in the social (or human) sciences and natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houser|first=Nathan|date=|title=Review of Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/houser/TEJERA.HTM|journal=Arisbe|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of art and spirituality in American philosophy permeates his Semiotics books, ''American Modern: The Path Not Taken,'' as well as later works.

His later work in American philosophy had taken two paths: (1) a theory of creative rationality via the aesthetically-aware [[Metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical Naturalism]] of Justus Buchler and Peirce's semiotics, and (2) a fuller aesthetics and poetics-oriented theory in the human sciences and in interpretation theory ([[Hermeneutics]]). His latest book, ''Two Metaphysical Naturalisms,'' serves as a companion to ''American Modern,'' dwelling on some of the practical functions of American philosophical reflection. This alignment with classic American Philosophy also contrasts with the cognitivist aesthetics of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] which turns the aesthetic object into a cognitive object while failing to recognize its dimension of feeling, or the cognitive gain available in art as art in the fullest sense which both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] and [[Justus Buchler]] defend.

== Plato's ''Dialogues'' and ''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' ==
Tejera's work in Plato studies emphasizes the nature of Plato's ''Dialogues'' as the dramatized conversational encounters and communicative interactions that their design shows them to be, as well as their character as literary works of art. He attends to the tone in which Plato's Socrates addresses his interlocutors to obtain satirical effects by persistent dialogical wit, humor and irony, often missed by readers. His published works on Plato establish that the dialogues are satirical of Spartan militarism and Pythagorean intellectuality, as well as of faction (reactionary dissent, partisanship, etc.) whether democratic or oligarchical. He has advanced this line of scholarship to counter the traditionalist reading of Plato with its predilection for ethical or political propositions, and supplanted it with the Columbia University School reading of the ''Dialogues'' through their literary construction and expressive speech.

Tejera offers the argument that nothing qualifies the works of Plato as expository tracts. Rather, they give every sign of being ''dialogical'' ''Dialogues''. That is, they are self-discovering works, highly orchestrated original queries''.'' Instead of supporting the dogma often labeled as "Platonic Idealism," Tejera follows internal clues and self-focusing devices in examining the formative prose of the ''Dialogues'' in line with the interpretational poetics developed in his literary theory volume (''Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs'').

Tejera's most widely recognized book ''Plato's Dialogues: A Dialogical Interpretation'' (c. 1984, updated and revised 1999)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One: A Structural Analysis|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1990_0022_0001_0139_0140|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato which influenced and precipitated a generation of Plato studies (cf. Gerald A. Press  editions in Further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy|last=Popkin|first=Richard|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tejera invented and invoked a unique notation to address the confusion in Plato scholarship to address the Socratic problem in these and other papers, to disambiguate Plato's Socrates from the Historical Socrates, Xenophon's Socrates, and the various interpretations claimed to be Plato's own views. "To keep track of the many ''composite'' Socrates, both of "the tradition" and of individual commentators, we use the label SocC, "[[Socrates]] sub upper-case C." (cf. ''The Philosophy of Socrates Program Guide'' p.&amp;nbsp;106).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hri.org/iagp/books/vol05.html|title="Dialogical Dynamics, Socrates, and Source-Criticism" from The Philosophy of Socrates, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Greek Philosophy in Samos Greece 1990|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=Athens, Greece|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's notations for keeping track of Socrates ===
The conventions (subscripts) he used to note the ''kinds'' of Socrates that we are liable to encounter in discussions of Greek literature and philosophy include the following: 
* SocP - [[Plato]]'s Socrates - as a dramatic character in Plato's Dialogues. Plato's Socrates teases or is polite, refutes or rationalizes, is logical in argument or paralogical, tells stories to his interlocutors, allusively satirizes, or suspends judgment, and appears as seeking for definitions which he then cannot accept. Plato's Socrates was inductive, interrogative, skeptical, anti-dogmatic and in that sense anti-systematic. He is also a story-teller, poet-quoter, myth-maker, punster, ironic etymologizer, and intellectually scrupulous. SocP frequently quotes the poets he is misinterpreted as hating.
* SocH - Historical Socrates - as a questioner, or knowledge seeker, a critical non-conformist, a critical seeker after truth and competence. The Socrates who claimed to know only that he did not know is both SocH and SocP. We only know a small number of facts regarding SocH. We do not know enough about SocH to state that there was any such thing as a "circle of Socrates". 
* SocX - [[Xenophon]]'s Socrates - based on Xenophon's testimony in his works, that Socrates is a Spartanizer, chauvinist, conventional tutor of a militarist, but not a philosopher.
* SocHc - [[Cicero]]'s Socrates - based on Cicero's testimony, as in ''Academic''a ''I''. 
* SocC - Composite Socrates - the traditional Socrates that had been handed down by the Pythagorizing or Platonist tradition of Plato-interpretation. The conventional composite reading of Plato. Also, the view of Socratism (or Socraticism) associated with the composite view, often limited to the practice of interrogation and induction, or the theory of ideas as in [[Socratic Club|I.M. Crombie]] (Doctrines), [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]] (Unwritten Doctrines), et al.  
* SocC + (x) is the notation used to specify a Plato scholar. For more instances of this notation, we found SocCa for [[John P. Anton|Anton's Socrates]], and SocCr for Rossetti's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rossettiweb.it/livio/|title=Livio Rossetti|last=Rossetti|first=Livio|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates.  
* SocD - Doctrinal Socrates - Socrates derived from a literalistic reading, as a advancing a system of doctrine.  
* SocCn - [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s Socrates - Nietzsche's attitude to Socrates. Nietzsche had characterized Plato as a doctrinal system builder of the Idealist tradition. The aphoristic Nietzsche is anti-systematic, an anti-system builder in order to be free to question his own assumptions. Nietzsche both liked and disliked the undisambiguated SocC of the 'tradition'.   
* SocDn - Nietzsche's Socrates doctrinal subscript - 'Socrates' that is found to hold different doctrines by different expositors. The Socrates that Nietzsche disliked, a composite of traits derived from Diogenes Laertius and Xenophon, a composite both a culture hero ''and'' attached to some rationalist dogmas.  
* SocU - Socrates Undisambiguated - an unknown or uncritically formed Socrates. A Socrates to which fabulous predicates are attached, as in SocC. The undistributed Socrates of "the tradition". (An undistributed middle term), e.g., "Socrates was the first to discourse on the conduct of life". This label is for the complexly ambiguous, difficult to disambiguate (or not worth disambiguating) "Socrates" of much anti-dialogical writing about Socrates that fails to practice source-criticism. This "undistributed" Socrates, as in the fallacy of the undistributed middle term, because it is so often used as such. It sanctions the avoidance of distinction between SocP and SocH, or the other [[Socrates]]. 
* SocLy - Socrates in the ''Lysis'' - the fictional report by Socrates himself of a conversation he once held. These are sophistical traits that are incompatible traits with SocP. An un-Socratic Socrates, using un-Socratic language.
* SocL - [[Diogenes Laërtius|Diogenes Laertius's]] Socrates - Socrates of the Biographical tradition, which is also historically unreliable. A view of Socrates via popular beliefs, and by beliefs, doctrines, as Laertius does. Socrates as a mishmash of contradictory attributes, but some traits coincide with traits of both SocP and SocX, all hearsay good or bad recorded about Socrates. 
* SocA - [[Aristophanes]] Socrates - the dramatic character in Aristophanes comedy ''[[The Clouds]]''.  
* SocAs - [[Leo Strauss|Strauss]]'s Aristophanean Socrates - an interpretive construction formed in response to "the ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy", derived from a non-dialogical reading of Plato.   
* SocXs - Strauss's Xenophantean Socrates - A Socrates that is accepting of the views of Ischomachus in Xenophon. Strauss's Socrates that is in the main SocX with some traits of SocP super-added and derived from a literalist reading of both which reinforce doctrines of [[Laws (dialogue)|Plato's ''Laws'']] (''Laws'' is a "posthumous" work not by Plato himself. External and internal evidence point to it as an Academic production likely issued under the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] head of [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]] [[Speusippus|Speusippos]] after Plato's death). Another notation, SocPs, Plato's Socrates according to Strauss.

Tejera is the first to utilize such conventions and standards of source-critical practices in the study of Greek Philosophy. It was the first substantial utility since the writing of [[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] on the Socratic problem&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orb.binghamton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&amp;context=sagp|title=The Socratic Problem: Some Second Thoughts|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1979|website=Binghampton University Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which modern scholars were plagued, and which had ended "in a dilemma of contradiction" (Havelock).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One A Structural Analysis|url=|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=139–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] had grouped the efforts of Plato interpretation scholars among the following 1) Sceptics, [[Olof Gigon]] and [[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], 2) Alternatives to the Sceptics, [[Gregory Vlastos]], [[Terence Irwin]], and Gerasimos X. Santas 3) and the Reconstructionists of Socraticism, [[Kenneth Dover|Kenneth J. Dover]] and [[W. K. C. Guthrie|W.K.C. Gutherie]]. This was ushered in by the earlier and now century old tradition of Plato interpretation via the [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] - [[Alfred Edward Taylor|A.E. Taylor]] thesis (my terminology, and first cited in an early article by Havelock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1934|title=The Evidence for the Teaching of Socrates|url=https://monoskop.org/images/b/ba/Havelock_Eric_A_1934_The_Evidence_for_the_Teaching_of_Socrates.pdf|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=65|pages=287–292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifty Years (And Twelve) of Classical Scholarship|last=Ross|first=Sir David|publisher=Basil Blackwell - Oxford|year=1968|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which in effect had rendered Plato as a mere reporter of the doctrines of Socrates (Theory of Forms, Ideas), and with the middle dialogues together comprising all of the historical Socrates, SocH. These concerns are also addressed in the recent works of Charles H. Kahn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plato-and-the-socratic-dialogue/E5D70E71413FE839481C150667847A15|title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are in contradistinction with Tejera's and Havelock's works that minimize the value of the early-middle-late dialogue categorization, and the [[Stylometry|stylometrics]] enforced accounts. With the utility of Tejera's conventions, modern scholars have the advantage of addressing such dilemmas in a progressive and orderly fashion, whether from classicist, philosophical and historical orientations. A fuller examination and citations of these approaches may be found in the recent work of the philologist Holger Thesleff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Thesleff|title=Holger Thesleff|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he notes Tejera's observations about the dogmatic interpretations of Plato, and the "Post-Platonic dogmatization of Platonism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Plato's Two-Level Model|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|publisher=The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters|year=1999|isbn=|location=Helsinki, Finland|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's Naturalistic view of Aristotle ===
Tejera's three books on [[Aristotle]] (''Return of the King''&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/978-0-7618-0926-5|title=The Return of the King: The Intellectual Warfare Over Democratic Athens|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Rowman Littlefield|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', Two Metaphysical Naturalisms''&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;'','' and ''Aristotle in Epitome''&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;) show how Aristotle was turned into a Platonizing logician by a long series of Alexandrian, Latin and Byzantine commentators, who in turn used Aristotle as a proper "introduction to Plato", a Plato that had been Pythagorized by the Academy (as an Academic reinterpretation of the dialogues) and initiated after his lifetime, in secondary literature. This long tradition of rendering Aristotle and misshaping of Plato is contested by Tejera as the dogmatic anti-dialogical and doxographical tradition of interpretation, and forms the basis of his inquiry into the pre-Scholastic Aristotle. These books help the reader to recover the Naturalist (nature-inquirer), and humanist Aristotle, lover of poetic drama.

== Honors ==
Professor Tejera was a founding member of the International Plato Society in [[Perugia]], Italy in 1989, a member of the International Organizing Committee for the International Conference on [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek Philosophy]], and was made an Honorary Citizen of [[Lindos]], [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]] for his work on Greek Culture in 1992. He served as Program Chair for the Committee for Aesthetics in 1968 and on the Executive Committee of the Long Island Philosophy Society in 1976. In 1986, he was Program Director for the Society for Advancement of American Philosophy conference honoring [[John Herman Randall Jr.|John H. Randall Jr.]], and [[Herbert Schneider (philosopher)|Herbert W. Schneider]].

The '''Vietnam War body count controversy '''centers on the counting of enemy dead by the US forces during the [[Vietnam War]] with issues around killing and counting unarmed civilians as enemy combatants as well as inflating the number of actual enemy KIA.  For search and destroy operations, as the objective was not to hold territory or secure populations victory was assessed by having a higher enemy body count.

==Overview==
Since the goal of the United States in the [[Vietnam War]] was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically "held" already. Instead, the US Army used body counts to show that the US was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) would lose after the [[attrition warfare]].

According to historian [[Christian Appy]], "[[search and destroy]] was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress" in [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland’s]] war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the VC out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. Since the early stages of the war did not seek to hold territory, assessments of whether an operation was considered a victory or not was entirely based on having a higher enemy killed ratio for US commanders. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a096431.pdf|title=Declassification of the BDM Study, "The Strategic Lessons Learned in Vietnam"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Defense Technical Center|pages=225–34|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;Competitions were held between units for the highest number of VC/PAVN killed in action, or KIAs. Army and marine officers knew that promotions were largely based on confirmed kills.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The pressure to produce confirmed kills resulted in massive fraud. One study revealed that 61% of American commanders considered that body counts were grossly exaggerated.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count|title=In This War, Body Count Is Ruled Out : Casualties: Gen.

== Killing and Counting Unarmed Civilians ==
It was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN operations were miscounted as "enemy KIA" as when [[free-fire zones]] were declared it was erroneously assumed all individuals were enemy combatants&lt;ref name=Bellamy&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=spc4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;|title=East Asia's Other Miracle: Explaining the Decline of Mass Atrocities|last=Bellamy|first=Alex J.|date=2017-09-29|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780191083785|location=|pages=33–34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For official US military operations reports, there are no distinctions between enemy KIA and civilian KIA since it was assumed by US forces that an area declared a free-fire zone that all individuals killed regardless of whether they were combatants or civilians were considered enemy KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thevietnamwar.info/free-fire-zone/|title=Free Fire Zone - The Vietnam War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appy&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam|last=Appy|first=Christian|publisher=UNC Chapel Hill|year=1993|isbn=|location=http://projectsmrj.pbworks.com/f/Working+Class+War+-+Christian+Appy.pdf|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Since body counts was a direct measure of operational success this often caused US battle reports to list civilians killed as enemy KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/body-count-in-vietnam.htm|title=Body Count in Vietnam {{!}} HistoryNet|website=www.historynet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of civilians killed led to the enormous discrepancy between weapons seized and 'enemy KIA' during [[Operation Speedy Express]], nearly 10,000 KIA with just 748 weapons found. Most of the enemy killed included were unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name=Bellamy/&gt; The [[My Lai Massacre]] and [[Son Thang massacre]] both reported women and children killed as "enemy combatants".

Former Marine Officer and later war-time corresponding [[Philip Caputo]] in the book [[A Rumor of War]] noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;''General Westmoreland’s strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior. Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill: to kill communists and as many of them as possible. Stack ’em like cordwood. Victory was a high body-count, defeat a low kill-ratio, war a matter of arithmetic. The pressure on unit commanders to produce enemy corpses was intense, and they in turn communicated it to their troops. This led to such practices as counting civilians as Viet Cong. ‘If it’s dead and Vietnamese, it’s VC,’ was our rule of thumb in the bush. It is not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and predilection for taking it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DMeJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156|title=The Vietnam Reader: The Definitive Collection of American Fiction and Nonfiction on the War|last=O'Nan|first=Stewart|last2=Caputo|first2=Philip|date=1998|publisher=Anchor Books|year=|isbn=9780385491181|location=|pages=156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Christian Appy]] in ''Working Class War'' documents widespread atrocities committed by US forces, especially towards the latter 'withdrawal' period as well.&lt;ref name=Appy/&gt;{{rp|267–78}} Accidental or deliberate killings through napalming, artillery and others were reported to have frequently either been re-attributed to the PAVN/VC or claimed as "VC" casualties by US forces.&lt;ref name=Appy/&gt;{{rp|267-78}} Other reported incidents include the ambushing or attacking unarmed groups of men such as fishermen or farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vQpe_he59K4C&amp;pg=PA43|title=After the Massacre: Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai|last=Kwon|first=Heonik|last2=Kwŏn|first2=Hŏn-ik|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520247963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were reported as "Viet Cong" as well as any civilians wearing black pajamas and civilians running away from helicopters, including women and children who were again reported as "enemy combatants" KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PeFK5dkYZsEC|title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|year=|isbn=9780805095470|location=|pages=121–128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of this was the purported killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians by [[Tiger Force]], following grievous losses from a PAVN ambush, in which the unit proceeded to kill countless women, children and crippled individuals during [[Operation Wheeler/Wallowa]].&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=i4KyDQAAQBAJ|title=The Vietnam War: An Intimate History|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C.|last2=Burns|first2=Ken|date=2017-09-05|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781524733100|location=|pages=235–238|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Jonathan Schell]] who reported on [[Operation Cedar Falls]] observed the general inability of US forces to discern VC from unarmed civilians during, based on tacit ignorance of the culture and the murder of civilians on whim or suspicion, for example in which a man riding a bicycle past a patrol near his town was shot and subsequently declared a VC, and the shooting of a woman carrying medical supplies, who was then declared an enemy combatant serving as a medic post-mortem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schell|first=Jonathan|title=The Village of Ben Suc|journal=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/07/15/the-village-of-ben-suc|date=15 July 1967|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body Count Inflation ==
In the summer of 1970, [[H. Norman Schwarzkopf]] writes, "the Army War College issued a scathing report," that, among other things, "criticised the Army's obsession with meaningless statistics and was especially damning on the subject of body counts in Vietnam. A young captain had told the investigators a sickening story: he'd been under so much pressure from headquarters to boost his numbers that he'd nearly gotten into a fistfight with a South Vietnamese officer over whose unit would take credit for various enemy body parts. Many officers admitted they had simply inflated their reports to placate headquarters."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf/Petre, "It Doesn't Take A Hero," Bantam Books, 1992, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The junior officers queried in the 1970 "Study on Military Professionalism" (seemingly the study that Schwarzkopf refers to) had particularly violent reactions to instructions on the body count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-on-going-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-army|title=The On-Going Battle for the Soul of the Army {{!}} Small Wars Journal|website=smallwarsjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They told of being given quotas and being told to go out and recount until they had sufficient numbers. “Nobody out there believes the body count,” was the reportedly common response."

In [[Lewis Sorley]]'s book ''A Better War'', published in 1999 after studies of voluminous previously-secret papers of [[Creighton Abrams]], he writes "Body count may have been the most corrupt - and corrupting - measure of progress in the whole mess. Certainly the consensus of senior Army leaders, the generals who commanded in Vietnam, strongly indicates that it was. A survey found that sixty-one percent of officers believed that the body count was often inflated. Typical comments by the respondents were that it was "a fake - totally worthless," that "the immensity of the false reporting is a blot on the honor of the Army," and that they were grossly exaggerated by many units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like McNamara and Westmoreland."&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorley|first=Lewis|title=A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam|publisher=Harvest|year=2007|isbn=9780156013093|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secretary of Defense]] [[Chuck Hagel|Charles Hagel]] states that U.S. commanders on the ground inflated body counts since this was how their success was judged."You used that body count, commanding officers did, as the metric and measurement of how successful you were...", hence providing a positive incentive for deliberate fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postmortem/2009/08/vietnam_still_resonates_in_the.html|title=A Vietnam War That Never Ends|author=Patricia Sullivan|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Dak To]] and [[the Battle of the Slopes]], one company commander alleges after losing 78 men while finding 10 enemy bodies, the "enemy body count" figures was deliberately re-written as 475 by General [[William Westmoreland]] and released as official operational reports.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;{{rp|193}}

Shelby Stanton states that accurate assessments of PAVN and VC losses were largely impossible due to lack of corresponding statistics, the fact that allied ground units were often unable to confirm artillery and aerial kills and gamesmanship practised by units under pressure to "produce results." American losses were subject to statistical manipulation as well. For instance, dying soldiers put aboard medical evacuation helicopters were often counted as only wounded in unit after-action tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_an_American_Army.html?id=nm-ov7lIe_AC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780891418276|location=|pages=xvi-xvii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Mark Woodruff states that when the Vietnamese Government released its actual losses in April 1995 as being 1.1&amp;nbsp;million dead, US body count figures he claimed they had actually underestimated communist losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodruff|first=Mark|title=Unheralded Victory: Who won the Vietnam war?|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|isbn=0004725190|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the role played by '''women in the military in the Americas''', particularly in the [[History of women in the United States|United States]] and [[History of women in Canada|Canada]] from the First World War to modern times.

==Brazil==

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, it was not until 1943, during World War II, that women officially entered the Brazilian Army. They included 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army.  All volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces. After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

In 1992, the School of Army Administration (Salvador - BA) enrolled the first group of 49 women, by conducting tender. And in 1996, Maria Quitéria de Jesus, the Paladina of Independence, was recognized in the army ranks, as Patron of Table Complementary Brazilian Army officers. The Army established the Military Female Volunteer for Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and top-level Nurses (MFDV) in 1996. At that time, they entered the first class of 290 female volunteers to provide military service in healthcare. This merger took place in all twelve military regions of the country. 

In 1997 the Military Institute of Engineering—IME (Rio de Janeiro—RJ) enrolled the first group of 10 women students to be included in Table Military Engineers (QEM). In the same year the School of the Army Health—Essex (Rio de Janeiro RJ) enrolled and graduated the first group of medical officers, dentists, pharmaceutical, veterinary and top-level nurses in the framework of the Army Health.

In 1998, the Army established the Stage Technical Service for higher education professionals than healthcare. At that time, he entered the first class of 519 women lawyers, administrators of businesses, accountants, teachers, computer analysts, engineers, architects, journalists, and other areas of human and exact sciences, serving the needs of Official Temporary Technical (OTT) of Institution. In 2001 the Army Health School allowed the enrollment of women to participate in the public tender for the filling of vacancies in the Health Sergeant Course, which started to operate in 2002.

==Canada==

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. Canadian women were also organized into possible uniformed home guard units, undertaking military training in [[paramilitary]] groups. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada’s part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. These included the standardization of enlistment criteria, equal pay and pensions, and allowing women to enroll in all aspects of the Canadian armed forces and making it possible for women to reach any rank. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]], and four years later the first woman qualified for the Canadian skydiving demonstration team, the Skyhawks.

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. 1981 saw the first female navigator and helicopter pilot, and in 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with no restrictions in place, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada’s first female infantry soldier, first female gunner, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1990 the Ministers Advisory Board on Women in the Canadian Forces was created, and in 1994 Wendy Clay was promoted to [[Major-General]]. In 2000 Major [[Micky Colton]] became the first female to log 5,000 flying hours in a [[C-130 Hercules]]. Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first female submariner in 2003.

Canadian women have also become clearance divers, and commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships.

On May 17, 2006 [[Captain (Canadian army and air force)|Captain]] [[Nichola Goddard]] became the first Canadian woman killed in combat during operations in [[Afghanistan]].

[[File:080930-110605 - SGT Lisa Morales awaits turn.jpg|thumb|Two female U.S. Army soldiers in September 2008.]]
One of the first American woman soldiers was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman. Finally, at the end of the hostilities her secret was discovered—even so, [[George Washington]] gave her an [[honorable discharge]]. She later lectured on her experiences and became a champion of [[women's rights]]. Another female soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was  [[Anna Maria Lane]] of [[Virginia]], who enlisted with her husband in 1776 and fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of Germantown]]. &lt;ref&gt;T [https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&amp;q=Anna+Maria+Lane#v=snippet&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Lane&amp;f=false endrich, Lisa Frank, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadway, Sandra Gioia. “Anna Maria Lane: An Uncommon Soldier of the American Revolution.” Virginia Cavalcade 37, no. 3 (1988): 134–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], about 250 women have been found to have enlisted, counting both sides, and specialists believe that the total is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mtsu.edu/tps/Women_and_the_Civil_War.pdf Women and the Civil War], Middle Tennessee State U and Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeAnne Blanton.

''Prologue Magazine'' 25:1, Spring 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was not generally a crime to for a woman to enlist, but it was considered improper and women only signed up claiming to be men.  For example, [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman. She served in the 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Her complete letters describing her experiences as a female soldier in the Union Army are reproduced in the book, ''An Uncommon Soldier: The Civil War Letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Pvt. Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862–1864''.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, Sarah Rosetta, and Lauren M. Cook. 1994.

A letter written by Annie Oakley to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. [[Annie Oakley]], sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] Show, wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley's offer was not accepted for the [[Spanish–American War]].

In World War I, the first American women enlisted into the regular armed forces were 13,000 women admitted into active duty in the Navy and Marines and a much smaller number admitted into the Coast Guard. The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in clerical positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. These women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.

[[Women's Army Corps|The Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. However, political pressures stalled attempts to create more roles for women in the American Armed Forces. Women saw combat during [[World War II]], first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on December 7, 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]] and [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women’s Reserve]] were also created during this conflict. In July 1943 a bill was signed removing 'auxiliary' from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, making it an official part of the regular army. In 1944 WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War Two and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

After World War Two, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953 many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 during the conflict.

Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

The [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]] began accepting female missile technicians in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/women_chron/chron1970s.html |title=The Women of Redstone Arsenal |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] missile units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Busse |first=Charlane |date=July 1978 |title=First women join Pershing training |journal=[[Field Artillery (magazine)|Field Artillery Journal]] |publisher=[[United States Army Field Artillery School]] |page=40 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/famag/1978/JUL_AUG_1978/JUL_AUG_1978_PAGES_40_43.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1978 |title=The Journal interviews: 1LT Elizabeth A.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots: [[Jane Skiles O'Dea]], [[Barbara Allen Rainey]], [[Rosemary Bryant Mariner]], [[Judith Neuffer|Judith Ann Neuffer]], Ana Marie Fuqua, and Joellen Drag Oslund. The Congressionally mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933|Ocala Star-Banner August 23, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1990s/1997/mj97/ppp.pdf|Naval Aviation News, May–June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s involvement in [[Grenada]] in 1983 saw over 200 women serving; however, none of these took part in direct combat. Some women, such as Lt Col [[Eileen Collins]] or Lt Celeste Hayes, flew transport aircraft carrying wounded or assault teams, however they were not deemed to have been in direct combat. Several hundred women took part in operations in [[Panama]] in 1989, in non-combat roles.

On December 20, 1989, Capt Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women MPs to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the Panamanian Defense force. From a command center about a half-mile from the kennel she ordered her troops to fire warning shots. The Panamanians returned fire until threatened by artillery attack, fleeing into nearby woods. Bray advanced to the kennel to try to stop them, using the cover of a ditch to reach the building. No enemy dead were found, but a cache of weapons was recovered.

The 1991 [[Gulf War]] brought greater media attention to the role of women in the American armed forces. A senior woman pilot at the time, Colonel Kelly Hamilton, commented that "[t]he conflict was an awakening for the people in the US. They suddenly realised there were a lot of women in the military." Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. They were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Many came under fire, however, and there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Women Were There!]&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that of the USS Mount HOOD, AE-29, Pacific Fleet ammunitions carrier in Battle Group Bravo. The Mt. Hood's sister ship, which was all male, was grounded after hitting a mine. The Mt. Hood, regardless of having at least 32 women on board, the first women to board that class of vessel in the USN, filled in. The women aboard the USS Mt. Hood, AE-29, may be the enlisted Navy's very first CONGRESSIONALLY RECOGNIZED females ordered to combat in a Congressionally declared war. That is not to say that they were the first females in combat because, as above illustrates, women have fought the front lines, whether they were afforded official Congressional recognition for their service or not. At any rate, this small ship tackled her duties and from the women leaders aboard came the first African-American female Admiral in the history of the United States Navy, Admiral and second in command of the United States Navy as Vice Chief of Naval Operations: Admiral Michelle Howard.&lt;ref&gt;MM3 Dorothy D. Meindok, Esq./ USS Mount Hood AE-29 sailor&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, women can serve on American combat ships, including in command roles, and on submarines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/us-navy-submarines-women US navy lifts ban on women submariners (''The Guardian'' (UK), 29 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not permitted to participate in special forces programs such as [[Navy SEALs]]. Women enlisted soldiers are barred from serving in Infantry, Special Forces, however female enlisted members and officers can hold staff positions in every branch of the Army except infantry and armor. Women can however serve on the staffs of infantry and armor units at Division level and above, and be members of Special Operations Forces. Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. military. Although Army regulations ban women from infantry assignments, some females are detailed to accompany male infantry units to handle searches of Iraqi women.

[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|left|thumb|[[Jessica Lynch]] after being rescued in 2003]]
The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the Virginia Military Institute allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting J. Ruth Bader Ginsburg) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.”

During [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] in 2003, American soldiers [[Shoshana Johnson]], the first African-American and first Hispanic female prisoner of war, and [[Jessica Lynch]] were captured while serving in Iraq. In the same action, [[Lori Piestewa]], a U.S. soldier, died after driving her Humvee through enemy fire in an attempt to escape an ambush, earning a Purple Heart. She had just rescued Jessica Lynch, whose vehicle had crashed.

Also in 2003, Major [[Kim Campbell (pilot)|Kim Campbell]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for landing her combat damaged [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over [[Baghdad]].

In a recent scandal, U.S Army Reservists [[Lynndie England]] and [[Sabrina Harman]] were convicted by [[court martial]] of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|cruelty and maltreatment of prisoners]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

[[File:Leigh Ann Hester medal.jpg|thumb|upright|SGT [[Leigh Ann Hester]], awarded the [[Silver Star]] for direct combat]]
SGT Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest US decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. Female medical personnel had been awarded the same medal, but not for actual combat. She was a team leader of [[Raven 42]], a [[Military Police]] squad that broke up an ambush roughly three to four times its strength. Specialist Ashley Pullen received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. The squad leader, SSG Timothy Nein, had originally received the Silver Star, but his award was later upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. SGT Jason Mike, the unit's medic, also received the Silver Star.
