      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12108">In [[economics]], an '''absentee landlord''' is a person who owns and [[renting|rent]]s out a [[profit (economics)|profit]]-earning [[property]], but does not live within the property's local economic region. The term "absentee ownership" was popularised by [[economist]] [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s 1923 book of the same name, ''Absentee ownership''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Absentee ownership|author=Veblen, Thorstein|isbn=1-56000-922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used in a local context, the term refers to a [[landlord]] of a house or other [[real estate]], who [[lease]]s the property to [[leasehold estate|tenant]]s, but fails to ensure that proper [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] is done on it, or does only the minimum required by law (the term [[slumlord]] is also used to describe such a person).  This in turn leads to what may appear to be [[abandoned building]]s, causing significantly lowered [[property value]]s and [[urban blight]].

[[Tax policy]] seems, overall, to favour absentee ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Corporate Tax Incentives: The American Version of Industrial Policy|publisher=Journal of Economic Issues|date=March 1985|volume=XIX|number=1|jstor=4225540}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some jurisdictions seek to extract money from absentee owners by taxing land.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Should Land and Capital be Taxed at a Uniform Rate?|author=Lee, Kangoh|jstor=3131847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absentee ownership has sometimes put the absentee owners at risk of loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Governance through ownership: Centuries of practice, decades of research|author=N Rajagopalan|publisher=The Academy of Management|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Ireland before 1903 ==
{{anchor|Absentee landlords in Ireland}}&lt;!--Old heading name.--&gt;
Absentee landlords were a highly significant issue in the [[history of Ireland]]. During the course of 16th and 17th centuries, most of the land in Ireland was confiscated from Irish Catholic landowners during the [[Plantations of Ireland]] and granted to Scottish and [[English People|English]] settlers who were members of the [[established church]]es (the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] at the time); in Ulster, many of the landowners were Scottish Presbyterians. Seized land was given to Scottish and English nobles and soldiers, some of whom rented it out to the Irish, while they themselves remained residents of Scotland and England. By 1782 the Irish patriot [[Henry Grattan]] deplored that some Â£800,000 was transferred annually to such landlords. He attempted to place an extra tax on remittances to the British. But many absentees also reinvested part of their rents into roads and bridges, to improve local economies, that are still seen today. A notable beneficial absentee in the 19th century was [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who went into debt to develop his part of Sligo; an investment that eventually paid off.

By the 1800s resentment grew as not only were the absentee landlords [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant]] (while most tenants were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and forbidden to inherit land), but their existence meant that the wealth of the land was always exported. This system became particularly detrimental to the native population during the [[Great Irish Famine]] when, despite Ireland being a [[Great Irish Famine#Food exports to the British mainland|net exporter of food]], millions starved, died of disease, or emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, David (2002), Ireland: History of a Nation, New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset, {{ISBN|1-84205-164-4}} page 226&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following, the land issue with the [[Irish Land League]]'s [[Land War]] became a significant issue in Ireland. The land issue was one of the historic factors which resulted in Ireland's troubled history until the 1920s, though it had largely been addressed legislatively by 1903 in the [[Irish Land Acts]].

== On Prince Edward Island before 1867 ==
{{anchor|Absentee landlords in Prince Edward Island}}&lt;!--Old heading name.--&gt;
An absentee landlord crisis was a key factor in [[Prince Edward Island]]'s decision to become a part of Canada when the idea of [[Confederation]] was proposed in 1867. In the mid-1760s, a survey team divided the Island into 67 lots. On July 1, 1767, these properties were allocated to supporters of [[King George III]] by means of a lottery. Ownership of the land remained in the hands of landlords in England, angering Island settlers who were unable to gain title to land on which they worked and lived. Significant rent charges (to absentee landlords) created further anger. The land had been given to the absentee landlords with a number of conditions attached regarding upkeep and settlement terms; many of these conditions were not satisfied. Islanders spent decades trying to convince the Crown to confiscate the lots, however the descendants of the original owners were generally well connected to the British government and refused to give up the land.

In 1853, the Island government passed the Land Purchase Act which empowered them to purchase lands from those owners who were willing to sell, and then resell the land to settlers for low prices. This scheme collapsed when the Island ran short of money to continue with the purchases. Many of these lands also were fertile, and were some of the key factors to sustaining Prince Edward Island's economy.

In 1864, the Island government saw union with Canada as a possible solution to the landlord crisis. This followed a [[rent strike]] and riots on the Island. At the [[Charlottetown Conference]], delegates proposed a fund to purchase landlords' holdings if the Island joined Confederation. Several weeks later at the Quebec Conference this offer was withdrawn. The Island resolved not to enter Confederation as a result. The government refused offers from the other provinces and finally relented in 1873 after the local economy was pushed near to collapse. Under the terms of union, Canada agreed to provide the Island with an $800 000 fund to purchase the remaining absentee holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/confederation/023001-2952-e.html "Library and Archives Canada"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211190505/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/confederation/023001-2952-e.html |date=2006-02-11 }}, Collections Canada&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1875, the ''[[Land Purchase Act (1875)|Land Purchase Act]]'' was enacted to force owners of the large estates to sell their holdings to the provincial government.

The Island's experience with absentee landlords affects its land ownership laws to this day.  Non-residents are not permitted to purchase land in excess of two [[hectare]]s without approval from the [[Cabinet of Prince Edward Island|cabinet]].  In 2009 an American was fined [[Canadian dollar|$]]29,000 for contravening these laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/american-fined-for-buying-p-e-i-land-1.817457 American fined for buying P.E.I. land] CBC News (Nov 13, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Palestine before 1948 ==
{{anchor|Absentee landlords in Palestine before 1948}}&lt;!--Old heading name.--&gt;
The Ottoman Empire embarked on a systematic [[land reform]] program in the second half of the 19th Century.  Two of the new laws were the 1858 land registration law and the 1873 emancipation act.

Prior to 1858, land in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] since 1516, was cultivated or occupied mainly by peasants. Land ownership was regulated by people living on the land according to customs and traditions. Usually, land was communally owned by village residents, though land could be owned by individuals or families.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"&gt;[http://www.beki.org/landlaw.html Ottoman Land Registration Law as a Contributing Factor in the Israeli-Arab Conflict], Jon-Jay Tilsen, Congregation Beth ElâKeser Israel (retrieved August 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858 the Ottoman Empire introduced ''[[The Ottoman Land Code of 1858]]'', requiring land owners to register ownership. The reasons behind the law were twofold. (1) to increase tax revenue, and (2) to exercise greater state control over the area. Peasants, however, saw no need to register claims, for several reasons:&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;

* land owners were subject to military service in the Ottoman Army
* general opposition to official regulations from the Ottoman Empire
* evasion of taxes and registration fees to the Ottoman Empire

The registration process itself was open to misregistration and manipulation. Land collectively owned by village residents ended up registered to one villager, and merchants and local Ottoman administrators took the opportunity to register large areas of land to their own name. The result was land that became the legal property of people who had never lived on the land, while the peasants, having lived there for generations, retained possession, but became tenants of absentee owners.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;

The [[1856 Emancipation Reform Decree]] and [[1869 citizenship law]] was interpreted as giving Jews the right to own land in Ottoman Syria under their own name.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigue, Aron, ''French Jews, Turkish Jews: the Alliance israÃ©lite universelle and the politics of Jewish schooling in Turkey, 1860-1925'', Indiana University Press, 1990, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The changing of this law (the change occurring at the same time as the [[Emancipation Proclamation|freeing of the Africans in the United States]] and in South America and the [[emancipation of the serfs in Russia]] (held in slavery by the Russian landowning class) was a part of the worldwide 19th century movement towards emancipation and civil rights for oppressed minorities.  This 1873 secular land reform/civil rights law was popularly confused with a religious law and it was held as a "humiliation to Islam that Jews should own a part of the Muslim [[Ummah]]". The confusion between religious and secular law made the laws (ended in 1873) against Jewish ownership of land 'religious laws'. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Over the course of the next decades land became increasingly concentrated on fewer hands; the peasants continued to work on the land, giving landlords a share of the harvest. This led to both an increased level of [[Palestinian nationalism]] as well as civil unrest.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howlett012001"&gt;[http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/34-01/howlett.html Palestinian Private Property Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175245/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/34-01/howlett.html |date=2014-07-14 }} Stacy Howlett, Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law (Volume 34 number 1, January 2001, retrieved August 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the area witnessed an increased flow of Jewish immigrants who did not restrict themselves to the cities where their concentration offered some protection from persecution. These new Jews came hoping to create a new future in what they regarded as the homeland of their ancestors. Organizations created to aid the Jewish migration to Palestine also bought land from absentee landowners. Jewish immigrants then settled on the land, sometimes replacing peasants already living there.&lt;ref name="tilsen20060814"/&gt;&lt;ref name="howlett012001"/&gt; A steady arrival of Jewish immigrants from 1882 led to several peasant insurgencies, recorded from as early as 1884-1886.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Abu Talib Yahya''' (951 - 1033) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaydiyyah]] sect in 1020-1033.

Like his elder brother and predecessor [[al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad]], Abu Talib Yahya was a prominent man of learning and a descendant of Imam [[Hasan bin Ali]]. He succeeded al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad in the imamate of the Zaidi territories in [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and [[Dailamites|Deylaman]] in [[Persia]], formally as "[[caliph]]".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', Supplement, Vol. I. Leiden 1937, p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time there were two major [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] territories, namely the area south of the [[Caspian Sea]] and the highlands of [[Yemen]]. For many years after the death of imam [[al-Mahdi al-Husayn]] in 1013, no local imam was appointed in the Yemeni territory. In Zaidi [[historiography]], al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad and Abu Talib Yahya are sometimes listed as such, although they never visited Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;List in Cornelis van Arendonk, ''Les dÃ©buts de l'imamat zaidite au Yemen''. Leiden 1960; Cesare Ansalsi, ''Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda''. Roma 1933, p. 134; http://www.hukam.net/family.php?fam=2.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Adrenocorticotropic hormone''' is used as a '''[[medication]]''' and as [[Medical test#By method|diagnostic agent]] in the [[ACTH stimulation test]].&lt;ref name="IndexNominum2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elks2014/&gt;{{rp|316,1165}}&lt;ref name="MortonHall2012" /&gt;{{rp|84,271}}

The form that is purified from pig [[pituitary gland]]s is known as '''corticotropin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]])&lt;ref name="IndexNominum2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&amp;pg=PA275|date=January 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=275â}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elks2014&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The form that is made synthetically is '''tetracosactide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''tetracosactrin''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]) and '''cosyntropin''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), and the [[acetate]] [[ester]], '''tetracosactide acetate''' ([[Japanese Accepted Name|JAN]]), also known as '''tetracosactrin acetate''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]).&lt;ref name="Elks2014"/&gt;{{rp|1165}}&lt;ref name="MortonHall2012"/&gt;{{rp|271}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&amp;pg=PA1005|date=January 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=1005â}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the first 24 (of a total of 39) [[amino acid]]s of ACTH and retains full function of the parent peptide.&lt;ref name="Elks2014"/&gt;{{rp|1165}}  Tetracosactide stimulates the release of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s, and is used for the [[ACTH stimulation test]] to assess [[adrenal gland]] function.&lt;ref name="MortonHall2012" /&gt;{{rp|271}}

== Medical uses ==
Both corticotropin and tetracosactide have been used for diagnostic purposes to determine adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly in [[Addison's disease]], via the [[ACTH stimulation test]].&lt;ref name=Gettig2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenDiagnostic/&gt; However, as of 2015 the US label for corticotropin does not include diagnostic use.&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;

Both corticotropin and tetracosactide have been used for therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/&gt; In the US the tetracosactide label is limited to diagnosis&lt;ref name=Gettig2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/&gt; but the UK label provides for therapeutic uses.&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/&gt;

In the US corticotropin is used to treat [[epileptic spasms]] in infants, acute exacerbations of [[multiple sclerosis]] in adults; acute episodes of [[psoriatic arthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[ankylosing spondylitis]]; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and systemic [[dermatomyositis]]; for skin conditions like severe [[erythema multiforme]] and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]; for [[serum sickness]]; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as [[keratitis]], [[iritis]], [[iridocyclitis]], diffuse posterior [[uveitis]], [[choroiditis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[chorioretinitis]], and anterior segment inflammation;  [[sarcoidosis]] in the lungs; and to treat [[edema]] in certain [[nephrotic syndrome]]s.&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;

In the UK tetracosactide is used for short-term therapy in conditions for which [[glucocorticoids]] are usually used but for some reason should not be; some uses include use for people who don't respond to glucocorticoids or cannot tolerate them who have [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or [[osteoarthrosis]].&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/&gt;

== Contraindications ==
In the US the only contraindication for tetracosactide for diagnostic use is hypersensitivity to ADCH&lt;ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/&gt; but in the UK, regulators placed contraindications for hypersensitivity to ADCH and additionally, for people with allergic disorders including asthma, acute psychosis, infectious diseases, peptic ulcer, refractory heart failure, [[Cushing's syndrome]], treatment of primary adrenocortical insufficiency and adrenocongenital syndrome.&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenDiagnostic/&gt;

The same contraindications that were applied in the UK for diagnostic use of tetracosactide, apply for therapeutic use of both tetracosactide and corticotropin in the US and UK.&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/&gt;

In addition, the US label for corticotropin for therapeutic uses includes contraindications for people who have recently had surgery, and people with scleroderma, osteoporosis, uncontrolled hypertension, or sensitivity to proteins of porcine origin; in addition the infection diseases systemic fungal infection, ocular herpes simplex, and infants who have congenital infections are specified.  The label also notes that people taking corticotropin for immunosuppression should not be given live vaccines.&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
People taking corticotropin or tetracosactide are more likely to get infections, and are at risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA) suppression and [[Cushing's syndrome]].&lt;ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/&gt;

== Pharmacology ==
In the normal situation, ACTH is released from the [[pituitary gland]] at the base of the brain. It acts on the adrenal glands to stimulate the production of steroid hormones ([[glucocorticoid]]s). If the adrenal glands are healthy, a single injection of tetracosactide results in a rise in blood [[cortisol]] (hydrocortisone) concentrations in 30 minutes. If the adrenal glands appear not to be working then tetracosactide injection can be given to check whether the problem is due to diseased or damaged adrenals or due to lack of pituitary ACTH.

Tetracosactide stimulates the release of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s, and is used for the [[ACTH stimulation test]] to assess [[adrenal gland]] function.&lt;ref name="MortonHall2012" /&gt;{{rp|271}}

== Chemistry ==
The synthetic form consists of the first 24 (of a total of 39) [[amino acid]]s of ACTH and retains full function of the parent peptide.&lt;ref name="Elks2014"/&gt;{{rp|1165}}

In Canada, Synacthen Depot's pricing increased by 2000% in 2015, causing some provincial single payer authorities to delist the drug from funded medications. The increase in the drug's price came after [[Mallinckrodt]] acquired Questcor and its drug portfolio, which included the worldwide rights to Synacthen Depot. Prior to the price increase,  Mallinckrodt claims that the drug was manufactured at a loss. Some have claimed that the price increase is abusive.&lt;ref name=CBC-2015-11-16&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/infantile-seizures-drug-1.3318183 |title= 2,000% price hike for infant seizure drug called 'absurd' |author= Kelly Crowe |publisher= CBC News |date= 16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug had been priced at $33 but rose to $680 per vial. As an off-patent pharmaceutical, a similar drug, differing in formulation, available in Europe, made by a different manufacturer, sells for $8 per vial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Monday November 16th 2015 |date= 16 November 2015 |series= The National |publisher= CBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alacalufe''', also known as the '''KawÃ©sqar''', '''Kaweskar''', '''Alacaluf''' or '''Halakwulup''' (meaning "mussel eater" in [[Yaghan]]), are an [[indigenous people of South America|indigenous people]] who live in [[Chilean Patagonia]], specifically in the [[Brunswick Peninsula]], and [[Wellington Island|Wellington]], [[Santa InÃ©s Island|Santa InÃ©s]], and [[DesolaciÃ³n]] islands of the western area of [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Their traditional language is known as [[KawÃ©sqar language|KawÃ©sqar]]; it is [[Endangered language|endangered]] as few native speakers survive.

==Etymology==
The English and other Europeans initially adopted the name that the [[Yahgan]], a competing [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribe whom they met first in central and southern Tierra del Fuego, used for these people: '''Alacaluf''' or '''Halakwulup''' (meaning "mussel eater" in [[Yaghan]]). Their own name for themselves (autonym) is KawÃ©sqar.

== Economy ==
Like the Yahgan in southern Chile and Argentina, the KawÃ©sqar were a [[nomad]]ic seafaring people, called canoe-people by some anthropologists. They made canoes that were eight to nine meters long and one meter wide, which would hold a family and its dog.&lt;ref name="messier"&gt;[http://www.indigenousgeography.si.edu/community.aspx?commID=5&amp;lang=eng Patricia Messier Loncuante, "KawÃ©sqar Community"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67W8sObk7?url=http://www.indigenousgeography.si.edu/community.aspx?commID=5&amp;lang=eng |date=2012-05-08 }}, National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 12 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They continued this fishing, nomadic practice until the twentieth century, when they were moved into settlements on land. Because of their maritime culture, the KawÃ©sqar have never farmed the land.

== Population ==
[[File:Pueblos indigenas de Chile.svg|thumb|center|700px|Distribution of the pre-Hispanic people of Chile, north is to the right]]
The total population of the KawÃ©sqar was estimated not to exceed 5,000. They ranged from the area between the [[Gulf of Penas]] (Golfo de Penas) to the north and the [[Brecknock Peninsula]] (PenÃ­nsula de Brecknock) to the south.&lt;ref name="messier"/&gt; Like other indigenous peoples, they suffered high fatalities from endemic European [[infectious diseases]], to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Their environment was disrupted as Europeans began to settle in the area in the late 1880s.

In the 1930s many remaining Alacaluf were relocated to [[Wellington Island]], in the town of [[Puerto EdÃ©n]], to shield them from pressures from the majority culture. Later they moved further south, to [[Puerto Natales]] and [[Punta Arenas]].

In the 21st century, few KawÃ©sqar remain. The 2002 census found 2,622 people identifying as KawÃ©sqar (defined as those who still practiced their native culture or spoke their native language). In 2006, only 15 full-blooded members remained, but numerous [[mestizo]] have KawÃ©sqar ancestry. Lessons in the KawÃ©sqar language are part of the local curriculum, but few native speakers remain to encourage daily use of their traditional language.
 
===Tribes and languages===
Adwipliin, AksÃ¡nas, Alacaluf, CÃ¡len ([[CÃ¡lenches]], Calenes,), [[Caucahue]], Enoo, [[Lecheyel]], [[TaÃ­jataf]] (Tayataf), Yequinahuere (Yequinahue, [[Yekinauer]]).

By 1884 [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]], an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]] based in Ushuaia who had been serving and studying the indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego since the late 1860s, and his son Despard compiled a 1200-word vocabulary for the [[KawÃ©sqar language]]. It was in the form of a manuscript.&lt;ref name="furlong"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Furlong |first=Charles Wellington |authorlink=Charles W. Furlong |date=December 1915 |title=The Haush And Ona, Primitive Tribes Of Tierra Del Fuego |journal=Proceedings of the Nineteenth International Congress of Americanists |volume= |issue= |pages=446â447 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA432 |accessdate=2009-08-16 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous missionaries and anthropologists moved among the indigenous peoples to aid, record and study them.

==Treatment of KawÃ©skar by Europeans==
[[File:The earth and its inhabitants (1882) (14591030248).jpg|thumb|"Alakaluf fuegians, dressed in huanaco skins" (ca. 1882).]]
In 1881, European anthropologists took eleven KawÃ©skar people from [[Patagonia]] to be exhibited in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in [[Paris]], and in the [[Berlin Zoological Garden]]. Only four survived to return to Chile. Early in 2010, the remains of five of the seven who died in Europe were repatriated from the [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland, where they had been held for studies. Upon the return of the remains, the president of Chile formally apologized for the state having allowed these indigenous people to be taken out of the country to be exhibited and treated like animals.&lt;ref name="130 aÃ±os despuÃ©s regresan los kawÃ©sqar"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/01/100114_1626_chile_indigenas_gtg.shtml "130 aÃ±os despuÃ©s regresan los kawÃ©sqar"], BBC.co.uk, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16473">'''[[Belize]]'s social structure''' is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, [[Power (philosophy)|power]], and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]]n societies, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[El Salvador]]. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that has figured so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbors.&lt;ref name=sbs&gt;Rutheiser, Charles C., "Structure of Belizean Society". In Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of a relatively small local elite, most of whom are either white, light-skinned [[Creole peoples|Creole]], or [[Mestizo]]. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle group does not constitute a unified [[social class]], but rather a number of middle-class and [[working-class]] groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group from the grass roots majority of the [[Belizean people]].&lt;ref name=sbs/&gt;

==The upper sector==

The elite is a small, socially distinct group whose base of social power lies not in [[landownership]], but in its control of the institutions that mediate relations between Belize and the outside world. The principal economic interests of the elite include commercial and financial enterprises, [[retail trade]], local manufacturing, the state apparatus, and, to a much lesser extent, export agriculture.&lt;ref name=us&gt;Rutheiser, Charles C., "The upper sector". In Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belizean elite consists of people of different status, prestige, and [[ethnicity]]. At the top of the power hierarchy are local whites and light-skinned descendants of the nineteenth-century Creole elite. The next group consists of Creole and Mestizo commercial and professional families whose ancestors first came to political and economic prominence during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Next in status are some of the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] merchant families who immigrated to Belize in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

The more recently arrived [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[India]]n families comprise another elite group, distinguished from the remaining upper sector by length of residence in the country and by cultural differences. Groups within the elite socialize primarily among themselves.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Shared economic interests and business dealings bond the different segments of the elite. Other cultural factors also play a role. Intermarriage binds several of the elite families together, although usually without transgressing [[Interracial marriage|ethnic]] or [[Interfaith marriage|religious]] boundaries. Religion also serves as a partial unifying force; a number of the oldest and most prominent Creole families share the [[Catholicism]] of the Mestizo commercial elite.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Because [[Belize City]] is the center of the nation's commercial life, the majority of elite families live or maintain a residence there, although some prominent families are based in the district towns. In Belize City, elite families live in the same ocean-front neighborhoods, belong to the same social clubs, and enjoy a similar lifestyle centered around the extravagant conspicuous consumption of [[Import|imported goods]].&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Education also serves to unify the upper sector of society. Religious affiliation formerly largely determined which [[Parochial school|schools]] children attended. With the decline of the [[Anglican]] and [[Methodist]] school systems, most elite children, regardless of faith, attend two of Belize's premier [[Catholic school|Catholic institutions]], which provide [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[post-secondary education]]. Even after the expansion of secondary and postsecondary schooling in the districts, many of the elite district families continue to send their offspring to Belize City for higher education.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Despite the establishment of a local institution of higher education in 1985, most elite youth attend universities abroad. Their choice of institutions reflects the changing dominant metropolitan cultural orientation of Belizean society. [[British universities]] attracted many of the college-bound members of the Belizean elite in the [[History of Belize (1506â1862)|colonial period]], but by 1990 the majority pursued their higher education in the United States or, to a lesser extent, in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

==The middle sector==

The middle sector of Belizean society is considerably larger, more diverse, and less cohesive than the elite. People in this group lack the jobs, social status, or economic assets that are typical of the elite, and they are better off than the rest of society. Some families are "poor relations" of the elite class; others have acquired wealth and prestige over a few generations through higher education or economic success. This large group encompasses the traditional [[middle class]] as well as elements of the working classes: not only small businessmen, professionals, teachers, and mid-level [[civil servant]]s, but also other government workers, [[Smallholding|smallholders]], skilled manual workers, and commercial employees.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;Rutheiser, Charles C., "The middle sector". In Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle sector is stratified according to wealth, level of education, and the status difference between manual and nonmanual occupations. A shared belief system that emphasizes cultural respectability, upward [[social mobility]], and the importance of education unifies this group. Even more than middle-class families, some working-class families often make great sacrifices to ensure that their children received the best and most extensive education possible.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;

The middle sector of Belizean society is largely the product of the massive expansion of educational opportunities and the corresponding growth of the modern sector of the economy between 1950 and 1980. As an increasing number of Belizeans earned degrees from education institutions and as the local job market became saturated, families in this group became more concerned in the 1970s and 1980s with maintaining their social position than with upward [[social mobility]]. Faced with limited economic prospects in Belize, large numbers [[emigrated]] to the United States.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;

The middle sector is culturally diverse and includes members of all Belizean ethnic groups, although not in proportion to their numbers in the general population. Relatively few [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] or [[Q'eqchi' people|KekchÃ­]] families, for example, belong to either the middle or upper working classes. Historical correlations between occupation and ethnic identity are long standing. Middle-sector Creoles are most likely to work in the professions, especially law and [[accounting]], the civil service, and the skilled trades. Considerable numbers of Mestizos are employed by the government, as well as in small business and farming. [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] are particularly well established in the [[Teacher|teaching]] profession.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;

Ethnic and religious sentiments divide the middle sector to a certain extent. The nationalist movement of the 1950s drew most of its leaders from the Catholic-educated Creole and Mestizo middle class. The [[Protestant]]-educated Creole middle class opposed the movement's anti-British, multicultural ethos and the projection of a Central American destiny for Belize. Still, political affiliation defies narrow ethnic or racial lines.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;

British and North American ideas, particularly those of the United States, largely shape the beliefs and practices of the middle sector. These influences stem not only from the formal education system, but also from the popular culture of North America conveyed through cinema, magazines, radio, television, and migration. These cultural ideas are as much [[African-American]] as [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo-American]]. Beginning with the [[Black Power]] movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, middle- and working-class Creole youth increasingly adopted an [[Afrocentric]] cultural consciousness that distinguished them both from their elders and other ethnic groups in Belizean society.&lt;ref name=ms/&gt;

==The lower sector==

This sector comprises the bulk of the Belizean population and is popularly known as the grass roots or roots class. It, too, is stratified by occupation and ethnicity. The lower sector consists of unskilled or [[Skilled worker|semiskilled]] urban workers, [[subsistence farmer]]s, agricultural laborers, and the unemployed. These people share, in addition to poverty and generally poor living conditions, severely limited access to land, higher education, or any other opportunity to change their marginal status. Possibilities for mobility are a main [[Social stratification|dividing line]] between the middle and lower sectors of Belizean society.&lt;ref name=ls&gt;Rutheiser, Charles C., "The lower sector". In Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic composition of the lower sector varies by region. Most of the country's urban poor lived in predominantly Creole Belize City. With a population four times the size of the next largest urban area, Belize City was home to over half of all [[unemployed]] Belizeans in 1980. Many of the employed are engaged in ketch an kill jobs, temporary unskilled [[manual labor]].&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

Educational opportunities beyond the primary level are scarce for most poor urban families. Many children drop out of school before completing their primary education. Children who finish school often lacked the grades or financial resources to attend secondary school. Because the government generally awards scholarships according to academic performance rather than financial need, most poor Belizean families continued to lack access to education beyond the primary level.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

In further contrast to the upper and middle sectors, many lower-sector households in Belize City are headed by [[single parent]]s, usually women. Female workers generally receive lower incomes than their male counterparts, and women experience a much higher unemployment rate than men. In numerous cases, migration of both parents results in children being raised by siblings, older relatives, or friends of the family. Some of the more privileged members of Belizean society perceive that increases in juvenile delinquency, crime, and drug use among Belizean urban youth are directly attributable to breakdowns in family structure.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

As with the population in general, a large percentage of the urban poor are young. Youth unemployment is high, and many unemployed youths in Belize City congregate on street corners or meet in storefronts known as "bases." These young people are known as baseboys and basegirls. More privileged members of Belizean society tend to categorize baseboys and basegirls as criminals and [[juvenile delinquency|delinquents]], although the only thing many are guilty of is lacking opportunities for education and meaningful work.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

The lack of educational and employment prospects for the rural and urban poor in the 1980s lead to dramatic increases in crime, especially in the [[Illegal drug trade in Latin America|illegal drug trade]]. By the middle of the decade, Belize had become the fourth largest exporter (after [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Jamaica]]) of [[marijuana]] to the United States. By 1987, [[crack cocaine]] and gangs had established a foothold among the youthful population of Belize City. By 1991, both gang membership and [[gang warfare]] had escalated dramatically, moving off the street corners of the poorer neighborhoods into the schools and major public spaces of Belize City. Gangs, drugs, and violence were the dominant realities with which nearly all Belizean urban youth, especially the poor, had to deal.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

Extremely limited access to education and well-paying jobs characterize conditions for the poor in the district towns of Belize. But many people perceive the conditions in these towns as less severe than in Belize City. One exception was [[Orange Walk Town|Orange Walk]], which was known as Rambo Town, owing to the intensity of drug-related violence there in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

The most limited opportunities for education and economic advancement are found in rural areas. Rural primary schools have much higher rates of [[absenteeism]] and attrition than urban schools, and all but three secondary schools are located in Belize City or the major district towns. Furthermore, the demands of agricultural work often prevent many children from attending school.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

The rural poor are mostly [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] and Mestizo subsistence farmers and agricultural laborers, although some Creole and Garifuna families are also included in this category. At the very bottom of both the rural and urban social hierarchies are illegally present Central Americans who are employed in the lowest paid, least desirable occupations, such as unskilled labor in the [[Sugarcane|sugar]], citrus, [[Banana plantation|banana]], and marijuana industries.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt;

==Social dynamics==

Belize has adopted wholeheartedly, and with much popular support, the rhetoric and practices of the ideologies of development and [[consumerism]], twin hallmarks of a modernizing society. Far-reaching changes have occurred in Belizean society since 1960. The growth of educational opportunities and [[Public sector|government employment]] has facilitated the emergence of a sizable middle-class with expanding horizons of consumption. The meaning of education has also changed. Once revered as a scarce privilege guaranteeing social advancement, education is now perceived as a [[Right to education|birthright]] and an essential tool for entering the job market.&lt;ref name=sd&gt;Rutheiser, Charles C., "Social dynamics". In Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education, migration, and shifts in economic activity have enhanced the power and influence of previously marginal social groups and regions, particularly the Mestizos who inhabited the northern [[Districts of Belize|districts]]. Intermarriage and political mobilization have helped at times to cut across ethnic boundaries and create a nascent sense of [[national identity]]. [[Satellite television]], [[Tourism in Belize|tourism]], and emigration have strengthened an already close connection with North America, while immigration has anchored Belize more firmly within Central America and its culture.&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;

But not all of the changes have been positive. Many Belizeans of more than thirty years of age noted the breakdown of [[Traditional values|traditional]] notions of authority, respect, and propriety and the obsessive fascination of Belizean youth with North American material culture. Other blamed mass emigration for the dissolution of the Belizean family and a subsequent rise in juvenile delinquency and crime.&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;

[[Ethnic conflict|Ethnic tension]]s still regularly intruded into many areas of social interaction and indeed showed signs of intensifying. Possibilities for social mobility existed, but only for some individuals. The [[Education in Belize|local school system]] produced continuously growing numbers of graduates for whom jobs did not exist, while it simultaneously excluded growing numbers of the poor from educational opportunity. Emigration to [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] countries often siphoned off people with the highest qualifications and the most ambitions, while immigration from neighboring republics promised to reshape the cultural orientation and, quite literally, the complexion of Belizean society.&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;

==History==
The [[Sindh]] region was ruled by various Muslim dynasties from 711 until the conquest by the [[East India Company|British]] in 1843, when it became a part of [[Bombay Presidency]]. During that period, Hindus were a significant minority of the population although accurate figures continued to be unavailable until after 1947. Mark-Anthony Falzon notes that, "Due to the shifting criteria of categorisation and the complex politics of census in general, the decennial colonial censuses of pre-independence Sindh must be read with caution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000 |first=Mark-Anthony |last=Falzon |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2004 |pages=30â31 |isbn=9789004140080 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these are Hindus, with the exceptions being those considered to be [[Bhatia (caste)|Bhatia]]s or [[Brahmin]]s. Although considered to be [[Vaishya]] in the Hindu ritual ranking system known as [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna].&lt;ref name="Falzonp32"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000 |first=Mark-Anthony |last=Falzon |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2004 |pages=32â33 |isbn=9789004140080 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the sindhi jatis - a social grouping based on birth and kinship - are the Bhaibands, who by the time of the [[British Raj]] were held in a lesser regard than the [[Amil]] but who were the wealthiest as a result of their mobility and participation in trade. Falzon considers this trade-sourced wealth to be their "distinguishing characteristic" among the Hindus of Sindh.&lt;ref name="Falzonp32" /&gt;{{efn|Falzon notes that traders in small localities might be called bania or hatvania. It is unclear whether he is including the Bhaibands in this nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000 |first=Mark-Anthony |last=Falzon |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2004 |page=34 |isbn=9789004140080 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although it was generally uncommon, there was intermarriage between Amils, Bhaibands and another jati, the [[Sahiti]]s. The ritual prohibitions of caste, such as restrictions on eating and worshipping together, permeate life in south India but did not play a great role in the life of Sindhis. Nonetheless, a hierarchy existed and, according to Falzon, "still today, Bhaibands are seen by Amils as unpolished, having poor aesthetic tastes, and given to vulgar displays of wealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmopolitan Connections: The Sindhi Diaspora, 1860-2000 |first=Mark-Anthony |last=Falzon |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2004 |page=35 |isbn=9789004140080 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buckquoy Spindle Whorl, Ogham inscription - Buckquoy-Spinnwirtel, Ogham-Inschrift.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the Ogham inscription]]
The '''Buckquoy spindle-whorl''' is an [[Ogham]]-inscribed [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorl]] dating from the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]], probably the 8th century, which was found in 1970 in Buckquoy, [[Birsay]], [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Made of sandy limestone, it is about 36&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only known spindle-whorl with an [[Ogham]] [[Epigraphy|inscription]].

The inscription was once used as proof that the [[Pictish language]] was not [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], being variously read as:
* E(s/n)DDACTA(n/lv)IM(v/lb)
* (e/)(s/n/)DDACTANIMV
* (e/)TMIQAVSALL(e/q)&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1977) Jackson states that "[a]ll of the readings are wholly unintelligible and cannot be Celtic," and that "[w]e must be content to write off this inscription as unintelligible, like all the other 'Pictish' inscriptions."&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 1995 historian [[Katherine Forsyth]] reading 
* ENDDACTANIM(f/lb)
proposed that the inscription was a standard [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ogham [[benediction|benedictory]] message, '''''Benddact anim L.''''' meaning "a blessing on the soul of L.".&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (1995), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone from which the whorl was made, and on which the inscription was written, is likely to have originated in Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Collins (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 census conducted by the Sociology Department of [[Tehran University]] in many districts of Tehran across various socio-economic classes in proportion to population sizes of each district and socio-economic class, 63% of [[persian people]] in [[Tehran]] were born in Tehran, 98% know [[Persian language]], 75% identify themselves as ethnic [[Persian people|Persian]], and 13% have some degree of proficiency in a European language&lt;ref&gt;"Chand Darsad Tehranihaa dar Tehran Bedonyaa Amadand" (How many percent of Tehranis were born in Tehran), accessed December, 2010 [http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/133668][http://www.aftabnews.ir/vdchimnzw23nzid.tft2.html][http://www.jahannews.com/vdcgw39qzak9tn4.rpra.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">The '''Family Policy Studies Centre''' was a charity which carried out independent [[policy studies]] research and policy analysis on family issues and trends. It was based at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]].  

Its research included the understanding of contemporary family structures and patterns, the changes taking place, and the implications of such changes for policy and practice; the analysis of the impact of [[Policy|public policy]] decisions on families of different kinds.  The centre acted as a centre of information, dissemination and debate, and aimed to serve as a bridge between policy-makers, academics and practitioners.

It produced a range of publications aimed at a variety of audiences, many of which are still available on its website. 

The centre closed at the end of April 2001, after twenty-three years, following funding difficulties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7235">A '''feeding disorder''', in infancy or early childhood, is a child's refusal to eat certain food groups, textures, solids or liquids for a period of at least one month, which causes the child to not gain enough weight, grow naturally or cause any developmental delays.&lt;ref name="minddisorder.com"/&gt; Feeding disorders resemble [[failure to thrive]], except that at times in feeding disorder there is no medical or physiological condition that can explain the very small amount of food the children consume or their lack of growth. Some of the times, a previous medical condition that has been resolved is causing the issue.&lt;ref name="minddisorder.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Del-Fi/Feeding-disorder-of-infancy-or-early-childhood.html|work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Children attempting to swallow different food textures often vomit, gag, or choke while eating. At feeding times they may react negatively to attempts to feed them, and refuse to eat.&lt;ref name=KKlod&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kki_diag.jsp?pid=1084|publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symptoms include head turns, crying, difficulty in chewing or vomiting and spitting whilst eating. Many children may have feeding difficulties and may be picky eaters, but most of them still have a fairly healthy diet. Children with a feeding disorder however, will completely abandon some of the food groups, textures, or liquids that are necessary for human growth and development &lt;ref name=Feeding&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders|url=https://pediatricfeeding.com/feeding-disorders/|publisher=Feeding Clinic of Santa Monica|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with this disorder can develop much more slowly because of their lack of nutritional intake. In severe cases the child seems to feel socially isolated because of the lack of social activities involving foods.&lt;ref name=KKlod/&gt;

==Types==
Feeding disorder has been divided into six further sub-types:&lt;ref name=Sexon&gt;{{cite book|last=Sexson|first=Sandra B.|title=Child and adolescent psychiatry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-1768-0|pages=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Feeding disorder of state regulation
# Feeding disorder of reciprocity (neglect)
# Infantile [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]
# Sensory food aversion
# Feeding disorder associated with concurrent medical condition
# Post-traumatic feeding disorder

==Associated problems==
A few of the medical and psychological conditions that have been known to be associated with this disorder include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/diagnoses-disorders/feeding-disorders | title=Feeding Disorders | publisher=Kennedy Krieger Institute | date=2012 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gastrointestinal motility disorders 
*Oral-motor dysfunction 
*Failure to thrive 
*Prematurity 
*Food allergies
*Sensory problems
*Reflux
*Feeding tube placement

A child that is suffering from malnutrition can have permanently stunted mental and physical development. Getting treatment early is essential and can prevent many of the complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders |url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001540trt.htm |accessdate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152536/http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001540trt.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also develop further eating disorders later in life such as [[anorexia nervosa]], or they could become a limited eaterâthough they could still be a healthy child they may become a picky eater.

==Diagnosis==
A barium swallow test is often performed, where the child is given a liquid or food with barium in it. This allows the consulting medical practitioners to trace the swallow-function on an X-ray or other investigative system such as a [[X-ray computed tomography|CAT scan]]. An endoscopic assignment test can also be performed, where an endoscope is used to view the oesophagus and throat on a screen. It can also allow viewing of how the patient will react during feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorders and swallowing disorders|url= http://www.asha.org/public/speech/swallowing/feedswallowchildren.htm|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==
There is no quick cure, and treatment will be based on what problems may be causing the feeding disorder. Depending on the condition, the following steps can be taken: increasing the number of foods that are accepted, increasing the amount of calories and the amount of fluids; checks for vitamin or mineral deficiencies; finding out what the illnesses or psychosocial problems are. To accomplish these goals patients may have to be hospitalized for extensive periods of time. Treatment involves professionals from multiple fields of study including, but not limited to; behavior analysts (Behavioral interventions), &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1284399|year=2002|author1=Patel|first1=M.

To obtain the best results, treatment should include a behavior modification plan under the guidance of multiple professionals. If the child has oral motor difficulties related to the feeding disorder a pediatric occupational or speech therapist who is trained in feeding disorders and oral motor function should help develop a plan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding Disorder of Early Childhood|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=14504&amp;cn=37|accessdate=26 June 2011|authors=Andrea Barkoukis, M.A., Natalie Staats Reiss, Ph.D., and Mark Dombeck, Ph.D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Some 25% to 40% of young children are reported to have feeding problemsâmainly [[colic]], vomiting, slow feeding, and refusal to eat.&lt;ref name="cfp journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard-Bonnin|first=AC|title=Feeding problems of infants and toddlers|journal=Canadian Family Physician|year=2006|volume=Vol 52|issue=Issue 10|url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/reprint/52/10/1247}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that up to 80% of infants with developmental handicaps also demonstrate feeding problems while 1 to 2% of infants aged less than one year show severe food refusal and poor growth.&lt;ref name="essentials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Jerald|title=Essentials of Psychiatry|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex|isbn=0470018542|pages=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Preterm birth|infants born prematurely]], 40% to 70% experience some form of feeding problem.&lt;ref name="minddisorder.com"/&gt;

'''Gentrification''' is a process of renovating deteriorated urban neighborhoods by means of the influx of more affluent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentrification|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gentrification|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lees"&gt;Lees, Loretta, Tom Slater, and Elvin K. Wyly. Gentrification. New York: Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008. Print. Defines gentrification as "the transformation of a working-class or vacant area of the central city to a middle class residential and/or commercial use".&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common and controversial topic in politics and in [[urban planning]]. Gentrification can improve the material quality of a neighborhood, while also potentially forcing relocation of current, established residents and businesses, causing them to move from a gentrified area, seeking lower cost housing and stores.

Gentrification often shifts a neighborhoodâs racial/ethnic composition and average household income by developing new, more expensive housing, businesses and improved resources.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthtopics/gentrification.htm |title=Health Effects of Gentrification |date=24 March 2015 |website=[[Centers for Disease Control]] |publisher= Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversations about gentrification have evolved, as many in the social-scientific community have questioned the negative connotations associated with the word ''gentrification''. One example is that gentrification can lead to [[community displacement]] for lower-income families in gentrifying neighborhoods, as property values and rental costs rise; however, every neighborhood faces unique challenges, and reasons for displacement vary.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, L. (2005). Displacement or Succession? Residential Mobility in Gentrifying Neighborhoods.

The gentrification process is typically the result of increasing attraction to an area by people with higher incomes spilling over from neighboring cities, towns, or neighborhoods. Further steps are increased investments in a community and the related infrastructure by [[real estate development]] businesses, local government, or [[community activist]]s and resulting [[economic development]], increased attraction of business, and lower [[crime]] rates. In addition to these potential benefits, gentrification can lead to [[population mobility|population migration]] and displacement. However, some view the fear of displacement, which is dominating the debate about gentrification, as hindering  discussion about genuine progressive approaches to distribute the benefits of urban redevelopment strategies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
[[File:mk Berlin Pfefferberg.jpg|thumb|Symbolic gentrification in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin]]

The term gentrification has come to refer to a multi-faceted phenomenon that can be defined in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''There Goes the 'Hood'' (2006), p. 3. "The significant gaps in our understanding of gentrification persists despite a voluminous literature developed over several decades that perhaps reflects chaotic nature of gentrification as a concept (Beauregard 1986). As such it means different things, under different circumstances, to different people. This chaos results from the different manifestations of gentrification and its differing ways of impacting people in its wake."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians say that gentrification took place in [[ancient Rome]] and in [[Roman Britain]], where large [[villa]]s were replacing small shops by the 3rd century, AD.&lt;ref name=Roman/&gt; The word ''gentrification'' derives from ''[[gentry]]''âwhich comes from the Old French word ''genterise'', "of gentle birth" (14th century) and "people of gentle birth" (16th century). In England, ''[[Landed gentry]]'' denoted the social class, consisting of [[gentlemen]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Etymology'' (1966) C. T. Onions, G. W. S. Friedrichsen, R. W. Burchfield, eds.p.394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gentry|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001|accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term was already used in English in the 1950s - for instance by Sidney Perutz (Strange Reciprocity: Mainstreaming Women's Work in Tepotzlan in the 'Decade of the New Economy',1955, p37) and by William Xenophon Weed and Oscar Le Roy Warren (Warren's Weed on the New York Law of Real Property, Volume 6, 1950, p.&amp;nbsp;67), British [[sociologist]] [[Ruth Glass]] coined the term "gentrification"  in 1964 to describe the influx of [[middle-class]] people displacing [[Working class|lower-class]] worker residents in urban neighborhoods; her example was [[London]], and its working-class districts such as [[Islington]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEs0nSHG8a4C&amp;pg=PA4|title=Gentrification in a Global Context|author=Rowland Atkinson, Gary Bridge|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32951-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London: aspects of change|author=Ruth Glass|year=1964|publisher=London: MacGibbon &amp; Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been invaded by the middle-classesâupper and lower. Shabby, modest [[mews]] and cottagesâtwo rooms up and two downâhave been taken over, when their [[lease]]s have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences&amp;nbsp;... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.}}

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] report ''Health Effects of Gentrification'' defines the [[real estate]] concept of ''gentrification'' as "the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value. This change has the potential to cause displacement of long-time residents and businesses&amp;nbsp;... when long-time or original neighborhood residents move from a gentrified area because of higher rents, [[mortgage]]s, and [[property tax]]es. Gentrification is a housing, economic, and health issue that affects a community's history and culture and reduces [[social capital]]. It often shifts a neighborhood's characteristics, e.g., racial-ethnic composition and household income, by adding new stores and resources in previously run-down neighborhoods."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

In the [[Brookings Institution]] report ''Dealing with Neighborhood Change: A Primer on Gentrification and Policy Choices'' (2001), Maureen Kennedy and Paul Leonard say that "the term 'gentrification' is both imprecise and quite politically charged", suggesting its redefinition as "the process by which higher income households displace lower income residents of a neighborhood, changing the essential character and flavour of that neighborhood", so distinguishing it from the different socio-economic process of "neighborhood (or urban) revitalization", although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2001/04metropolitanpolicy.aspx|title=Dealing with Neighborhood Change: A Primer on Gentrification and Policy Choices|author=Maureen Kennedy, Paul Leonard|date=April 2001|publisher=The Brookings Institution Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy and PolicyLink|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606055104/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2001/04metropolitanpolicy.aspx|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[geographer]]s have a more distanced view on gentrification. Actual gentrification is seen as a mere symbolic issue happening in a low number of places and blocks, the symbolic value and visibility in public discourse being higher than actual migration trends. E.g. Gerhard Hard assumes that [[urban flight]] is still more important than inner city gentrification.&lt;ref name="GH"/&gt;
[[Volkskunde|Volkskunde scholar]] Barbara Lang introduced the term 'symbolic gentrification' with regard to the ''Mythos Kreuzberg'' in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Myt"&gt;Barbara Lang: ''Mythos Kreuzberg: Ethnographie eines Stadtteils (1961â1995).'' Campus Verlag, 1998, {{ISBN|3-593-36106-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lang assumes that complaints about gentrification often come from those who have been responsible for the process in their youth.

American economists describe gentrification as a natural cycle: the well-to-do prefer to live in the newest housing stock. Each decade of a city's growth, a new ring of new housing is built. When the housing at the center has reached the end of its useful life and is therefore cheap, the well-to-do gentrify the neighborhood. The push outward from the city center continues as the housing in each ring reaches the end of its economic life.&lt;ref name="frbp170925"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Jeffrey|title=Understanding Gentrification's Causes|date=2017|url=https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/economic-insights/2017/q3/eiq3_understanding-gentrifications-causes.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that ''gentrification'' has three interpretations: (a) "great, the value of my house is going up, (b) coffee is more expensive, now that we have a Starbucks, and (c) my neighbors and I can no longer afford to live here (''community displacement'')&lt;ref name="gm1502"&gt;{{cite news|last1=EHRENHALT|first1=Alan|title=What, Exactly, Is Gentrification?|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-gentrification-definition-series.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=Governing Magazine|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===London and Palen===
There are several approaches that attempt to explain the roots and the reasons behind the spread of gentrification. Bruce London and J. John Palen (1984) compiled a list of five explanations: (1) demographic-ecological, (2) sociocultural, (3) political-economical, (4) community networks, and (5) social movements.

====Demographic-ecological====
The first theory, demographic-ecological, attempts to explain gentrification through the analysis of demographics: population, social organization, environment, and technology. This theory frequently refers to the growing number of people between the ages of 25 and 35 in the 1970s, or the baby boom generation. Because the number of people that sought housing increased, the demand for housing increased also. The supply could not keep up with the demand; therefore cities were "recycled" to meet such demands (London and Palen, 1984). The [[baby boomers]] in pursuit of housing were very different, demographically, from their house-hunting predecessors. They married at an older age and had fewer children. Their children were born later. Women, both single and married, were entering the labor force at higher rates which led to an increase of dual wage-earner households. These households were typically composed of young, more affluent couples without children. Because these couples were child-free and were not concerned with the conditions of schools and [[playground]]s, they elected to live in the [[inner city]] in close proximity to their jobs. These more affluent people usually had white-collar, not blue-collar jobs. Since these [[white-collar worker]]s wanted to live closer to work, a neighborhood with more white-collar jobs was more likely to be invaded; the relationship between administrative activity and invasion was positively correlated (London and Palen, 1984).

====Sociocultural====
The second theory proposed by London and Palen is based on a sociocultural explanation of gentrification. This theory argues that values, sentiments, attitudes, ideas, beliefs, and choices should be used to explain and predict human behavior, not demographics, or "structural units of analysis" (i.e., characteristics of populations) (London and Palen, 1984). This analysis focuses on the changing attitudes, lifestyles, and values of the middle- and upper-middle-class of the 1970s. They were becoming more pro-urban than before, opting not to live in rural or even suburban areas anymore. These new pro-urban values were becoming more salient, and more and more people began moving into the cities. London and Palen refer to the first people to invade the cities as "urban pioneers". These urban pioneers demonstrated that the inner-city was an "appropriate" and "viable" place to live, resulting in what is called "inner city chic" (London and Palen, 1984). The opposing side of this argument is that dominant, or recurring, American values determine where people decide to live, not the changing values previously cited. This means that people choose to live in a gentrified area to restore it, not to alter it, because restoration is a "new way to realize old values" (London and Palen, 1984).

====Political-economic====
The third theoretical explanation of gentrification is political-economic and is divided into two approaches: traditional and Marxist. The traditional approach argues that economic and political factors have led to the invasion of the inner-city, hence the name political-economic. The changing political and legal climate of the 1950s and 1960s (new [[civil rights]] legislation, anti-discrimination laws in housing and employment, and [[desegregation]]) had an "unanticipated" role in the gentrification of neighborhoods. A societal decrease in acceptance of prejudice led to more blacks moving to the suburbs and whites no longer rejected the idea of moving to the city. The decreasing availability of suburban land and inflation in suburban housing costs also inspired the invasion of the cities. The Marxist approach denies the notion that the political and economic influences on gentrification are invisible, but are intentional. This theory claims that "powerful interest groups follow a policy of neglect of the inner city until such time as they become aware that policy changes could yield tremendous profits" (London and Palen, 1984). Once the inner city becomes a source of revenue, the powerless residents are displaced with little or no regard from the powerful.

====Community networks====
The community-network approach is the fourth proposed by London and Palen. This views the community as an "interactive social group". Two perspectives are noted: community lost and community saved. The community lost perspective argues that the role of the neighborhood is becoming more limited due to [[Technological advancement|technological advances]] in transportation and communication. This means that the small-scale, local community is being replaced with more large-scale, political and social organizations (Greer, 1962). The opposing side, the community saved side, argues that community activity increases when neighborhoods are gentrified because these neighborhoods are being revitalized.

====Social movements====
The fifth and final approach is social movements. This theoretical approach is focused on the analysis of ideologically based movements, usually in terms of leader-follower relationships. Those who support gentrification are encouraged by leaders (successful urban pioneers, political-economic elites, land developers, lending institutions, and even the Federal government in some instances) to revive the inner-city. Those who are in opposition are the people who currently reside in the deteriorated areas. They develop countermovements in order to gain the power necessary to defend themselves against the movements of the elite. An excellent example was the turned around gang in Chicago who fought for years against the Richard J. Daley machine: the [[Young Lords]] led by [[Jose Cha Cha Jimenez]]. They occupied neighborhood institutions and led massive demonstration to make people aware. These countermovements can be unsuccessful, though. The people who support reviving neighborhoods are also members, and their voices are the ones that the gentrifiers tend to hear (London and Palen, 1984).

===As an economic process===
Two discrete, sociological theories explain and justify gentrification as an economic process ([[economic production|production]]-side theory) and as a social process ([[economic production|consumption]]-side theory) that occurs when the suburban [[gentry]] tire of the automobile-dependent [[urban sprawl]] style of life; thus, professionals, [[empty nest syndrome|empty nest]] aged parents, and recent university graduates perceive the attractiveness of the city centerâearlier abandoned during [[white flight]]âespecially if the poor community possesses a [[transport hub]] and its architecture sustains the [[pedestrian]] traffic that allows the proper human relations impeded by (sub)urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=The Rise of the Creative Class|nopp=|isbn=978-0-465-02477-3|title-link=The Rise of the Creative Class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, proximity to urban amenities such as transit stops has been shown to drive up home prices over time. A survey of Northwest Chicago conducted between 1975 and 1991 showed that homes located directly in the vicinity Red Line and Brown Line stops of the "L" rail transit system saw a huge price jump during these years, compared to only modest increases for area outside the zone. Between 1985 and 1991 in particular, homes near transit stops nearly doubled in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Jeffrey|year=2002|title=Gentrification and Transit in Northwest Chicago|url=|journal=Transportation Quarterly|volume=56|pages=175â191|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Smith and Marxist sociologists explain gentrification as a [[structuralism|structural]] economic process; Humanistic Geographer, [[David Ley]] explains gentrification as a natural outgrowth of increased professional employment in the central business district (CBD), and the creative sub-class's predilection for city living. "Liberal Ideology and the Post-Industrial City" (1980) describes and deconstructs the TEAM committee's effort to rendering Vancouver, BC, Canada, a "livable city". The investigators Rose, Beauregard, Mullins, Moore ''et al.'', who base themselves upon Ley's ideas, posit that "gentrifiers and their social and cultural characteristics [are] of crucial importance for an understanding of gentrification"âtheoretical work Chris Hamnett criticized as insufficiently comprehensive, for not incorporating the "supply of dwellings and the role of developers [and] speculators in the process".&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett 1991, 186, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production-side theory====
The ''production-side'' theory of urban gentrification derives from the work of human geographer [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]], explaining gentrification as an [[economics|economic]] process consequent to the fluctuating relationships among [[capital (economics)|capital]] investments and the production of [[urban area|urban]] space. He asserts that restructuring of urban space is the visual component of a larger social, economic, and spatial restructuring of the contemporary capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Neil, and Peter Williams. Gentrification of the City. Boston: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith summarizes the causes of gentrification into five main processes: suburbanization and the emergence of [[Rent-gap theory|rent gap]], deindustrialization, spatial centralization and decentralization of capital, falling profit and cyclical movement of capital, and changes in demographics and consumption patterns.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=====Suburbanization and rent gap=====
Suburban development derives from outward expansion of cities, often driven by sought profit and the availability of cheap land. This change in consumption causes a fall in inner city land prices, often resulting in poor upkeep and a neglect of repair for these properties by owners and landlords. The depressed land is then devalued, causing rent to be significantly cheaper than the potential rent that could be derived from the "best use" of the land while taking advantage of its central location.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; From this derives the ''Rent-gap Theory'' describing the disparity between "the actual capitalized ground rent (land price) of a plot of land given its present use, and the potential ground rent that might be gleaned under a 'higher and better' use."&lt;ref name = "Smith 1987b 462"&gt;Smith, 1987b, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rent gap is fundamental to explaining gentrification as an economic process. When the gap is sufficiently wide, [[real estate developer]]s, [[landlord]]s, and other people with vested interests in the development of land perceive the potential [[Profit (economics)|profit]] to be derived from re-investing in inner-city properties and redeveloping them for new tenants. Thus, the development of a rent gap creates the opportunity for urban restructuring and gentrification.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=====De-industrialization=====
The [[de-industrialization]] of cities in developed nations reduces the number of [[blue-collar]] jobs available to the urban working class as well as middle-wage jobs with the opportunity for [[Promotion (rank)|advancement]], creating lost investment capital needed to physically maintain the houses and buildings of the city. Abandoned industrial areas create availability for land for the rent gap process.

=====Spatial centralization and decentralization of capital=====
De-industrialization is often integral to the growth of a divided [[White-collar worker|white collar]] [[employment]], providing [[professional]] and [[management]] jobs that follow the spatial decentralization of the expanding world economy. However, somewhat counter-intuitively, globalization also is accompanied by spatial centralization of urban centers, mainly from the growth of the inner city as a base for headquarter and executive decision-making centers. This concentration can be attributed to the need for rapid decisions and information flow, which makes it favorable to have executive centers in close proximity to each other. Thus, the expanding effect of suburbanization as well as agglomeration to city centers can coexist. These simultaneous processes can translate to gentrification activities when professionals have a high demand to live near their executive workplaces in order to reduce decision-making time.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=====Falling profit and the cyclical movement of capital=====
This section of Smith's theory attempts to describe the timing of the process of gentrification. At the end of a period of expansion for the economy, such as a [[Economic boom|boom]] in postwar suburbs, accumulation of capital leads to a falling [[rate of profit]]. It is then favorable to seek investment outside the industrial sphere to hold off onset of an [[financial crisis|economic crisis]]. By this time, the period of expansion has inevitably led to the creation of rent gap, providing opportunity for capital reinvestment in this surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=====Changes in demographic and consumption patterns=====
Smith emphasizes that demographic and life-style changes are more of an exhibition of the ''form'' of gentrification, rather than real factors behind gentrification. The aging [[Baby boomers|baby-boomer]] population, greater participation of women in the workforce, and the changes in marriage and childrearing norms explain the appearance that gentrification takes, or as Smith says, "why we have proliferating quiche bars rather than Howard Johnson's".&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

====Consumption-side theory====
[[File:Minneapolis Warehouse District.jpg|thumb|right|Gentrification in the US: The [[North Loop, Minneapolis|North Loop neighborhood]], Minneapolis, Minn., is the "Warehouse District" of [[condominium|condominia]] for artists and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/06_robertsc_artsplan/|title= Getting a handle on gentrification in Nordeast|author=Chris Roberts|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=6 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2004/08/16/focus1.html|title=Home at loft, The Warehouse District is attracting many new condo and apartment dwellers|date=13 August 2004|publisher=Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal|author=Adam Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-a-whirl.org/webpage.php?webpage_name=Arts%20District|title=NE Mpls Arts District|publisher=Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association|date=3 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In contrast to the production-side argument, the ''consumption-side'' theory of urban gentrification posits that the "socio-cultural characteristics and motives" of the gentrifiers are most important to understanding the gentrification of the ''post-industrial city''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the structure of advanced capitalist cities with the shift from industrial to service-based economy were coupled with the expanding of a new middle classâone with a larger purchasing power than ever before.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;Lees, Loretta, Tom Slater, and Elvin K. Wyly. ''The Gentrification Reader'', London: Routledge (15 April 2010), trade paperback, {{ISBN|0415548403}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, human geographer [[David Ley]] posits a rehabilitated post-industrial city influenced by this "new middle class".&lt;ref&gt;Ley 1994, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption theory contends that it is the demographics and consumption patterns of this "new middle class" that is responsible for gentrification.

The economic and cultural changes of the world in the 1960s have been attributed to these consumption changes. The antiauthoritarian protest movements of the young in the U.S., especially on college campuses, brought a new disdain for the "standardization of look-alike suburbs,"&lt;ref name="Ley"&gt;Ley, David. The New Middle Class and the Remaking of the Central City. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fueled a movement toward empowering freedom and establishing authenticity. In the postindustrial economy, the expansion of middle class jobs in inner cities came at the same time as many of the ideals of this movement. The process of gentrification stemmed as the new middle class, often with politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] ideals, was employed in the city and recognized not only the convenient commute of a city residence, but also the appeal towards the urban lifestyle as a means of opposing the "deception of the suburbanite".&lt;ref name="Ley" /&gt;

This new middle class was characterized by professionals with life pursuits expanded from traditional economistic focus.&lt;ref name="Lees"/&gt; Gentrification provided a means for the 'stylization of life' and an expression of realized profit and social rank. Similarly, Michael Jager contended that the consumption pattern of the new middle class explains gentrification because of the new appeal of embracing the historical past as well as urban lifestyle and culture.&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt; The need of the middle class to express individualism from both the upper and lower classes was expressed through consumption, and specifically through the consumption of a house as an aesthetic object. Consumers' desire for "local" products and services has been used to explain the effects of businesses such as craft breweries on neighborhood gentrification.&lt;ref name="Barajas2017Untapped"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barajas|first1=J.M.|last2=Boeing|first2=G.|last3=Wartell|first3=J.|date=2017|chapter=Neighborhood Change, One Pint at a Time: The Impact of Local Characteristics on Craft Breweries|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317570500_Neighborhood_Change_One_Pint_at_a_Time_The_Impact_of_Local_Characteristics_on_Craft_Breweries |editor1-last=Chapman|editor1-first=N.G.|editor2-last=Lellock|editor2-first=J.S.|editor3-last=Lippard|editor3-first=C.D.|title=Untapped: Exploring the Cultural Dimensions of Craft Beer|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|pages=155â176|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2936427|arxiv=1802.03140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This permanent tension on two fronts is evident in the architecture of gentrification: in the external restorations of the Victoriana, the middle classes express their candidature for the dominant classes; in its internal renovation work this class signifies its distance from the lower orders." p.&amp;nbsp;154&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt;

Gentrification, according to consumption theory, fulfills the desire for a space with social meaning for the middle class as well as the belief that it can only be found in older places because of a dissatisfaction with contemporary urbanism.&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt;

===Economic globalization===
Gentrification is integral to the [[new economy]] of centralized, high-level services workâthe "new urban economic core of [[banking]] and service activities that come to replace the older, typically manufacturing-oriented, core"&lt;ref&gt;Sassen 1995, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; that displaces middle-class retail businesses so they might be "replaced by upmarket boutiques and restaurants catering to new high-income urban Ã©lites".&lt;ref&gt;Sassen 1995, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[globalization]], the city's importance is determined by its ability to function as a discrete socio-economic entity, given the lesser import of national borders, resulting in de-industrialized [[global cities]] and [[economic restructuring]].

To wit, the American urban theorist [[John Friedman]]'s seven-part theory posits a bifurcated [[service industry]] in [[global city|world cities]], composed of "a high percentage of professionals specialized in control functions and&amp;nbsp;... a vast army of low-skilled workers engaged in&amp;nbsp;... personal services&amp;nbsp;... [that] cater to the privileged classes, for whose sake the world city primarily exists".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The final three hypotheses detail (i) the increased immigration of low-skill laborers needed to support the privileged classes, (ii) the class and caste conflict consequent to the city's inability to support the poor people who are the service class,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986, pp. 323â28.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the [[global city|world city]] as a function of social class struggleâmatters expanded by [[Saskia Sassen]] ''et al.'' The world city's inherent socio-economic inequality illustrates the causes of gentrification, reported in "Where Did They Go? The Decline of Middle-Income Neighborhoods in Metropolitan America" (2006) demonstrating [[geographical segregation]] by income in US cities, wherein middle-income (middle class) neighborhoods decline, while poor neighborhoods and rich neighborhoods remain stable.&lt;ref&gt;Booza et al. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
As rent-gap theory would predict, one of the most visible changes the gentrification process brings is to the infrastructure of a neighborhood. Typically, areas to be gentrified are deteriorated and old, though structurally sound, and often have some obscure [[amenity]] such as a historical significance that attracts the potential gentrifiers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Gentry purchase and restore these houses, mostly for single-family homes. Another phenomenon is "loft conversion," which rehabilitates mixed-use areas, often abandoned industrial buildings or run-down apartment buildings to housing for the incoming gentrifiers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; While this upgrade of housing value is the superficial keynote to the gentrification process, there is a greater number of less-visible shifts the gentry bring with them into their new neighborhoods in the community.

Gentrification has been substantially advocated by local governments, often in the form of 'urban restructuring' policies. Goals of these policies include dispersing [[poverty|low-income]] residents out of the inner city and into the suburbs as well as redeveloping the city to foster mobility between both the central city and suburbia as residential options.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; The strain on public resources that often accompanies [[concentrated poverty]] is relaxed by the gentrification process, a benefit of changed social makeup that is favorable for the local state.  Rehabilitation movements have been largely successful at restoring the plentiful supply of old and deteriorated housing that is readily available in inner cities. This rehabilitation can be seen as a superior alternative to expansion, for the location of the central city offers an intact [[infrastructure]] that should be taken advantage of: streets, public transportation, and other urban facilities.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; Furthermore, the changed perception of the central city that is encouraged by gentrification can be healthy for resource-deprived communities who have previously been largely ignored.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

A change of residence that is forced upon people who lack resources to cope has social costs.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; Measures protecting these marginal groups from gentrification may reduce those.

There is also the argument that gentrification reduces the social capital of the area it affects. Communities have strong ties to the history and culture of their neighborhood, and causing its dispersal can have detrimental costs.&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;
The [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] has a webpage discussing adverse effects gentrification has on health, and provides a list of policies that would inhibit gentrification in order to prevent these impacts.&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;

===Displacement===
{{see also|Community displacement}}
Displacement of lower income families as a result of gentrification has been a major issue for decades. However, research has shown that oftentimes the opposite is true. Low-income families in gentrifying neighborhoods are less likely to be displaced than in non-gentrifying neighborhoods. A common theory has been that as affluent people move into a poorer neighborhood, housing prices increase as a result, causing poorer people to move out of the neighborhood.  Although there is evidence showing gentrification may modestly raise real estate prices, numerous studies show that in many circumstances, other benefits from gentrification such as lower crime and an improved local economy outweigh the increased housing costsâdisplacement tends to decrease in gentrifying areas such as these as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, L. (2005). Displacement or Succession? Residential Mobility in Gentrifying Neighborhoods. Urban Affairs Review, 40(4), 463â491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="citylab.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/09/the-complicated-link-between-gentrification-and-displacement/404161/|title=The Complex Relationship Between Gentrification and Displacement|author=Richard Florida|date=8 September 2015|website=CityLab.com|accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calvin.edu"/&gt;

A study from 2016 found that nearly 10,000 Hispanic families have had to move out of [[Pilsen, Chicago|Pilsen]] in Chicago, Illinois, originally an Eastern European neighborhood which had become predominantly Mexican by the 1970s. This has come as a result of more wealthier people moving into the area. Chicago itself has been going through a process of gentrification and displacement quite rapidly in the past decade. When young often wealthier white people move into areas historically of color it can cause the ethnic groups common to the area to leave because of rent hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160413/pilsen/pilsen-gets-whiter-as-10000-hispanics-families-move-out-study-finds|title=Pilsen Gets Whiter As 10,000 Hispanics, Families Move Out, Study Finds|website=DNAinfo Chicago|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512011828/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160413/pilsen/pilsen-gets-whiter-as-10000-hispanics-families-move-out-study-finds|archivedate=2017-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social changes===
Many of the social effects of gentrification have been based on extensive theories about how [[socioeconomic status]] of an individual's neighborhood will shape one's behavior and future. These studies have prompted "social mix policies" to be widely adopted by governments to promote the process and its positive effects, such as lessening the strain on public resources that are associated with de-concentrating poverty. However, more specific research has shown that gentrification does not necessarily correlate with "social mixing," and that the effects of the new composition of a gentrified neighborhood can both weaken as well as strengthen community cohesion.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, Lance. There Goes the 'hood: Views of Gentrification from the Ground up. Philadelphia, PA: Temple UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing confers social status, and the changing norms that accompany gentrification translate to a changing social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The process of gentrification mixes people of different socioeconomic strata, thereby congregating a variety of expectations and social norms. The change gentrification brings in class distinction also has been shown to contribute to residential [[Social polarization|polarization]] by income, education, household composition, and race.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  It conveys a social rise that brings new standards in consumption, particularly in the form of excess and superfluity, to the area that were not held by the pre-existing residents.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; These differing norms can lead to conflict, which potentially serves to divide changing communities.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Often this comes at a larger social cost to the original residents of the gentrified area whose displacement is met with little concern from the gentry or the government. Clashes that result in increased police surveillance, for example, would more adversely affect young minorities who are also more likely to be the original residents of the area.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

There is also evidence to support that gentrification can strengthen and stabilize when there is a consensus about a community's objectives. Gentrifiers with an organized presence in deteriorated neighborhoods can demand and receive better resources.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; A characteristic example is a combined community effort to win historic district designation for the neighborhood, a phenomenon that is often linked to gentrification activity.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; Gentry can exert a peer influence on neighbors to take action against crime, which can lead to even more price increases in changing neighborhoods when crime rates drop and optimism for the area's future climbs.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

===Economic shifts===
The economic changes that occur as a community goes through gentrification are often favorable for local governments. Affluent gentrifiers expand the local tax base as well as support local shops and businesses, a large part of why the process is frequently alluded to in urban policies. The decrease in vacancy rates and increase in property value that accompany the process can work to stabilize a previously struggling community, restoring interest in inner-city life as a residential option alongside the suburbs.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; These changes can create positive feedback as well, encouraging other forms of development of the area that promote general economic growth.

Home ownership is a significant variable when it comes to economic impacts of gentrification. People who own their homes are much more able to gain financial benefits of gentrification than those who rent their houses and can be displaced without much compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''There Goes the 'Hood'' (2006), p. 93â94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic pressure and market price changes relate to the speed of gentrification. English-speaking countries have a higher amount of property owners and a higher mobility. German speaking countries provide a higher share of rented property and have a much stronger role of municipalities, cooperatives, guilds and unions offering low-price-housing. The effect is a lower speed of gentrification and a broader social mix. [[Gerhard Hard]] sees gentrification as a typical 1970s term with more visibility in public discourse than actual migration.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;Gerhard Hard: ''Dimensionen geographischen Denkens.'' In: ''OsnabrÃ¼cker Studien zur Geographie.'' V&amp;R unipress, 2003, {{ISBN|3-89971-105-X}}. (Band 2 der AufsÃ¤tze zur Theorie der Geographie)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Whether gentrification has occurred in a census tract in an urban area in the United States during a particular 10-year period between censuses can be determined by a method used in a study by ''[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]'':&lt;ref name=GoverningMethodology&gt;{{cite web|title=Gentrification Report Methodology|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-report-methodology.html|website=Governing.com|publisher=Governing Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the census tract in a central city had 500 or more residents and at the time of the baseline census had median household income and median home value in the bottom 40th percentile and at the time of the next 10-year census the tract's educational attainment (percentage of residents over age 25 with a bachelor's degree) was in the top 33rd percentile; the median home value, adjusted for inflation, had increased; and the percentage of increase in home values in the tract was in the top 33rd percentile when compared to the increase in other census tracts in the urban area then it was considered to have been gentrified. The method measures the rate of gentrification, not the degree of gentrification; thus, [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], which has a history of gentrification dating to the 1970s, show a decreasing rate between 1990 and 2010.&lt;ref name=SFmap&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Gentrification Map: 2000 Census - Present|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/san-francisco-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html|publisher=''[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]''|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentrifier types==
[[File:Haight Ashbury11.JPG|thumb|right|San Francisco]]
[[File:Terrace of 182-186 George St, East Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century Victorian terrace houses in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne, Australia]].]]
Just as critical to the gentrification process as creating a favorable environment is the availability of the 'gentry,' or those who will be first-stage gentrifiers. The typical gentrifiers are affluent and have professional-level, service industry jobs, many of which involve [[self-employment]].&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, Tim. Gentrification and the Middle Classes. Aldershot, Hants, England: Ashgate Pub., 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are willing and able to take the investment risk in the housing market. Often they are single people or young couples without children who lack demand for good schools.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;  Gentrifiers are likely searching for inexpensive housing close to the workplace and often already reside in the inner city, sometimes for educational reasons, and do not want to make the move to suburbia. For this demographic, gentrification is not so much the result of a return to the inner city but is more of a positive action to remain there.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

The stereotypical gentrifiers also have shared consumer preferences and favor a largely consumerist culture. This fuels the rapid expansion of trendy restaurant, shopping, and entertainment spheres that often accompany the gentrification process.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Holcomb and Beauregard described these groups as those who are "attracted by low prices and toleration of an unconventional lifestyle".&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holcomb"&gt;Holcomb, H.B., Beauregard, R.A. (1981): Revitalizing Cities. Washington DC, Association of American Geographers, Resource Publications in Geography.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting find from research on those who participate and initiate the gentrification process, the "marginal gentrifiers" as referred to by Tim Butler, is that they become marginalized by the expansion of the process.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Research has also shown subgroups of gentrifiers that fall outside of these stereotypes. Two important ones are white women, typically [[single parent|single mothers]], as well as white gay people who are typically men.

===Women===
Women increasingly obtaining higher education as well as higher paying jobs has increased their participation in the labor force, translating to an expansion of women who have greater opportunities to invest. Smith suggests this group "represents a reservoir of potential gentrifiers".&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; The increasing number of highly educated women play into this theory, given that residence in the inner city can give women access to the well-paying jobs and networking, something that is becoming increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Loretta, Tom Slater, and Elvin K. Wyly. Gentrification. New York: Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also theories that suggest the inner-city [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is important for women with children where the father does not care equally for the child, because of the proximity to professional childcare.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; This attracts single parents, specifically single mothers, to the inner-city as opposed to suburban areas where resources are more geographically spread out. This is often deemed as "marginal gentrification," for the city can offer an easier solution to combining paid and unpaid labor. Inner city concentration increases the efficiency of commodities parents need by minimizing time constraints among multiple jobs, childcare, and markets.&lt;ref name="Lees"/&gt;

===Artists===

[[File:Bedstuybrownstone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in New York City, traditionally the largest black community in the US.]]

[[File:Muenchen hanssachsstrasse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Glockenbach district of [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] in [[Munich]], Germany]]

Phillip Clay's two-stage model of gentrification places artists as prototypical stage one or "marginal" gentrifiers. [[The National Endowment for the Arts]] did a study that linked the proportion of employed artists to the rate of inner city gentrification across a number of U.S. cities.&lt;ref name="Ley"/&gt; Artists will typically accept the risks of rehabilitating deteriorated property, as well as have the time, skill, and ability to carry out these extensive renovations.&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt; [[David Ley]] states that the artist's critique of everyday life and search for meaning and renewal are what make them early recruits for gentrification.

The identity that residence in the inner city provides is important for the gentrifier, and this is particularly so in the artists' case. Their cultural emancipation from the bourgeois makes the central city an appealing alternative that distances them from the conformity and mundaneness attributed to suburban life. They are quintessential city people, and the city is often a functional choice as well, for city life has advantages that include connections to customers and a closer proximity to a downtown art scene, all of which are more likely to be limited in a suburban setting. Ley's research cites a quote from a Vancouver printmaker talking about the importance of inner city life to an artist, that it has, "energy, intensity, hard to specify but hard to do without" (1996).

Ironically, these attributes that make artists characteristic marginal gentrifiers form the same foundations for their isolation as the gentrification process matures. The later stages of the process generate an influx of more affluent, "[[yuppie]]" residents. As the [[bohemianism|bohemian]] character of the community grows, it appeals "not only to committed participants, but also to sporadic consumers,"&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rising property values that accompany this migration often lead to the eventual pushing out of the artists that began the movement in the first place.&lt;ref name="Lees"/&gt; Sharon Zukin's study of SoHo in [[Manhattan]], NYC was one of the most famous cases of this phenomenon. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, [[Manhattan loft]]s in [[SoHo]] were converted ''en masse'' into housing for artists and hippies, and then their sub-culture's followers.&lt;ref&gt;Zukin, pp. 121â23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay community===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] is located at the heart of the gentrified, gay-oriented neighborhood [[Tel Aviv]].]] [[Manuel Castells]] has researched the role of gay communities, especially in [[San Francisco]], as early gentrifiers.&lt;ref name="ca"&gt;Castells, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  The film ''[[QuinceaÃ±era (film)|QuinceaÃ±era]]'' depicts a similar situation in Los Angeles. ''[[Flag Wars]]'' (Linda Goode Bryant)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2003/flagwars/ |title=Flag Wars &amp;#124; POV |website=Pbs.org |date=17 June 2003 |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows tensions as of 2003 between white [[LGBT]]-newcomers and a black middle-class neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/19/AR2006041902922_pf.html |title=In Shaw, Pews vs. Bar Stools |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
To counter the gentrification of their mixed-populace communities, there are cases where residents formally [[community organizing|organized]] themselves to develop the necessary socio-political strategies required to retain local affordable housing. The gentrification of a mixed-income community raises [[Affordable housing|housing affordability]] to the fore of the community's politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111100820.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Living With the Tensions of Gentrification | first=Sara | last=Gebhardt | date=12 November 2005 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cities, municipalities, and counties which have countered gentrification with [[inclusionary zoning]] (inclusionary housing) [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] requiring the apportionment of some new housing for the community's original low- and moderate-income residents. [[Inclusionary zoning]] is a new [[sociology|social]] concept in English speaking countries; there are few reports qualifying its effective or ineffective limitation of gentrification in the English literature. The basis of inclusionary zoning is partial replacement as opposed to displacement of the embedded communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Eric|title=The order and simplicity of gentrification - a political challenge|journal=Gentrification in a Global Context|date=2005|pages=256â264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, California, inclusionary zoning apparently accelerated gentrification, as older, unprofitable buildings were razed and replaced with mostly high-rent housing, and a small percentage of affordable housing; the net result was less affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City Hall's 'Density Hawks' Are Changing L.A.'s DNA |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/city-halls-density-hawks-are-changing-las-dna/18410 |deadurl=yes |newspaper=LA Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416194725/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/city-halls-density-hawks-are-changing-las-dna/18410/ |archivedate=16 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; German (speaking) municipalities have a strong legal role in zoning and on the real estate market in general and a long tradition of integrating social aspects in planning schemes and building regulations. The German approach uses &lt;nowiki/&gt;en (milieu conservation municipal law), e.g. in Munichs Lehel district in use since the 1960s. The concepts of socially aware renovation and zoning of [[Bologna]]'s old city in 1974 was used as role model in the Charta of Bologna, and recognized by the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnk.de/_uploads/media/147_1974_Europarat_hist_Ortskerne.pdf 1974 ''Europarat-Symposium Nr. 2 â Schlussresolution: Die sozialen Aspekte der Erhaltung historischer Ortskerne.''] (PDF; 62&amp;nbsp;kB) Europarat (Bologna, 22. bis 26. Oktober 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===

====Direct action and sabotage====
[[File:Vandalized coffee shop Montreal.jpg|thumb|Coffee shop attacked with paint in alleged anti-gentrification attack in the [[Saint-Henri, Montreal|St-Henri neighborhood]] of [[Montreal]], January 2012.]]
When wealthy people move into low-income working-class neighborhoods, the resulting class conflict sometimes involves [[vandalism]] and arson targeting the property of the gentrifiers. During the [[dot-com boom]] of the late 1990s, the gentrification of San Francisco's predominantly working class [[Mission District]] led some long-term neighborhood residents to create what they called the "Mission Yuppie Eradication Project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artgoodhitlerbad.com/signs-and-wonders/war-is-not-fair-but-it-does-have-class/ |title=War Is Not Fair, But It Does Have Class &amp;#124; Art Good, Hitler Bad |publisher=Art Good, Hitler Bad. |date= |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group allegedly destroyed property and called for property destruction as part of a strategy to oppose gentrification. Their activities drew hostile responses from the [[San Francisco Police Department]], real estate interests, and "work-within-the-system" housing activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/07/MN91476.DTL | title=Battle Over Gentrification Gets Ugly in S.F.'s Mission / Anarchist arrested, charged with making threats | date=7 June 1999 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meibion GlyndÅµr]] ({{lang-cy|Sons of [[Owain GlyndÅµr|GlyndÅµr]]}}), also known as the Valley Commandos, was a [[Welsh nationalist]] movement violently opposed to the loss of [[Welsh culture]] and [[Welsh language|language]]. They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of second homes being bought by the English which had increased house prices beyond the means of many locals. The group were responsible for setting fire to [[England|English]]-owned [[holiday home]]s in [[Wales]] from 1979 to the mid-1990s. In the first wave of attacks, eight holiday homes were destroyed in a month, and in 1980, Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in [[Operation TÃ¢n]]. Within the next ten years, some 220 properties were damaged by the campaign.&lt;ref name="BBC2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4084013.stm MP's theory over cottage burnings], BBC News, 10 December 2004. Accessed 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased. In 1989 there was a movement that protested an influx of Swabians to Berlin who were deemed as gentrification drivers. Berlin saw the [[Schwabenhass]] and 2013 SpÃ¤tzlerstreit controversies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Swabian Separatists Fling SpÃ¤tzle to Make a Point|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/world/europe/swabian-separatists-fling-spatzle-to-make-a-point.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 17 January 2013|access-date = 2015-12-04|issn = 0362-4331|first = Nicholas|last = Kulish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified gentrification with newcomers from the German south.

[[File:Bologna014.jpg|thumb|Canale delle Moline in Bologna]]

====Zoning ordinances====
Zoning ordinances and other [[urban planning]] tools can be used to recognize and support local business and industries. This can include requiring developers to continue with a current commercial tenant or offering development incentives for keeping existing businesses, as well as creating and maintaining industrial zones. Designing zoning to allow new housing near to a commercial corridor but not on top of it increases foot traffic to local businesses without redeveloping them. Businesses can become more stable by securing long-term commercial leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayareavision.org/initiatives/equitabledevelopment.html#sf|title=Equitable Development|last=|first=|date=|website=San Francisco Bay Area Vision Project|publisher=FOCUS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703184541/http://www.bayareavision.org/initiatives/equitabledevelopment.html|archive-date=2014-07-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although developers may recognize value in responding to living patterns, extensive zoning policies often prevent affordable homes from being constructed within urban development. Due to [[urban density]] restrictions, rezoning for residential development within urban living areas is difficult, which forces the builder and the market into urban sprawl and propagates the energy inefficiencies that come with distance from urban centers. In a recent example of restrictive urban zoning requirements, Arcadia Development Co. was prevented from rezoning a parcel for residential development in an urban setting within the city of Morgan Hill, California. With limitations established in the interest of public welfare, a density restriction was applied solely to Arcadia Development Co.'s parcel of development, excluding any planned residential expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://firsttuesdayjournal.com/multi-generational-housing-is-a-temporary-fix-for-economic-woes/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120225031044/http://firsttuesdayjournal.com/multi-generational-housing-is-a-temporary-fix-for-economic-woes/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 25 February 2012 |publisher= first tuesday |title= Multi-generational housing is a temporary fix for economic woes |date= 10 February 2012 |accessdate= 22 May 2012 |first= Mary |last= Balash }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community land trusts====
Because land [[speculation]] tends to raise property values, removing real estate (houses, buildings, land) from the open market stabilizes property values, and thereby prevents the economic eviction of the community's poorer residents. The most common, formal [[law|legal]] mechanism for such stability in English speaking countries is the [[community land trust]]; moreover, many [[inclusionary zoning]] ordinances formally place the "inclusionary" housing units in a [[land trust]]. German municipalities  and other cooperative actors have and maintain strong roles on the real estate markets in their realm.

====Rent control====
In jurisdictions where local or national government has these powers, there may be [[rent control]] regulations. Rent control restricts the rent that can be charged, so that incumbent tenants are not forced out by rising rents. If applicable to private landlords, it is a disincentive to speculating with property values, reduces the incidence of dwellings left empty, and limits availability of housing for new residents. If the law does not restrict the rent charged for dwellings that come onto the rental market (formerly owner-occupied or new build), rents in an area can still increase. The cities of southwestern [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and eastern [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] in [[California]], United States gentrified despiteâor perhaps, because ofârent control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedlevine.com/nedlevine2.htm|title=Evaluation of Rent Control in California|author=Ned Levine|year=2000|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a housing [[black market]] develops, wherein landlords withdraw houses and apartments from the market, making them available only upon payment of additional [[key money]], fees, or bribesâthus undermining the rent control law. Many such laws allow "vacancy decontrol", releasing a dwelling from rent control upon the tenant's leavingâresulting in steady losses of rent-controlled housing, ultimately rendering rent control laws ineffective in communities with a high rate of resident turnover. In other cases [[social housing]] owned by local authorities may be [[Right to buy scheme|sold to tenants]] and then sold on. Vacancy decontrol encourages landlords to find ways of shortening their residents' tenure, most aggressively through [[landlord harassment]]. To strengthen the rent control laws of [[New York City]], housing advocates active in [[rent control in New York]] are attempting to repeal the vacancy decontrol clauses of rent control laws. The state of [[Massachusetts]] abolished rent control in 1994; afterwards, rents rose, accelerating the pace of [[Boston]]'s gentrification; however, the laws protected few apartments, and confounding factors, such as a strong economy, had already been raising housing and rental prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenant.net/Alerts/Guide/papers/dreier/dreier2.html#anchor4305940|title=Rent Deregulation in California and Massachusetts: Politics, Policy, and Impacts&amp;nbsp;â Part II|author=Peter Dreier|year=1997|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!--Please do NOT include a neighborhood here unless neutral sources attest that it is experiencing gentrification.----&gt;

===Inner London, England===
Gentrification is not a new phenomenon in Britain; in [[ancient Rome]] the shop-free forum was developed during the [[Roman Republic]]an period, and in 2nd- and 3rd-century cities in [[Roman Britain]] there is evidence of small shops being replaced by large [[Roman villa|villas]].&lt;ref name=Roman&gt;[Trade, traders, and the ancient city, ed. Helen Parkins and Christopher John Smith, Routledge, 1998, p197]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King's College London]] academic Loretta Lees reported that much of [[Inner London]] was undergoing "super-gentrification", where "a new group of super-wealthy professionals, working in the [[City of London]] [i.e. the financial industry], is slowly imposing its mark on this Inner London housing market, in a way that differentiates it, and them, from traditional gentrifiers, and from the traditional urban upper classes&amp;nbsp;... Super-gentrification is quite different from the classical version of gentrification. It's of a higher economic order; you need a much higher salary and bonuses to live in [[Barnsbury]]" (some two miles north of [[central London]]).&lt;ref name=TimesSuperGentrification/&gt;

Barnsbury was built around 1820, as a middle-class neighbourhood, but after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939â1945), many people moved to the suburbs. The upper and middle classes were fleeing from the working class residents of London; the modern railway allowed it. At the war's end, the great housing demand rendered Barnsbury a place of cheap housing, where most people shared accommodation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, people moving into the area had to finance house renovations with their money, because banks rarely financed loans for Barnsbury. Moreover, the rehabilitating spark was ''The 1959 Housing Purchase and Housing Act'', investing Â£100&amp;nbsp;million to rehabilitating old properties and [[infrastructure]]. As a result, the principal population influx occurred between 1961 and 1975; the UK Census reports that "between the years of 1961 and 1981, owner-occupation increased from 7 to 19 per cent, furnished rentals declined from 14 to 7 per cent, and unfurnished rentals declined from 61 to 6 per cent";&lt;ref name = "Slater"&gt;(Slater, Lees, Wyly 13).&lt;/ref&gt; another example of urban gentrification is the super-gentrification, in the 1990s, of the neighboring working-class [[London Borough of Islington]], where Prime minister [[Tony Blair]] moved upon his election in 1997.&lt;ref name=TimesSuperGentrification&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article624781.ece |title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Timesonline.co.uk |date=21 December 2015 |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
From a market standpoint, there are two main requirements that are met by the U.S. cities that undergo substantial effects of gentrification. These are: an excess supply of deteriorated housing in central areas, as well as a considerable growth in the availability of professional jobs located in central business districts. These conditions have been met in the U.S. largely as a result of suburbanization and other postindustrial phenomena.

Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. industry has created a surplus of housing units as construction of new homes has far surpassed the rate of national household growth. However, the market forces that are dictated by an excess supply cannot fully explain the geographical specificity of gentrification in the U.S., for there are many large cities that meet this requirement and have not exhibited gentrification. The missing link is another factor that can be explained by particular, necessary demand forces. In U.S. cities in the time period from 1970 to 1978, growth of the central business district at around 20% did not dictate conditions for gentrification, while growth at or above 33% yielded appreciably larger gentrification activity.&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt; Succinctly, central business district growth will activate gentrification in the presence of a surplus in the inner city housing market.

In the U.S., these conditions were generated by the economic transition from manufacturing to [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[service economy|service economies]]. The post-[[World War II]] economy experienced a service revolution, which created white-collar jobs and larger opportunities for women in the work force, as well as an expansion in the importance of centralized administrative and cooperate activities. This increased the demand for inner city residences, which were readily available cheaply after much of the movement towards central city abandonment of the 1950s. The coupling of these movements is what became the trigger for the expansive gentrification of U.S. cities, including [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Reader"/&gt;

Measurement of the rate of gentrification during the period from 1990 to 2010 in 50 U.S. cities showed an increase in the rate of gentrification from 9% in the decade of the 1990s to 20% in the decade from 2000 to 2010 with 8% of the urban neighborhoods in the 50 cities being affected.

[[File:Atlanta etc. 019.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bungalows]] in [[Atlanta]]'s [[Inman Park]] neighborhood, United States]]

[[Gentrification in Atlanta]] has been taking place in its [[Intown Atlanta|inner-city neighborhoods]] since the 1970s. Many of Atlanta's neighborhoods experienced the urban flight that affected other major American cities in the 20th century, causing the decline of once upper and upper-middle-class [[Neighborhoods of Atlanta#East Side|east side]] neighborhoods. In the 1970s, after neighborhood opposition blocked two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the east side, its neighborhoods such as [[Inman Park]] and [[Virginia-Highland]] became the starting point for the city's gentrification wave, first becoming affordable neighborhoods attracting young people, and by 2000 having become relatively affluent areas attracting people from across [[Metro Atlanta]] to their upscale shops and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Virginia-Highland: Classic homes and convivial atmosphere reel 'em in | author = Emily Kleine | url = http://clatl.com/atlanta/virginia-highland/Content?oid=1229110 | newspaper = Creative Loafing | date = 27 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, gentrification expanded into other parts of Atlanta, spreading throughout the historic [[streetcar suburb]]s east of Downtown and Midtown, mostly areas that had long had black majorities such as the [[Old Fourth Ward]], [[Kirkwood (Atlanta)|Kirkwood]], [[Reynoldstown]] and [[Edgewood (Atlanta)|Edgewood]]. On the western side of the city, once-industrial [[West Midtown]] became a vibrant neighborhood full of residential lofts and a nexus of the arts, restaurants, and home furnishings. Gentrification by young African Americans was also taking place in the 1990s in southwest Atlanta neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A1540 "Adair Park: Newcomers rediscover the charms of this southwest hood", ''Creative Loafing'', October 7, 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120011948/http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A1540 |date=20 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BeltLine]] trail construction is expected to bring further gentrification in the neighborhoods alongside which it runs. Concerns about displacement of existing working-class black residents by increasing numbers of more affluent whites moving in are expressed by author [[Nathan McCall]] in his novel ''Them'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Them: A Novel|first=Nathan|last=McCall|date=6 November 2007|publisher=Atria|via=Amazon|isbn=978-1416549154}}&lt;/ref&gt; in The ''Atlanta Progressive News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/interspire/search?search_Query=gentrification |title=Page not found â Atlanta Progressive News |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222083813/http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/interspire/search?search_Query=gentrification |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the documentary ''[[The Atlanta Way (film)|The Atlanta Way]]''.

====Boston====
The city of [[Boston]] has seen several neighborhoods undergo significant periods of urban renewal, specifically during the 1960s to the 1980s. Called "turbo-gentrification" by sociologist Alan Wolfe, particular areas of study of the process have been done in South End, Bay Village, and West Cambridge. In Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]], the removal of the noisy [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway|Central Artery]] elevated highway attracted younger, more affluent new residents, in place of the traditional Italian immigrant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-19-gentrification_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Rick | last1=Hampson | title=Studies: Gentrification a boon | date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;South End
In the early 1960s, Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]] had a great many characteristics of a neighborhood that is prime for gentrification. The available housing was architecturally sound and unique row houses in a location with high accessibility to urban transport services, while surrounded by small squares and parks. A majority of the area had also been designated a [[Historic districts in the United States|National Historic District]].

South End became deteriorated by the 1960s. Many of the row houses had been converted to cheap apartments, and the neighborhood was plagued by dominant, visible poverty. The majority of the residents were working-class individuals and families with a significant need for public housing and other social services. The situation was recognized by local governments as unfavorable, and in 1960 became the target of an [[urban renewal]] effort of the city.

The construction of the [[Prudential Tower]] complex that was finished in 1964 along the northwest border of South End was a spark for this urban-renewal effort and the gentrification process for the area that surrounded it. The complex increased job availability in the area, and the cheap housing stock of South End began to attract a new wave of residents. The next 15&amp;nbsp;years saw an influx of predominantly affluent, young professionals who purchased and renovated houses in South End. Unfortunately, tension characterized the relationship between these new residents and the previous residents of the neighborhood. Clashes in the vision for the area's future was the main source of conflict. The previous, poorer residents, contended that "renewal" should focus on bettering the plight of South End's poor, while new, middle-class residents heavily favored private market investment opportunities and shunned efforts such as subsidized housing with the belief that they would flood the market and raise personal security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Auger |first=Deborah |title=The Politics of Revitalization in Gentrifying Neighborhoods The Case of Boston's South End |journal=Journal of the American Planning Association |volume=45 |issue=4 |year=1979 |pages=515â522 |doi=10.1080/01944367908976999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bay Village
The late 1940s was a transition for the area from primarily families with children as residents to a population dominated by both retired residents and transient renters. The 2â3 story brick row houses were largely converted to low-cost lodging houses, and the neighborhood came to be described as "blighted" and "down at heel". This deterioration was largely blamed on the transient population.

The year 1957 began the upgrading of what was to become [[Bay Village, Boston|Bay Village]], and these changes were mainly attributed to new artists and gay men moving to the area. These "marginal" gentrifiers made significant efforts towards superficial beautification as well as rehabilitation of their new homes, setting the stage for realtors to promote the rising value of the area.

Of the homebuyers in Bay Village from 1957 to 1975, 92% had careers as white-collar professionals. 42% of these homebuyers were 25â34&amp;nbsp;years old. The majority of them were highly educated and moving from a previous residence in the city, suggesting ties to an urban-based educational institution. The reasons new homebuyers gave for their choice of residence in Bay Village was largely attributed to its proximity to downtown, as well as an appreciation for city life over that of suburbia (Pattison 1977).

;West Cambridge
The development and gentrification of [[West Cambridge (neighborhood)|West Cambridge]] began in 1960 as the resident population began to shift away from the traditional majority of working class [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrants]]. The period of 1960â1975 had large shifts in homebuyer demographics comparable to that experienced by Bay Village. Professional occupations were overrepresented in homebuyers during this 15-year period, as well as the age group of 25â34&amp;nbsp;years old. Residents reported a visible lack of social ties between new homebuyers and the original residents. However, displacement was not cited as a problem because the primary reason of housing sale remained the death of the sole-surviving member of the household or the death of a spouse.

Researcher Timothy Pattison divided the gentrification process of West Cambridge into two main stages. Stage one began with various architects and architectural students who were attracted to the affordability of the neighborhood. The renovations efforts these "marginal" gentrifiers undertook seemed to spark a new interest in the area, perhaps as word of the cheap land spread to the wider student community.

The Peabody Schools also served as an enticing factor for the new gentrifiers for both stages of new homebuyers. Stage two of the process brought more architects to the area as well as non-architect professionals, often employed at a university institution. The buyers in stage two cited Peabody schools and the socioeconomic mix of the neighborhood as primary reasons for their residential choice, as well as a desire to avoid job commutes and a disenchantment with the suburban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pattison |first=Timothy James |title=The Process of Neighborhood Upgrading and Gentrification an Examination of Two Neighborhoods in the Boston Metropolitan Area |journal=Thesis.

{{main|Gentrification of Chicago}}

[[Chicago]]'s gentrification rate was reported to be 16.8% in 2015.&lt;ref name="GoverningRanking" /&gt; But researchers have claimed that it has had a significant on specific urban neighborhoods and led to destabilization of black and Latino communities and their shared cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betancur|first=John|date=2010-06-29|title=Gentrification and Community Fabric in Chicago|journal=Urban Studies|language=en|volume=48|issue=2|pages=383â406|doi=10.1177/0042098009360680|pmid=21275200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David|last2=Grammenos|first2=Dennis|date=2016-11-29|title=Gentrification, Discourse, and the Body: Chicago's Humboldt Park|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=295â312|doi=10.1068/d0203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philadelphia: Darien Street====
{{further|Gentrification in Philadelphia}}

''Gentrification Amid Urban Decline: Strategies for America's Older Cities'', by Michael Lang, reports the process and impact (social, economic, cultural) of gentrification.&lt;ref name="lang82"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Michael|title=Gentrification Amid Urban Decline: Strategies for America's Older Cities|date=1982|publisher=Ballinger Publishing Co,|isbn=978-0-88410-697-5|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnayAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it focuses on the section of Darien Street (a north-south street running intermittently from South to North Philadelphia) which is essentially an alley in the populous [[Bella Vista, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Bella Vista]] neighborhood. That part of Darien Street was a "back street", because it does not connect to any of the city's main arteries and was unpaved for most of its existence.

In its early days, this area of Darien Street housed only Italian families; however, after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939â1945), when the municipal government spoke of building a cross-town highway, the families moved out. Most of the houses date from 1885 (built for the artisans and craftsmen who worked and lived in the area), but, when the Italian Americans moved out, the community's low-rent houses went to poor African American families. Moreover, by the early 1970s, [[urban blight|blighted]] Darien Street was at its lowest point as a community, because the houses held little [[property value]], many were abandoned, having broken heaters and collapsed roofs, et cetera.&lt;ref name = "Lang 17"&gt;Lang p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the houses were very small&amp;nbsp;â approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep, each had three one-room stories (locally known, and still currently advertised as a "Trinity" style house) and the largest yard was {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep. Despite the decay, Darien Street remained charmed with European echoes, each house was architecturally different, contributing to the street's community character; children were safe, there was no car traffic. The closeness of the houses generated a closely knit community located just to the south of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], an inexpensive residential neighborhood a short distance from the city-life amenities of Philadelphia; the city government did not hesitate to [[urban renewal|rehabilitate]] it.

The gentrification began in 1977; the first house rehabilitated was a corner property that a school teacher re-modeled and occupied. The next years featured (mostly) white middle-class men moving into the abandoned houses; the first displacement of original Darien Street residents occurred in 1979. Two years later, five of seven families had been economically evicted with inflated housing prices; the two remaining families were renters, expecting eventual displacement. In five years, from 1977 to 1982, the gentrification of Darien Street reduced the original population from seven black households and one white household, to two black households and eleven white households. The average rent increased 488 per cent&amp;nbsp;â from $85 to $500 a month; by 1981, a house bought for $5,000 sold for $35,000. Of the five black households displaced, three found better houses within two blocks of their original residence, one family left Pennsylvania, and one family moved into a [[public housing]] apartment building five blocks from Darien Street.&lt;ref name = "Lang 17-8"&gt;Lang pp. 17â8.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of the Darien Street gentrification included increased property tax revenues and better-quality housing. The principal detriment was residential displacement via higher priced housing.&lt;ref name = "Lang 18-9"&gt;Lang pp. 18â9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington, D.C.====
Gentrification in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the most studied examples of the process, as well as one of the most extreme. The process in the [[U Street Corridor]] and other downtown areas has recently become a major issue, and the resulting changes have led to [[African-Americans]] dropping from a majority to a minority of the population, as they move out and middle-class whites and Asians have moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/08/facts-and-fictions-gentrification-dc/2914/ | work=The Atlantic | first1=Garance | last1=Franke-Ruta | title=Facts and Fictions of D.C.'s Gentrification | date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington is one of the top three cities with the most pronounced capital flow into its "core" neighborhoods, a measurement that has been used to detect areas experiencing gentrification. Researcher Franklin James found that, of these core areas, [[Capitol Hill]] was significantly revitalized during the decade of 1960â1970, and by the end of the decade this revitalization had extended outward in a ring around this core area.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;  Dennis Gale studied these "Revitalization Areas," which include the [[Dupont Circle]], [[Adams Morgan]], and Capitol Hill neighborhoods, and as compared to the rest of the city found that these areas were experiencing a faster rate of [[population decline|depopulation]] in the 1970s than the surrounding areas. [[United States Census|U.S. census data]] show that in the Revitalization Areas, the percentage of the population with four or more years of college education rose from 24% in 1970 to 47% in 1980, as opposed to an increase of 21% to 24% for the remaining areas of Washington. Additionally, Gale's data show that in 1970, 73% of the residents living in the Revitalization Areas had been residents since 1965; however, in 1975, only 66% of the residents living there had been residents of the area in 1970 as well.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

The gentrification during this time period resulted in a significant problem of displacement for marginalized city residents in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; A decrease in the stock of affordable housing for needy households as well as non[[subsidized housing]] for low-income workers has had a burdensome effect on individuals and families.&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;Gale, Dennis E. Washington, D.C.: Inner-city Revitalization and Minority Suburbanization. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of gentrification, however, Washington's safety has improved drastically. In the early 1990s, the city had an average of 500 homicides a year; by 2012, the rate had dropped by more than 80% to about 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/10/19/how-washington-d-c-got-off-the-most-dangerous-cities-list/ | work=Forbes | first1=Daniel | last1=Fisher |title=How Washington D.C.

Prince George's County saw a huge spark of violent crimes in 2008 and 2009, but the rate has decreased since then.

====San Francisco====
{{further|Gentrification of San Francisco}}A major driver of gentrification in [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] cities such as [[San Francisco]] has been attributed with the [[Dot-com boom|Dot-Com Boom]] in the 1990s, creating a strong demand for skilled tech workers from local startups and nearby [[Silicon Valley]] businesses leading to rising standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spur.org/documents/010701_article_03.shtm |title=SPUR - Articles - San Francisco by the Numbers: Planning After the 2000 Census |date=11 February 2005 |access-date=2016-11-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211032911/http://spur.org/documents/010701_article_03.shtm |archivedate=11 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private shuttle buses operated by companies such as [[Google]] have driven up rents in areas near their stops, leading to some [[San Francisco tech bus protests|protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Koning|first1=Rosanne|title=Google Bus and Spatial Justice: A Call for Greater Social Responsibility in Urban Governance|url=http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=545104|website=Digital Academic Repository of the University of Amsterdam|publisher=[[University of Amsterdam]]|accessdate=4 March 2015|ref=bus-spatial}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large influx of new workers in the internet and technology sector began contributing to the gentrification of historically poor immigrant neighborhoods such as the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/05/us/mission-district-fights-case-of-dot-com-fever.html|title=Mission District Fights Case of Dot-Com Fever|last=Nieves|first=Evelyn|date=5 November 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time San Francisco began a transformation, eventually culminating in it becoming the most expensive city in which to live in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-20-most-expensive-cities-for-renters-2015-8/#2-new-york-city-new-york-the-average-rent-for-a-one-bedroom-here-is-3100-a-month-1111111119|title=America's 20 most expensive cities for renters|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 2010, 18,000 African Americans left San Francisco, while the White, Asian, and Hispanic populations saw growth in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/counties/SanFranciscoCounty.htm|title=Bay Area Census -- San Francisco City and County|website=Bayareacensus.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010 to 2014, the number of households making $100,000 grew while households making less than $100,000 declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=Factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=Factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Community Survey]], during this same period an average of 60,000 people both migrated to San Francisco and migrated out. The people who left the city were more likely to be nonwhite, have lower education levels, and have lower incomes than their counterparts who moved into the city. In addition, there was a net annual migration of 7,500 people age 35 or under, and net out migration of over 5,000 for people 36 or over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml?src=bkmk|title=American FactFinder - Community Facts|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=Factfinder.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{further|Gentrification of Vancouver}}
{{As of|2011}}, gentrification in Canada has proceeded quickly in older and denser cities such as [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Vancouver]], but has barely begun in places such as Calgary, Edmonton, or Winnipeg, where suburban expansion is still the primary type of growth. Since Canada did not experience the same degree of "white flight" as in the U.S. during the 1960s and 70s, the term "gentrification" in Canada is not synonymous with predominantly-white people moving into the neighborhoods of people of color, as it is in the United States. In fact in Toronto and Vancouver recent Asian immigrants and foreign buyers are also major purchasers of downtown housing, contributing to a major housing price spike in those cities in 2011.&lt;ref name="financialpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages/Vancouver+housing+market+surges+thanks+Chinese+buyers/4796258/story.html|title=Vancouver housing market surges thanks to Chinese buyers|publisher=financialpost.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec City. The Saint Roch district in the city's lower town was previously predominantly working class and had gone through a period of decline. However, since the early to mid 2000's, the area has seen the derelict buildings turned into condos and the opening of bars, restaurants and cafes, attracting young professionals into the area, but kicking out the residents from many generations back. Several software developers  and gaming companies, such as Ubisoft and Benox have also opened offices there.

===France===
In Paris, most poor neighborhoods in the east have seen rising prices and the arrival of many wealthy residents. However, the process is mitigated by social housing and most cities tend to favor a "social mix"; that is, having both low and high-income residents in the same neighborhoods. But in practice, social housing does not cater to the poorest segment of the population; most residents of social dwellings are from the low-end of the middle class. As a result, a lot of poor people have been forced to go first to the close suburbs (1970 to 2000) and then more and more to remote "periurban areas" where public transport is almost nonexistent. The close suburbs (Saint-Ouen, Saint Denis, Aubervilliers, ...) are now in the early stages of gentrification although still poor. A lot of high-profile companies offering well-paid jobs have moved near Saint-Denis and new real-estate programs are underway to provide living areas close to the new jobs.

On the other side, the eviction of the poorest people to periurban areas since 2000 has been analyzed as the main cause for the rising political far-right national front. When the poor lived in the close suburbs, their problems were very visible to the wealthy population. But the periurban population and its problem is mainly "invisible" from recent presidential campaign promises. These people have labelled themselves "les invisibles". Many of them fled both rising costs in Paris and nearby suburbs with an insecure and ugly environment to live in small houses in the countryside but close to the city. But they did not factor in the huge financial and human cost of having up to four hours of transportation every day. Since then, a lot has been invested in the close suburbs (with new public transports set to open and urban renewal programs) they fled, but almost nobody cares of these "invisible" plots of land. Since the close suburbs are now mostly inhabited by immigrants, these people have a strong resentment against immigration: They feel everything is done for new immigrants but nothing for the native French population.

This has been first documented in the book ''Plaidoyer pour une gauche populaire'' by think-tank Terra-Nova which had a major influence on all contestants in the presidential election (and at least, Sarkozy, [[FranÃ§ois Hollande]], and [[Marine Le Pen]]). This electorate voted overwhelmingly in favor of Marine Le Pen and Sarkozy while the city centers and close suburbs voted overwhelmingly for FranÃ§ois Hollande.

Most major metropolises in France follow the same pattern with a belt of periurban development about 30 to 80&amp;nbsp;kilometers of the center where a lot of poor people moved in and are now trapped by rising fuel costs. These communities have been disrupted by the arrival of new people and already suffered of high unemployment due to the dwindling numbers of industrial jobs.

In smaller cities, the suburbs are still the principal place where people live and the center is more and more akin to a commercial estate where a lot of commercial activities take place but where few people live.

===Cape Town, South Africa===
The ''[[Bo-Kaap]]'' pocket of [[Cape Town]] nestles against the slopes of Signal Hill. It has traditionally been occupied by members of South Africa's minority, mainly Muslim, [[Cape Malay]] community. These descendants of artisans and political captives, brought to the Cape as early as the 18th century as slaves and indentured workers, were housed in small barrack-like abodes on what used to be the outskirts of town. As the city limits increased, property in the Bo-Kaap became very sought after, not only for its location but also for its picturesque cobble-streets and narrow avenues. Increasingly, this close-knit community is "facing a slow dissolution of its distinctive character as wealthy outsiders move into the suburb to snap up homes in the City Bowl at cut-rate prices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocfm.co.za/index.php?%26section%3Dnews%26category%3D%26vocnews%3D%26article%3D12096 |deadurl=yes |title=Bo-Kaap gentrification sees residents evicted |website=Voice of the Cape |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723235708/http://www.vocfm.co.za/index.php?&amp;section=news&amp;category=&amp;vocnews=&amp;article=12096 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inter-community conflict has also arisen as some residents object to the sale of buildings and the resultant eviction of long-term residents.

===Italy===
[[File:Via_Tortona_-_design_street.jpg|thumb|right|Design street in Milan's [[Zona Tortona]].]]
In [[Italy]], similarly to other countries around the world, the phenomenon of gentrification is proceeding in the largest cities, such as [[Milan]], [[Turin]], [[Genoa]] and [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="ilfattoquotidiano"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balocco|first1=Fabio|title=Gentrification, il fenomeno che cambia l'aspetto delle nostre cittÃ |journal=Il Fatto Quotidiano|date=28 October 2015|ref=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/10/28/gentrification-il-fenomeno-che-cambia-laspetto-delle-nostre-citta/2163808/|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diappi"/&gt;

In Milan, gentrification is changing the look of some semi-central neighborhoods, just outside the inner ring road (called ''[[Walls of Milan#Spanish walls|Cerchia dei Bastioni]]''), particularly of former working class and industrial areas.
One of the most well known cases is the neighborhood of [[Isola (district of Milan)|Isola]]. Despite its position, this area has been for a long time considered as a suburb since it has been an isolated part of the city, due to the physical barriers such as the railways and the [[Naviglio Martesana]]. In the 1950s, a new [[Centro Direzionale di Milano|business district]] was built not far from this area, but Isola remained a distant and low-class area. In the 2000s vigorous efforts to make Isola as a symbolic place of the Milan of the future were carried out and, with this aim, the Porta Garibaldi-Isola districts became attractors for stylists and artists.&lt;ref name="diappi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diappi|first1=Lidia|title=Rigenerazione urbana e ricambio sociale.

Another semi-central district that has undergone this phenomenon in Milan is [[Zona Tortona]]. Former industrial area situated behind [[Milano Porta Genova railway station|Porta Genova station]], Zona Tortona is nowadays the mecca of Italian design and annually hosts some of the most important events of the ''[[Milan Design Week|Fuorisalone]]'' during which more than 150 expositors, such as [[Superstudio]], take part.&lt;ref name="mentelocale"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dispenza|first1=Andrea|title=Zona Tortona: il quartiere di Milano che dalla fabbrica passa a moda e design|url=http://milano.mentelocale.it/28696-zona-tortona-il-quartiere-di-milano-che-dalla-fabbrica-passa-a-moda-e-design/|website=Mentelocale.it|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tortonadesignweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tortona Design Week|url=http://www.tortonadesignweek.com/|language=it|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211215733/http://www.tortonadesignweek.com/|archivedate=2012-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zona Tortona, some of important landmarks, related to culture, design and arts, are located such as ''Fondazione [[Arnaldo Pomodoro|Pomodoro]]'', the ''[[Armani/Silos]]'', ''Spazio A'' and ''MUDEC''.

Going towards the outskirts of the city, other gentrified areas of Milan are [[Lambrate|Lambrate-Ventura]] (where others events of the ''Fuorisalone'' are hosted),&lt;ref name="giorgi"&gt;{{cite newspaper |last1=Giorgi|first1=Anna|title=Lambrate sa di Londra, il quartiere torna a vivere con East Market|newspaper=Il Giorno|date=7 February 2016|url=http://www.ilgiorno.it/milano/lambrate-east-market-1.1710492|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="signorelli"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Signorelli|first1=Andrea|title=Lambrate Ventura: il quartiere cool del momento|url=http://www.02blog.it/post/86467/lambrate-ventura-quartieri-milano|website=02blog.it|accessdate=21 March 2016|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bicocca (district of Milan)|Bicocca]] and [[Bovisa]] (in which universities have contributed to the gentrification of the areas), [[Sesto San Giovanni]], Via Sammartini, and the so-called [[Piazzale Loreto|NoLo]] district (which means ''Nord di Loreto'').&lt;ref name="arsuffi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arsuffi|first1=Roberto|title=Milano Loreto â Benvenuti a NoLo|url=http://blog.urbanfile.org/2016/03/18/milano-loreto-benvenuti-a-nolo/|website=Blog.urbanfile.org|accessdate=21 March 2016|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===

In Poland, gentrification is proceeding mostly in the big cities like [[Warsaw]], [[ÅÃ³dÅº]], [[Cracow]], [[Silesian Metropolis]], [[PoznaÅ]], [[WrocÅaw]]. The reason of this is both de-industrialisation and poor condition of residential areas.

The biggest European ongoing gentrification process has been occurring in [[ÅÃ³dÅº]] from the beginning of 2010s. Huge unemployment (24% in 1990s) caused by the downfall of the garment industry created both economic and social problems. Moreover, vast majority of industrial and housing facilities had been constructed in the late 19th century and the renovation was neglected after [[WWII]]. [[ÅÃ³dÅº]] authorities rebuilt the industrial district into the New City Center. This included re-purposing buildings including the former electrical power and heating station into the [[ÅÃ³dÅº Fabryczna]] railway station and the [[EC1 Science Museum]].

There are other significant gentrifications in Poland, such as:
*[[Cracow]] â the Jewish district [[Kazimierz]], gentrification  financed mostly by private investors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/style/19iht-pol.html]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113222957/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/style/19iht-pol.html |date=2017-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[PoznaÅ]] â build up Law Department of [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in the post military facility.  
*[[WrocÅaw]] â Nadodrze and Nowe Å»erniki districts; residential area drown upon the [[modernism]] concepts.
*[[WaÅbrzych]], Julia coal mine â adaptation post-industrial buildings to art and cultural facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archirama.muratorplus.pl/architektura/rewitalizacja-starej-kopalni-w-walbrzychu,67_3803.html#|title=Rewitalizacja Starej Kopalni w WaÅbrzychu|website=Archirama.muratorplus.pl|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Warsaw]], [[Praga PÃ³Ånoc]] district.

Nowadays the Polish government has started National Revitalization Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mib.gov.pl/files/0/1796888/NarodowyPlanRewitalizacjiZalozenia062014.pdf|title=Strona gÅÃ³wna :  Ministerstwo Infrastruktury|website=Mib.gov.pl|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ensures financial support to municipal gentrification programs.

==East Harlem==
In East Harlem, the phenomenon of gentrification has led to an influx of tourists and development. Lower income neighborhoods are now subject to higher rents as well as costs of living.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/opinion/sunday/the-end-of-black-harlem.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black and Latino communities in the area are being displaced rapidly due to higher costs of living. There has been a decrease in the supply of for affordable housing in favor of more expensive condos. Non-subsidized housing for lower income individuals has also decreased with new development in the area. East Harlem, being roughly 20 minutes away from [[New Jersey]], [[The Bronx]] and midtown [[Manhattan]], seems to be the right candidate for a new wave of gentrification in rural areas. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.governing.com/gov-data/new-york-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gentrification process in the area results in a widespread displacement of small business owners who struggle to adapt to new competing businesses such as retailers, bars and restaurants.

==Anti-gentrification protests==

=== Movement for Justice in El Barrio ===
The Movement for Justice in El Barrio is an immigrant-led, organized group of tenants who resist against gentrification in East Harlem, New York. This movement has 954 members and 95 building communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/35625-participatory-democracy-drives-anti-gentrification-movement-in-new-york-s-el-barrio|title=Participatory Democracy Drives Anti-Gentrification Movement in New York's El Barrio|last=Davies|first=Jessica|website=Truthout|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 2006, the MJB gathered people to protest in the New York City Hall against an investment bank in the United Kingdom that purchased 47 buildings and 1,137 homes in East Harlem. News of these protests reached England, Scotland, France and Spain. MJB made a call to action that everyone, internationally, should fight against gentrification. This movement gained international traction and also became known as the International Campaign Against Gentrification in El Barrio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2008/4/7/headlines/international_campaign_against_gentrification_launched|title=International Campaign Against Gentrification Launched|website=Democracy Now!|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idealist.org/view/nonprofit/H2dW3SPD9GBD/|title=Nonprofit (New York): Movement for Justice in El Barrio|website=Idealist.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/04/22/el-barrio-fights-back-against-globalized-gentrification/|title=El Barrio Fights Back Against Globalized Gentrification|date=22 April 2008|website=Counterpunch.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cereal Killer Cafe protest===
On 26 September 2015, a cereal cafe in East London called Cereal Killer Cafe was attacked by a large group of anti-gentrification protestors. These protestors carried with them a pig's head and torches, stating that they were tired of unaffordable luxury flats going into their neighbourhoods. These protestors were alleged to primarily be "middle-class academics," who were upset by the lack of community and culture that they once saw in East London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/cereal-killer-london-gentrification-housing/408199/|title=Why Are Londoners Attacking a Cereal Cafe?|last=Horn|first=Heather|newspaper=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/27/shoreditch-cereal-cafe-targeted-by-anti-gentrification-protesters|title=Shoreditch Cereal Killer Cafe targeted in anti-gentrification protests|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|date=27 September 2015|last2=Halliday|first2=Josh|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; People targeted Cereal Killer Cafe during their protest because of an alleged article in which one of the brothers with ownership of the cafe had said marking up prices was necessary as a business in the area. After the attack on the cafe, users on Twitter were upset that protestors had targeted a small business as the focus of their demonstration, as opposed to a larger one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Europe - Anti-gentrification movement grows in London {{!}} All media content {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 1 October 2015|url=http://www.dw.com/en/inside-europe-anti-gentrification-movement-grows-in-london/av-18752785|website=Dw.com|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Francisco tech bus protests===
The [[San Francisco tech bus protests]] occurred in late 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, protesting against tech shuttle buses that take employees to and from their homes in the Bay Area to workplaces in Silicon Valley. Protestors said the buses were symbolic of the gentrification occurring in the city, rising rent prices, and the displacement of small businesses. This protest gained global attention and also inspired anti-gentrification movements in East London.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Protest-Blocks-Tech-Buses-in-San-Francisco-as-Supes-Consider-Extending-Program-368202491.html|title=Protests Block Tech Buses in San Francisco|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ink! Coffee Protest (Denver, Colorado)===
On November 22, 2017, ink! Coffee, a small coffee shop, placed a manufactured metal [[Sandwich board]] sign on the sidewalk outside one of their [[Denver]] locations in the historic [[Five Points, Denver]] neighborhood.  The sign said âHappily gentrifying the neighborhood since 2014â on one side and "Nothing says gentrification like being able to order a cortadoâ on the other side.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/22/ink-coffee-gentrification-joke-denver/|title=Ink!

Ink's ad ignited outrage and garnered national attention when a picture of the sign was shared on social media by a prominent Denver writer, Ru Johnson.  The picture of the sign quickly went viral accumulating critical comments and negative reviews. Ink! responded to the social media outrage with a public apology followed by a lengthier apology from its founder, Keith Herbert.  Ink's public apology deemed the sign a bad joke causing even more outrage on social media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ad design was created by a Five Points, Denver firm named Cultivator Advertising &amp; Design.  The advertising firm responded to the public's dismay by issuing an ill-received social media apology, "An Open Letter to Our Neighbors".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The night following the debut of ink's controversial ad campaign their [[Five Points, Denver]] location was vandalized.  A window was broken and the words "WHITE COFFEE" among others were spray-painted onto the front of the building.  Protest organizers gathered at the coffee shop daily following the controversy.

[[Image:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|''[[The Geographer]]'' (1668-69), by [[Johannes Vermeer]] ]]

A '''geographer''' is a scientist whose area of study is [[geography]], the study of [[Earth]]'s natural environment and human society. The Greek prefix, "geo," means "earth" and the Greek suffix, "graphy," meaning "description," so a geographer is someone who studies the earth. The word "[[geography]]" is a [[Middle French]] word that is believed to have been first used in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=geography (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/geography |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geographers are historically known as people who make [[maps]], map making is actually the field of study of [[cartography]], a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to the human society and how the human society affects the natural environment.

In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society. Modern geographers are the primary practitioners of the GIS ([[geographic information system]]), who are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms.

The paintings by [[Johannes Vermeer]] titled ''[[The Geographer]]'' and ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668â69.

== Famous Geographers ==
=== Eratosthenes (Greek) ===
The [[ancient Greeks]] discovered much of the knowledge that formed the basis for later scientific and geographical discoveries. [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (born circa 276 BCE in [[Cyrene, Libya]]; died circa 194 BCE in [[Alexandria, Egypt]]) was a Greek [[writer]], [[poet]], [[astronomer]], and geographer who created the first known measurements of the [[Earth#Infobox Physical characteristics|Earth's circumference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eratosthenes |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eratosthenes |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used the angles at which the sun's rays fall on the ground to calculate the curvature of the Earth's surface, which he then used to determine the full horizontal length around the Earth. According to the works of [[Aristotle]], other scientists had estimated the circumference of the Earth prior to Eratosthenes's discovery, but the records of the specific methods and calculations that they used did not survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eratosthenes |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eratosthenes |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hipparchus (Greek) ===
[[Hipparchus]] (born in Nicaea, Bithynia [now Iznik, Turkey]; believed to have died after 127 BC in [[Rhodes]]) is best known for using [[astronomical]] studies to predict the movements and positions of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Hipparchus |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095937997 |website=www.oxfordreference.com |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered the [[equinoxes]] ([[autumnal equinox]] and [[spring equinox]]) and calculated the length of the [[solar year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Collins English Dictionary |title=Hipparchus |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hipparchus |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus was also the first to correctly determine the distance between the earth and the moon (which he believed was equal to 63 times the earth's radius, although it is actually equal to 60 times the earth's radius). Building upon this knowledge, he developed the [[parallax]] theory to explain the apparent displacement of celestial bodies relative to the observer's vantage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Hipparchus |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095937997 |website=www.oxfordreference.com |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Hipparchus |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hipparchus-Greek-astronomer |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=23 September 2018 |format=Web. |date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alexander von Humboldt (German) ===
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (born Sept. 14, 1769 in Berlin; died May 6, 1859) was a German geographer, [[naturalist]] and [[explorer]] who made major contributions to the field of [[biogeography]] by producing break-through research on the connection between the [[climate]] of a region and the [[plant life]] growing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=5 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records he kept of his travels provided highly valuable data on the geography of [[Central Asia]], which was not very well understood by [[Europeans]] at the time. Furthermore, with the help of [[Sir Edward Sabine]], he was able to prove that the origin of [[storms]] is extraterrestrial by showing the relationship between magnetic storms on [[earth]] with the changing activity of [[sun spots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his latter years, Humboldt published a multi-volume series of books called ''[[Kosmos]]'', wherein he described the structure of the universe as it was then understood. Initially, he published four volumes, which were received with great success and were subsequently translated into almost every European language. Humboldt began work on the fifth volume, but died before it was completed (he was ninety years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kellner |first1=Charlotte L. |title=Alexander von Humboldt |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-von-Humboldt |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web article |date=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humboldt Current]] (also known as the [[Peru Current]]), which was named after him, is an ocean current that holds warm air off a 600-mile coastal region between [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] in [[South America]], thereby keeping the [[climate]] cool. Humboldt had explored this region in 1802, and it is now known for containing the world's richest [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiger |first1=Patrick J. |title=Who Was Alexander von Humboldt and What Is the Humboldt Current? |url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/alexander-von-humboldt-and-humboldt-current.htm |website=science.howstuffworks.com |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=16 September 2018 |format=Web. |date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alfred Russel (A.R.) Wallace (British) ===
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]], also known as A.R. Wallace, (born on Jan. 8, 1823, in [[Usk]], Monmouthshire, Wales; died on Nov. 7, 1913, in Broadstone, [[Dorset, England]]), was a British [[naturalist]], [[geographer]], and [[social critic]] who is most known for formulating the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] before [[Charles Darwin]] published his famous work on the same subject, ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Camerini |first1=Jane R. |title=Alfred Russel Wallace |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Russel-Wallace |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avid traveler and explorer, Wallace became both rich and famous from the work he did identifying new animal [[species]] in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Amazon_rainforest|Amazon region]]. Importantly, Wallace discovered and defined the concept of "[[speciation]]," which he discussed in a paper he published around 1865 describing his research on [[butterflies]]. Speciation refers to defining animal [[species]] based on their interbreeding capabilities; animals within the same species can breed with each other, but not with animals from other species. In this way, individual species can be identified for [[scientific classification]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garrity |first1=Lyn |title=Out of Darwinâs Shadow |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/out-of-darwins-shadow-48274065/ |website=www.smithsonianmag.com |publisher=Smithsonian.com |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Francis Burton (British) ===
[[Sir Richard Francis Burton]] (born on March 19, 1821, in [[Torquay]], Devonshire, [[England]]; died on October 20, 1890, in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]] [now in [[Italy]]]) is known for being the first European to discover [[Lake Tanganyika]] in east Africa and for gaining access to [[Muslim]] cities, which Europeans had previously been forbidden to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brodie |first1=Fawn McKay |title=Sir Richard Burton |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Burton-British-scholar-and-explorer |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |format=Web article. |date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be the second deepest and the second largest freshwater lake in the world and is believed to be one of the oldest lakes in the world (approximately twenty million years old by evolutionary timelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lake Tanganyika |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/p/index.php?title=Lake_Tanganyika&amp;oldid=1012460 |website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strabo (Greek) ===
[[Strabo]] (born circa 64 BC in [[Amaseia]], Pontus; died some time after 21 AD) was a Greek geographer and historian who left a remarkably comprehensive written record of all the people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans around 27 BC-14 AD. This record, a book called ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'', also provides information on the technology geographers used to study the world at that time as well as the history of the many of the countries mentioned in his records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strabo: Greek Geographer and Historian |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Strabo |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopeadia Britannica |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Strabo's account is far from perfect (it assumes, for example, that the earth, then called [[oikoumene]], is one giant landmass consisting of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and their associated [[islands]] surrounded by a large [[ocean]]), his writing is highly valued for being a rich compilation of not only his own observations but also the research and ideas of other respected scientific figures and thinkers including [[Eratosthenes]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Polybius]], [[Artemidorus]], [[Apollodorus_of_Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strabo |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/strabo |website=www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography |accessdate=10 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muhammad al-Idrisi (Moroccan) ===
[[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (born in 1100 in Ceutah, [[Morocco]]; died around 1165-66 in Ceutah) is known for compiling an enormous  world geography for the Norman King of Sicily, [[Roger II]]. The book, subsequently named the ''[[Book of Roger]]'', was completed in January 1154 and was written as the commentary for a large map of the world created by al-Idrisi (also at the bequest of the King). An avid traveler himself, al-Idrisi relied on contemporary accounts of the world, the works of [[Ptolemy]], as well as geographical literature from Greek, Latin, and Arabic sources to create his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(author unknown) |title=Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Idrisi |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/muhammad-ibn-muhammad-al-idrisi |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography |accessdate=14 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of Roger'' contained fairly accurate information on the countries of Europe and was released in several editions although, as of the mid-1900s, the full text had never been edited.

=== Claudius Ptolemy (Ancient Roman) ===
Claudius Ptolemy, known simply as [[Ptolemy]], (born around 100 AD; died c. 170 AD) was an [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]], and [[geographer]] who lived in [[Alexandria]] and is known for (among other things) drawing detailed maps of what was known of the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Alexander Raymond |title=Ptolemy |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=14 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's geographical works include tables of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] and a discussion of how such lines could be mathematically calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Science |title=Ptolemy (CA. 100-170) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/ancient-history-egypt-biographies/ptolemy-vii |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ptolemy's most famous work, ''[[Almagest]]'', he comprehensively describes the layout of the stars and other astronomical objects as understood by ancient Greek and Babylonian scientists. He also put forth the idea of an earth-centered universe, an idea widely believed until the 1500s when [[Copernicus]] began to suggest that the earth and other planets in the solar system actually revolve around the [[sun]] (called the ''[[heliocentric]]'' (Sun-centered) theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ptolemy |url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ptolemy |website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Gerardus Mercator (Belgian) ===
[[Gerardus Mercator]], originally name Gerard De Cremer or simply Kremer(?) (born on March 5, 1512 in [[Rupelmonde]], [[Flanders]] [now in [[Belgium]]]; died on December 2, 1594 in [[Duisburg]], Duchy of Cleve [now in [[Germany]]]) was a [[cartographer]] famous for creating a heart-shaped representation of the earth (also called the "[[Mercator projection]]" of the earth) in response to a demand for flat [[maps]] that could accurately depict the earth as a [[spherical]] object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cavendish |first1=Richard |title=The Birth of Gerardus Mercator |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/birth-gerardus-mercator |website=https://www.historytoday.com |publisher=History Today Ltd. |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercator was also the first to begin using the term "atlas" to describe a collection of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Gerardus Mercator |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his work, travelers and explorers could maintain a course over long distances using straight lines, thus eliminating the need to constantly adjust their [[compass]] readings in order to keep track of their movements.

=== Charles Lyell (British) ===
[[Charles Lyell]] (1797â1875) was a British [[geologist]] whose theory of [[Uniformitarianism]] significantly impacted the way modern scientists understand the earth's structure and how this structure can change over time. Uniformitarianism overturned the previously accepted theory of [[Catastrophism]], which held that earth's features were formed by sudden, violent forces rather than by gradual changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=A Dictionary of Plant Sciences |title=catastrophism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/geology-and-oceanography/geology-and-oceanography/catastrophism |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell contended that major geological forces in effect today, including [[volcanic eruptions]], [[earthquakes]], and erosion due to [[wind]], [[water]], and [[gravity]], have happened throughout earth's history and are responsible changing its surface features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Sciences |title=Lyell, Charles (1797-1875) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/charles-lyell |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[evolution]] is believed to have gained acceptance in part because of Lyell's efforts to promote gradual biological change rather than change due to sudden, extreme events. Building upon the work of James Hutton, Charles Lyell is also responsible for spreading the idea that older rocks are buried underneath newer ones, which led scientists to begin studying [[fossils]] and [[rock layers]] in order to better understand the history of the earth's [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=World of Earth Sciences |title=Lyell, Charles (1797-1875) |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/charles-lyell |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pytheas (Greek) ===
[[Pytheas]], a Greek geographer, astronomer, and explorer who lived around 300 bc near Massalia, [[Gaul]] (a region comprising mostly modern-day [[France]]) is known for producing the first known records of the history of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |title=Pytheas of Massalia |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/pytheas-massalia |website=https://www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pytheas's most important work, [[Pytheas|''On the Ocean'']], has since been lost, but most of what is known about him was recorded by the Greek historian, [[Polybius]] (approx. 200-118 BC). Through travel and detailed observation, Pytheas noticed that the length of the days increased as he traveled northward and that the [[moon]] affects the [[tides]] in the water. His travels took him to the northernmost parts of [[Europe]] including [[Thule]] (the northernmost inhabited island, roughly six days sail beyond [[Great_Britain|Britain]]) and at least to the [[Arctic Circle]] (possible [[Norway]] or [[Iceland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Pytheas |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pytheas |website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=13 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Douglas Mawson (Australian) ===
Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] (born in [[Yorkshire]], England in 1882; died in [[Brighton]], England in 1958) is known for his exploration of [[Antarctica]], although he also studied [[uranium]] and other radioactive materials as a preeminent professor of [[geology]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[Australia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Sir Douglas Mawson |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/sir-douglas-mawson |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=The Gale Group Inc. |accessdate=16 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Edgeworth David]] and Dr. A.F. Mackay, Mawson was the first man to reach the summit of [[Mount Erebus]], an ice-covered volcanic mountain approximately 11,400 feet high. His expeditions led Britain to surrender its claims over the Antarctic territory to [[Australia]] in 1936, and the methods he developed to survive in, and travel through, freezing climates paved the way for subsequent explorations of sub-zero regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Sir Douglas Mawson |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/geography-biographies/sir-douglas-mawson |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=The Gale Group Inc. |accessdate=16 November 2018 |format=Web article |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piri Reis (Turkish) ===
[[Piri_Reis|Piri Reis]] (born in 1465 in [[Gelibolu]], Turkey; died in 1553 in [[Egypt]]) is famous for having made one of the oldest known maps (and the oldest Turkish map) of the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Editors, TheFamousPeople.com |title=Piri Reis Biography |url=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/piri-reis-32218.php |website=TheFamousPeople.com |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piri began his career in the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman]]-Turkish navy, rising to fame as an [[admiral]] ("Reis" is Turkish for "admiral" and is not actually part of Piri's birth name) and participating in many battles against Spanish, Genoese, Venetian, and Portuguese naval forces. In fact, it was during his time as a captain that he had the opportunity to show his world map to Sultan [[Selim I]] and Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], which helped to establish his fame as a geographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaimeche |first1=Salah |title=Piri Reis: A Genius 16th-Century Ottoman Cartographer and Navigator |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/piri-reis-genius-16th-century-ottoman-cartographer-and-navigator |website=MuslimHeritage.com |publisher=FSTC Limited |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513, Piri created his first [[Piri_Reis_map|world map]]. Only a third of this map has survived, and it has been found to accurately depict parts of [[North Africa]], the European west coast, and the South American east coast. Between 1524-1525, Piri put together his most well-known geographical work, called ''[[Piri_Reis#Kitab-.C4.B1_Bahriye|KitÄb-Ä± Baá¸¥rÄ«ye]]'', which was 434 pages long and consisted of 290 maps. It was revised and gifted to Suleiman the Magnificent. In 1528, Piri drew a second world map, which was also gifted to Suleiman the Magnificent, and that shows [[Greenland]], parts of North America (from [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the north to [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Florida]] in the south), and parts of [[Central America]]. In 1553, Piri Reis was beheaded for refusing to support Kubad Pasha, an Ottoman Vali (Governor), in his campaign against the Portuguese in the northern Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Editors, TheFamousPeople.com |title=Piri Reis Biography |url=https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/piri-reis-32218.php |website=TheFamousPeople.com |accessdate=3 December 2018 |format=Web article |date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">'''Gibraltarian status''' is a [[legal status]] in [[Law of Gibraltar|Gibraltar law]] defined by the '''Gibraltarian Status Act, 1962'''. Persons with Gibraltarian status are registered on the '''Register of Gibraltarians'''.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
The term was coined in the 1920s at a time of increasing awareness of [[national identity]] and was popularised during [[Military history of Gibraltar during World War II|World War II]], when the civil population of Gibraltar was [[emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to the [[United Kingdom]] and other parts of the [[British Empire]]. In 1962, the term was made a legal status in Gibraltar through the ''Gibraltarian Status Ordinance (1962)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/1962-13o.pdf Gibraltarian Status Act (1962)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[local ordinance|Ordinance]] became the ''Gibraltarian Status Act, 1962'' following the implementation of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006]].

The ''Register of Gibraltarians'' pre-dates Gibraltarian status - the register was created in 1955 while Gibraltarian status originates with the ''Gibraltarian Status Act, 1962''. The 1962 [[act (document)|Act]] provides a legal framework for the register, and defines who is eligible to be listed on the register.

==Eligibility for Gibraltarian status==

*March 2009 FISC ruling showing a consistent pattern of misrepresentations of the bulk telephone metadata collection program by the government to the Court. It also held that the data was being routinely queried in ways that did not meet "reasonable articulatable suspicion", demonstrating inadequate safeguards in the software and training of analysts. Showing that "thousands of violations resulted from the use of identifiers that were not "RAS-approved by analysts who were not even aware that they were accessing BR metadata," and that in 2006 "there was no single person [in the NSA] who had a complete understanding of the BR FISA system architecture," a situation which persisted until February 2009 or later. RAS is shorthand for Reasonable Articulatable Suspicion. The Court nonetheless reapproved the collection of bulk phone metadata, while mandating additional safeguards and training, and "end-to-end system engineering reviews," and reports from the review.

In his opinion, he wrote, "a bulk telephony metadata collection program [is] a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data" and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 9/11 might have prevented the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazzle |first=Steph |title=Judge Says NSA's Data Collection Is Legal |url=http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |publisher=Indyposted |accessdate=28 December 2013 |date=27 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228162843/http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. And further he ruled that, when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is [[Smith v. Maryland]]: "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," Judge Pauley wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.'s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|author1=Adam Liptak |author2=Michael S.

*Numerous reports relating to drones, including "Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", a report summarizing attempts to shoot down, intercept, control or otherwise spoof drones. While the report details vulnerabilities of specific aircraft, the document itself has not been published, but only excerpts described. Other reports detail American spin efforts, suggesting that the phrases "drone strike," "kill list," "robot warfare," "Aerial Assassins" be avoided, offering "lethal UAV operations" instead, and also terms like "Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action" and "Inherent Right of Self Defense." Likewise, reports detail efforts by Al-Qaeda to spin, portraying attacks as cowardly and immoral. Analysts also questioned whether America was losing rhetorical battle in courts, media, and public opinion. Another report stated that drone strikes "could be brought under increased scrutiny, perceived to be illegitimate, openly resisted or undermined."&lt;ref name="wapo20130903"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story_3.html|title=U.S. documents detail al-Qaeda's efforts to fight back against drones|authors= Craig Whitlock and Barton Gellman|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2013|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggested protective measures from surveillance ==

=== Encryption ===
In [[cryptography]], [[encryption]] is the process of encoding information in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can. According to Snowden's recommendations published by ''The Guardian Edward'' in September 2013,&lt;ref name="Encryp" /&gt; properly implemented strong [[Cryptosystem|crypto systems]] were among the few things which one can rely on. However, [[Communication endpoint|endpoint]] security is often too weak to prevent the [[NSA]] from finding ways around it.&lt;ref name="Encryp"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA surveillance: A guide to staying secure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground bunkers ===
In September 2013, it was reported by the press that a number of countries deemed by the US and its allies to be [[rogue state]]s, such as [[Syria]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], had successfully evaded U.S. government surveillance by constructing secret bunkers deep below the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Narayan Lakshman|title=Secret bunkers, a challenge for U.S. intelligence|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/secret-bunkers-a-challenge-for-us-intelligence/article5164833.ece?ref=relatedNews|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013|location=Chennai, India|date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]]'s underground megaproject, the [[816 Nuclear Military Plant]] in [[Chongqing]] (now declassified and opened to tourists), was reported to be "most worrying" for the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

[[Libya]] evaded surveillance by building "hardened and buried" bunkers at least 40 feet below ground level.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

==Life==

Hemalatha was born on 26 February 1932 at [[Vinukonda]] in [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]], now in the [[Guntur District]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]].

===Reformation of denotified tribes===

Through Samskar, Lavanam and Hemlatha took part in historical surrenders of [[dacoit]]s in [[Chambal Valley]] to [[Vinobha Bhave]].

They devoted their time to bring change in the mindset of criminal tribal shelter helped to provide alternative livelihood to criminal rehabilitated families. Hemalatha and Lavanam demended government of Andhra Pradesh to abolish settlements. Due to their efforts, the state government took a step in abolishing the managements and declaring them as free colonies in 1976. They visited the prisoners of Stuartpuram and kept constant contact through letters. The families of settlers visited Atheist center for advice. This contact changed some hardened criminals. They motivated the criminals to change from crime culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-Criminal tribes of india|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10603/25615/8/08-chapter%201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Thompson (MRCVS)''' (Member of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]], 1836â1920) was a founder member of the Aspatria Agricultural Society, the [[Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society]] and the [[Aspatria Agricultural College]].

==Early life and education==
Henry Thompson was born at [[Allonby]], [[Cumberland]], on 9 September 1836, the youngest of seven children, his father a poor country tailor, earned 9s (45p) per week. At the age of thirteen Thompson became apprentice to Joseph Slee, a [[Maryport]] druggist, working from four in the morning to nine in the evening. He later moved to [[Whitehaven]] to learn [[veterinary]] practice under John Fisher, the most qualified veterinary surgeon in Cumberland. After a further two years learning the basic practical skills associated with the equerry business at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], he enrolled at the Edinburgh Veterinary College, where he studied under Professor William Dick (1793â1866), the founder of the [[Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies]]. After five years of intensive study he graduated with several coveted qualifications; the Diploma of the Highland and Agricultural Society, the examination of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]], and the Royal Diploma. He became one of only two veterinary surgeons in Cumberland, to hold both Diploma's by examination. He obtained many academic distinctions including two silver medals for [[Anatomy]] and [[Physiology]], and both first and second class certificates for [[Chemistry]], [[Histology]] and [[Pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural progress==
On 4 June 1860, he arrived at [[Aspatria]] with âhalf-a-crownâ (12.5p) in his pocket to take up the position of junior partner in the towns veterinary practice. He befriended [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet of Brayton]] and together they became two of the prominent members of the [[Wigton]], and later Aspatria Farmers Club. In 1869, along with William Norman and John Twentyman, the âdauntless threeâ as they became known, he organised the annual Aspatria Agricultural Show. In the following year the trio founded the [[Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society]] and in 1874 they established the Aspatria Agricultural and Commercial School, later renamed the Aspatria Agricultural College. In 1893, after the sale of the Agricultural School the outgoing directors and [[shareholders]] acknowledged his many hours of unpaid tuition with the presentation of a piano, and a gold watch.&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 12 August 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional triumphs==
He had many professional triumphs. He was one of the first to experiment with salt as a dressing on the land as a means of destroying insect pests. During his experiments he also discovered that salt acted as a deterrent to other parasitic and microbial diseases, such as âred waterâ in cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1840), p.265&lt;/ref&gt; He also anticipated the cure of [[milk fever]] in cattle,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1840), pp.314-5&lt;/ref&gt; a discovery later attributed to the [[Danish people|Danish]] biologist Karl Schmidt. In 1895 he enjoyed a degree of success in the treatment of [[foot and mouth]], having seen many cases of the disease, and noted the heavy loss of cattle particularly when calving.
As a writer he was an authority on veterinary and agricultural matters. For over forty years he edited the periodical, âNorth British Agriculturistâ. His book entitled, Elementary Veterinary Science for Agricultural Students, Farmers, and Stock-Keepers, remains an authoritative text book 120 years after its first publication (1895) and is available in paperback form today. It went into seven editions, and was translated and referred to by all sides in the Great War. âGreensâ encyclopaedia (the leading authority of the day), contained thirty-six articles appearing under his name.&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic responsibilities==
There were many examples of his civic work. He was a member of the Aspatria Urban District Council, the Wigton Board of Guardians; a Director of the West Cumberland Dairy Company, and the Aspatria Gas Works. He was president of the [[Aspatria RUFC]], a trustee of the Aspatria National Schools; a founder member of the Aspatria Volunteer Fire Brigade. He was also a collector of public subscriptions initiated to erect the districts first footpaths. He was secretary of the Aspatria Agricultural College, the Cumberland Steam Ploughing Society and the Aspatria Model Building Society. He was also a member of the Council of Veterinary Associations, and the secretary to the Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society, for over fifty years. He was also an authority on the [[Cumbrian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;West Cumberland Times 21 July 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public recognition==
Harry Thompson preached the gospel of cooperation at every available opportunity and never tired of demonstrating its value to farmers. He succeeded in combating their apathy and their individuality, and worked for the society with a singleness and purpose that no monetary value ever did or could compensate. After the death of the âGrand Old Man of Cumberland Farmingâ the following tribute appeared in the pages of the âWheatsheafâ magazine. 

::"There is no name more honourable in the records of agricultural co-operation than that of Henry Thompson of Aspatria Cumberland. Although a visionary surgeon and a leading authority on the pathology of animals for sixty years he found time not only to act as secretary of the Aspatria Agricultural Society, but also to champion the cause with his pen."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22349">[[Singaporean Hokkien]] is the largest non-Mandarin Chinese dialect spoken in Singapore. As such, it exerts the greatest '''influence on Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin''', resulting in a Hokkien-style Singaporean Mandarin widely spoken in Singapore. The colloquial Hokkien-style Singaporean Mandarin can differ from [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] in terms of vocabulary, phonology and grammar.

==Influences on phonology==

Some Hokkien Singaporeans are unable to accurately pronounce the sounds of [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] due to influences from their [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]] mother tongue. These include [[consonant]]s such as ''f, z, zh, s, r''. They also pronounce some [[vowel]]s and rhymes such as ''i, e, en, eng'' differently. In terms of tone, they often bring the [[checked tone]] (å¥å£°) of Hokkien into Mandarin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Hokkien-derived vocabulary==

The use of Hokkien vocabulary in Singaporean Mandarin can be categorized as such:
#Use of Hokkien words in lieu of standard Mandarin words
#Use of Hokkien monosyllabic words in lieu of standard disyllabic Mandarin words
#Replacing of Mandarin morphemes with Hokkien morphemes
#Use of Hokkien word order (in vocabulary) in lieu of standard Mandarin word order
#Modifying the meaning of Mandarin word using Hokkien words

===Hokkien borrowings===

Some Hokkien words with the same meaning are used to replace standard Mandarin words.

===Monosyllabic borrowings===

Some Hokkien mono-syllabic words are used instead of two-syllable words in Mandarin.

==Omission of Mandarin word's suffix==

The [[suffix]] of certain Mandarin words might be omitted in [[colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] due to the use of Hokkien mono-syllabic words. For instance, the suffix "{{lang|zh|å­}} zi" is commonly omitted in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin.

===Same meaning, different word order===

Some multi-syllable words in Standard Mandarin might be used with a different word order (reversed or changed) in Hokkien, and the latter's word order is adopted into Singaporean Mandarin.

===Modifying the meaning of Mandarin using Hokkien words===

Certain words in Standard Mandarin have a different meaning in Hokkien, and this difference is adopted by Singaporean Mandarin.

Some examples of these are listed below.

{|class=wikitable

|-
|{{lang|zh|è¥}} fÃ©i
|{{lang|zh|è}} pÃ ng
|Fat
|{{lang|zh|ä½ æè¿'''è¥'''å¥½å¤äº}} (You've been fatter recently)
|The Mandarin word "è¥" is not originally used for a person. Instead, Standard Mandarin uses the word "è" esp. when referring to a fat person.
|-
|{{lang|zh|ç½}} shuÇng
|{{lang|zh|çå¿«}} tÃ²ng kuai
|Happy/Joyful
|{{lang|zh|ç©å¾å¾'''ç½'''}} (''play joyfully'')
|The Mandarin word "ç½" originally means "cool". Here it has been modified to mean "happy".
|-
|{{lang|zh|ä¼}} huÃ¬
|{{lang|zh|è½}} nÃ©ng
|Able to
||{{lang|zh|è½¦'''ä¼'''è¿å?}} (''Is the car able to cross?'')
|The word "ä¼" in Standard Mandarin does not mean an action that can probably be realized. "è½", which indicates a possibility, is usually used instead.
|-
|{{lang|zh|æ¬äº}} bÄn shÃ¬
|{{lang|zh|ææ¬äº}} yÇu bÄn shÃ¬
|Capable
||{{lang|zh|ä»å¾'''æ¬äº'''}} (''He is capable'')
|The word "æ¬äº" in Standard Mandarin is a 'noun'.
|}

==Influences on grammar==

Singaporean Hokkien has influenced Singaporean Mandarin Grammar in 5 main areas.

===Word order===

The word order refers to the order or sequence of how words are arranged in combination. Because of influence from Singaporean Hokkien, the word order in certain phrases are replaced by that of Singaporean Hokkien, or are simultaneously used with that of Singaporean Mandarin.

===="Verb/object + complement" structure====

In Standard Mandarin, certain [[Object (grammar)|object]] in [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] structure are put after a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]. However, the "[[verb]]/[[Object (grammar)|object]] + [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]" structure is used in Singaporean Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable

|Can you write after you've finished your meal?
|The [[Object (grammar)|object]] "é¥­" is put before the [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] "äº", instead of after.
|}

====Changes in overlapping word order====

Overlapping word order in Singaporean Mandarin sometimes differ from that of Standard Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable

|{{lang|zh|ä¸'''æ'''å«'''æ'''}} qÄ« gÇo bÄ gÇo
|Anyhow mess around
|}

===Overlapping of words===

Certain mono-syllabic [[adjectives]] and [[verbs]] or two-syllable [[adjectives]] and [[verbs]] in Singaporean Hokkien have entered into Singaporean Mandarin. These are used together with their counterparts in Standard Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

===Omission===

Certain components of a sentence that are used in Standard Mandarin are omitted in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, due to Hokkien influence on the latter.

====Omission of directional verbs====

Certain directional verbs are omitted or dropped in Singaporean Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

|The number "å" (thousand) has been omitted
|}

===Word groupings and arrangements===

Certain word groupings and arrangements in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin sentences are greatly influenced by Hokkien.

====Use of the words "æ" and "æ "====

In Mandarin, the words "æ" and "æ " generally do not act as [[Complement (linguistics)|complementary]] [[verbs]]. But due to influence from Hokkien, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin uses them as [[Complement (linguistics)|complementary]] [[verbs]].

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable
!Singaporean Mandarin (Hokkien influenced)
!Standard Mandarin
!Translation
|-
|{{lang|zh|ä½ å¬'''æ'''åï¼æå¬'''æ'''ã}} nÇ tÄ«ng yÇu ma? wÇ tÄ«ng yÇu.

|I found this book
|}

====Use of the word "å°" in lieu of "å¾"====

In a "[[verb]]+[[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]" sentence structure, standard Mandarin uses the word å¾ to link the verb and complement. Singapore Mandarin, due to influence from Hokkien, uses the word å° instead.

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable
!Singaporean Mandarin (Hokkien influenced)
!Standard Mandarin
!Translation
|-
|{{lang|zh|ææ°'''å°'''åæ­»ã}} wÇ qÃ¬ dÃ o bÃ n sÇ
|{{lang|zh|ææ°'''å¾'''åæ­»ã}} wÇ qÃ¬ dÃ© bÃ n sÇ

|{{lang|zh|å®³'''å°'''æç½å¿ä¸åºã}} hÃ i dÃ o wÇ bÃ¡i mÃ¡ng yÄ« chÃ¡ng

|It wastes all my effort.

|{{lang|zh|æè¢«ä»å¼'''å°'''å¾ä¸å¥½ææã}} wÇ bÃ¨i tÄ nÃ²ng dÃ o hÄn bÃ¹ hÇo yÃ¬ si

|He makes me feel embarrassed.
|}

====Use of the word "å»"====

Certain Singapore Mandarin sentence structures use the word å» as the resultative complement, where another character (such as æ) might be used in Standard Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable
!Singaporean Mandarin (Hokkien influenced)
!Standard Mandarin

|-
|{{lang|zh|æ¯å­ç ´'''å»'''äºã}} bÄi zi pÃ² qÃ¹ le

|{{lang|zh|é±ç¨'''å»'''äºã}} qiÃ¡n yÃ²ng qÃ¹ le

|{{lang|zh|æ¤å­å·²ç»åæã}} yÇ zi yÇ jÄ«ng huÃ i diÃ o
|The chair has been broken
|}

====Use of Hokkien classifiers====

A [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] (measure words) which is used with a certain noun in Hokkien might also be used similarly in Singapore Mandarin with the same noun, whereas another classifier might be used for that same word in Standard Mandarin.

Examples are shown in the table below:

{|class=wikitable

|{{lang|zh|ä¸'''ç²'''çã}} yÄ« lÃ¬ qiÃº

|The word "æ¯" (zhÄ«) is a Hokkien measure word
|}

Some cases are listed in the following sub-sections.

====Use of the word "æ"====

The word "æ" (you) is usually added in front of a [[verb]] or [[verb]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to indicate an existing action or completed status.

====Use of the word "ä¼"====

[[Image:Hustler-hell.jpg|thumb|right|Larry Flynt Hustler Club on West 52nd Street in New York]]
'''''Hustler''''' is a monthly [[pornographic magazine]] published in the [[United States]]. It was first published in 1974 by [[Larry Flynt]]. It was a step forward from the ''Hustler Newsletter'', which was cheap [[advertising]] for his [[strip club]] businesses at the time. The magazine grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so, in contrast with relatively modest publications like ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis (2001) pp.134-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, ''Hustler'' is still considered more explicit (and more self-consciously lowbrow) than such well-known competitors as ''Playboy'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. It frequently depicts [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] themes, such as the use of [[sex toy]]s, [[sexual intercourse|penetration]] and [[group sex]].

[[Larry Flynt Publications]] also licenses Hustler brand to the [[Hustler Casino]] in [[Gardena, California]] which is owned directly by Larry Flynt as an individual through his holding company El Dorado Enterprises, the [[Hustler Club]] chain of bars and clubs, and Hustler store chain that sells adult-oriented videos, clothing, magazines and sex toys. The chain's flagship store is on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].

==Founding==
The business first began in Cincinnati. Here, Larry Flynt and his brother, Jimmy Flynt, opened up a store in 1969. Jimmy wrote the check for $5,000 to pay for the club in Cincinnati, and he was listed as the masthead for volume 1, number 1 of the magazine in July, 1974. However, Larry fired his brother in 2009, and since then he has been trying to make a business grow all on his own, called Jimmy Flynt's Sexy Gifts Stand. An old member of Hustler magazine has described the relationship, saying, "Larry is the show, and Jimmy makes it go".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghose|first1=David|last2=Zucca|first2=Mario|title=Flynt Family Values|journal=Cincinnati Magazine|date=February 2013|volume=46|issue=5|page=66|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=e29c279d-b943-4aa6-a396-5826cd2445b2%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=4203&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=85288418&amp;db=f5h|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publisher==
[[File:Hustler Hollywood retail store.jpg|thumb|Hustler retail store in [[West Hollywood, California]]]]
''Hustler'' is officially published by LFP, Inc, which also produces pornographic films. The abbreviation "L.F.P." originally stood for "Larry Flynt Publications."

A Canadian version of ''Hustler'' is published by a Quebec-based firm. This magazine is not owned by Larry Flynt, but is licensed to publish material from the American version. In general, Canadian ''Hustler'' imitates the appearance and tone of its American counterpart, with Canadian content added. In 1999, the magazine created a minor controversy in Canada by inviting readers to submit sexually explicit stories about [[Sheila Copps]], a left-leaning member of the Liberal cabinet. There have also been Australian, British and South African versions of the magazine.

During a bookstore signing in July 2011, Flynt stated that less than five percent of his income comes from the print magazine; he also speculated that the print magazine will not be around in 2 to 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2011/07/last_night_larry_flynt_talks_s.php |title=Last Night: Larry Flynt Talks Sex, Lies And Rick Perry At Brazos Books|first= Craig|last= Hlavaty|work=blogs.houstonpress.com |date=2011-07-28 |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular features==
One feature of ''Hustler'' is a column called "Asshole of the Month". In every monthly issue of the magazine, a public figure is selected for severe criticism as that month's "asshole". An illustration depicting the criticized person's head emerging from the anus of a cartoon donkey is shown alongside the article. After Flynt's imprisonment in 1977 and his alleged conversion to evangelical Christianity, he promised to reform "Asshole of the Month". However, as of 2016, reform in the feature has yet to be seen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement, 1976â1986|last=Bronstein|first=Carolyn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, ''Hustler'' ran a comic strip feature entitled "Honey Hooker". In each installment, Honey would have graphic sexual encounters with any male (or female) she ran across. She might be in American colonial times one month or in a Super Bowl locker room the next. This feature was designed to compete against ''[[Playboy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Little Annie Fanny]] and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Wicked Wanda]]. In keeping with ''Hustler'''s focus on the seamier and less romantic aspects of sexuality, Honey Hooker, unlike Fanny and Wanda, was explicitly portrayed as being a prostitute.

The ''Beaver Hunt'' section of the magazine contains explicit nudes of amateur models submitted by readers.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis (2001) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ''Hustler'' feature that was heavily criticized was the "[[Chester the Molester]]" cartoon. Each month's issue depicted Chester, a cartoon middle-aged pedophile, joyfully raping girls. Following Flynt's alleged religious conversion, he introduced "Chester the Protector", a reincarnation of the molester character who served as a hero to protect young girls from rape and seduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A regular feature entitled "Ads We'd Like to See" recreates advertisements of everyday products in a sexualized or violent way. For example, an advertisement in the 1980 issue called 'Doer's Lite Label', a parody of Dewar's Lite Label Whiskey, featured [[Kenneth Bianchi]], the Hillside Strangler. Listed as his greatest accomplishment was [[Cindy Lee Hudspeth]], whom he actually strangled in 1978. He is quoted as saying "You gotta treat 'em roughâ¦". This section was highly criticized for admiring men who had committed sexualized crimes against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sex Crime|last=Caputi|first=Jane|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its regular features, ''Hustler'' occasionally published special features and issues. Examples include the "All Meat" issue from 1978, where the cover spread depicted a naked woman being fed into a meat grinder upside down. In 1977, the magazine's front page read "First-Time Ever Scratch 'N' Sniff Centerfold".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Controversy and criticism ==
In 1984, conservative academic [[Judith Reisman]] received a grant from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to complete a study at [[American University]] concerning the cartoons of ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', and ''Hustler'', specifically the sexual depictions of minors in these cartoons. She finished the study in 1986, and found that on average, the number of times per issue that ''Hustler'' referred to children, crime, and violence was 46.&lt;ref&gt;Reisman, Judith A. "Child Pornographer, Larry Flynt et. al: A Clear and Present Danger to Children." Former Principal Investigator of ''Images of Children, Crime &amp; Violence in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler'', 1989, US Dpt of Justice, Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Grant No. 84-JN-AX-K007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisman published a nearly 1,600-page report of her findings, condemning the sexual depictions of children in pornographic magazines, but her work was met with criticism from her peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Nude Women, Mud Pies, And The Deficit.|last=Kilpatrick|first=James|date=September 26, 1986|work=Toledo Blade|access-date=|via=Google News Archive|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VRNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2wIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3253,4342177}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American University professor, Dr. Myra Sadker, said that she was "very dismayed about the quality of office management and the nature of the research that was going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New study will determine how adult magazines affect children|last=Margasak|first=Larry|date=May 3, 1985|work=Gettysburg Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fellow academics have disputed the neutrality of the research. [[Avedon Carol]], a sex crime researcher and author, said that Reisman's study was a "scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias."&lt;ref&gt;Carol, Avedon. ''Nudes, Prudes and Attitudes: Pornography and Censorship'', New Clarion Press, Gloucester. 1994. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hustler''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s chief cartoon artist Dwaine Tinsley was arrested on May 18, 1989, after being accused by his 18-year-old daughter Allison of molesting her since she was thirteen years old. According to court records, he allegedly told his coworkers, "You can't write about this stuff all the time if you don't experience it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Artist's Cartoons Depicted His Molestations of Teen-Ager, Court Papers Allege|last=Associated Press|first=|date=June 2, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-02/local/me-970_1_dwaine-tinsley-molester-hustler-magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tinsley was found guilty of five counts of child molestation and sentenced to six years in prison&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jury Convicts Hustler Cartoonist of Molesting Girl|last=Berger|first=Leslie|date=January 11, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-11/news/ve-324_1_jury-convicts-hustler}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he only spent 23 months behind bars. Tinsley was the artist behind the regular "Chester the Molester" series, which ran from 1976 to 1989.

In a 2012 issue of ''Hustler'', [[S. E. Cupp]], a conservative commentator, was photoshopped and depicted as explicitly performing oral sex. The article describes Cupp as a "lovely young lady who read too much Ayn Rand in high school and ended up joining the dark side...But her hotness is diminished when she espouses dumb ideas like defunding Planned Parenthood."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2149975/Doctored-photo-months-Hustler-magazine-conservative-commentator-S-E-Cupp-performing-oral-sex-sparks-outrage-conservatives-AND-liberals.html|title=Doctored photo in Hustler magazine of conservative commentator S.E.

Falwell."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cupp will not be pursuing either Flynt or the magazine because of "free speech".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hustler's American flag hijab cover was criticized as an attack on American patriotism and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Neill |first1=Natalie |title=Hustler under fire for racy cover with American flag hijab |url=https://nypost.com/2017/06/09/hustler-under-fire-for-racy-cover-with-american-flag-hijab/ |accessdate=17 June 2018 |publisher=New York Post |date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits and litigation ==
The magazine has had many lawsuits since the 1980s, including claims of defamation and enforcement of sexual violence and behavior. However, there have not been any lawsuits against the magazine or incorporation as of 2016.

In ''Douglass v. Hustler Magazine Inc.'', actress [[Robyn Douglass]] sued ''Hustler'' for defamation and unlawfully placing her under a false light.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teplinsky|first=Howard L.|year=1986|title=Douglass v.

However, Gregory was hired to ''Hustler'' and Douglass' photos were published in the 1981 January issue without Douglass' consent. She brought the case to the United States District Court from the North District of Illinois on the basis that the magazine had defamed her name and likeness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The court cases ended in favoring Douglass since the magazine had violated her right of publicity, awarding her $600,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1984 ''Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.'' court case, Kathy Keeton, vice chairman of ''Penthouse'', sued ''Hustler'' for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=David I.|year=1984|title=Preliminary Procedural Protection for the Press from Jurisdiction in Distant Forums After Calder and Keeton|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1396&amp;context=faculty_scholarship|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|volume=|pages=468â470|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeton brought the case to New Hampshire due its generous six-year statute of limitations for libel and the state believed it was able to support taking jurisdiction due to the magazine's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kane|first=Peter E.|date=1992-01-01|title=Shaping Our Judicial System for the Rest of the Century and Beyond: The Souter Confirmation Process|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08997225.1992.10556146|journal=Free Speech Yearbook|volume=30|issue=1|pages=149â154|doi=10.1080/08997225.1992.10556146|issn=0899-7225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borchers|first=Patrick J.|year=2004|title=Internet Libel: The Consequences of a Non-Rule Approach to Personal Jurisdiction|url=https://dspace.creighton.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10504/67189/Borchers_98NwULRev473.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|volume=98|pages=476â478|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine sold up to 15,000 issues since 1975, containing a cartoon where Keeton had received a venereal disease from Robert Guccione, a publisher of Penthouse.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-08/news/mn-1860_1_larry-flynt|title=Hustler Ordered to Pay $2 Million for Libeling Penthouse Executive|last=|first=|date=8 August 1986|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeton was awarded $2 million for the defamation damages.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell|Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell]]''''', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 485|485]] [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 46 (1988), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] prohibit [[Public figure|public figures]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;from recovering damages for the [[tort]] of [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] (IIED), if the emotional distress was caused by a caricature, parody, or satire of the public figure that a [[reasonable person]] would not have interpreted as factual.

In ''Herceg v. Hustler'' (1989), a family attempted to sue ''Hustler'' for the suicide of their fourteen-year-old boy on the basis that its illustrations stimulated violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=John L.|year=1988|title=Rediscovering Traditional Tort Typologies to Determine Media Liability for Physical Injuries: From the Mickey Mouse Club to Hustler Magazine|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol59/iss3/6/|journal=Indiana Law Journal|volume=59|pages=990|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the magazine's contents was the article "Orgasm of Death", demonstrating practices of erotic asphyxia via photographs in order to heighten sexual pleasure in men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Lisa A.|year=1984|title=Products Liability and the First Amendment: The Liability of Publishers for Failure to Warn|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol59/iss3/6|journal=Indiana Law Journal|volume=59|pages=503â526|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Hustler'' placed disclaimers on the photographs of "Do Not Attempt" to prevent the audience from mimicking the photos. The court case ended in favoring the magazine; the court agreed that the depictions were not forcing readers to perform these erotic or dangerous activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Editorial policy==
''Hustler'' has had what would be considered a [[left-wing]] (liberal) editorial policy on [[economics]], [[foreign policy]], and social issues. Flynt and ''Hustler'' are also noted for having a more [[populism|populist]] and working-class outlook than the more upscale-oriented ''Playboy'' and ''Penthouse''. Throughout the 1980s, Flynt used his magazine as a podium with which to launch attacks on the [[Reagan Administration]] and the [[Christian right|Religious Right]], and even published a short-lived political magazine called ''Rebel''. During the controversy surrounding [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Flynt publicly announced his sympathy for Clinton, and offered cash rewards to anyone with information regarding sexual impropriety on the part of the president's critics. In 2003, Flynt [[California gubernatorial recall election|ran unsuccessfully]] for the office of Governor of [[California]] during that state's [[California gubernatorial recall election|recall election]].

Every month ''Hustler'' is mailed, uninvited and for free, to all of the offices of Members of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="Hustler on the Hill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hustler on the Hill|url=http://reason.com/archives/2006/06/05/hustler-on-the-hill|publisher=reason.com|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Postal Service v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.|This practice]] began at some point between 1974 and 1983, and it continues as of April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/why-every-member-of-congress-gets-a-monthly-porn-delivery-20140417|title=Why Every Member of Congress Gets a Monthly Porn Delivery|work=www.nationaljournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Flynt explained, "I felt that they should be informed with what's going on in the rest of the world ... Some of them didn't appreciate it much. I haven't had any plans to quit."{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In a 1983 parody of an advertisement for [[Campari]], ''Hustler'' described the then-prominent [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] minister [[Jerry Falwell]] having a drunken, [[incest]]uous encounter with his mother in an outhouse. Falwell sued Flynt, alleging [[libel]] and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]. The case was ultimately decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in Flynt's favor. The decision strengthened [[free speech]] rights in relation to parodies of public figures. ''See'' ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]''.

==Erotic Movie Awards==
During the [[Golden Age of Porn]], and prior to getting into the movie business themselves, ''Hustler'' was one of two magazines that announced awards for adult sex films, the other being ''[[Adam Film World]]''. They were discontinued in the late 1980s.

The awards were based on fan ballots printed in the publication. In announcing its third annual awards, the magazine said, "''Hustler'''s erotic-movie awards are intended to reward excellence in the erotic-film industry and thereby encourage the fast-buck makers of mediocrity to clean up their act or go out of business."&lt;ref name="HustlerMag0479"&gt;"''Hustler'' Third Annual Erotic Movie Awards", ''Hustler'' Magazine, April 1979, Vol. 5 No. 10, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jayapa Nayudu''' or '''Jayapa Senani''' was a military commander under Ganapatideva, the [[Kakatiya]] king had give some districts to jayapa nayudu to rule present [Andhra and telagana] during the medieval period from his seat in [[Warangal]], He was major Key-roller in Kakatiya Empire.  

The defeat of [[Velanati Chodas]] at the hands of [[Kakatiya]] emperor [[Ganapatideva]] (1241 CE) led to many Nayaka warriors migrating to [[Warangal]] and joining the Kakatiya army. '''Jayapa Nayudu''', a valiant commander from [[Kammanadu]], was made the chief of the elephant wing in the army.&lt;ref&gt;''Bouddhamu-Andhramu'', Hanumantha Rao, B. S. L., 1995, Telugu University, Hyderabad&lt;/ref&gt;  He was uncle of Ranirudrama Devi, Emperor Ganapatideva married Naramma and Peramma, sisters of Jayapa nayudu(Ganapatidevas Brother-in-law).

==Lineage==
Jayapa was the son of Pinna Choda whose father Narappa was the governor of the estuary region of river [[Krishna]], also known as [[Diviseema]]. Narappa had four sons Choda, Pina Choda, Bhima and Brahma. All the brothers served as commanders in the army of Velanati Choda kings.

==Contributions==
Jayapa participated in the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] conquest of Ganapatideva and was honoured with the title âVairigodhuma Gharattaâ. He built a temple (Ganapeswara) in the honour of Ganapatideva and made a grant of many villages to the temple (1231 CE). He built another temple (Chodeswara) in the name of his father Pinna Choda in Chebrolu (Guntur district) and made a grant of Modukuru village to meet the temple expenses. According to the [[Chebrolu, Guntur district|Chebrolu]] inscription (1235 CE, April 21) he also built two-storied quarters in two rows for Devadasis (Temple dancers) in front of the temple. Jayapa must have been an accomplished master of dance because his Sanskrit treatise âNritya Ratnavaliâ is an authoritative text on Indian dance.

Jayapa is the first person who wrote about the dances prevalent in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Both Desi and Margi forms of dances have been included in ''Nritya Ratnavali''. It contains eight chapters. Folk dance forms like Perani, Prenkhana, Suddha Nartana, Carcari, Rasaka, Danda Rasaka, Shiva Priya, Kanduka Nartana, Bhandika Nrityam, Carana Nrityam, Chindu, Gondali and Kolatam are described. In the first chapter the author deals with discussion of the differences between Marga and desi, tandava and lasya, Natya and nritta. In the 2nd and 3rd chapters he deals with angikabhinaya, caris, Sthanakas and mandalas. In the 4th Chapter Karnas, angaharas and recakas are described. In following chapters he described the local dance forms i.e. desi nritya. In the last chapter he deals with art and practice of dance.

'''John Huang''' ({{zh|c=é»å»ºå}}, born 1945) is a major figure in the [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy]]. He worked for [[Lippo Bank]] in [[California]] and [[Worthen Bank]] in [[Arkansas]], and as deputy assistant secretary for international economic affairs in U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[United States Commerce Department|Commerce Department]] before he became a chief fundraiser for the [[Democratic National Committee]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=riady&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/players/huang.htm "Campaign Finance Key Player: John Huang"], ''Washington Post'', July 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On August 12, 1999, Huang pleaded guilty to a felony [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge for violating campaign finance laws and was sentenced to one year of [[probation]]. He was also ordered by [[U.S. District Court]] to pay a $10,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service.

The '''KPC Ngong Forest Land Scandal''' was a scandal that resulted in the suspension in October 2012 of [[Kenya]]n Government Minister [[William Ruto]] who was charged in court as a result.

Mr Ruto and four other persons faced fraud charges over the alleged sale of a piece of land in Ngong forest to [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] (KPC) for Sh272 million. The minister allegedly received Sh96 million at various intervals during the alleged transaction. In the case, Mr. Ruto and Berke Commercial Agencies, a company associated with him, Mr [[Joshua Kulei]], a former aide of retired president [[Daniel Moi]], Mr [[Sammy Mwaita]] (the Member of Parliament for [[Baringo Central Constituency]]) and two other firms were sued for allegedly obtaining money from KPC between 6 August and 6 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Ruto-suspended-over-Kenya-Pipeline-land-sale/-/539546/1036132/-/126d70kz/-/index.html Ruto suspended over Kenya Pipeline land sale â Politics and policy]. ''Business Daily Africa''. (6 September 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Mr. Ruto was acquitted of the Sh43 million land fraud charges for lack of evidence after the prosecution failed to produce in court the then Finance Manager Hellen Njue to give her evidence on how she paid out the money. His co-accused, Mr Joshua Kulei and Mr Sammy Mwaita, were also set free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Ruto-acquitted-in-Sh43m-fraud-case-/-/1064/1143122/-/xye5dnz/-/index.html "Ruto acquitted in Sh43m fraud case"].

The '''Kho''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oÊ}},&lt;ref name="O'LearyRensch1992"/&gt; {{lang-khw|Ú©Ú¾Ù}}) are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] ethnolinguistic group associated with the [[Dardistan region]].&lt;ref name="Olson1998"/&gt; They speak Khowar, which is a member of the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] subgroup of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language family.&lt;ref name="Olson1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of China|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9780313288531|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Kho people live in the [[Chitral District]] of [[Pakistan]], while others live in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]],&lt;ref name="SimonsFenning2017"/&gt; as well as in the [[Badakhshan region]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="PG2016"/&gt;

==History==
The Kho people are likely descendents of those who arrived in the region during the [[Indo-Aryan migration]].&lt;ref name="O'LearyRensch1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Leary|first1=Clare F.|last2=Rensch|first2=Calvin Ross|last3=Decker|first3=Sandra J.|title=Sociolinguistic Survey of Northern Pakistan: Languages of Chitral|accessdate=4 August 2017|year=1992|publisher=National Institute of Pakistan Studies at Quaid-i-Azam University|language=English|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kho people formerly observed a form of [[ancient Hinduism]] and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="CacopardoCacopardo2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cacopardo|first1=Alberto M.|last2=Cacopardo|first2=Augusto S.|title=Gates of Peristan: history, religion and society in the Hindu Kush|accessdate=4 August 2017|year=2001|publisher=[[Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente]]|language=English|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mongol invasions of India|Mongol invasion of India]] in the 1200s, many of the northern Kho converted to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Minahan2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minahan|first=James B.|title=Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World, 2nd Edition: Ethnic and National Groups around the World|date=1 August 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781610699549|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Historically the Kho people reside in the [[Dardistan region]]. As such, they are a [[Dardic people|Dardic]] ethnic group located primarily in [[South Asia]]. Many of the Kho people live in the [[Chitral District]] of the Pakistani province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and a smaller number also live in Ghizer District of Gilgit Baltistan (including the Yasin Valley, Phandar Ishkoman and Gupis). In addition, a sizeable community of Kho people are found in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="SimonsFenning2017"/&gt; They are also found in few numbers in northern Afghanistan, where the majority of them live in the northern provinces of [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]].&lt;ref name="PG2016"/&gt; 

==Culture==
Kho culture places heavy emphasis on poetry, song and dance. Kho people also have a great respect of law and order. Much of this can be attributed to Chitral being a stable kingdom for most of its history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Pakistan/chitral.htm |title=chitral |publisher=Royalark.net |date=1937-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the rule of law and the will of the ruler came before tribal concepts such as revenge and isolationism.

Because of Chitral's location at the crossroads of [[Central Asia]] and South Asia, the Kho display a wide variety of cultures, largely depending upon their ancestral ethnic group and family history.

==Languages==
The Kho people speak the [[Khowar language]], a member of the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] subgroup of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language family]]. The ethnologists [[:de:Karl Jettmar|Karl Jettmar]] and Lennart Edelberg noted, with respect to the Khowar language, that: "Khowar, in many respects [is] the most archaic of all modern Indian languages, retaining a great part of [[Sanskrit]] case inflexion, and retaining many words in a nearly Sanskritic form.â&lt;ref name="JettmarEdelberg1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jettmar|first1=Karl|last2=Edelberg|first2=Lennart|title=Cultures of the Hindukush|year=1974|publisher=F. Steiner Verlag|language=English|isbn=9783515012171|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khowar is spoken by about 247,000 Kho people in northern Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/01/25/khowar-language/&lt;/ref&gt; and 19,200 Kho people in [[northern India]].&lt;ref name="SimonsFenning2017"/&gt; Some of the Kho people use [[Urdu]] as a second language.&lt;ref name="SimonsFenning2017"/&gt;

==Folk music==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Folk singers and reed instrument players have a special respect in the Kho society and are featured in their festivities. The most common instruments are Surnai [[Shehnai]], Sitar, and reed instruments. The Kho sitar is a popular musical instrument in Chitral. It is made out of mulberry wood with five steel strings arranged in three courses, the outer ones have double strings, tuned in unison, while the inner course is single. Popular music of the area includes:
* ''Shishtoo-war (Sauz)'', a popular folk music played with shehnai on happy occasions, mostly at marriages.
* ''Shab-daraaz (Dani)'' is a sad tone based on heartbroken love poems.
* ''Ghalhwar'' is a combination of Dani and Sauz. This is a mixture of fast and classical music played at the starting of a polo match.

'''Marshall Kenneth Kirk''' (December 8, 1957 â {{circa|July 28, 2005}}) was a [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] librarian, and a noted writer and a researcher in [[neuropsychiatry]].  He is, however, best known as one of the co-authors of ''[[After the Ball (book)|After the Ball]]: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s'', a strategy for the [[LGBT]] movement in the 1990s.

== Background ==
Kirk was born in [[Norway, Maine]], the third child of Roger Marchant and Kathleen Marie (Murphy) Kirk, and was raised in [[Mechanic Falls, Maine|Mechanic Falls]]. Marshall had two brothers, Roger and Douglas, and a sister, Kathy. Growing up Kirk took interest in [[weather]]; his brothers report that at age 10 his fellow townsmen in Mechanic Falls, Maine, preferred his forecasts to anything on television. He was valedictorian of his high school class and graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard University]] in 1980, majoring in psychology, and writing his honors thesis on the testing of gifted children.

== Genealogical research ==
His interest in his own colonial [[New England]] forebears broadened into the study of pre-American [[genealogy|ancestry]]. He became internationally known as one of the three or four major American authorities on [[medieval]] and ancient genealogy ([[Greece]], [[Rome]], [[Egypt]], [[Persia]], [[Armenia]], the [[Merovingians]] and [[Carolingians]]).

Writing sometimes under his own name and at other times under the [[pseudonym]] "Kenneth W. Kirkpatrick", he authored or co-authored several articles in the NEGHS Register and also wrote for the New Hampshire Genealogical Record, Vermont Genealogist and ''The Island'' Magazine.  His accumulation of arguments to "build a case" for speculative identifications in the near English ancestry of New England immigrants was widely perceived as brilliant, and he published such pieces on the five Winslow brothers and Thomas Bradbury in the NEGHS Register (the second article published 2007) and on John Cotton in the last 1999 issue of ''The New Hampshire Genealogical Record''.

His research on Gov. [[Thomas Dudley]] was used by both Doug Richardson in ''Plantagenet Ancestry'' and in ''The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants'' (RD600) by [[Gary Boyd Roberts]]. Marshall was especially pleased by the prospect of an [[Edward III]] descent through Katherine Deighton (Dudley's second wife), Dennis and Stradling, and after publication of an article in ''Foundations'' attempting to refute it, was strong in its defense.

Marshall also contributed to the fourth edition (1999) of the ''Genealogistâs Handbook for New England Research'', the CD-ROM edition of Clarence A. Torreyâs ''New England Marriages Prior to 1700'', and John A. Schutz, ''Legislators of the Massachusetts General Court, 1691â1780: A Biographical Dictionary'' (1997).

He was associate editor of ''The [[Mayflower]] Descendant'' from 2002 to 2003.

== Gay rights activism ==
In 1987 Kirk partnered with Hunter Madsen (writing under the pen-name "Erastes Pill") to write an essay, "The Overhauling of Straight America",&lt;ref name="overhauling"&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Kirk
  | first = Marshall
  | last2 = Madsen
  | first2 = Hunter
  | title = The Overhauling of Straight America
  | newspaper = Guide
  |date=November 1987
  | url = http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm
  | accessdate = 2011-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the â90s''.  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''.

The book is often critically described by social conservatives as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged "[[homosexual agenda]]". The conservative Christian group [[Focus on the Family]] claim that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is an agenda that they basically set in the late 1980s, in a book called 'After the Ball,' where they laid out a six-point plan for how they could transform the beliefs of ordinary Americans with regard to homosexual behavior â in a decade-long time frame.... They admit it privately, but they will not say that publicly. In their private publications, homosexual activists make it very clear that there is an agenda. The six-point agenda that they laid out in 1989 was explicit: Talk about gays and gayness as loudly and as often as possible... Portray gays as victims, not as aggressive challengers... Give homosexual protectors a just cause... Make gays look good... Make the victimizers look bad... Get funds from corporate America.&lt;ref name="osten"&gt;{{Citation

==Health==
Kirk suffered from severe [[migraine|migraine headaches]] that were preceded by a strong desire to talk in a rapid monologue.  He found that if he gave into these "babbling fits", the headache would be alleviated. He had other medical problems and suffered from bouts of [[clinical depression|depression]] that required [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) on three occasions.  Because of the negative effects on his memory, he considered ECT to be the last alternative to avoid death. In part due to this medical history, his knowledge of [[pharmacology]] was usually greater than that of anyone who treated him. When he died, he was found alone in his apartment by two friends.  The cause of death has never been publicly revealed.

Atmar was born in 1968 as son of Mohammad Asef Atmar in [[Laghman Province]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He is an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; As a young adult, he worked for the [[KHAD]], an Afghan security and intelligence agency with strong ties to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Andrew |last2=Mitrokhin|first2= Vasili |title=The World Was Going Our War: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World |publisher=Basic Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-465-00311-2 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; including with a special-operations unit.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  During the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] he fought against Mujahids, and lost a leg defending [[Jalalabad]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Atmar left for the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1989-1992)#Fall of Kabul|fall of Kabul]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Studies and humanitarian work==
In the UK he earned two degrees at the [[University of York]]: a diploma in Information Technology and Computers, and an M.A. in Public Policy, International Relations and Post-war Reconstruction studies, which he studied for from 1996 to 1997.&lt;ref name=USAID&gt;{{cite web |title= Minister of Education Makes First Trip to the U.S. for Global Literacy Conference |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Article.106.aspx |publisher=USAID |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He speaks fluent  [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], [[English language|English]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  In 1992 Atmar began advising on Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]] for humanitarian agencies, which he would continue for two years.&lt;ref name=USAID/&gt;  Following that he went to the [[Norwegian Church Aid]], where he served as Program Manager for six years until 2001.&lt;ref name=USAID/&gt;  That same year he was hired as the Deputy Director General of the [[International Rescue Committee]] for Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=USAID/&gt; but after the [[September 11th attacks]], the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], and the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] creating an Afghan Transitional Authority under [[Hamid Karzai]], Atmar left to join the new government.

==Political career==

===Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development===
In 2002, Atmar was invited to join the Transitional Government as the Minister of Rural Rehabilitation &amp; Development and was confirmed with the same portfolio in the cabinet of the newly elected President Karzai in December 2004. As one of the youngest members of cabinet and a technocrat, he directed his energies into transforming a dysfunctional and non-descript ministry into one of national significance that reached into every province of the country, overseeing an annual budget of nearly 500 million dollars at the end of his four-year tenure.

Ercan Murat, Country Director for [[UNDP]] in Afghanistan described Atmar in 2004 as a human development champion.&lt;ref name="undpreport2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murat|first1=Ercan|title=NAtional human Development Report 2004|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/afghanistan_2004_en.pdf|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As head of a ministry that was considered a key consumer of international funds, his task entailed providing food security for the rural population, safe drinking water, alternatives for the drug-economy and building the necessary infrastructure for the economy in rural areas to develop.&lt;ref name="irininterview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with rural development minister|url=http://www.irinnews.org/q-and/2005/07/04/interview-rural-development-minister|accessdate=29 April 2017|work=IRIN|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Education===
In May 2006, Atmar was sworn in as the Minister of Education after being approved by an overwhelming majority of the National Assembly.  As one of the very few who has served in successive cabinets under President Karzai, he went equipped with valuable institutional experience and memory to take on challenge of making available one of the most basic rights denied to a generation of Afghans - education.

As a member of the Presidential Oversight Committee, Atmar provides valuable advice and input into the development of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy and the represents government on the Joint Monitoring and Coordination Board that tracks the implementation of the Afghanistan Compact.

===Minister of Interior===

'''Northern''' or '''North Sami''' ({{lang|se|davvisÃ¡megiella}}; disapproved [[exonym]] '''Lappish''' or '''Lapp'''), sometimes also simply referred to as '''Sami''', is the most widely spoken of all [[Sami languages]]. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samediggi.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=74&amp;Itemid=167 |title=Samediggi â SaamelaiskÃ¤rÃ¤jÃ¤t â SÃ¡mi language |accessdate=2008-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.samer.se/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=1186 |title=The Sami dialects |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120081140/http://www.eng.samer.se/servlet/GetDoc?meta_id=1186 |archivedate=20 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Swenske och Lappeske ABC.djvu|page=9|thumb|A page from the 1638 edition of ''Svenske och Lappeske ABC Book'' with the [[Lord's Prayer]] in what is believed to be Northern Sami]]
Among the first printed Sami texts is ''Svenske och Lappeske ABC Book'' ("Swedish and Lappish ABC book"), written in Swedish and what is likely a form of Northern Sami. It was published in two editions in 1638 and 1640 and includes 30 pages of prayers and confessions of Protestant faith. It has been described as the first book "with a regular Sami language form".&lt;ref&gt;Original quote: "''"med en regelmessig samisk sprogform"''"; Forsgren, Tuuli (1988) "Samisk kyrko- och undervisningslitteratur i Sverige 1619â1850." Scriptum: Rapportserie utgiven av Forskningsarkivet vid UmeÃ¥ universitet, ISSN 0284-3161; p. 12 [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A311331&amp;dswid=-8603]&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Sami was first described by [[Knud Leem]] (''En lappisk Grammatica efter den Dialect, som bruges af Field-Lapperne udi Porsanger-Fiorden'') in 1748 and in dictionaries in 1752 and 1768. One of Leem's fellow grammaticians, who had also assisted him, was [[Anders Porsanger]], himself Sami and in fact the first Sami to receive higher education, who studied at the Trondheim Cathedral School and other schools, but who was unable to publish his work on Sami due to racist attitudes at the time. The majority of his work has disappeared.

===Assimilation===
[[File:Sami languages large.png|thumb|right|Area number 5 illustrates the approximate distribution of Northern Sami in northern Scandinavia.]]
[[File:Finnish border sign Kilpisjarvi.JPG|thumb|right|Trilingual international border sign ([[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and '''Northern Sami''') on the [[European route E8|E8]] road at the border between [[Norway]] and [[Finland]], at [[KilpisjÃ¤rvi]], Finland]]
The mass mobilization during the [[Alta controversy]] as well as a more tolerant political environment caused a change to the Norwegian policy of assimilation during the last decades of the twentieth century.
In Norway, Northern Sami is currently an official language of two [[counties]] ([[Finnmark]] and [[Troms]]) and six municipalities ([[Kautokeino]], [[Karasjok]], [[Nesseby]], [[Deatnu - Tana|Tana]], [[Porsanger]] and [[GÃ¡ivuotna]] ([[KÃ¥fjord, Troms|KÃ¥fjord]])). Sami born before 1977 have never learned to write Sami according to the currently used orthography in school, so it is only in recent years that there have been Sami capable of writing their own language for various administrative positions.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

The consonant inventory of Northern Sami is large, contrasting voicing for many consonants. Some analyses of Northern Sami phonology may include preaspirated stops and affricates ({{IPA|/hp/}}, {{IPA|/ht/}}, {{IPA|/htÍ¡s/}}, {{IPA|/htÍ¡Ê/}}, {{IPA|/hk/}}) and pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals (voiceless {{IPA|/pm/}}, {{IPA|/tn/}}, {{IPA|/tÉ²/}}, {{IPA|/kÅ/}} and voiced {{IPA|/bËm/}}, {{IPA|/dËn/}}, {{IPA|/dËÉ²/}}, {{IPA|/gËÅ/}}). However, these can be treated as clusters for the purpose of phonology, since they are clearly composed of two segments and only the first of these lengthens in quantity 3. The terms "preaspirated" and "pre-stopped" will be used in this article to describe these combinations for convenience.

Notes:
* Voiceless stops have voiced or partly voiced allophones when they occur adjacent to voiced sounds, and sometimes also word-initially.
* Stops before a [[homorganic]] nasal are realised as [[unreleased stop]]s. Some, particularly younger, speakers instead realise voiceless stops as a glottal stop {{IPA|[Ê]}} in this position, and decompose voiced stops into a homorganic nasal + glottal stop combination ({{IPA|[mÊ]}}, {{IPA|[nÊ]}} etc.).
* {{IPA|/v/}} is realised as a labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}} in the syllable onset (before a vowel), and as bilabial {{IPA|[Î²]}} or {{IPA|[w]}} in the syllable coda (in a consonant cluster).&lt;ref name="Bals Odden Rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~odden/Saami.pdf |title= Topics in North Saami Phonology |last1=Bals |first1=Berit Anne |last2=Odden |first2=David |last3=Rice |first3=Curt |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although {{IPA|[v]}} is a fricative, it behaves phonologically like an approximant, in particular like {{IPA|/j/}}.
* Quantity 3 geminated plain stops and affricates (written ''bb'', ''dd'', ''zz'', ''Å¾Å¾'', ''ddj'', ''gg'') are variously described as voiced ({{IPA|/bËb/}}, {{IPA|/dËd/}}, {{IPA|/dËdÍ¡z/}}, {{IPA|/dËdÍ¡Ê/}}, {{IPA|/ÉËÉ/}}, {{IPA|/É¡ËÉ¡/}}) or partly voiced ({{IPA|/bËp/}}, {{IPA|/dËt/}}, {{IPA|/dËtÍ¡s/}}, {{IPA|/dËtÍ¡Ê/}}, {{IPA|/ÉËc/}}, {{IPA|/É¡Ëk/}}).
* Voiceless sonorants are very rare, but occur more frequently as allophonic realisations. A combination of sonorant followed by {{IPA|/h/}} in the coda ({{IPA|/mh./}}, {{IPA|/nh./}}, {{IPA|/Åh./}}, {{IPA|/vh./}}, {{IPA|/jh./}}, {{IPA|/lh./}}, {{IPA|/rh./}}), is realised as the equivalent voiceless sonorant (with {{IPA|/vh/}} becoming {{IPA|/f/}}). Voiceless {{IPA|[ÅÌ¥]}} only occurs this way, and is quite rare.
* A combination of {{IPA|/h/}} followed by a stop or affricate in the onset ({{IPA|/.hp/}}, {{IPA|/.ht/}} etc) is realised as preaspiration ({{IPA|[Ê°p]}}, {{IPA|[Ê°t]}}).
* {{IPA|/Î¸/}} is extremely rare.

====Dialectal variation====

Not all Northern Sami dialects have identical consonant inventories. Some consonants are absent from some dialects, while others are distributed differently.

* Western Finnmark lacks {{IPA|/Å/}}, using {{IPA|/É²/}} in its place. This also applies to sequences of pre-stopped {{IPA|/gËÅ/}} and {{IPA|/kÅ/}}, which become {{IPA|/dËÉ²/}} and {{IPA|/tÉ²/}} respectively. {{IPA|[Å]}} is retained before a velar consonant, but as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}}.
* Eastern Finnmark does not have voiced pre-stopped nasals, replacing them with voiceless equivalents.
* Sea Sami does not have pre-stopped nasals at all, having geminate nasals in their place.
* The postaspirated stops do not occur in Western Finnmark dialects, plain stops are used instead. They occur only in recent loanwords from the Scandinavian languages, and only before a stressed syllable when not next to another consonant.

====Consonant length and gradation====

Consonants, including [[consonant cluster|clusters]], that occur after a stressed syllable can occur in multiple distinctive length types, or quantities. These are conventionally labelled quantity 1, 2 and 3 or Q1, Q2 and Q3 for short. The consonants of a word alternate in a process known as [[consonant gradation]], where consonants appear in different quantities depending on the specific grammatical form. Normally, one of the possibilities is named the ''strong grade'', while the other is named ''weak grade''. The consonants of a weak grade are normally quantity 1 or 2, while the consonants of a strong grade are normally quantity 2 or 3.

* '''Quantity 1''' includes any single consonant. It originates from [[Proto-Samic]] single consonants in the weak grade.
* '''Quantity 2''' includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a short consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable (in Eastern Finnmark, any combination of consonants preceded by a long vowel or diphthong). It originates from Proto-Samic single consonants in the strong grade, as well as combinations of two consonants in the weak grade.
* '''Quantity 3''' includes any combination of consonants (including two of the same) with a long consonant in the coda of the preceding syllable (in Eastern Finnmark, any combination of consonants preceded by a short vowel or diphthong). It originates from Proto-Samic combinations of two consonants in the strong grade.

Throughout this article and related articles, consonants that are part of different syllables are written with two consonant letters in IPA, while the lengthening of consonants in quantity 3 is indicated with an IPA length mark ({{IPA|Ë}}).

Not all consonants can occur in every quantity type. The following limitations exist:
* Single {{IPA|/h/}} is restricted to quantity 1, and does not alternate.
* Postaspirated consonants do not occur after a stressed syllable, and thus do not have any quantity distinctions.
* Voiced stops and affricates only occur in quantity 3. In quantity 1, voiced stops are allophones of the corresponding voiceless stops.
* {{IPA|/c/}}, {{IPA|/É/}} and {{IPA|/Ê/}} occur in quantity 2 and 3, but not in quantity 1.

When a consonant can occur in all three quantities, quantity 3 is termed "overlong".

In quantity 3, if the syllable coda consists of only {{IPA|/Ã°/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, the additional length of this consonant is realised phonetically as an epenthetic vowel. This vowel assimilates to the quality of the surrounding vowels:
* Between two rounded vowels (but not the diphthong {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}}) in the adjacent syllables, it becomes {{IPA|[o]}}.
* Before a front vowel in the next syllable, it becomes {{IPA|[e]}}, e.g. ''muorji'' {{IPA|/ËmuoÌ¯rË.jiË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËmÅ­ÅÌ¯re.jiË]}}.
* Otherwise, it becomes {{IPA|[a]}}, e.g. ''silba'' {{IPA|/ËsilË.pa/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[Ësila.pa]}}.
This does not occur if the second consonant is a dental/alveolar stop, e.g. ''gielda'' {{IPA|/ËkieÌ¯lË.ta/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËkÄ­ÄÌ¯lË.ta]}}, or ''sÃ¡lti'' {{IPA|/ËsaËlË.htiË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËsaËlË.Ê°tiË]}}.

|-
! Open
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|a}} || colspan="2" | {{IPA|aË}} || colspan="2" | || colspan="2" | {{IPA|aË}}
|}

Closing diphthongs such as ''Ã¡i'' also exist, but these are phonologically composed of a vowel plus one of the semivowels {{IPA|/v/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}. The semivowels still behave as consonants in clusters.

Not all of these vowel phonemes are equally prevalent; some occur generally while others occur only in specific contexts as the result of sound changes. The following rules apply for stressed syllables:
* Short {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, the normal diphthongs, and the long vowel {{IPA|/aË/}} occur generally.
* The other long vowels occur only in the context of diphthong simplification (below).
* Short {{IPA|/e/}} is rare, and mostly occurs due to the combination of diphthong simplification plus stressed vowel shortening.
* Rising diphthongs and half-long {{IPA|/aË/}} occur only due to unstressed vowel shortening in the next syllable.

The distribution in post-stressed syllables (unstressed syllables following a stressed one) is more restricted:
* Short {{IPA|/a/}} and long {{IPA|/aË/}}, {{IPA|/iË/}} and {{IPA|/uË/}} occur generally.
* Short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} occur more rarely, sometimes from Proto-Samic ''*i'' and ''*u'' and sometimes as a result of unstressed vowel shortening.
* Short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} occur only before {{IPA|/j/}}.
* No diphthongs occur at all, nor do half-long {{IPA|/aË/}} or long {{IPA|/eË/}} and {{IPA|/oË/}}.

In a second unstressed syllable (one that follows another unstressed syllable), no long vowels occur and {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are the only vowels that occur frequently.

The standard orthography of Northern Sami distinguishes vowel length in the case of {{angbr|a}} {{IPA|/a/}} versus {{angbr|Ã¡}} {{IPA|/aË/}}, although this is primarily on an etymological basis. Not all instances of {{angbr|Ã¡}} are phonemically long, due to both stressed and unstressed vowel shortening. Some dialects also have lengthening of {{angbr|a}} under certain circumstances. Nonetheless, a default length can be assumed for these two letters. For the remaining vowels, vowel length is not indicated in the standard orthography. In reference works, macrons can be placed above long vowels that occur in a position where they can be short. Length of {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|u}} in a post-stressed syllable is assumed, and not indicated, except in the combinations {{angbr|ii}} and {{angbr|ui}}, where these letters can also indicate short vowels.

====Dialectal variation====
The Eastern Finnmark dialects possess additional contrasts that other dialects of Northern Sami do not:
* There is a three-way contrast among open vowels between {{IPA|/Ã¦/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/É/}}, both short and long.
** The vowel spelled {{angbr|a}} is {{IPA|/É/}} in stressed syllables, {{IPA|/a/}} in unstressed syllables.
** The vowel spelled {{angbr|Ã¡}} is {{IPA|/a/}} in stressed syllables if the next syllable has a back vowel (including {{angbr|a}} but not {{angbr|Ã¡}}), and {{IPA|/Ã¦/}} everywhere else (including all unstressed syllables).
* There is a length contrast between short and long diphthongs. In other dialects, this distinction exists as well, but is allophonic.

Some Torne dialects have {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}} instead of stressed {{IPA|/eË/}} and {{IPA|/oË/}} (from diphthong simplification) as well as unstressed {{IPA|/iË/}} and {{IPA|/uË/}}.

===Phonological processes===

====Diphthong simplification====

Diphthong simplification, also known as [[umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]], is a process whereby a diphthong loses its second component and becomes a long monophthong:
* ''ie'' â ''Ä«'': ''viehkat'' {{IPA|/ËvieÌ¯h.kat/}} "to run" â ''v&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Ä«&lt;/span&gt;hken'' {{IPA|/ËviËh.ken/}} "I ran"
* ''ea'' â ''Ä'': ''geassi'' {{IPA|/ËkeaÌ¯s.siË/}} "summer" â ''g&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Ä&lt;/span&gt;siid'' {{IPA|/ËkeË.sijt/}} "of the summers"
* ''oa'' â ''Å'': ''goarrut'' {{IPA|/ËkoÉÌ¯r.ruËt/}} "to sew" â ''g&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Å&lt;/span&gt;rro!'' {{IPA|/ËkoËr.ro/}} "sew!"
* ''uo'' â ''Å«'': ''muorra'' {{IPA|/ËmuoÌ¯r.ra/}} "tree" â ''m&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Å«&lt;/span&gt;rrii'' {{IPA|/ËmuËr.rij/}} "into the tree"

Historically, diphthong simplification was caused by a short ''i'' or ''u'' in the following syllable, the same conditioning that still exists in neighbouring [[Lule Sami]]. In Northern Sami, these vowels have now become short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, except when followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, so simplification can occur when the next syllable contains {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/o/}}, or the sequences {{IPA|/ij/}} or {{IPA|/uj/}}.

The process is complicated by two factors. Firstly, vowel length is not indicated in the spelling, so it's not possible to tell whether the first vowel in ''ui'' is short or long. It is short in the illative singular and thus causes simplification (''viessu'' "house" â ''v&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Ä«&lt;/span&gt;ssui'' "into the house"), but it is long in the plural forms and does not cause any simplification (''viessÅ«ide'' "into the houses"). A second complicating factor is that under some circumstances, original long ''i'' and ''u'' in unstressed syllables have shortened to ''e'' and ''o'' (denoted in grammars and dictionaries with an underdot ''áº¹'' and ''á»'' to distinguish them). These shortened vowels do not cause simplification, but are indistinguishable from the older originally short vowels that do trigger it. These cases must simply be memorised.

====Unstressed vowel shortening====

Shortening of long vowels in unstressed syllables occurs irregularly. It commonly occurs in the first element of a compound word, in a fourth syllable, and in various other unpredictable circumstances. When shortened, {{IPA|/iË/}} and {{IPA|/uË/}} are lowered to {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, except before {{IPA|/j/}}. Shortened vowels are denoted here, and in other reference works, with an underdot: ''áº¡'', ''áº¹'', ''á»'', to distinguish them from originally-short vowels.

When a long vowel or diphthong occurs in the stressed syllable before the shortened vowel, it becomes half-long/rising.
* {{wikt-lang|se|boarÃ¡seamá»s}} {{IPA|/ËpoÉÌ¯.raË.seÌ¯a.mos/}} "oldest" (nom. sg.) ~ ''boarÃ¡sÄpmosa'' {{IPA|/ËpoÉÌ¯.raË.seËp.mo.sa/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|baluheapmáº¹}} {{IPA|/Ëpa.luË.heÌ¯ap.me/}} "fearless" (nom. sg.) ~ ''baluhÄmiid'' {{IPA|/Ëpa.luË.heË.mijt/}} (acc. pl.)

When the consonant preceding the shortened vowel is quantity 3, any lengthened elements are shortened so that it becomes quantity 2. However, the resulting consonant is not necessarily the weak-grade equivalent of that consonant. If the consonant was previously affected by consonant lengthening (below), this process shortens it again.

* {{wikt-lang|se|eadni}} {{IPA|/ËeaÌ¯dË.niË/}} "mother" &amp;rarr; {{wikt-lang|se|eadnespiidni|eadnáº¹spiidni}} {{IPA|/ËeÌ¯ad.neËspijËt.niË/}} "mother pig"; contrast the weak grade in {{wikt-lang|se|eatni}} {{IPA|/ËeaÌ¯t.niË/}}
* {{wikt-lang|se|jahki}} {{IPA|/ËjahË.kiË/}} "year" &amp;rarr; ''jahkáº¹bealli'' {{IPA|/Ëjah.keËpeaÌ¯l.liË/}} "half year"

====Stressed vowel shortening====

In the Eastern Finnmark dialects, long vowels as well as diphthongs are shortened before a quantity 3 consonant. This is phonemic due to the loss of length in quantity 3 in these dialects.
* {{wikt-lang|se|eadni}} {{IPA|/ËÄÄÌ¯t.niË/}} "mother" (nom. sg.) ~ ''&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;tniid'' {{IPA|/Ëet.nijt/}} (gen. pl.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|guoika}} {{IPA|/ËkÅ­ÅÌ¯j.hka/}} "waterfall" (nom. sg.) ~ ''g&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;ikii'' {{IPA|/Ëkuj.hkij/}} (ill. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|oahppa}} {{IPA|/ËÅÉÌ¯Ìh.pa/}} "teaching" (nom. sg.) ~ ''oahpa'' {{IPA|/ËoÉÌ¯h.pa/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|guossi|guosËsi}} {{IPA|/ËÉ¡Å­ÅÌ¯s.siË/}} "guest" (nom. sg.) ~ ''guossi'' {{IPA|/ËÉ¡uoÌ¯s.siË/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|Ã¡hkku}} {{IPA|/Ëah.kuË/}} "grandmother" (nom. sg.) ~ ''Ã¡hku'' {{IPA|/ËaËh.kuË/}} (acc. sg.)

Outside Eastern Finnmark, long {{IPA|/aË/}} is only shortened before a long preaspirate, not before any other consonants. The shortening of diphthongs remains allophonic due to the preservation of quantity 3 length, but the shortening of long vowels that result from diphthong simplification is phonemic.

====Stressed vowel lengthening====
In the Eastern Finnmark dialects, short vowels are lengthened when they occur before a quantity 1 or 2 consonant. Combined with the preceding change, vowel length in stressed syllables becomes conditioned entirely by the following consonant quantity. Moreover, because the coda lengthening in quantity 3 is lost in these dialects, vowel length becomes the only means for distinguishing quantities 3 and 2 in many cases.

* {{wikt-lang|se|lohkka}} {{IPA|/Ëloh.ka/}} "lock" (nom. sg.) ~ ''lohka'' {{IPA|/ËloËh.ka/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|gazza}} {{IPA|/ËkÉd.dÍ¡za/}} "nail" (nom. sg.) ~ ''gacca'' {{IPA|/ËkÉËt.tÍ¡sa/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|bussÃ¡|busËsÃ¡}} {{IPA|/Ëpus.sÃ¦Ë/}} "cat" (nom. sg.) ~ ''bussÃ¡'' {{IPA|/ËpuËs.sÃ¦Ë/}} (acc. sg.)

====Lengthening of unstressed short /a/====

In the Western Finnmark dialects, a short /a/ in a post-stressed syllable is lengthened to /aË/ if the preceding consonants are quantity 1 or 2, and the preceding syllable contains a short vowel. Compare the Eastern Finnmark pronunciations of these words under "stressed vowel lengthening".

* {{wikt-lang|se|lohkka}} {{IPA|/ËlohË.ka/}} "lock" (nom. sg.) ~ ''lohka'' {{IPA|/Ëloh.kaË/}} (acc. sg.).
* {{wikt-lang|se|gazza}} {{IPA|/ËkadË.dÍ¡za/}} "nail" (nom. sg.) ~ ''gacca'' {{IPA|/Ëkat.tÍ¡saË/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|balva}} {{IPA|/ËpalË.va/}} "cloud" (nom. sg.) ~ ''balvva'' {{IPA|/Ëpalv.vaË/}} (acc. sg.)

A long {{IPA|/aË/}} that originates from this process does ''not'' trigger consonant lengthening.

====Consonant lengthening====

In dialects outside Eastern Finnmark, in quantity 2, the last coda consonant is lengthened if the following vowel is long, and the preceding vowel is a short monophthong. Since the coda now contains a long consonant, it is considered as quantity 3, but the lengthening is mostly allophonic and is not indicated orthographically. It is phonemic in the Western Finnmark dialects when the following vowel is {{IPA|/aË/}}, because lengthening is triggered by an original long {{IPA|/aË/}} but not by an original short {{IPA|/a/}} that was lengthened (as described above).

The new consonant may coincide with its Q3 consonant gradation counterpart, effectively making a weak grade strong, or it may still differ in other ways. In particular, no change is made to syllable division, so that in case of Q2 consonants with a doubled final consonant, it is actually the first of this pair that lengthens, making it overlong.

* {{wikt-lang|se|jahki}} {{IPA|/ËjahË.kiË/}} "year" (nom. sg.) ~ ''jagi'' {{IPA|/Ëja.É¡iË/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|ballu}} {{IPA|/ËpalË.luË/}} "fear" (nom. sg.) ~ ''balu'' {{IPA|/Ëpa.luË/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|submi}} {{IPA|/ËsubË.miË/}} "sum" (nom. sg.) ~ ''supmi'' {{IPA|/ËsupË.miË/}} (acc. sg.); contrast {{wikt-lang|se|skÃ¡bma}} {{IPA|/ËskaËbË.ma/}} "polar night" ~ ''skÃ¡pma'' {{IPA|/ËskaËp.ma/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|Äalbmi}} {{IPA|/ËtÊalË.pmiË/}} "eye" (nom. sg.) ~ ''Äalmmi'' {{IPA|/ËtÊalmË.miË/}} (acc. sg.); contrast {{wikt-lang|se|bÃ¡lbma}} {{IPA|/ËpaËlË.pma/}} "palm tree" ~ ''bÃ¡lmma'' {{IPA|/ËpaËlm.ma/}} (acc. sg.)
* {{wikt-lang|se|loddi}} {{IPA|/ËlodË.diË/}} "bird" (nom. sg.) ~ ''lotti'' {{IPA|/ËlotË.tiË/}} (acc. sg.); contrast {{wikt-lang|se|bodda}} {{IPA|/ËpodË.da/}} "period" ~ ''botta'' {{IPA|/Ëpot.ta/}} (acc. sg.)

Lengthening also occurs if the preceding vowel is a close diphthong {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} or {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}}. In this case, the diphthong also shortens before the new quantity 3 consonant.
* {{wikt-lang|se|duoddi}} {{IPA|/ËtuoÌ¯dË.diË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËtÅ­ÅÌ¯dË.diË]}} "protection" (nom. sg.) ~ ''duotti'' {{IPA|/ËtuoÌ¯tË.tiË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËtÅ­ÅÌ¯tË.tiË]}} (acc. sg.); contrast {{wikt-lang|se|luodda}} "track, trail" {{IPA|/ËluoÌ¯dË.da/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËlÅ­ÅÌ¯dË.da]}} ~ ''luotta'' {{IPA|/ËluoÌ¯t.ta/}} (acc. sg.) with no lengthening.
* {{wikt-lang|se|gieddi}} {{IPA|/ËkieÌ¯dË.diË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËkÄ­ÄÌ¯dË.diË]}} "field" (nom. sg.) ~ ''gietti'' {{IPA|/ËkieÌ¯tË.tiË/}}, phonetically {{IPA|[ËkÄ­ÄÌ¯tË.tiË]}} (acc. sg.)

===Prosody===

Stress is generally not phonemic in Northern Sami; the first syllable of a word always carries primary stress. Like most Sami languages, Northern Sami follows a pattern of alternating ([[trochaic]]) stress, in which each odd-numbered syllable after the first is secondarily stressed and even-numbered syllables are unstressed. The last syllable of a word is never stressed, unless the word has only one syllable.

Consequently, words can follow three possible patterns:
* A single stressed syllable.
* An even number of syllables: Ending in a stressed odd-numbered syllable followed by an unstressed even-numbered syllable.
* An odd number of syllables: Ending in a stressed odd-numbered syllable followed by an unstressed even-numbered syllable, and an unstressed odd-numbered (final) syllable.
This gives the following pattern, which can be extended indefinitely in theory. S indicates stress, _ indicates no stress:
* S
* S _
* S _ _
* S _ S _
* S _ S _ _
* S _ S _ S _
* etc.

The number of syllables, and the resulting stress pattern, is important for grammatical reasons. Words with stems having an even number of syllables from the last  inflect differently from words with stems having an odd number of syllables. This is detailed further in the grammar section.

In compound words, which consist of several distinct word roots, each word retains its own stress pattern, potentially breaking from the normal trochaic pattern. If the first element of a compound has an odd number of syllables, then there will be a sequence of two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed one, which does not occur in non-compound words. In some cases, the first element of a compound has only one syllable, resulting in two adjacent stressed syllables. Hence, stress is lexically significant in that it can distinguish compounds from non-compounds.

Recent loanwords generally keep the stress of the language they were borrowed from, assigning secondary stress to the syllable that was stressed in the original word. The normal trochaic pattern can also be broken in this case, but words will still be made to fit into the even or odd inflection patterns. Words with penultimate stress ending in a consonant will follow the odd inflection:
* {{wikt-lang|se|neon|nÄon}} {{IPA|/ËneË.on/}} "neon"
* {{wikt-lang|se|apostal}} {{IPA|/ËaËposË.tal/}} "apostle"

Words with antepenultimate or earlier stress will have the stress modified, as this is not allowed in Northern Sami:
* {{wikt-lang|se|anÃ¡nas}} {{IPA|/ËaËnaË.nas/}} "pineapple"
* {{wikt-lang|se|AfrihkkÃ¡}} {{IPA|/ËafËrihË.kaË/}} "Africa"
* {{wikt-lang|se|AmerihkkÃ¡}} {{IPA|/Ëa.meËrihË.kaË/}} "America"

Final stress is not allowed, so if the original word has final stress, an extra dummy syllable (generally ''a'') is added in Northern Sami to avoid this.
* {{wikt-lang|se|biila}} {{IPA|/ËpijËla/}} "car"
* {{wikt-lang|se|bomba}} {{IPA|/ËpomËpa/}} "bomb"
* {{wikt-lang|se|kultuvra}} {{IPA|/ËkulËtuvË.ra/}} "culture"
* {{wikt-lang|se|advearba}} {{IPA|/ËatËveaÌ¯rË.pa/}} "adverb"
* {{wikt-lang|se|tomÃ¡htta}} {{IPA|/ËtoËmaËhË.ta/}} "tomato"
* {{wikt-lang|se|advokÃ¡hta}} {{IPA|/Ëat.voËkaËh.ta/}} "lawyer"
* {{wikt-lang|se|kapasitehta|kapasitÄhta}} {{IPA|/Ëka.pa.siËteËh.ta/}} "capacity"
* {{wikt-lang|se|matematihkka}} {{IPA|/Ëma.te.maËtihË.ka/}} "mathematics"

As a result of retaining the original stress pattern, some loanwords have sequences of three unstressed syllables, which don't occur in any other environment:
* {{wikt-lang|se|spesialiseret|spesialisÄret}} {{IPA|/Ëspe.si.a.li.ËseË.reh(t)/}} "to specialise"
* {{wikt-lang|se|teoretiseret|teoretisÄret}} {{IPA|/Ëte.o.re.ti.ËseË.reh(t)/}} "to theorise"
* {{wikt-lang|se|administraÅ¡uvdna}} {{IPA|/Ëat.mi.ni.stra.ËÊuvË.tna/}} "administration"

[[Conjunctions]], [[postpositions]], [[grammatical particle|particles]], and monosyllabic pronouns tend to be unstressed altogether, and therefore fall outside the above rules.

==Dialects==

Sammallahti&lt;ref name="Sammallahti"&gt;{{cite book|first=Pekka|last=Sammallahti|title=The Saami Languages: An Introduction|year=1998|publisher=Davvi Girji|location=KÃ¡rÃ¡Å¡johka|pp=8â20}}&lt;/ref&gt; divides Northern Sami dialects as follows:
* Finnmark dialects
** Western Finnmark: eastern [[EnontekiÃ¶]], northern [[SodankylÃ¤]] and part of [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] in Finland, [[Kautokeino]] and [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in Norway
** Eastern Finnmark: [[Utsjoki]] and part of [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] in Finland, [[Karasjok]], [[Porsanger]] and [[Tana, Norway|Tana]] in Norway
* Torne dialects
** Finnish Wedge: western [[EnontekiÃ¶]] in Finland, [[Skibotnelva]], [[GÃ¡lggojÃ¡vri]] and [[Nordreisa]] in Norway
** [[Karesuando]]: [[KÃ¶nkÃ¤mÃ¤vuoma]] and [[Lainiovuoma]] in Sweden, [[Lyngen]] and [[Balsfjord]] in Norway
** [[JukkasjÃ¤rvi]]: [[Saarivuoma]], Talma, [[Rautasvuoma]] and [[Kaalasvuoma]] in Sweden, VÃ¥gsfjord and [[Ofotfjord]] in Norway
** [[Kaitum]]: [[Norrkaitum]] and [[Mellanbyn]] in Sweden
* Sea Sami

The written language is primarily based on the western Finnmark dialects, with some elements from the eastern Finnmark dialects.

===Western Finnmark dialects===

Features of the western Finnmark dialects are:
* Merging of the velar nasals into the palatal nasals, except before a (plain or preaspirated) homorganic stop.
* Lengthening of short {{IPA|/a/}} when the preceding syllable contains a short vowel and a quantity 1 or 2 consonant. This new long {{IPA|/aË/}} does not trigger consonant lengthening.
* Kautokeino: Merging of {{IPA|/É/}} into {{IPA|/tÊ/}}.
* Kautokeino: Assibilation of {{IPA|/Î¸/}} into {{IPA|/s/}}.

===Eastern Finnmark dialects===
The eastern Finnmark dialects have the following characteristics:

* Lengthening of stressed vowels before quantity 1 and 2 consonants.
* Shortening of the first element of quantity 3 consonants, merging them with quantity 2 consonants (unless the second element of the corresponding Q2 consonant is doubled, which keeps them distinct). Combined with the previous change, this causes Q3-Q2 gradation in Eastern Finnmark to become primarily about vowel length rather than consonant length.
* A distinction between {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/É/}}, the former spelled {{angbr|Ã¡}} and reflecting Proto-Samic ''*Ä'', the latter spelled {{angbr|a}} and reflecting Proto-Samic ''*Ã«''.
* Fronting of {{IPA|/a/}} to {{IPA|/Ã¦/}} in unstressed syllables.
* Umlaut: fronting of vowels before a following front vowel in the second syllable (including {{IPA|/Ã¦/}} produced by the previous change).
** {{IPA|/a/}} is fronted to {{IPA|/Ã¦/}}.
** {{IPA|/eaÌ¯/}} is fronted to {{IPA|/eÃ¦Ì¯/}}.
** {{IPA|/oÉÌ¯/}} is fronted to {{IPA|/oÃ¦Ì¯/}}.
** {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}} is fronted to {{IPA|/ueÌ¯/}}.
* Between vowels, lenition of {{IPA|/b/}} to {{IPA|/v/}}, and of {{IPA|/É¡/}} to {{IPA|/É£/}}, which in modern speech becomes {{IPA|/j/}} between a stressed vowel and a front vowel, and [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] otherwise.
* Raising of the non-close diphthongs {{IPA|/eaÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/oÉÌ¯/}}.
** Along the lower [[Tana (Norway)|Tana river]], these merge entirely with standard {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}}, resulting in {{IPA|/iÉÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uÉÌ¯/}} (when not fronted) or {{IPA|/iÃ¦Ì¯/}} and {{IPA|/uÃ¦Ì¯/}} (when fronted).
** Along the upper Tana, the non-close diphthongs are only raised before single and (original) geminate consonants, and they may or may not merge with original {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}}. 
** In dialects south of [[Tana bru]], only fronted {{IPA|/eÃ¦Ì¯/}} and {{IPA|/oÃ¦Ì¯/}} are raised to {{IPA|/iÃ¦Ì¯/}} and {{IPA|/uÃ¦Ì¯/}}.

===Torne dialects===
* JukkasjÃ¤rvi, Karesuando, Finnish Wedge: Loss of distinction between postalveolar and plain alveolar consonants, with the result being alveolar in Karesuando and postalveolar in the Finnish Wedge.
* Use of ''-n'' instead of ''-s'' in the locative singular. This originates from the old inessive case, whereas the standard ending is from the old elative case.
* Use of ''-o'' instead of ''-u'' in the third-person singular present tense.
* JukkasjÃ¤rvi and Kaitum: Use of ''-is'' instead of ''-in'' in the locative plural. Again, these originate from two different older cases.
* Karesuando: Long {{IPA|/eË/}} and {{IPA|/oË/}} from diphthong simplification are re-diphthongised to {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}}.
* JukkasjÃ¤rvi and Karesuando: Raising of short {{IPA|/a/}} to {{IPA|/e/}} before {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}.
* JukkasjÃ¤rvi and Karesuando: {{IPA|/ieÌ¯/}} and {{IPA|/uoÌ¯/}} instead of standard long {{IPA|/iË/}} and {{IPA|/uË/}} in post-stressed syllables.
* All except Finnish Wedge: {{IPA|/É¡d/}} and {{IPA|/É¡dÊ/}} instead of standard {{IPA|/vd/}} and {{IPA|/vdÊ/}} from the Proto-Samic clusters ''*mt'' and ''*mÄ''.

===Sea Sami dialects===
* Lack of fortition in strong-grade nasals and glides, thus {{IPA|/mË/}}, {{IPA|/nË/}}, {{IPA|/É²Ë/}}, {{IPA|/ÅË/}} rather than {{IPA|/pm/}}, {{IPA|/tn/}}, {{IPA|/tÉ²/}} and {{IPA|/kÅ/}}.
* Use of ''-st'' instead of ''-s'' in the locative singular.
* Eastern Sea Sami: Loss of distinction between postalveolar and plain alveolar consonants.

The roots of the current orthography for Northern Sami were laid by [[Rasmus Rask]] who, after discussions with [[Nils Vibe Stockfleth]], published ''RÃ¦sonneret lappisk sproglÃ¦re efter den sprogart, som bruges af fjÃ¦ldlapperne i Porsangerfjorden i Finmarken. En omarbejdelse af Prof. Knud Leems Lappiske grammatica'' in 1832. Rask opted for a [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic orthographic]] system. All of the orthographies that have been used for Northern Sami trace their roots back to Rask's system, unlike the orthographies used for [[Lule Sami|Lule]] and [[Southern Sami]], which are mainly based on the orthographical conventions of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Following in the tradition of Rask meant that diacritics were used with some consonants (Ä, Ä, Å, Å¡, Å§ and Å¾), which caused data-processing problems before [[Unicode]] was introduced. Both Stockfleth and [[Jens Andreas Friis|J. A. Friis]] went on to publish grammar books and dictionaries for Sami. It can be said that Northern Sami was better described than Norwegian was before [[Ivar Aasen]] published his grammar on Norwegian.

Northern Sami was and is used in three countries, each of which used its own orthography for years. Friis' orthography was used when work on translating the Bible into Northern Sami commenced, in the first Sami newspaper called ''[[SaÇ¥ai MuittalÃ¦gje]]'', and in the Finnemisjonen's own newspaper ''[[Nuorttanaste]]''. The groundwork for Northern Sami lexicography was laid by [[Konrad Nielsen]] who used an orthography of his own creation in his dictionary ''Lappisk ordbok''. Starting in 1948, the orthographies used in Norway and Sweden were combined into a single ''[[Knut Bergsland|Bergsland]]-[[Israel Ruong|Ruong]] orthography''. It was not greatly used in Norway. In 1979, an official orthography for Northern Sami was adopted for use in Norway, Sweden and Finland.

Thus, until the official orthography currently in use was adopted in 1979, each country had its own, slightly different standard, so it is quite possible to come across older books that are difficult to understand for people unacquainted with the orthography:

# {{Lang|se|Maanat leÃ¤t poahtan skuvllai.}}
# {{Lang|se|MÃ¡nÃ¡t leat boahtÃ¡n skuvlii.}}

(The children have come to school.)

The first sentence is from Antti Outakoski's ''Samekiela kiellaoahpa'' from 1950; the second one is how it would be written according to the current orthography.

When typing, if there is no way of entering the letters particular to Northern Sami (ÃÃ¡ ÄÄ ÄÄ ÅÅ Å Å¡ Å¦Å§ Å½Å¾) correctly, an acute accent is sometimes placed over the corresponding [[Latin script|Latin]] letter as a substitute.&lt;ref name="Svonni"&gt;{{cite book

  | nopp = true
  | page = III}}&lt;/ref&gt; These substitutions are still found in books printed after the common orthography was adopted due to system limitations when typing.

===Marks used in reference works===

Some additional marks are used in dictionaries, grammars and other reference works, including in this article. They are not used in normal writing. The following are used in [[Pekka Sammallahti]]'s ''SÃ¡mi-suoma sÃ¡tnegirji'':
* A vertical mark Ë or apostrophe or other similar mark is placed between a double consonant to indicate an overlong (quantity 3) consonant.
* The same mark may be used in the combination {{angbr|lËj}} to indicate the Q3 consonant cluster {{IPA|/lËj/}}.
* A macron is placed above vowel letters to indicate a long vowel ({{angbr|Ä}}, {{angbr|Ä«}}, {{angbr|Å}}, {{angbr|Å«}}).
* A dot is placed below vowel letters to indicate an unstressed vowel that has been shortened ({{angbr|áº¡}}, {{angbr|áº¹}}, {{angbr|á»}}), which in turn hints that preceding vowels are rising/half-long, and preceding Q3 consonants are shortened.

===Multigraphs===

Northern Sami orthography includes many combinations of multiple letters. In most cases, a double consonant letter corresponds to a doubled consonant phoneme, e.g. ''mm'' stands for {{IPA|/mm/}}. Overlong (quantity 3) consonants are not distinguished from regular double consonants, but are commonly denoted with a vertical line between the two consonant letters ({{angbr|fËf}}, {{angbr|mËm}}, {{angbr|sËs}} etc.) in reference works.

Combinations of different consonant letters stand for their equivalent individual phonemes, as described by the pronunciations of the individual letters, above. The last consonant in a sequence may be doubled. This indicates that the consonant cluster is quantity 2, while a cluster with an undoubled last consonant is generally quantity 3. It often also indicates a doubling of the corresponding consonant phoneme, but not if the preceding consonant is voiceless.

The following details combinations of multiple letters which are exceptions to the general pronunciation rules of each letter.

====Diphthongs====

The diphthongs, as may be expected, are written using a combination of two letters. Length is not indicated, nor is the distinction between normal and rising diphthongs. This distinction can be inferred by the presence of {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|o}} in the next syllable (which must always be shortened vowels when following a diphthong), and in reference works by the presence of vowels with an underdot in the next syllable.

====Ending in {{angbr|j}}====

The combinations {{angbr|dj}}, {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} indicate {{IPA|/cc/}}, {{IPA|/ÊÊ/}} and {{IPA|/É²/}} respectively. The first letter is doubled to indicate longer versions, and a vertical line is then used for overlong {{IPA|/É²ËÉ²/}}.

In the case of {{angbr|lj}}, there are two possible interpretations: as a single quantity 2 consonant {{IPA|/ÊÊ/}}, or as a quantity 3 consonant cluster {{IPA|/lËj/}} (e.g. {{wikt-lang|se|olju}}), although the latter is rare. These two cases are distinguished by their behaviour in consonant gradation. In the first case, {{angbr|llj}} appears in the strong grade while {{angbr|lj}} appears in the weak grade, and these represent overlong {{IPA|/ÊËÊ/}} and long {{IPA|/ÊÊ/}} respectively. In the second case, {{angbr|lj}} appears in the strong grade while {{angbr|ljj}} appears in the weak grade, representing the clusters {{IPA|/lËj/}} and {{IPA|/ljj/}} respectively.

====Beginning with {{angbr|h}}====

Preaspiration is indicated with a preceding {{angbr|h}}. Long preaspiration is indicated by doubling the second letter. This is exactly the opposite of how normal clusters are written.

===Hyphenation===

With just a single consonant between syllables, the hyphen goes before that consonant.
* i-ja
* de-hÃ¡-laÅ¡

If a word contains a double consonant letter, the hyphen is always placed between those two letters. The combination ''ij'', when preceded by a vowel, counts as a double consonant and thus gets a hyphen in between.
* guol-li
* Ã¡hk-kÃ¡
* beaiv-vÃ¡Å¡
* krist-ta-laÅ¡
* bi-o-lo-gii-ja

With other combinations of two consonants, the hyphen goes between those. Again, if ''i'' counts as a consonant, it goes between that and the next one.
* SÃ¡p-mi
* bÃ¡i-di
* kon-sear-ta
* duos-tan

There are a few exceptions where the hyphen goes before all consonants.
* pro-gram-ma
* in-du-strii-ja

In compound words, a hyphen always goes between two parts of a compound.
* mÃ¡-ilm-mi
* gas-ka-i-ja-beaiv-vÃ¡Å¡

==Grammar==

Northern Sami is an [[agglutinative]], highly inflected language that shares many grammatical features with the other [[Uralic languages]]. Sami has also developed considerably into the direction of fusional and inflected morphology, much like [[Estonian language|Estonian]] to which it is distantly related. Therefore, morphemes are marked not only by suffixes but also by [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] modifications to the root. Of the various morphophonological alterations, the most important and complex is the system of [[consonant gradation]].

===Consonant gradation===

Consonant gradation is a pattern of alternations between pairs of consonants that appears in the inflection of words. The system of consonant gradation in Northern Sami is complex, especially compared to that found in the Finnic languages. A word stem can appear in two ''grades'': the strong grade and the weak grade. A given word can alternate either between quantity 3 in the strong grade and quantity 2 in the weak grade, or between quantity 2 in the strong grade and quantity 1 in the weak grade. Historically, the weak grade appeared when the syllable following the consonant was closed (ended in a consonant), but the loss of certain vowels or consonants have obscured this in Northern Sami and it is now a more-or-less opaque process.

In verbs, some nouns, and in some processes of word derivation, a Q2 strong grade can become "extra strong" Q3, alternating in all three quantities. This is caused by the historical loss of a consonant (often /j/ or /s/) between the second and third syllable, which triggered [[compensatory lengthening]] on the gradating consonant.

====Quantity 3 ~ 2 alternations====

Alternations between quantities 3 and 2 are either consonant clusters or sequences of two identical consonants. In the '''strong''' grade, the '''first consonant forms the coda''' of the preceding syllable, and the remaining consonants form the onset of the following syllable. In the '''weak''' grade, only the '''last consonant belongs to the onset''' of the next syllable, and the remaining consonants belong to the coda of the preceding syllable. Thus, when there are three or more consonants, the syllable division changes between the grades. In addition, the strong grade by default has a lengthened consonant in the coda, while this lengthening is generally absent in the weak grade. However, this lengthening is subject to the modifying effects of consonant lengthening and unstressed vowel shortening, which can in some occasions level the length distinctions, so that length not an absolute indicator of grade (though it is of ''quantity''). In Eastern Finnmark, no lengthening is found at all, instead of length the preceding vowel is short, while the vowel becomes long when the length would be absent.

Doubling of the last consonant is another distinguishing feature of the weak grade, although it only occurs if the preceding consonant is voiced. The additional consonant is always assigned to the coda (the double consonant is split between syllables), so that it obligatorily shifts the syllable boundary relative to the strong grade:
* ''vl'' {{IPA|/vË.l/}} ~ ''vll'' {{IPA|/vl.l/}}
* ''id'' {{IPA|/jË.t/}} ~ ''idd'' {{IPA|/jt.t/}}
Consonant lengthening can then, in turn, lengthen the first of this pair again (the one in the coda). In writing, the last consonant is doubled in the weak grade, even if the preceding consonant is voiceless, simply to distinguish the two grades visually:
* ''st'' /sË.t/ ~ ''stt'' /s.t/
* ''vst'' /vË.st/ ~ ''vstt'' /vs.t/

Sequences of two identical consonants gradate in the same way, with lengthening of the first consonant in the strong grade (again, subject to modification, and not in Eastern Finnmark), but without any doubling of the last consonant in the weak grade. For most pairs of consonants, no difference is made between the grades orthographically, both are written with a double consonant. In reference works, the special mark Ë is placed between the consonants to indicate the strong grade.

Some cases are indicated specially in the orthography, but behave as expected from a phonological point of view:
* Clusters beginning with /h/ (preaspirated stops): the second consonant is written doubled in the ''strong'' grade instead of the weak grade. In Eastern Finnmark the length is lost, making both grades identical (but still with different preceding vowel lengths).
** ''hpp'' /hË.p/ (EF /h.p/) ~ ''hp'' /h.p/
** ''htt'' /hË.t/ (EF /h.t/) ~ ''ht'' /h.t/
** ''hcc'' /hË.tÍ¡s/ (EF /h.tÍ¡s/) ~ ''hc'' /h.tÍ¡s/
** ''hÄÄ'' /hË.tÍ¡Ê/ (EF /h.tÍ¡Ê/) ~ ''hÄ'' /h.tÍ¡Ê/
** ''hkk'' /hË.k/ (EF /h.k/) ~ ''hk'' /h.k/
* Clusters of /r/ plus pre-stopped nasal: orthographically indicated the same as lone pre-stopped nasals (below), but both grades have a voiceless stop, and differ only in the length of the first consonant and syllabification. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is missing from the strong grade.
** ''rbm'' /rË.pm/ (EF /r.m/) ~ ''rpm'' /rp.m/
** ''rdn'' /rË.tn/ (EF /r.n/) ~ ''rtn'' /rt.n/
** ''rdnj'' /rË.tÉ²/ (EF /r.É²/) ~ ''rtnj'' /rt.É²/
** ''rgÅ'' /rË.kÅ/ (EF /r.Å/) ~ ''rkÅ'' /rk.Å/
* Sequences of two /Ê/: the strong grade is indicated by a doubled first consonant, the weak grade by only a single one. This is possible because this consonant cannot occur singly (as quantity 1).
** ''llj'' /ÊË.Ê/ ~ ''lj'' /Ê.Ê/
* Sequences of two /É²/: both grades are indicated identically. The strong grade can be distinguished with an overlength mark in reference works.
** ''nËnj'' /É²Ë.É²/ ~ ''nnj'' /É².É²/
* Sequences of two voiceless sonorants: both grades are indicated identically. The strong grade can be distinguished with an overlength mark in reference works.
** ''hjËj'' /jÌ¥Ë.jÌ¥/ ~ ''hjj'' /jÌ¥.jÌ¥/
** ''hlËl'' /lÌ¥Ë.lÌ¥/ ~ ''hll'' /lÌ¥.lÌ¥/
** ''hmËm'' /mÌ¥Ë.mÌ¥/ ~ ''hmm'' /mÌ¥.mÌ¥/
** ''hnËn'' /nÌ¥Ë.nÌ¥/ ~ ''hnn'' /nÌ¥.nÌ¥/
** ''hrËr'' /rÌ¥Ë.rÌ¥/ ~ ''hrr'' /rÌ¥.rÌ¥/

In some clusters, there is an alternation in the quality of the first consonant between the two grades.
* Clusters beginning with /k/ in the strong grade: /k/ becomes /v/ in the weak grade. {{IPA|/h/}} is inserted before a stop or affricate, and in other cases the last consonant phoneme can be doubled in the weak grade.
** ''kc'' /kË.tÍ¡s/ ~ ''vcc'' /vh.tÍ¡s/ ({{IPA|[f.tÍ¡s]}})
** ''ks'' /kË.s/ ~ ''vss'' /vs.s/
** ''kst'' /kË.st/ ~ ''vstt'' /vs.t/
** ''kt'' /kË.t/ ~ ''vtt'' /vh.t/ ({{IPA|[f.t]}})
* Clusters of pre-stopped nasals: a voiced stop occurs in the strong grade, and a voiceless stop in the weak grade. The voiceless stop, in turn, blocks doubling of the last consonant. In this case, however, there is no doubling in the orthography. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is devoiced in the strong grade, making the two grades identical (but still with different preceding vowel lengths). In Sea Sami, this alternation is replaced by geminate nasals.
** ''bm'' /bË.m/ (EF /p.m/) ~ ''pm'' /p.m/
** ''dn'' /dË.n/ (EF /d.n/) ~ ''tn'' /t.n/
** ''dnj'' /dË.É²/ (EF /d.É²/) ~ ''tnj'' /t.É²/
** ''gÅ'' /É¡Ë.Å/ (EF /É¡.Å/) ~ ''kÅ'' /k.Å/
* Clusters of a voiced consonant (except /r/) plus pre-stopped nasal: the stop is voiceless and occurs only in the strong grade, the weak grade has doubling of the nasal. In Eastern Finnmark, the stop is missing from the strong grade.
** ''lbm'' /lË.pm/ (EF /l.m/) ~ ''lmm'' /lm.m/
** ''idn'' /jË.tn/ (EF /j.n/) ~ ''inn'' /jn.n/
** ''vdnj'' /vË.tÉ²/ (EF /v.É²/) ~ ''vnnj'' /vÉ².É²/
** ''lgÅ'' /lË.kÅ/ (EF /l.Å/) ~ ''lÅÅ'' /lÅ.Å/
* Sequences of two homorganic plain stops: the first stop is voiced in the strong grade, voiceless in the weak grade. The strong grade is represented orthographically by a pair of voiced consonants.
** ''bb'' /bË.b/ ~ ''pp'' /p.p/
** ''dd'' /dË.d/ ~ ''tt'' /t.t/
** ''gg'' /É¡Ë.É¡/ ~ ''kk'' /k.k/
** ''zz'' /dË.dÍ¡z/ ~ ''cc'' /t.tÍ¡s/
** ''Å¾Å¾'' /dË.dÍ¡Ê/ ~ ''ÄÄ'' /t.tÍ¡Ê/
* Sequences of two palatal stops: these are phonetically the same as the previous, but different orthographically.
** ''ddj'' /ÉË.É/ ~ ''dj'' /c.c/

====Quantity 2 ~ 1 alternations====

Alternations between 2 and 1 are less predictable than alternations between quantities 3 and 2. The '''weak''' grade is always represented by a '''single consonant''', which forms the onset of the next syllable, and the preceding syllable has no coda. The corresponding '''strong''' grade additionally has a '''single consonant in the coda''', which may the same as the following onset consonant or different. The coda consonant in the strong grade may undergo consonant lengthening to receive additional length.

A double consonant in the strong grade always alternates with a single consonant in the weak grade. This occurs with all nasals, sonorants and fricatives (except /Ê/ and /j/). Orthographically, this is represented as a double versus a single consonant letter.
* ''hrr'' /rÌ¥.rÌ¥/ ~ ''hr'' /rÌ¥/
* ''mm'' /m.m/ ~ ''m'' /m/
* ''nnj'' /É².É²/ ~ ''nj'' /É²/
* ''ss'' /s.s/ ~ ''s'' /s/
* ''ÄÄ'' /Ã°.Ã°/ ~ ''Ä'' /Ã°/

A cluster of short /h/ and a voiceless consonant (preaspirated) in the strong grade alternates with a single voiced consonant in the weak grade.
* ''hp'' /h.p/ ~ ''b'' /p/ (/v/ in Eastern Finnmark)
* ''ht'' /h.t/ ~ ''Ä'' /Ã°/
* ''hc'' /h.tÍ¡s/ ~ ''z'' /dÍ¡z/
* ''hÄ'' /h.tÍ¡Ê/ ~ ''Å¾'' /dÍ¡Ê/
* ''hk'' /h.k/ ~ ''g'' /k/ (/j/ or zero in Eastern Finnmark)

A cluster of a voiceless pre-stopped nasal in the strong grade drops the stop in the weak grade. In Sea Sami, the strong grade has a double nasal, without the stop.
* ''pm'' /p.m/ ~ ''m'' /m/
* ''tn'' /t.n/ ~ ''n'' /n/
* ''tnj'' /t.É²/ ~ ''nj'' /É²/
* ''kÅ'' /k.Å/ ~ ''Å'' /Å/

Double /cc/ alternates with /j/.
* ''dj'' /c.c/ ~ ''j'' /j/

===Changes to word-final consonants===

Only a limited number of consonants are allowed at the end of a word. Therefore, consonants will be modified when they come to stand word-finally:
* In the case of a consonant cluster, all consonants except the first are removed. The other rules are then applied to that consonant. Combinations of /j/ plus a consonant are allowed, however.
* All stops, including preaspirated, become ''t'' /h(t)/. Combinations of /j/ plus a stop become ''id'' /jt/.
* ''h'' also becomes ''t'' /h(t)/.
* All affricates become homorganic fricatives: ''c''/''z'' &amp;rarr; ''s'', ''Ä''/''Å¾'' &amp;rarr; ''Å¡''.
* ''m'' becomes ''n''. Some recent loanwords such as {{wikt-lang|se|serum}} retain ''m''.
* /j/ becomes spelled {{angbr|i}}, but there is no phonemic change.

===Post-stressed vowel alternations===

Certain inflectional endings and derivational suffixes trigger changes in the first unstressed (post-stressed) vowel of the stem. These changes are generally the result of umlaut effects in Proto-Samic. The following changes may be noted. An empty table cell means there is no change, ''S'' indicates diphthong simplification.

|}

There are some vowel alternations that don't have a clear rule or cause. For example, the change of ''a'' to ''Ã¡'' in the present tense third-person singular of verbs is unexpected and must simply be taken as-is. Likewise, the appearance of ''u'' or ''o'' in some verb imperative forms is not based on any rule, but is an inherent part of the ending.

===Inflection types===

All inflected words, whether nouns, adjectives or verbs, can be divided into three main inflectional classes. The division is based on whether there is an even or odd number of syllables from the last stressed syllable to the end of the word.
* Words with '''even''' inflection (''bÃ¡rrastÃ¡vvalsÃ¡nit'', also called "vowel stems") have an even number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem; usually two, but sometimes also four.
* Words with '''odd''' inflection (''bÃ¡rahisstÃ¡vvalsÃ¡nit'', also called "consonant stems") have an odd number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem; usually three, but very rarely one or five.
* Words with '''contracted''' inflection (''kontrÃ¡ktasÃ¡nit'') have an even number of syllables from the last stressed syllable of the stem, but have the consonant gradation pattern of odd-inflection words. If the gradation has three levels, the strong grade is always level 3.

For nouns and adjectives, the stem is taken from the accusative/genitive singular rather than the nominative, as the latter often drops the final vowel and sometimes also the preceding consonant. For verbs, the infinitive is used to determine the stem, by removing the infinitive ending ''-t''.

Words with even and contracted inflection can be divided further, based on the final vowel of the stem. For even-inflected words, this vowel is most commonly ''a'', ''i'' or ''u'', while for contracted words it is mostly ''Ã¡'', ''e'' or ''o''. Words with odd inflection are not differentiated by stem-final vowel.

===Nouns===

Nouns inflect in singular (''ovttaidlohku'') and plural (''mÃ¡Åggaidlohku''), and also in 7 [[Grammatical case|cases]]. The following table shows the general endings; the actual forms can differ based on consonant gradation and the inflection type of the word.

{| class="wikitable"
! Case
! Singular&lt;br&gt;ending
! Plural&lt;br&gt;ending
! Meaning/use
|-
| [[Nominative case|Nominative]] (''nominatiiva'')
| -â

| [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]]
|-
| [[Accusative case|Accusative]] (''akkusatiiva'')
| -â

|-
| [[Illative case|Illative]] (''illatiiva'')
| -i

|-
| [[Comitative case|Comitative]] (''komitatiiva'')

| With, in company of, by means of
|-
| [[Essive case|Essive]] (''essiiva'')
| colspan="2" | -n, -in
| As, in the role of, under condition of (when)
|}

The accusative and genitive are always identical. There is no singular/plural distinction in the essive, so that for example ''mÃ¡nnÃ¡n'' is interpreted as either "as a child" or "as children".

====Nouns with even inflection====

Nouns with even inflection have consonant gradation of the last consonant in the stem. The strong grade appears in the nominative, illative and essive singular, while the weak grade appears in the remaining forms.

The most common of this type are the nouns with a stem ending in ''-a'', ''-i'' or slightly rarer ''-u''.

Even-syllable nouns with four or more syllables sometimes drop the final vowel in the nominative singular. Consequently, simplification of the final consonant occurs. The stem of these nouns always ends in ''-a''.

====Nouns with odd inflection====

Nouns with odd inflection have consonant gradation. The weak grade appears in the nominative and essive singular, while the strong grade appears in the remaining forms. Some nouns also have other alternations in the stem of the strong grade, such as changes of ''i'' to ''Ã¡'', ''u'' to ''o'', or addition of a consonant.

====Nouns with contracted inflection====

Nouns with contracted inflection have consonant gradation. The pattern follows that of odd-inflection nouns, with the weak grade in the nominative and essive singular, and the strong grade in the remainder. If the weak grade is level 1, the strong grade will be level 3. The final syllable is generally altered along with the gradation as well.

====Possessive suffixes====

The possessive suffixes are similar in meaning to the English personal possessive determiners ''my'', ''your'', ''their'' and so on. There are 9 possessive suffixes: one for each person in singular, dual and plural. Possessive suffixes attach to the end of a noun, after the case ending. Thus, for example, ''ruovttus'' "in a house" may become ''ruovttustan'' "in my house".

Like noun case endings, the suffixes have different forms depending on whether they are attached to a stem with an even or odd number of syllables, and (in the case of even-syllable stems) depending on the last vowel of the stem. The following table shows the suffixes:

| -eattet
| -easet
|}

The suffixes attach to a combination of noun plus case ending, so the stem that the suffix is attached to may not be the stem of the noun. Rather, a new "possessive stem" is formed from the noun with its case ending included. This stem is not always identical to the ending of the noun on its own; some case endings undergo modifications or the addition of a final vowel. Thus, certain cases may have possessive stems that inherently end in ''-a'', other cases may have ''-i'', but this is only significant if the combination has an even number of syllables.

The following table shows the possessive stems for each case, for four of the nouns whose inflection was given above. If the stem ends in a vowel, it is even and the suffixes with the matching vowel are used. If the stem ends in a consonant, it is odd and the odd endings are used.

In the comitative plural, the possessive suffix attaches between the possessive stem and the final ''-guin''.

As can be seen in the table, for the nominative, accusative and genitive singular cases, the possessive stem is identical to the noun stem. The stem also undergoes consonant gradation in the accusative and genitive singular forms, and endings beginning with ''e'' or ''o'' also trigger diphthong simplification. The noun is in the strong grade with the first-person possessive suffixes, and in the weak grade with the second- and third-person possessives.

The possessive forms of ''ruoktu'' are:

===Adjectives===

Adjectives inflect the same as nouns do, and have the same cases and inflection types.

====Attributive form====

Adjectives also have an additional form, the attributive form (''attribuhttahÃ¡pmi''). This form is used when the adjective is used [[Adjectives#Types of use|attributively]], where it precedes the noun. The attributive does not receive any endings, so it does not have cases or number. Its formation is also unpredictable: for some adjectives, it's formed from the nominative singular by adding an extra ending of some kind to the stem, while for others the attributive is formed by ''removing'' part of the stem. It may also be identical to the nominative singular. Some examples:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| boar'''is'''
| boar'''Ã¡s'''- (odd)
| boar'''es'''

| ruoks'''at'''
| ruoks'''ad'''- (odd)
| r&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;ks'''es'''

|-
| Å¡ealg'''at'''
| Å¡ealg'''ad'''- (odd)
| Å¡ealg'''es'''
| shiny
|-
| uhcc'''i'''
| uhcc'''i'''- (even)
| uhc'''a'''
| small
|}

Not all adjectives have an attributive form. For example, the frequently-used adjective ''buorre'' "good" has only case forms. When there is no attributive form, this doesn't mean it can't be used attributively. Instead, the case and number of the adjective matches that of the noun it is an attribute of (as in for example Finnish).

===Pronouns and determiners===

====Personal pronouns====

The personal pronouns inflect irregularly, and also have a third number, the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] (''guvttiidlohku''). The dual is used to refer to exactly two people. The following table shows the forms.

====Demonstratives====

The five demonstrative determiners/pronouns inflect somewhat irregularly as well. The nominative singular and nominative plural are identical, and some other cases have endings not found in nouns.

{| class="wikitable"

| colspan="2" | dÃ¡'''nin'''

|}

When these words modify a noun rather than standing alone, the demonstrative is in the same case as the noun, with the following exceptions:
* A noun in the illative or locative singular is preceded by a demonstrative in the accusative/genitive singular form.
* A noun in the comitative plural is preceded by a demonstrative in either the comitative or the accusative/genitive plural form.

====Interrogatives====

The interrogative/relative pronouns/determiners ''gii'' "who" and ''mii'' "what" are likewise irregular.

{| class="wikitable"
!
! colspan="2" | ''gii'' "who"
! colspan="2" | ''mii'' "what, which"
|-
! Case
! Singular !! Plural
! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative
| gii || gea'''t'''
| mii || ma'''t'''
|-
| Accusative
| gea'''n''' || gea'''id'''
| ma'''n''', mÃ¡id || ma'''id'''
|-
| Genitive
| gea'''n''' || gea'''id'''
| ma'''n''' || ma'''id'''
|-
| Illative
| gea'''sa''' || gea'''idda'''
| ma'''sa''' || ma'''idda'''
|-
| Locative
| gea'''s''' || gea'''in'''
| ma'''s''' || ma'''in'''
|-
| Comitative
| gea'''inna''' || gea'''iguin'''
| ma'''inna''' || ma'''iguin'''
|-
| Essive
| colspan="2" | gea'''nin'''
| colspan="2" | ma'''nin'''
|}

In the accusative singular of ''mii'', there are two possible forms. The "regular" form ''man'' is used when there is an implication of a choice from a limited number of options. The form ''mÃ¡id'' has no such implication.

These two pronouns, as well as other interrogatives (which inflect regularly) can act as determiners and modify nouns. The rules for which case to use are the same as for the demonstrative. The form ''mÃ¡id'' is followed by a noun in the accusative plural form.

====Reflexive pronoun====

The reflexive pronoun is ''ieÅ¡'' (dual and plural ''ieÅ¾a''), meaning ''myself'', ''yourself'', ''himself'', ''herself'' and so on. In its base form, the pronoun occurs only in the nominative case and is never used on its own; it always occurs next to the subject of the sentence, where it acts as an adverb to strengthen it. Compare for example sentences such as ''I '''myself''' have never seen it.''.

The other cases can occur by themselves, but only in the singular, and are always used in combination with a possessive suffix that matches the subject of the sentence (i.e. always ''I see myself'', never ''I see himself''). These forms are irregular as well as [[suppletion|suppletive]]: the illative and locative forms derive from completely different roots. There are also several alternative stems.

{| class="wikitable"
! Case
! Possessive stem
! Notes
|-
! Accusative
| ieÅ¾a- (iehÄa-)
| rowspan="2" | The stem ''iehÄa-'' is only used with first-person possessives.
|-
! Genitive
| ieÅ¾a- (iehÄa-)
|-
! Illative
| alcces-, alcce-, allas- (alcca-)
| The stem ''alcca-'' is only used with first- and second-person possessives.
|-
! Locative
| alddi-, alddest- (alddiin-, alddÃ¡n-)
| The stems ''alddiin-'' and ''alddÃ¡n-'' are only used with dual and plural possessives.
|-
! Comitative
| ieÅ¾ain-
|
|-
! Essive
| iehÄan-
|
|}

===Verbs===

====Finite verbal categories====
The conjugation of Northern Sami [[verb]]s resembles that of Finnish. There are three [[grammatical person]]s (''persovnnat''), and three [[grammatical number]]s (''logut''), singular, dual and plural. There are four or five [[grammatical mood]]s (''vuogit''):
* [[Indicative mood|indicative]] (''indikatiiva'' or ''duohtavuohki''), indicating real events or statements of fact.
* [[Imperative mood|imperative]] (''imperatiiva'' or ''gohÄÄunvuohki''), indicating commands.
* [[Optative mood|optative]] (''optatiiva'' or ''Ã¡vÅ¾Å¾uhusvuohki''), indicating wishes, things that the speaker would like to see done or realised. The optative is not usually considered a distinct mood, but is generally combined with the imperative.
* [[Conditional mood|conditional]] (''konditionÃ¡la'' or ''eaktovuohki''), indicating conditional or hypothetical statements, like the English subjunctive and the verb "would".
* [[Potential mood|potential]] (''potientiÃ¡la'' or ''veadjinvuohki''), indicating ability or possibility.

[[Grammatical tense|Tense]] is also distinguished, but only in the indicative. There are two tenses  (''tempusat''):
* [[Present tense|present]] (''preseansa'' or ''dÃ¡lÃ¡ Ã¡igi''), which is also used for [[Future tense|future]] events ([[nonpast tense]]).
* [[Past tense|past]] (''preterihtta'' or ''vÃ¡ssÃ¡n Ã¡igi'').

In addition, each mood and tense has a so-called [[connegative]] form. This form is used in negative sentences, when combined with the negative verb.

====Non-finite verbal categories====

Finally, there are several [[Non-finite verb|non-finite forms]].

=====Infinitive=====
The [[infinitive]] is the dictionary form of the verb.

=====Present participle=====
The present [[participle]] is an adjective indicating a current or ongoing action. It is identical in form to the [[agent noun]], and has the same origin. However, the participle has only an attributive form, no case forms.
* '''''oaÄËÄi''' mÃ¡nnÃ¡'' &amp;mdash; a sleeping child
* '''''Ã¡hpÃ¡smeaddji''' buohcci'' &amp;mdash; a recovering patient

=====Past participle=====
The past participle is an adjective indicating a past or completed action. Like the present participle, it has only an attributive form. It is also used in forming the [[periphrastic]] perfect tense, and as the connegative form of the past indicative.
* '''''oaÄÄÃ¡n''' mÃ¡nnÃ¡'' &amp;mdash; child who slept
* '''''Ã¡hpÃ¡sman''' buohcci'' &amp;mdash; patient who recovered

=====Agent participle=====
The agent participle is an adjective indicating a past or completed action that has been completed by a particular agent. It only exists for transitive verbs. The agent precedes the participle and is in the genitive case, much like its Finnish counterpart:
* ''Ã¡hÄi '''ÄÃ¡llin''' reive'' &amp;mdash; the letter written by the father

=====Negative participle=====
The negative participle is an adjective indicating an action that has not been done by or to something. It can be either active or passive in meaning.
* '''''logakeahtáº¹s''' reive'' &amp;mdash; unread letter
* '''''jugakeahtáº¹s''' vuola'' &amp;mdash; undrunk beer
* '''''muitalkeahtáº¹s''' muitalus'' &amp;mdash; untold story

=====Action noun=====
The [[action noun]] is a noun which indicates the action itself. It is not a verb form as such, but is often used in verbal constructions.

=====Action inessive=====
The action inessive (also called the "action essive") indicates "in (the process of)" or "while". It is used together with the copula ''leat'' to express a current, ongoing action, much like the English continuous.
* ''mÃ¡nnÃ¡ lea '''oaÄÄimin''''' &amp;mdash; the child is sleeping
* ''mun lean '''juhkamin''' vuola'' &amp;mdash; I am drinking beer

The action inessive originates in the inessive case of the action noun, a case which no longer exists for nouns in Northern Sami.

=====Action elative=====
The action elative (also called the "action locative") indicates "from (the action of)". It is used to indicate the cessation of an action, but is also required idiomatically by certain verbs.

* ''mun vajÃ¡lduhtin '''oaÄÄimis''''' &amp;mdash; I forgot to sleep

The action elative originates in the elative case of the action noun, a case which became the locative in regular nouns.

=====Action comitative=====
The action comitative indicates "through" or "by". It originates in the comitative case of the action noun.

=====Purposive converb=====
The purposive [[converb]] expresses "in order to".

=====Simultaneous converb=====
The simultaneous converb expresses that an action took place "during" or "while (doing)" another one. It is always accompanied by a possessive suffix.

=====Negative converb=====
The negative converb (also called the "verb abessive") expresses "without".

=====Verb genitive=====
The verb genitive is an adverbial form often used to indicate the way/method, accompanied by a verb of motion. It only exists for some verbs and is not very productive, so it is better considered a derivational form rather than an inflectional form.

=====Supine=====
The [[supine]] expresses "in order to". It is only used in western Northern Sami dialects.

====Verbs with contracted inflection====
{{empty section|date=February 2015}}

====Negative verb====

Northern Sami, like other Uralic languages, has a [[negative verb]] that conjugates according to [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative and imperative), [[Grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual and plural). It does not conjugate according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]].

===Numbers===

Northern Sami uses a [[decimal]] numeral system. Cardinal numbers inflect like adjectives, but have no attributive form. Instead, the numeral matches the noun it modifies in case and number. All numerals except for ''okta'' (1) use the nominative singular form also for the accusative singular. For ''ÄieÅ¾a'' (7), ''gÃ¡vcci'' (8), ''ovcci'' (9), ''logi'' (10) and ''ÄuoÄi'' (100), the genitive singular form is used also for the nominative and accusative singular. In the plural, they inflect like all other nominals.

====0-10====
The numbers from 0 to 10 are:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9 !! 10
|-
| nolËla, nulËla || okta || guoktáº¹ || golbma || njealljáº¹ || vihtta || guhtta || ÄieÅ¾a || gÃ¡vcci || ovcci || logi
|}

====11-19====
The numbers 11 to 19 are formed by compounding a number from 1 to 9 with ''-nuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i'' (literally "into the second ten").

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! 11 !! 12 !! 13 !! 14 !! 15 !! 16 !! 17 !! 18 !! 19
|-
| oktanuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || guoktáº¹nuppelohkÃ¡i || golbmanuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || njealljáº¹nuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || vihttanuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || guhttanuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || ÄieÅ¾anuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || gÃ¡vccinuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i || ovccinuppáº¹lohkÃ¡i
|}

====20-99====

The decades 20 to 90 are formed by simply compounding the multiple with ''logi''.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! 20 !! 30 !! 40 !! 50 !! 60 !! 70 !! 80 !! 90
|-
| guoktáº¹logi || golbmalogi || njealljáº¹logi || vihttalogi || guhttalogi || ÄieÅ¾alogi || gÃ¡vccilogi || ovccilogi
|}

Combinations of a decade and a unit are constructed by compounding the decade with the unit directly, as in English. For example:

* 28 ''guoktáº¹logigÃ¡vcci''
* 83 ''gÃ¡vccilogigolbma''
* 99 ''ovccilogiovcci''

====Hundreds====

100 is ''ÄuoÄi''. Multiples of 100 are expressed like multiples of 10, by simple compounding: 200 ''guoktáº¹ÄuoÄi'', 300 ''golbmaÄuoÄi'' and so on. Combinations of a hundred and a lower number follow the same pattern, again by compounding, with the hundred coming first.

* 112 ''ÄuoÄiguoktáº¹nuppelohkÃ¡i''
* 698 ''guhttaÄuoÄiovccilogigÃ¡vcci''
* 999 ''ovcciÄuoÄiovccilogiovcci''

====Thousands====

1000 is ''duhÃ¡t''. The pattern is the same as with the hundreds.

* 5 203 ''vihttaduhÃ¡tguoktáº¹ÄuoÄigolbma''
* 9 001 ''ovcciduhÃ¡tokta''
* 32 348 ''golbmalogiduhÃ¡tgolbmaÄuoÄinjealljáº¹logigÃ¡vcci''
* 123 456 ''ÄuoÄiguoktáº¹logigolbmaduhÃ¡tnjealljáº¹ÄuoÄivihttalogiguhtta''

====Millions and above====

Northern Sami uses the [[long and short scales|long scale system]].

* 1 000 000 ''[[1000000 (number)|miljovdna]]''
* 1 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000 (number)|miljÃ¡rda]]''
* 1 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000 (number)|biljovdna]]''
* 1 000 000 000 000 000 ''[[1000000000000000 (number)|biljÃ¡rda]]''
* etc.

Combinations with lower numbers are much the same as with the thousands. Multiples use the accusative/genitive forms ''miljovnna'' and ''miljÃ¡rdda'' instead.

* 117 401 067 ''ÄuoÄilogiÄieÅ¾amiljovnnanjealljáº¹ÄuoÄioktaduhÃ¡tguhttalogiÄieÅ¾a''
* 10 987 654 321 ''logimiljÃ¡rddaovcciÄuoÄigÃ¡vccilogiÄieÅ¾amiljovnnaguhttaÄuoÄivihttaloginjealljáº¹duhÃ¡tgolbmaÄuoÄiguoktáº¹logiokta''

====Ordinal numbers====

Ordinal numbers behave and inflect like regular adjectives. Except for ''nubbi'', they have an attributive form, which is identical to the nominative singular.

For the vast majority of numbers, the ordinal form is created by suffixing ''-t'', and putting the stem in the weak grade. The final vowel of the stem is often altered as well.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! 1st !! 2nd !! 3rd !! 4th !! 5th !! 6th !! 7th !! 8th !! 9th
|-
| vuosttaÅ¡ || nubbi || goalmmÃ¡t || njealjÃ¡t || viÄat || guÄat || ÄihÄÄet || gÃ¡vccÃ¡t || ovccÃ¡t
|-
! 10th !! 11-19th !! 100th !! 1 000th !! 1 000 000th+ !! 1 000 000 000th+
|-
| logÃ¡t || -nuppáº¹logÃ¡t || ÄuoÄÃ¡t || duhÃ¡hat || -ljovnnat || -ljÃ¡rddat
|}

When a number is composed of multiple parts, only the last one is converted to an ordinal, the rest stay in their cardinal form. Thus, 13th ''golbmanuppáº¹logÃ¡t'', 22nd ''guoktáº¹loginubbi'', 409th ''njealljáº¹ÄuoÄiovccÃ¡t'', 9001st ''ovcciduhÃ¡tvuosttaÅ¡''.

In mid-September 2012 a [[Opinion poll|poll]] surveying Israeli attitudes was commissioned by the Yisraela Goldblum Fund and conducted on the eve of [[Rosh Hashanah]] by the polling agency Dialog, The results were first presented to the public by Haaretz journalist [[Gideon Levy]] on October 23, 2012, under the headline:'Survey: Most Israeli Jews would support apartheid regime in Israel.' In the wake of a controversy, Haaretz emended this to 'Survey: Most Israeli Jews wouldn't give Palestinians vote if West Bank was annexed', stating that the original headline 'did not accurately reflect the findings of the Dialog poll'.&lt;ref name=levipoll/&gt; According to Haaretz, in the poll, 58% of respondents said Israel practiced apartheid against the Palestinians,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/israeli-poll-majority-apartheid-policies Israeli poll finds majority would be in favour of 'apartheid' policies (The Guardian, October 23, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a third said Israeli Arabs should be denied the vote in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-new-israeli-apartheid-poll-reveals-widespread-jewish-support-for-policy-of-discrimination-against-arab-minority-8223548.html The new Israeli apartheid: Poll reveals widespread Jewish support for policy of discrimination against Arab minority (The Independent, October 23, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the poll and Haaretz's presentation of its results have been challenged.

== Polling agency ==
Dialog is run by Prof. Camil Fuchs, [[Haaretz]]'s in-house pollster,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/camil-fuchs-statistics-expert-1.196595 âCamil Fuchs,â] at [[Haaretz]], 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and head of the Department of Statistics at [[Tel Aviv University]]'s School of Mathematical Sciences. According to Haaretz, the questionnaire was written by a group of academic, peace, political and civil rights activists.&lt;ref name=levipoll/&gt; The group consisted of the former director general of the [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Ministry]] and Israel ambassador to Turkey Alon Liel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/4/Dr%2520Alon%2520Liel&lt;/ref&gt; who is married to [[New Israel Fund]] Israel's Executive Director Rachel Liel; former ambassador to [[South Africa]] Ilan Baruch,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/veteran-diplomat-s-rebuke-of-netanyahu-lieberman-strikes-chord-with-colleagues-1.346790&lt;/ref&gt;  member of the New Israel Fund International Council;&lt;ref name="newisraelfund.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.newisraelfund.org.uk/resources/ic.pdf New Israel Fund International Council]&lt;/ref&gt; former chief of education in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[Mordechai Bar-On]], member of the New Israel Fund International Council;&lt;ref name="newisraelfund.org.uk"/&gt; and human rights lawyer [[Michael Sfard]], legal counsel to several recipients of grants from the New Israel Fund, including [[Yesh Din]], [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://action.nif.org/p/salsa/event/common/public/index.sjs?event_KEY=70264 Democracy in Recession: On accountability and âprice tagâ politics in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI1&gt;Elhanan Miller, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/haaretz-changes-tack-on-major-story-that-alleged-widespread-apartheid-attitudes-in-israel/ 'Haaretz changes tack on major story that alleged widespread âapartheidâ attitudes in Israel,'] at [[The Times of Israel]], October 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The questionnaire consisted of 17 questions put to a sampling group of 503 interviewees, differentiated in terms of [[Jewish secularism|secular]], [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|traditional]], [[Religion in Israel|religious]], [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and [[Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s|Russian]].&lt;ref name=levipoll&gt;Gideon Levy , [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/survey-most-israeli-jews-would-support-apartheid-regime-in-israel.premium-1.471644 'Survey: Most Israeli Jews would support apartheid regime in Israel,â] at [[Haaretz]], 23 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Alderman, [http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/89245/facts-behind-a-skewed-survey âFacts behind a skewed survey,â] at [[Jewish Chronicle]].

The poll results were first published in Haaretz by [[Gideon Levy]], initially with the following headline:â Survey: Most Israeli Jews would support apartheid regime in Israel.â Levyâs presentation stirred headlines round the world,&lt;ref&gt;Shany Mor,[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/apartheid-poll-errors-that-traveled-round-the-world.premium-1.472989 âApartheidâ poll: Errors that traveled round the world,â ] at [[Haaretz]], 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and was repeated &lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Levy]], [http://forward.com/articles/164779/ 'Israelis Support Anti-Arab Discrimination: Poll.

== Gideon Levy's presentation ==
Levy made the following points:-
*(1) A 59% majority of the Jewish public wants preference for Jews over Arabs in government ministries.
*(2) 49%, almost half, desire better treatment by the state for its Jewish, as opposed to its Arab, citizens
*(3) 42% preferred not to live in the same building with Arabs.
*(4) 42% preferred not to have their children share school classes with Arab children
*(5) A third of the Jewish public wants a law that would block Israeli Arabs from voting for the [[Knesset]] (the Israeli parliament).
*(6) 69% object, in the event that Israel was to annex the [[West Bank]], to giving the 2.5 million Palestinian residents there the right to vote.
*(7) 74% approve of a separate road system in the West Bank for Israelis and Palestinians.
*(8) 24% regard separate roads as "a good situation" vs. 50% who consider them "a necessary situation.â
*(9) 47% percent want part of Israel's Arab population transferred to the [[Palestinian National Authority]].
*(10) 36% support the transference of authority of some Israeli Arab villages to the rule of the PA, in exchange for keeping some of the [[Israeli settlement|West Bank settlements]].
*(11) 58% of the Jewish population believe Israel practices apartheid against Arabs, even before any annexation takes place in the West Bank. 
*(12) 31% believe that this racial segregative regime does not exist in Israel-
*(13) 38% wish, and 48% object to, the annexation of areas in the West Bank with Jewish Settlements.

Analyzing the results according to sectoral segmentation, Levy gave the following breakdown of the poll results:-

[[Haredim|Ultra Orthodox Israelis]]:-
*(14) 70% of the ultra-Orthodox support legally barring Israeli Arabs from voting.
*(15) 82% support state treatment in favor of Jews.
*(16) 95% are in favor of discrimination when deciding to accept Arabs or Jews for employment.

[[Religion in Israel|(Non ultra-orthodox) religious Israelis]]:-
*(17) This group, is second to the ultra-orthodox, in its racism.

[[Jewish secularism|Secular Israelis]]:- 
*(18) This group is the least racist: 
*(19) 68% of secular Israelis would not object to Arab neighbors, 
*(20) 73% percent would not object to Arab students in their children's classes. 
*(21) 50% think there should be no discrimination against Arabs in admissions to a workplace.

Russian immigrants are less radical, and closer to the secular Israelis in their outlook.

In a companion [[op-ed]], Levy wrote he expected that the [[New Israel Fund]], which has links to the Yisraeli Goldblum foundation, would be attacked for commissioning the survey. Levy noted that the results stated what Israelis already knew.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Levy [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/apartheid-without-shame-or-guilt.premium-1.471650 âApartheid without shame or guilt,â] at [[Haaretz]], 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
That afternoon [[HonestReporting]] gave a detailed critique of what it called Levyâs skewing of the poll data.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Plosker, [http://honestreporting.com/haaretz-creates-non-existent-apartheid-state/ âHaâaretz Creates Non-Existent Apartheid State,â ] at [[HonestReporting]], pp.1-2, 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, the ''Times of Israel'' also reported on problems with the poll.&lt;ref name="TOI2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Gabe|title= Controversial survey ostensibly highlights widespread anti-Arab attitudes in Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/survey-highlights-anti-arab-attitudes-in-israel/|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haaretz reported that the survey conductors said that perhaps the term "apartheid" was not clear enough to some interviewees.&lt;ref name=levipoll/&gt; Later in a press release [[Amiram Goldblum]], who commissioned the poll stood by Haaretzâs version, stating that âA large part of the Jewish population (58%) accepts the application of the term âapartheidâ to the current state of affairs in Israel.â Goldblum also acknowledged there were problems with the questions and methodology used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/haaretz-changes-tack-on-major-story-that-alleged-widespread-apartheid-attitudes-in-israel/ 'Haaretz changes tack on major story that alleged widespread âapartheidâ attitudes in Israel,'] at [[The Times of Israel]], October 30, 2012. Miller adds: âIt is, however, not clear what these respondents understand by the term as this question did not require clarificationâ.'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meretz]] leader [[Zehava Gal-On]] said that âIt is not surprising that following four years of Netanyahuâs government, most Israeli citizens support apartheidâ, and [[Jamal Zahalka]], leader of [[Balad (political party)|Balad]], said that Israel belonged to "the same family" as South Africa's apartheid regime.&lt;ref name=TOI1/&gt;

The conductors of the survey and critics of the poll suggested it was unclear what respondents understood with "apartheid", and that since a plurality of respondents opposed annexing the West Bank, it shouldn't be concluded that most Israelis support apartheid. Some critics said a question in the poll on apartheid was complex and problematically formulated.&lt;ref name=TOI1/&gt;

Maurice Ostroff, a past chairman of the Israel South Africa Chamber of Commerce and a pro-Israel commentator, said that the results of the poll reveals that a vast majority of Israelis are not racists, and that the level of racism in Israel is lower than in most Western countries and in the Arab world. He cited an [[Amnesty International]] study titled âChoice and prejudice â discrimination against Muslims in Europeâ, which found that public opinion in several European countries reflects [[Islamophobic]] views combined with racist attitudes. Another poll, he wrote, found that three-quarters of [[Qatari]]s would object to a non-Muslim neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-flip-side-of-the-israel-apartheid-poll/ The flip side of the Israel apartheid poll].

The government holiday schedule mainly benefits employees of government and government regulated businesses. At the discretion of the employer, other non-federal holidays such as [[Christmas Eve]] are common additions to the list of paid holidays.

Major [[Christianity|Christian]] holidays such as [[Christmas]] and [[Good Friday]] are officially observed, leave is permitted for other religious holidays as well. For example, some school children and employees take days off for [[Muslim holidays]], [[List of Hindu festivals|Hindu holidays]], or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] observances according to the [[Julian calendar]]. While not normally taken off work, [[Valentine's Day]], [[Halloween]], [[Mother's Day]], and [[Father's Day]] are traditionally observed by [[Tswana people|Batswana]].

==Public holidays==
A public holiday (also known as "stats" or "general" or "statutory" holiday) in Botswana is legislated through the parliament of Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/1766/Public%20Holidays%20Act.pdf|title=Botswana Public Holiday Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most workers, public and private, are entitled to take the day off with regular pay. However, some employers may require employees to work on such a holiday, but the employee must either receive a day off in lieu of the holiday or must be paid at a premium rate â usually 1Â½ (known as "time and a half") or twice (known as "double time") the regular pay for their time worked that day, in addition to the holiday pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bse.co.bw/holidays.php|title=BSE - Public Holidays and None Trading days|website=www.bse.co.bw|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holidays with religious and cultural significance ==
The religious and cultural holidays in Botswana are characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices.

=== Christian holidays ===
Some private businesses and certain other institutions are closed on Good Friday. The financial market and stock market is closed on Good Friday. Most retail stores remain open although some might close early. Public schools and most universities are closed on Good Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or part of spring break. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.

Many companies, including banks, malls, shopping centers and most private retail stores that normally open on Sundays are closed on [[Easter]].

The '''Punu''', or '''''Bapunu''''' (''Bapounou''), are a [[Bantu people|Bantu]] group of [[Central Africa]] and one of the four major peoples of [[Gabon]], inhabiting interior mountain and grassland areas in the southwest of the country, around the upper [[N'GouniÃ© River|N'GouniÃ©]] and [[Nyanga River]]s. Bapunu also live in the [[Divenie]], [[Kibangou]], and [[Mossendjo]] districts of the [[Republic of the Congo]]. They are linguistically related to the [[Eshira]].

Punu traditions record a migration from the south sometime before the 19th century, as a result of wars somewhere between the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Niari River]]. In the 19th century they gathered [[rubber]], and participated in the [[slavery|slave]] trade, sending both their own and acquisitions from further inland to [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] and [[Fernan Vaz]]. In the present day, the Punu are noted for their cloth made of [[Palm tree|palm]] fiber, and for [[iron]] weaponry.

The Punu were once called ''Bayaka'' by others, but they themselves consider this a pejorative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">A '''rÃ¨iteach''' (/ReËhdÊ²Éx/) was a [[betrothal]] ceremony in the older [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] culture of the [[Scottish highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Martin, 'The Gaelic rÃ¨iteach: symbolism and practice', ''Scottish Studies'' 34 (2000), 77â158&lt;/ref&gt; It is also attested in Gaelic-speaking [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward, ''Courtship, Love, and Marriage in Nineteenth-Century English Canada''. [https://books.google.de/books?id=AZyE1YVnydMC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=reiteach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirloOlwsbYAhVLzaQKHX7vDF0Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=reiteach&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The Gaelic word ''rÃ¨iteach'', which was written ''rÃ©iteach'' until the spelling reform, means "agreement", "settlement" or "reconciliation" generally, and "wedding arrangement" in particular. ''RÃ¨iteach'' also has the meanings "level place" and "disentangling", and the original meaning may have to do with the idea of clearing away obstacles.&lt;ref name="Faclair"&gt;http://www.faclair.com/&lt;/ref&gt; (''RÃ©iteach'' is also the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for "agreement" or "solution", but the Irish dictionaries make no mention of the ceremony.)

==Traditions==

The custom was still in practice in the first part of the 20th century, and involved the groom's party visiting the bride's house with an offer. &lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;Margaret Bennett, ''Scottish Customs: From the Cradle to the Grave''. [https://books.google.de/books?id=iba8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT111&amp;lpg=PT111&amp;dq=r%C3%A9iteach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BSwYjMLlfg&amp;sig=xemRDYDVdZ7XPbS0PRoN3xJUKjU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihu_bF0cXYAhXF2aQKHem7DxEQ6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=r%C3%A9iteach&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes the rÃ¨iteach was divided into two parts, ''an rÃ¨iteach beag'' (the small rÃ¨iteach) or ''a' chiad rÃ©iteach'' (the first rÃ¨iteach), which was more private and simple, and ''an rÃ¨iteach mÃ²r'' (the big rÃ©iteach), at which the details and practical issues were worked out.&lt;ref name="Faclair" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Referenced in chapter 14 of Iain Crichton Smith, "The Last summer". [https://books.google.de/books?id=uSs-CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=r%C3%A9iteach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_4t3XqcbYAhWQIewKHVCdCA84ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=r%C3%A9iteach&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''rÃ¨iteach mÃ²r'', the whole community would be present, and the bride and groom would reenact for them the commitment made at the ''rÃ¨iteach beag''.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;Alexander Fenton (ed), ''An Introduction to Scottish Ethnology''. [https://books.google.de/books?id=Mpm8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT318&amp;dq=r%C3%A8iteach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjExvKdscbYAhUSJewKHbSBAgMQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=r%C3%A8iteach&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one tradition the suitor would ask his prospective father-in-law for some gift, perhaps a boat or a cow, which was understood as a code for the daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Donald John Gillies, ''The Truth About St Kilda: An Islanderâs Memoir'' [https://books.google.de/books?id=rOgqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149&amp;dq=r%C3%A8iteach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjExvKdscbYAhUSJewKHbSBAgMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=r%C3%A8iteach&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; An informant from [[Harris, Scotland|Harris]] remembers:

:''He got up and said that he had heard that Jim [her father] had a ewe lamb that was inclinded to stray, and that he would be glad to take the ewe lamb off his hands and put it into a safer place, and that we wouldn't need to worry about the ewe lamb then because it would be in its own fold as it were. Jim replied 'Yes', he was quite happy to let him have the ewe lamb because he knew it was going into good hands.''&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt;

In another tradition, at the ''rÃ¨iteach mÃ²r'', the groom would be presented with a series of "false brides", whom he would have to reject politely until the real bride was offered.&lt;ref name="Fenton" /&gt;

==Literature and popular culture==

The custom has become known in the English-speaking world through the novel and films ''[[Whisky Galore (disambiguation)|Whisky Galore]]''. In both the 1949 film and the 2016 remake, the rÃ¨iteach is depicted as a ritual in which bride and groom drink whisky from a [[quaich]] in the presence of the whole community, after which there is drinking and dancing. The importance of whisky for the ceremony is a key element in the plot. In the original novel, [[Compton Mackenzie]] writes:

:'' 'Suppose the boat comes but the whisky doesn't, Father James?' Duncan asked. 'What ''rÃ¨iteach'' can anybody be having? It's against nature to have a ''rÃ¨iteach'' with tea and ginger-ale and lemonade. Even if there was plenty beer it would still be against nature.'''
:'' 'The fairies will bring up the whisky, Duncan,' Father James assured him solemnly.''&lt;ref&gt;Compton Mackenzie, ''Whisky Galore'', 1947, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 the Gaelic playwright [[Iain N. MacLeÃ²id]] produced a play entitled ''RÃ©iteach MÃ³raig'' (Morag's rÃ¨iteach), a companion to his play ''PÃ²sadh MÃ³raig'' (Morag's wedding).&lt;ref&gt;See entry on Gaelic Wikipedia. [https://gd.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_N._MacLe%C3%B2id]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish [[Celtic rock]] group [[Runrig]] have a song entitled "A reiteach" in their 2008 live album ''[[Year of the Flood]]''.

'''Sardinian''' or '''Sard''' (''sardu'' {{IPA-srd|ËsaÉ¾du|}}, ''limba sarda'' {{IPA-srd|Ëlimba ËzaÉ¾da|}} or ''lÃ­ngua sarda'' {{IPA-srd|ËliÅÉ¡u.a ËzaÉ¾da|}}) is the primary [[Indigenous language|indigenous]] [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken by the [[Sardinians]] on most of the island of [[Sardinia]]. It is considered one of the closest genealogical descendants, if not the closest, to [[Latin]] by many Romance linguists.&lt;ref&gt;'' L'Aventure des langues en Occident '', Henriette Walter, Le Livre de poche, Paris, 1994, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Romance languages |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romance-languages |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also incorporates a Pre-Latin (mostly [[Paleo-Sardinian language|Paleo-Sardinian]] and, to a much lesser degree, [[Punic language|Punic]]) [[Stratum (linguistics)#substratum|substratum]],&lt;ref&gt;Mele, Antonio. ''Termini prelatini della lingua sarda tuttora vivi nell'uso''. Edizioni Ilienses, Olzai&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Byzantine Greek]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] [[superstratum]] due to the political membership of the island, which became a Byzantine possession followed by a significant period of [[Giudicati|self-rule]], fell into the Iberian sphere of influence in the [[late Middle Ages]], and eventually into the Italian one in the 18th century.

In 1997, Sardinian was recognized by a regional law,&lt;ref name="Legge Regionale 15 ottobre 1997" /&gt; along with other languages spoken on the island; since 1999, Sardinian is also one of the twelve "historical [[Minority language|language minorities]]" of Italy, being granted recognition by the national [https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/L._15_dicembre_1999,_n._482_-_Norme_in_materia_di_tutela_delle_minoranze_linguistiche_storiche Law no. 482/1999].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|title=Legge 482|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vitality of the Sardinian-speaking community is threatened and [[UNESCO]] classifies the language as "definitely [[Endangered language|endangered]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/ "Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger"], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; although an estimated 68.4 percent of the islanders report to have a good oral command of Sardinian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/documenti/7_88_20070514130939.pdf Oppo, Anna. ''Le lingue dei sardi'', p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; While the level of language competence is in fact relatively high among the older generation beyond retirement age, it has been estimated to have dropped to around 13 percent among children, with Sardinian being kept as a [[heritage language]].&lt;ref name="Maxia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Euromosaic"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sardinian language use survey, 1995|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/sard/an/e1/e1.html|publisher=Euromosaic}} To access the data, click on List by languages, Sardinian, then scroll to "Sardinian language use survey".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{quote|Now the question arises as to whether Sardinian is to be considered a dialect or a language in its own right. Politically speaking,&lt;ref name="specification"&gt;It is to be noted on that matter that Wagner conducted academic research in 1951; it took in fact another forty years for Sardinian to be politically recognized, at least formally, as one of Italy's twelve [[minority language]]s by the Law no.482/99.&lt;/ref&gt; it is clearly one of the many dialects&lt;ref name="specification" /&gt; of Italy, just like the [[Serbo-Croatian]] and the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] spoken in various villages of [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]]. However, from a linguistic point of view, that is a different question. It can be said that Sardinian has no relationship whatsoever with any dialect of mainland Italy; it is an archaic Romance speech with its own distinctive characteristics, showing a very original vocabulary in addition to morphology and syntax rather different from the Italian dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Original version (in [[Italian language|Italian]]): ''Sorge ora la questione se il sardo si deve considerare come un dialetto o come una lingua. Ã evidente che esso Ã¨, politicamente, uno dei tanti dialetti dellâItalia, come lo Ã¨ anche, p. es., il serbo-croato o lâalbanese parlato in vari paesi della Calabria e della Sicilia. Ma dal punto di vista linguistico la questione assume un altro aspetto. Non si puÃ² dire che il sardo abbia una stretta parentela con alcun dialetto dellâitaliano continentale; Ã¨ un parlare romanzo arcaico e con proprie spiccate caratteristiche, che si rivelano in un vocabolario molto originale e in una morfologia e sintassi assai differenti da quelle dei dialetti italiani.''&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Max Leopold Wagner]], ''La lingua sarda'', 1951 â Ilisso, pp. 90â91}}

A 1949 study by Italian-American linguist [[Mario Pei]], analyzing the degree of difference from a language's parent ([[Latin]], in the case of [[Romance languages]]) by comparing [[phonology]], [[inflection]], [[syntax]], [[vocabulary]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], indicated the following percentages (the higher the percentage, the greater the distance from Latin):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Story of Language |last=Pei |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Pei |year=1949 |isbn=03-9700-400-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardinian 8%, [[Italian language|Italian]] 12%, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 20%, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] 23.5%, [[Occitan language|Occitan]] 25%, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] 31%, and [[French language|French]] 44%. For example, Latin "''Pone mihi tres panes in bertula''" (put three loaves of bread [from home] in the bag for me) would be the very similar "''Ponemi tres panes in bertula''" in Sardinian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mclink.it/com/lol/sardegna/g_tour/bri_i.htm ''Sardegna, isola del silenzio'', Manlio Brigaglia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of Sardinia}}
Sardinia's relative isolation from mainland Europe encouraged the development of a Romance language preserving traces of its indigenous, pre-Roman language(s). The language is posited to have substratal influences from [[Paleo-Sardinian language]], which some scholars have linked to [[Basque language|Basque]]&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, ed. 2010. ''Paleosardo: Le radici linguistiche della Sardegna neolitica'' (Paleosardo: The Linguistic Roots of Neolithic Sardinian). De Gruyter Mouton&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].&lt;ref name="pittau.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittau.it/libri/LNurEtr.html|title=Massimo Pittau â La lingua dei Sardi Nuragici e degli Etruschi|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|Adstratal]] influences include [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]. The situation of Sardinian language with regard to the politically dominant ones did not change until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Rosita"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8J7ilk0bAgC&amp;pg=PA271 |title=Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance |editor-last=Posner |editor-first=Rebecca |editor-last2=Green |editor-first2=John N. |date=1993 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110117240 |last=Rindler-Schjerve |first=Rosita  |language=en |chapter=Sardinian : Italian |pages=271â294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ministero"&gt;[http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/sardo/ Minoranze linguistiche, Sardo. Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins, Prenuragic and Nuragic era===
{{see also|Paleo-Sardinian language|Nuragic civilization}}
The origins of the Paleo-Sardinian language are currently not known. Research has attempted to discover obscure, indigenous, pre-Romance [[Root (linguistics)|roots]]; the root ''s(a)rd'', present in many place names and denoting the [[Sardinians|island's people]], is reportedly from the [[Sherden]] (one of the [[Sea Peoples]]), although this assertion is hotly debated.

In 1984, Massimo Pittau said he found in the [[Etruscan language]] the [[etymology]] of many Latin words after comparing it with the [[Nuragic language|Nuragic]] language(s).&lt;ref name="pittau.it"/&gt; Etruscan elements, formerly thought to have originated in Latin, would indicate a connection between the ancient Sardinian culture and the Etruscans. According to Pittau, the Etruscan and Nuragic language(s) are descended from [[Lydian language|Lydian]] (and therefore [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) as a consequence of contact with Etruscans and other [[Tyrrhenians]] from [[Sardis]] as described by [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name="pittau.it"/&gt; Although Pittau suggests that the Tirrenii landed in Sardinia and the Etruscans landed in modern [[Tuscany]], his views are not shared by most Etruscologists.

According to Alberto Areddu&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Areddu, ''Le origini albanesi della civiltÃ  in Sardegna: Gli appellativi. Sostratismi e correlazioni sardo-albanesi'' (Naples: Autorinediti, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sherden]] were of Illyrian origin, on the basis of some lexical elements, unanimously acknowledged as belonging to the indigenous substrate. Areddu asserts that ancient Sardinians, especially those from the most interior areas (Barbagia and Ogliastra), supposedly spoke a particular branch of Indo-European. There are in fact some correspondences, both formal and semantic, with the few testimonies of Illyrian (or Thracian) languages, and above all with their claimed linguistical continuer, [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. He finds such correlations: Sard. ''eni'', ''enis'', ''eniu'' "yew" = Alb. ''enjÃ«'' "yew"; Sard. ''urtzula'' "clematis" = Alb. ''urth'' "ivy"; Sard. ''rethi'' "tendril" = Alb. ''rrypthi'' "tendril".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eltonvarfi.blogspot.com/2009/08/due-nomi-di-piante-che-ci-legano-agli.html ''Due nomi di piante che ci legano agli albanesi'', Alberto Areddu. L'enigma della lingua albanese]&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered some correlations with the Balkan bird world.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Areddu, ''Uccelli nuragici e non nella Sardegna di oggi'', Seattle 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertoldi and Terracini, Paleo-Sardinian has similarities with the [[Iberic language]]s and [[Siculi]]an; for example, the suffix -''ara'' in [[proparoxytone]]s indicated the plural. Terracini proposed the same for suffixes in -''{{IPA|/Ã na/}}'', -/''Ã nna''/, -/''Ã©nna''/, -/''Ã²nna''/ + ''{{IPA|/r/}}'' + a [[paragogic]] vowel (such as the [[Toponymy|toponym]] ''[[Bonnanaro|BunnÃ nnaru]]''). Rohlfs, Butler and Craddock add the suffix -''{{IPA|/ini/}}'' (such as the toponym ''[[Barumini|BarÃ¹mini]]'') as a unique element of Paleo-Sardinian. Suffixes in /''a'', ''e'', ''o'', ''u''/ + -''rr''- found a correspondence in [[north Africa]] (Terracini), in the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] (Blasco Ferrer) and in [[southern Italy]] and [[Gascony]] (Rohlfs), with a closer relationship to Basque (Wagner and Hubschmid). However, these early links to a [[Aquitanian language|Basque precursor]] have been questioned by some Basque linguists.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Terracini, suffixes in -''{{IPA|/Ã i/}}'', -''{{IPA|/Ã©i/}}'', -''{{IPA|/Ã²i/}}'', and -''{{IPA|/Ã¹i/}}'' are common to Paleo-Sardinian and [[Berber languages|northern African languages]]. Pittau emphasized that this concerns terms originally ending in an accented vowel, with an attached paragogic vowel; the suffix resisted Latinization in some place names, which show a Latin body and a Nuragic [[:wikt:desinence|suffix]]. According to Bertoldi, some toponyms ending in -''{{IPA|/Ã i/}}'' and -/''asÃ i''/ indicated an Anatolian influence. The suffix -/''aiko''/, widely used in Iberia and possibly of Celtic origin, and the ethnic suffix in -/''itanos''/ and -/''etanos''/ (for example, the Sardinian ''Sulcitanos'') have also been noted as Paleo-Sardinian elements (Terracini, Ribezzo, Wagner, Hubschmid and Faust).

Linguists Blasco Ferrer (2009, 2010), Morvan (2009) and Arregi (2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanuovasardegna.it/tempo-libero/2017/12/21/news/quel-filo-che-lega-i-sardi-con-i-baschi-1.16269342 ''Â«Quel filo che lega i sardi con i baschiÂ»'', La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt;) have attempted to revive a theoretical connection with Basque by linking words such as Sardinian ''ospile'' "fresh grazing for cattle" and Basque ''ozpil''; Sardinian ''arrotzeri'' "vagabond" and Basque ''arrotz'' "stranger"; Sardinian ''galostiu'' and Basque ''gorostoi''; Gallurese (Corso-Sardinian) ''zerru'' "pig" and Basque ''zerri''. [[Sardinian people#Genetic peculiarities of the population|Genetic data]] on the distribution of HLA antigens have suggested a common origin for the [[Basque people|Basques]] and [[Sardinian people|Sardinians]].&lt;ref name=Arnaiz-Villena&gt;Arnaiz-Villena A, Rodriguez de CÃ³rdoba S, Vela F, Pascual JC, CerverÃ³ J, Bootello A. â HLA antigens in a sample of the Spanish population: common features among Spaniards, Basques, and Sardinians. â Hum Genet. 1981;58(3):344-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanuovasardegna.it/tempo-libero/2017/12/21/news/il-genetista-conferma-le-origini-comuni-1.16269258 ''Il genetista conferma le origini comuni tra i sardi e i baschi'', La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Neolithic period, some degree of variance across the island's regions is also attested. The [[Arzachena culture]], for instance, suggests a link between the northernmost Sardinian region ([[Gallura]]) and [[southern Corsica]] that finds further confirmation in the [[Naturalis Historia]] by [[Pliny the Elder]]. There are also some stylistic differences across Northern and Southern Nuragic Sardinia, which may indicate the existence of two other tribal groups ([[Balares]] and [[Ilienses]]) mentioned by the same Roman author. According to the archeologist Giovanni Ugas,&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas â L'alba dei Nuraghi (2005) pg.241&lt;/ref&gt; these tribes may have in fact played a role in shaping the current regional linguistic differences of the island.

===Roman period===
{{see also|Corsica and Sardinia}}
Although [[History of Sardinia#Roman Empire|Roman]] domination, which began in 238 {{sm|b.c.}}, brought [[Latin]] to Sardinia, it was unable to completely supplant the pre-Latin Sardinian languages, including [[Punic language|Punic]], which continued to be spoken in the {{sm|a.d.}} 4th century as attested by votive inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Putzu, âLa posizione linguistica del sardo nel contesto mediterraneoâ, in ''Neues aus der Bremer Linguistikwerkstatt: aktuelle Themen und Projekte'', ed. Cornelia Stroh (Bochum: UniversitÃ¤tsverlag Dr. N. Brockmeyer, 2012), 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Some obscure Nuragic roots remained unchanged, and in many cases the Latin accepted local roots (like ''nur'', which makes its appearance in [[nuraghe]], ''[[Nurra]]'', ''[[Nurri]]'' and many other toponyms). [[Barbagia]], the mountainous central region of the island, derives its name from the Latin ''Barbaria'' (a term meaning "Land of the Barbarians", similar in origin to the ''[[Barbary]]'' word), because its people refused cultural and linguistic assimilation for a long time: 50% of toponyms of central Sardinia, particularly in the territory of [[Olzai]], are actually not related to any known language.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf H. J., 1998, ''Toponomastica barbaricina'', p.20 Papiros publisher, Nuoro&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the place names, on the island there are still a few names of plants, animals and geological formations directly traceable to the ancient Nuragic era.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner M.L., D.E.S. â ''Dizionario etimologico sardo'', DES, Heidelberg, 1960â64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] called the Sardinian rebels ''latrones mastrucati'' ("thieves with rough wool cloaks") to emphasize Roman superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/scauro.shtml|title=Cicero: Pro Scauro|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the long Roman domination Latin gradually become however the speech of the majority of the island's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Casula, Francesco Cesare (1994). La Storia di Sardegna. Sassari, it: Carlo Delfino Editore. {{ISBN|978-88-7138-084-1}}. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this process of [[Romanization (cultural)|romanization]] the Sardinian language is today classified as Romance or neo-Latin, with some phonetic features resembling [[Old Latin]]. [[Classification of Romance languages#The standard proposal|Some linguists]] assert that modern Sardinian, being part of the Island Romance group,&lt;ref name="Koryakov" /&gt; was the first language to split off from Latin, all others evolving from Latin as Continental Romance.

At that time, the only literature being produced in Sardinia was mostly in Latin: the native (Paleo-Sardinian) and non-native (Punic) pre-Roman languages were then already extinct (the last Punic inscription in Bithia, southern Sardinia, is from the second or third century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Barreca F.(1988), ''La civiltÃ  fenicio-punica in Sardegna'', Carlo Delfino Editore, Sassari&lt;/ref&gt;). Some engraved poems in ancient Greek and Latin (the two most prestigious languages in the [[Roman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;''Cum utroque sermone nostro sis paratus.'' Svetonio, De vita Caesarum, Divus Claudius, 42&lt;/ref&gt;) are to be seen in Viper Cave, Cagliari, ('' Grutta 'e sa Pibera '' in Sardinian, ''Grotta della Vipera'' in Italian, ''Cripta Serpentum'' in Latin), a burial monument built by Lucius Cassius Philippus (a Roman who had been exiled to Sardinia) in remembrance of his dead spouse Atilia Pomptilla. We also have some religious works by [[Lucifer of Cagliari|Saint Lucifer]] and [[Eusebius of Vercelli|Eusebius]], both from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]).

Although Sardinia was culturally influenced and politically ruled by the [[Byzantine Empire]] for almost five centuries, Greek did not enter the language except for some ritual or formal expressions in Sardinian using Greek structure and, sometimes, the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wescher e M. Blancard, ''Charte sarde de lâabbaye de Saint-Victor de Marseille Ã©crite en caractÃ¨res grecs'', in "BibliothÃ¨que de lâ Ãcole des chartes", 35 (1874), pp. 255â265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/files/documenti/pubblicazioni_pdf/bss3/01Soddu-Crasta-Strinna.pdf Unâinedita carta sardo-greca del XII secolo nellâArchivio Capitolare di Pisa, di Alessandro Soddu â Paola Crasta â Giovanni Strinna]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this is found in the ''[[condaghe]]s'', the first written documents in Sardinian. From the long Byzantine era there are only a few entries but they already provide a glimpse of the sociolinguistical situation on the island in which, in addition to the community's everyday Neo-Latin language, Greek was also spoken by the ruling classes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giulio Paulis, ''Lingua e cultura nella Sardegna Bizantina'', Sassari, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Some toponyms, such as [[Jerzu]] (thought to derive from the Greek ''khÃ©rsos'', "untilled"), together with the personal names Mikhaleis, Konstantine and Basilis, demonstrate Greek influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Condaghe Silki.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[condaghe]] of Saint Peter of Silki (1065-1180), written in Sardinian.]]As the [[Muslims]] [[History of Islam in southern Italy|conquered southern Italy and Sicily]], communications broke down between [[Constantinople]] and Sardinia, whose districts became progressively more autonomous from the Byzantine [[oecumene]] (Greek: Î¿á¼°ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·). Sardinia was then brought back into the Latin cultural sphere.

[[Dante Alighieri]] wrote in his 1302â05 essay ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' that [[Sardinians]], not being [[Italians]] (''Latii'') and having no ''lingua vulgaris'' of their own, resorted to aping Latin instead.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/dante/vulgar.shtml ''Dantis Alagherii De Vulgari Eloquentia Liber Primus'', The Latin Library]: Sardos etiam, qui non Latii sunt sed Latiis associandi videntur, eiciamus, quoniam soli sine proprio vulgari esse videntur, gramaticam tanquam simie homines imitantes: nam domus nova et dominus meus locuntur.

===Aragonese period â [[Catalan language|Catalan]] influence===
{{See also|History of Sardinia#Kingdom of the Crown of Aragon|l1=Kingdom of the Crown of Aragon}}
The 1297 [[feoffment]] of Sardinia by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] led to the creation of the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and a long period of war between the Aragonese and Sardinians, ending with a Aragonese [[Battle of Sanluri|victory at Sanluri]] in 1409 and the renunciation of any succession right signed by [[William III of Narbonne]] in 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Cesare Casula, ''La storia di Sardegna'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the clergy adopted [[Catalan language|Catalan]] as their primary language, relegating Sardinian to a secondary status. According to attorney Sigismondo Arquer (Cagliari, 1530 â Toledo, 4 giugno 1571), author of ''Sardiniae brevis historia et descriptio'' in [[Sebastian MÃ¼nster]]'s [[Cosmographia (Sebastian MÃ¼nster)|Cosmographia Universalis]], Sardinian prevailed in rural areas and Catalan was spoken in the cities, where the ruling class eventually became bilingual in both languages;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/files/documenti/pubblicazioni_pdf/cfsarquer/05edizione.pdf Sigismondo Arquer (edited by Maria Teresa Laneri, 2008). ''Sardiniae brevis historia et descriptio'', CUEC, pg.30, ''De Sardorum Lingua'']. &lt;&lt;Certainly, the Sardinians had once their own language, however since many peoples immigrated to the island and it fell under the rule of many foreign powers (namely Latins, Pisans, Genoese, Spanish and Africans), the language of the Sardinians became extremely corrupted; nonetheless, a number of words which have no equivalent in any other language have been preserved. [...] Because of this, the Sardinians speak in a very different way depending on where they live, since they have been under many diverse dominations; however, they manage to understand each other perfectly. On the island are two main languages, the first in the cities and the latter out of their reach. People from the cities commonly speak Spanish, Tarragonese or Catalan, which they learnt from the Spaniards, who also occupy much of the official positions; the others, on the other hand, retain the genuine language of the Sardinians.&gt;&gt; Original text: &lt;&lt;Habuerunt quidem Sardi linguam propriam, sed quum diversi populi immigraverint in eam atque ab exteris principibus eius imperium usurpatum fuerit, nempe Latinis, Pisanis, Genuensibus, Hispanis et Afris, corrupta fuit multum lingua eorum, relictis tamen plurimis vocabulis, quae in nullo inveniuntur idiomate. [...] Hinc est quod Sardi in diversis locis tam diverse loquuntur, iuxta quod tam varium habuerunt imperium, etiamsi ipsi mutuo sese recte intelligant. Sunt autem duae praecipuae in ea insula linguae, una qua utuntur in civitatibus, et altera qua extra civitates. Oppidani loquuntur fere lingua Hispanica, Tarraconensi seu Catalana, quam didicerunt ab Hispanis, qui plerumque magistratum in eisdem gerunt civitatibus: alii vero genuinam retinent Sardorum Linguam.&gt;&gt; Sigismondo, Arquer (1549). ''Sardiniae brevis historia et descriptio'', ''De Sardorum Lingua''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alghero]] is still a Catalan-speaking enclave on Sardinia to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prosodia.upf.edu/coalgueres/en/algueres.html Why is Catalan spoken in L'Alguer? â Corpus Oral de l'AlguerÃ¨s]&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-lasting war and the so-called [[Black Death]] had a devastating effect on the island, depopulating large parts of it. People from the neighbouring island of Corsica began to settle in the northern Sardinian coast, leading to the birth of the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]]-sounding [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] and [[Gallurese language|Gallurese]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Maxia, Studi Sardo-Corsi, Dialettologia e storia della lingua fra le due isole&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxia-mail.doomby.com/medias/files/atti-convegno-palau-2014-def.pdf Ciurrata di la linga gadduresa, Atti del II Convegno Internazionale di Studi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Catalan being widely spoken and written on the island at this time (leaving a lasting influence in Sardinian), there are some written records of Sardinian. One is the 15th-century ''Sa Vitta et sa Morte, et Passione de sanctu Gavinu, Brothu et Ianuariu'', written by AntÃ²ni Canu (1400â1476) and published in 1557: ''Tando su rey Barbaru, su cane renegadu / de custa resposta multu restayt iradu / et issu martiriu fetit apparigiare / Itu su quale fetit fortemente ligare / sos sanctos martires cum bonas catenas / qui li segaant sos ossos cum sas veinas / et totu sas carnes cum petenes de linu... ''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfsmanca/03edizione.pdf Antonio Cano (Edited by Dino Manca, 2002). ''Sa Vitta et sa Morte, et Passione de sanctu Gavinu, Prothu et Januariu'', pg.29, CUEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century is instead marked by a new Sardinian literary revival: ''Rimas Spirituales'', by [[Gerolamo Araolla|Hieronimu Araolla]],&lt;ref name="sardegnaculletorigini"&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/j/v/258?s=20328&amp;v=2&amp;c=2695&amp;t=7 '' Lingua sarda, Letteratura, Dalle origini al '700 ''. Sardegna Cultura]&lt;/ref&gt; was aimed at "glorifying and enriching Sardinian, our language" (''magnificare et arrichire sa limba nostra sarda'') as [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[French people|French]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] poets had already done for their languages (''la Deffense et illustration de la langue franÃ§oyse'' and ''il Dialogo delle lingue'').&lt;ref name="Rosita"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Incipit]] to "Lettera al Maestro" in "La Sardegna e la Corsica", Ines Loi Corvetto, Torino, UTET Libreria, 1993: ''Semper happisi desiggiu, Illustrissimu Segnore, de magnificare, &amp; arrichire sa limba nostra Sarda; dessa matessi manera qui sa naturale insoro tottu sas naciones dessu mundu hant magnificadu &amp; arrichidu; comente est de vider per isos curiosos de cuddas.''&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Lo Frasso, a poet born in [[Alghero]]&lt;ref name="Arce"&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/906360.pdf J. Arce, La literatura hispÃ¡nica de CerdeÃ±a]. Revista de la Facultad de FilologÃ­a, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; (a city he remembered fondly)&lt;ref&gt;''&amp;nbsp;... L'Alguer castillo fuerte bien murado / con frutales por tierra muy divinos / y por la mar coral fino eltremado / es ciudad de mas de mil vezinos...&lt;/ref&gt; who spent his life in [[Barcelona]], wrote [[lyric poetry]] in Sardinian:&lt;ref&gt;''Los diez libros de fortuna d'Amor'' (1573)&lt;/ref&gt;
&amp;nbsp;... ''Non podende sufrire su tormentu / de su fogu ardente innamorosu. / Videndemi foras de sentimentu / et sensa una hora de riposu, / pensende istare liberu e contentu / m'agato pius aflitu e congoixosu, / in essermi de te senora apartadu, / mudende ateru quelu, ateru istadu&amp;nbsp;...''.

===[[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg period]] â [[Spanish language|Spanish]] influence===
Through the marriage of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in 1469 and, later in 1624, the reorganization of the monarchy led by the [[Gaspar de GuzmÃ¡n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]], Sardinia would progressively join a broad Spanish cultural sphere and leave the exclusive [[Aragon]]ese one. Spanish was perceived as an elitist language, gaining solid ground among the ruling Sardinian class; Spanish had thus a profound influence on Sardinian, especially in those words, styles and cultural models owing to the prestigious international role of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] as well as the [[Court (royal)|Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacinto Arnal de Bolea (1636), El Forastero,  Antonio Galcerin editor, Cagliari - "....ofreciÃ©ndonos a la vista la insigne ciudad de CÃ ller, corte que me dixeron era de aquel reino. ....La hermosura de las damas, el buen gusto de su alino, lo prendido y bien saconado de lo curioso-dandole vida con mil donaires-, la grandeza en los titulos, el lucimientos en los cavalleros, el concurso grande de la nobleza y el agasajo para un forastero no os los podrÃ  zifrar mi conocimiento.

What frightens you? Have you never seen some people gathering?â; Shepherd (in Sardinian): âAre you asking me if I'm married?â; Citizen (in Spanish): âYou're not getting a grasp of what I say, do you? Oh, what an idiot shepherd!â; Shepherd (in Sardinian): âI'm actually thirsty and tiredâ; Citizen (in Spanish): âI'd better speak in Sardinian so that we understand each other better. (in Sardinian) Tell me, shepherd, where are you from?â; Shepherd: âI'm from Suelli, my lord, Iâve been ordered to bring my lord a presentâ; Citizen: âAh, now you understand what I said, don't you!ââ.

A 1620 proclamation is in the [[Bosa]] archives.&lt;ref&gt;''Jn Dei nomine Amen, noverint comente sende personalmente constituidos in presensia mia notariu et de sos testimongios infrascrittos sa viuda Caterina Casada et Coco mugere fuit de su Nigola Casada jÃ ganu, Franziscu Casada et Joanne Casada Frades, filios de su dittu Nigola et Caterina Casada de sa presente cittade faguinde custas cosas gratis e de certa sciensia insoro, non per forza fraudu, malÃ¬ssia nen ingannu nen pro nexuna attera sinistra macchinassione cun tottu su megius modu chi de derettu poden et deven, attesu et cunsideradu chi su dittu Nigola Casada esseret siguida dae algunos corpos chi li dein de notte, pro sa quale morte fettin querella et reclamo contra sa persona de Pedru Najtana, pro paura de sa justissia, si ausentait, in sa quale aussensia est dae unu annu pattinde multos dannos, dispesas, traballos e disusios.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savoyard period and Kingdom of Italy===
{{See also|History of Sardinia#Piedmont-Sardinia|l1=Piedmontese period}}
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] gave Sardinia to [[Austria]], whose sovereignty was confirmed by the 1713â14 treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]]. In 1717 a Spanish fleet [[Spanish conquest of Sardinia|reoccupied]] [[Cagliari]], and the following year Sardinia was ceded to [[Victor Amadeus II of Savoy]] in exchange for [[Sicily]]. This transfer would not initially entail any social nor linguistic changes, though: Sardinia would still retain for a long time its Hispanic character, so much so that only in 1767 were the Aragonese and Spanish dynastic symbols replaced by the Savoyard cross.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lepori, ''Dalla Spagna ai Savoia. Ceti e corona della Sardegna del Settecento'' (Rome, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

And just along the lines of what had been theorized and put into effect in favour of the Italian nation, that was successfully completing the process of linguistic unification by elevating the Florentine dialect to the role of "national language", so in Sardinia the long-desired "Sardinian national language" was given the name of "illustrious Sardinian".&gt;&gt; Original: &lt;&lt;[...] Ciononostante le due opere dello Spano sono di straordinaria importanza, in quanto aprirono in Sardegna la discussione sul ''problema della lingua sarda'', quella che sarebbe dovuta essere la lingua unificata ed unificante, che si sarebbe dovuta imporre in tutta l'isola sulle particolaritÃ  dei singoli dialetti e suddialetti, la lingua della nazione sarda, con la quale la Sardegna intendeva inserirsi tra le altre nazioni europee, quelle che nell'Ottocento avevano giÃ  raggiunto o stavano per raggiungere la loro attuazione politica e culturale, compresa la nazione italiana. E proprio sulla falsariga di quanto era stato teorizzato ed anche attuato a favore della nazione italiana, che nell'Ottocento stava per portare a termine il processo di unificazione linguistica, elevando il dialetto fiorentino e toscano al ruolo di "lingua nazionale", chiamandolo ''italiano illustre'', anche in Sardegna l'auspicata ''lingua nazionale sarda'' fu denominata ''sardo illustre''"&gt;&gt;.

Original: "Dovendosi per tali insegnamenti (scuole inferiori) adoperare fra le lingue piÃ¹ colte quella che Ã¨ meno lontana dal materno dialetto ed a un tempo la piÃ¹ corrispondente alle pubbliche convenienze, si Ã¨ determinato di usare nelle scuole predette l'italiana, siccome quella appunto che non essendo piÃ¹ diversa dalla sarda di quello fosse la castigliana, poichÃ© anzi la maggior parte dei sardi piÃ¹ colti giÃ  la possiede; resta altresÃ¬ la piÃ¹ opportuna per maggiormente agevolare il commercio ed aumentare gli scambievoli comodi; ed i Piemontesi che verranno nel Regno, non avranno a studiare una nuova lingua per meglio abituarsi al servizio pubblico e dei sardi, i quali in tal modo potranno essere impiegati anche nel continente.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girolamo Sotgiu (1984), Storia della Sardegna Sabauda, Editori Laterza&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish was thus replaced as the official language and Sardinian faced again marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/j/v/258?s=20329&amp;v=2&amp;c=2695&amp;t=7 ''La lingua sarda, Letteratura, Il Settecento''.

Manuals of Romance Linguistics, De Gruyter Mouton, pp.209-210&lt;/ref&gt; the plurisecular Iberian period contributed in making the Sardinians feel more detached from the Italian language and its cultural sphere, and the Spanish themselves, comprising both the Aragonese and Castilian ruling class, long considered already Sardinian to be a distinct language with respect to their own tongues and Italian as well.&lt;ref name="sardgruyter" /&gt; At the time, Italian was a foreign language to the Sardinians.&lt;ref&gt;"Italian is as familiar to me as Latin, French or other foreign languages which one only partially learns through grammar study and the books, without fully getting the hang of them"[...] (Original: [...]"Ã tanto nativa per me la lingua italiana, come la latina, francese o altre forestiere che solo sâimparano in parte colla grammatica, uso e frequente lezione deâ libri, ma non si possiede appieno"[...]) said Andrea Manca DellâArca, agronomist from Sassari at the end of the 17th century (Ricordi di Santu Lussurgiu di Francesco Maria Porcu In Santu Lussurgiu dalle Origini alla "Grande Guerra" â Grafiche editoriali Solinas â Nuoro, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Baudi di Vesme ([[Cuneo]], 1809 â [[Turin]], 1877) claimed that the suppression of Sardinian and the imposition of Italian was desirable in order to make the islanders "civilized Italians".&lt;ref&gt;"It would be a great innovation, with regard to both the civilizing process in Sardinia and the public education, to ban the Sardinian dialects in every social and ecclesiastical activity, mandating the use of the Italian language... It is also necessary to eradicate the Sardinian dialect [''sic''] and introduce Italian even for other good reasons; that is, to civilize that nation [referring to Sardinia], in order for it to comprehend the instructions and commands from the Government... (Carlo Baudi di Vesme, ''Political and economical considerations on Sardinia'', 1848)" Original: "Una innovazione in materia di incivilimento della Sardegna e dâistruzione pubblica, che sotto vari aspetti sarebbe importantissima, si Ã¨ quella di proibire severamente in ogni atto pubblico civile non meno che nelle funzioni ecclesiastiche, tranne le prediche, lâuso dei dialetti sardi, prescrivendo lâesclusivo impiego della lingua italianaâ¦ Ã necessario inoltre scemare lâuso del dialetto sardo ed introdurre quello della lingua italiana anche per altri non men forti motivi; ossia per incivilire alquanto quella nazione, sÃ¬ affinchÃ© vi siano piÃ¹ universalmente comprese le istruzioni e gli ordini del Governo&amp;nbsp;... " (Carlo Baudi di Vesme, ''Considerazioni politiche ed economiche sulla Sardegna'', 1848)&lt;/ref&gt; a basic primary education was thus offered exclusively through Italian, importing solely Italian-speaking teachers from the mainland, and Piedmontese cartographers replaced many Sardinian place names with Italian ones. Eventually, Sardinian came to be perceived as ''sa limba de su famine'' / ''sa lingua de su famini'', literally translating into English as "the language of hunger" (i.e. the language of the poor), and Sardinian parents strongly supported the teaching of the new tongue to their children, since they saw it as the portal to escaping from a poverty-stricken, rural, isolated and underprivileged life.

Despite the assimilation policy the anthem of the Savoyard [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Sardinia]] was ''[[S'hymnu sardu nationale]]'' ("the Sardinian National Anthem"), also known as ''Cunservet Deus su Re'' ("God save the King"), with Sardinian lyrics first in Campidanese and then Logudorese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilisso.com/inno/innonazionalesardo.pdf Il primo inno d'Italia Ã¨ sardo]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mobilization for [[World War I]], the [[Italian Army]] compelled all [[Sardinians]] to enlist as Italian subjects and established the [[Brigata Sassari|Sassari Infantry Brigade]] on 1 March 1915 at [[Tempio Pausania]] and [[Sinnai]]. Unlike the other infantry brigades of Italy, Sassari's conscripts were only Sardinians (including many officers). It is currently the only unit in Italy with an anthem in a language other than Italian: ''Dimonios'' ("Devils"), written in 1994 by Luciano Sechi. Its title derives from ''Rote Teufel'' ([[German language|German]] for "red devils"). However, [[compulsory military service]] played a role in language shift.

Under [[Fascism]], all languages other than Italian were banned, including Sardinia's improvised poetry competitions in Sardinian,&lt;ref&gt;L. Marroccu, ''Il ventennio fascista''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Farinelli, ''The Invisible Motherland?

After [[World War II]], awareness around the Sardinian language and the danger of its slipping away did not seem to concern the Sardinian elites and entered the political spaces much later than in other European peripheries marked by the long-standing presence of ethno-linguistic minorities;&lt;ref&gt;Pala, Carlo (2016).

There have been many campaigns, often expressed in the form of political demands from the late '60s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/180542 ''Manuale di linguistica sarda'' (Manual of Sardinian linguistics)], 2017, Ed. by Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Peter Koch, Daniela Marzo.

Sanna sulla pronuncia della FacoltÃ  di Lettere in relazione alla difesa del patrimonio etnico-linguistico sardo. Il prof.Antonio Sanna fa a questo proposito una dichiarazione: &lt;&lt;Gli indifferenti problemi della scuola, sempre affrontati in Sardegna in torma empirica, appaiono oggi assai particolari e non risolvibili in un generico quadro nazionale; il tatto stesso che la scuola sia diventata scuola di massa comporta il rifiuto di una didattica inadeguata, in quanto basata sull'apprendimento concettuale attraverso una lingua, per molti aspetti estranea al tessuto culturale sardo. PoichÃ© esiste un popolo sardo con una propria lingua dai caratteri diversi e distinti dall'italiano, ne discende che la lingua ufficiale dello Stato, risulta in effetti una lingua straniera, per di piÃ¹ insegnata con metodi didatticamente errati, che non tengono in alcun conto la lingua materna dei Sardi: e ciÃ² con grave pregiudizio per un'efficace trasmissione della cultura sarda, considerata come sub-cultura. Va dunque respinto il tentativo di considerare come unica soluzione valida per questi problemi una forzata e artificiale forma di acculturazione dall'esterno, la quale ha dimostrato (e continua a dimostrare tutti) suoi gravi limiti, in quanto incapace di risolvere i problemi dell'isola. Ã perciÃ² necessario promuovere dall'interno i valori autentici della cultura isolana, primo fra tutti quello dell'autonomia, e "provocare un salto di qualitÃ  senza un'acculturazione di tipo colonialistico, e il superamento cosciente del dislivello di cultura" ([[Giovanni Lilliu|Lilliu]]). La FacoltÃ  di Lettere e Filosofia dell'UniversitÃ  di Cagliari, coerentemente con queste premesse con l'istituzione di una Scuola Superiore di Studi Sardi, Ã¨ pertanto invitata ad assumere l'iniziativa di proporre alle autoritÃ  politiche della Regione Autonoma e dello Stato il riconoscimento della condizione di minoranza etnico-linguistica per la Sardegna e della lingua sarda come lingua &lt;&lt;nazionale&gt;&gt; della minoranza. Ã di conseguenza opportuno che si predispongano tutti i provvedimenti a livello scolastico per la difesa e conservazione dei valori tradizionali della lingua e della cultura sarda e, in questo contesto, di tutti i dialetti e le tradizioni culturali presenti in Sardegna (ci si intende riferire al Gallurese, al Sassarese, all'Algherese e al Ligure-Carlofortino). In ogni caso tali provvedimenti dovranno comprendere necessariamente, ai livelli minimi dell'istruzione, la partenza dell'insegnamento del sardo e dei vari dialetti parlati in Sardegna, l'insegnamento nella scuola dell'obbligo riservato ai Sardi o coloro che dimostrino un'adeguata conoscenza del sardo, o tutti quegli altri provvedimenti atti a garantire la conservazione dei valori tradizionali della cultura sarda. Ã bene osservare come, nel quadro della diffusa tendenza a livello internazionale per la difesa delle lingue delle minoranze minacciate, provvedimenti simili a quelli proposti sono presi in Svizzera per la minoranza ladina fin dal 1938 (48000 persone), in Inghilterra per il Galles, in Italia per le minoranze valdostana, slovena e ultimamente ladina (15000 persone), oltre che per quella tedesca; a proposito di queste ultime e specificamente in relazione al nuovo ordinamento scolastico alto-atesino. Il presidente del Consiglio on. Colombo, nel raccomandare ala Camera le modifiche da apportare allo Statuto della Regione Trentino-Alto Adige (il cosiddetto "pacchetto"), &lt;&lt;modifiche che non escono dal concetto di autonomia indicato dalla Costituzione&gt;&gt;, ha ritenuto di dover sottolineare l'opportunitÃ  "che i giovani siano istruiti nella propria lingua materna da insegnanti appartenenti allo stesso gruppo linguistico"; egli inoltre aggiungeva che "solo eliminando ogni motivo di rivendicazione si crea il  necessario presupposto per consentire alla scuola di svolgere la sua funzione fondamentale in un clima propizio per la migliore formazione degli allievi". Queste chiare parole del presidente del Consiglio ci consentono di credere che non si voglia compiere una discriminazione nei confronti della minoranza sarda, ma anche per essa valga il principio enunciato dall'opportunitÃ  dell'insegnamento della lingua materna ad opera di insegnanti appartenenti allo stesso gruppo linguistico, onde consentire alla scuola di svolgere anche in Sardegna la sua funzione fondamentale in un clima propizio alla migliore formazione per gli allievi. Si chiarisce che tutto ciÃ² non Ã¨ sciovinismo nÃ© rinuncia a una cultura irrinunciabile, ma una civile e motivata iniziativa per realizzare in Sardegna una vera scuola, una vera rinascita, "in un rapporto di competizione culturale con lo stato (...) che arricchisce la Nazione" (Lilliu)&gt;&gt;. Il Consiglio unanime approva le istanze proposte dal prof. Sanna e invita le competenti autoritÃ  politiche a promuovere tutte le iniziative necessarie, sul piano sia scolastico che politico-economico, a sviluppare coerentemente tali principi, nel contempo acquisendo dati atti a mettere in luce il suesposto stato.

Such consensus remains relatively stable to this day; a further survey in 2008 reported that more than half of the interviewees, 57.3%, are in favour of the introduction of Sardinian into schools alongside Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/documenti/7_88_20070514130939.pdf Oppo, Anna.

According to a 2017 report on the digital language diversity in Europe, Sardinian appears to be particularly vital on social media as part of many people's everyday life for private use, but such vitality does not still translate into a strong and wide availability of Internet media for the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dldp.eu/sites/default/files/documents/DLDP_Sardinian-Report.pdf ''Sardinian, a digital language?'', DLDP Sardinian Report, the Digital Language Diversity Project]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a 60-hour Sardinian language course has been introduced for the first time in Sardinia and Italy at the [[University of Cagliari]], although such a course was already available in other universities abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unica.it/pub/7/show.jsp?id=35714&amp;iso=20&amp;is=7 ''Lingua sarda: "trinta prenu" per i primi due studenti'', Unica.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] commented on the status of national minorities in Italy, noting the ''Ã  la carte'' approach of the Italian state towards them with the exception of the German, French and Slovenian languages, where Italy has applied full bilingualism due to international agreements. Despite the formal recognition from the Italian state, Italy does not in fact collect any information on the ethnic and linguistic composition of the population, apart from [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref&gt;De Gruyter Mouton, ed. by Lubello, Sergio (2016). ''Manuale di linguistica italiana'', Manuals of Romance Linguistics 13, Lingue di minoranza, comunitÃ  alloglotte (Paul Videsott), 2: Rilevanza numerica e territoriale&lt;/ref&gt; There is also virtually no print and broadcasting media exposure in politically or numerically weaker minorites like Sardinian. Moreover, the resources allocated to cultural projects like bilingual education, which lacks a consistent approach, are largely insufficient to meet "even the most basic expectations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016806959b9 The Council of Europe Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Fourth Opinion on Italy, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanatzione.eu/2015/07/lingua-sarda-il-consiglio-deuropa-indaga-lo-stato-italiano-ne-parliamo-con-giuseppe-corongiu/ Lingua sarda: il Consiglio d'Europa indaga lo stato italiano.

===Standardization===
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
There have been some attempts at creating a standardized form of Sardinian over the years.

The Regional Council Deliberations no. 52/105 of 28 December 1999 and n. 59/117 of 29 December 1998 assigned the members for a commission with the goals of investigating an orthographic standardization of the Sardinian language and a project of linguistic unification. Those assigned to this commission were Eduardo Blasco Ferrer, Roberto Bolognesi, Diego Salvatore Corraine, Ignazio Delogu, Antonietta Dettori, Giulio Paulis, Massimo Pittau, Tonino Rubattu, Leonardo Sole, Heinz JÃ¼rgen Wolf, and Matteo Porru (acting as secretary of the commission). The output of this commission was the "Limba Sarda Unificada" (LSU). Its rules were published in 2001 by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.condaghes.com/public/docs/lsu2.pdf |title="Limba Sarda Unificada" Sintesi delle Norme di base: ortografia, fonetica, morfologia, lessico |date=2001 |publication-place=Cagliari |publisher=Regione Autonoma della Sardegna}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with some criticism and was also not adopted by the regional council. 

Regional Council Deliberation no. 20/15 of 9 May 2005 appointed a new commission composed of Giulio Angioni, Roberto Bolognesi, Manlio Brigaglia, Michel Contini, Diego Corraine, Giovanni Lupinu, Anna Oppo, Giulio Paulis, Maria Teresa Pinna Catte, Mario Puddu with within the framework of a program of measures for the protection and promotion of the Sardinian language, developing a guide for use by the regional administration in the translation of acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.regione.sardegna.it/documenti/1_45_20050513122932.pdf |title=Deliberazione n. 20/15 del 9.5.2005: Promozione e valorizzazione della cultura e della lingua della Sardegna. Indagine socio-linguistica sulla lingua sarda. |publisher=Regione Autonoma della Sardegna}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commission's output "Limba Sarda Comuna" was experimentally adopted for use by the regional authorities of Sardinia with Regional Council Deliberation no. 16/14 of 18 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.regione.sardegna.it/documenti/1_72_20060418155552.pdf |title=Deliberazione n. 16/14 del 18.4.2006: Limba Sarda Comuna. Adozione delle norme di riferimento a carattere sperimentale per la lingua scritta in uscita dellâAmministrazione regionale. |publisher=Regione Autonoma della Sardegna}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution does not aim to impose this spelling guide and notes that it is "open to integrations" and that "all solutions are of equal linguistic value". This work does not refer to language syntax and concerns itself primarily with spelling.

==Phonology==
All dialects of Sardinian have phonetic features that are relatively archaic compared to other [[Romance languages]]. The degree of archaism varies, with [[Nuorese dialect|the dialect]] spoken in the [[Province of Nuoro]] being considered the most conservative. Medieval evidence indicates that the language spoken in [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]] at the time was similar to modern Nuorese Sardinian. The other dialects are thought to have evolved through [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and later [[Italian language|Italian]] influences.

The examples listed below are from the [[Logudorese dialect]]:
* [[Latin]] vowels lost [[vowel length|length]] [[phonemic contrast|contrast]], but have all preserved their original sound; in particular, short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, which did not change in Sardinian, became instead {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, respectively, in Italian, Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where Latin [[vowel length|contrastive length]] resulted in contrastive [[vowel quality|quality]] (for example, {{lang|la|siccus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|sicu}} "dry"; Italian {{lang|it|secco}}, Spanish and Portuguese {{lang|es|seco}}).
* Preservation of the plosive sounds {{IPAslink|k}} and {{IPAslink|É¡}} before front vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} in many words; for example, {{lang|la|centum}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|kentu}} "hundred"; {{lang|la|decem}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|dÃ¨ke}} "ten" and {{lang|la|gener}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|ghÃ¨neru}} "son-in-law" (Italian {{lang|it|cento}}, {{lang|it|dieci}}, {{lang|it|genero}} with {{IPAslink|tÊ}} and {{IPAslink|dÊ}}).
* Absence of [[diphthongization]]s found in other Romance languages; for example, {{lang|la|potest}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|podest}} "(s)he can" (Italian {{lang|it|puÃ²}}, Spanish {{lang|es|puede}}, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|poate}}); {{lang|la|bonus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|bÃ³nu}} "good" (Italian {{lang|it|buono}}, Spanish {{lang|es|bueno}}).

Sardinian contains the following phonetic innovations:
* Change of the Latin ''-ll-'' into a [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPAblink|É|ÉÉ|}}, shared with [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and Southern [[Corsican language|Corsican]]; for example, {{lang|la|corallus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|coraddu}} "coral" and {{lang|la|villa}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|bidda}} "village, town".
* Similar changes in the consonant clusters ''-ld-'' and ''-nd-'': {{lang|la|solidus}}Â &gt; {{IPA-srd|ËsoÉÉu|}} "money", {{lang|la|abundantia}}Â &gt; {{IPA-srd|abbuÉ³ËÉantsi.a|}} "abundance".
* Evolution of ''-pl-'', ''-fl-'' and ''-cl-'' into ''-pr-'', ''-fr-'', as in Portuguese and [[Galician language|Galician]], and ''-cr-''; for example, {{lang|la|platea}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|pratza}} "public square" (Portuguese {{lang|pt|praÃ§a}}, Galician {{lang|gl|praza}}; but Italian {{lang|it|piazza}}), {{lang|la|fluxus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|frÃºsciu}} "flabby" (Portuguese and Galician {{lang|pt|frouxo}}) and {{lang|la|ecclesia}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|cresia}} "church" (Portuguese {{lang|pt|igreja}}, Galician {{lang|gl|igrexa}}; but Italian {{lang|it|chiesa}}).
* [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] such as {{lang|sc|abb'''r'''atzare}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|abba'''l'''tzare}} "to hug, to embrace".
* Vowel [[Prothesis (linguistics)|prothesis]] before an initial ''r'' in [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]], similar to [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Gascon language|Gascon]]: {{lang|la|rÄx}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|(g)urrÃ¨i}}/{{lang|sc|re}} "king"; {{lang|la|rota}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|arroda}} "wheel" (Gascon {{lang|oc|arrÃ²da}}); {{lang|la|rÄ«vus}}Â &gt; Sardinian and Gascon {{lang|sc|arrÃ­u}} "river".
* Vowel prothesis in Logudorese before an initial ''s'' followed by consonant, as in the [[Western Romance languages]]: {{lang|la|scrÄ«ptum}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|iscrÃ­tu}} "written" (Spanish {{lang|es|escrito}}, [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|Ã©cri}}), {{lang|la|stÄlla}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|isteddu}} "star" (Spanish {{lang|es|estrella}}, French {{lang|fr|Ã©toile}})
* Except for the Nuorese dialect, {{wikten|intervocalic}} Latin single voiceless plosives {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|t}}, {{IPAslink|k}} became voiced [[approximant consonant]]s. Single voiced plosives {{IPAslink|b}}, {{IPAslink|d}}, {{IPAslink|É¡}} were lost: {{lang|la|caritÄtem}} (acc.)Â &gt; {{lang|sc|caridÃ de}} {{IPA-srd|kaÉ¾iËÃ°aÃ°e|}}/{{IPA-srd|kaÉ¾iËdade|}} (Italian {{lang|it|caritÃ }}), {{lang|la|locus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|lÃ³gu}} {{IPA-srd|ËloÉ£u|}}/{{IPA-srd|ËloÉ¡u|}} (Italian {{lang|it|luogo}}). This also applies across word boundaries: {{lang|sc|porcu}} "pig", but {{lang|sc|su borcu}} "the pig"; {{lang|sc|tempus}} {{IPA-srd|'tempuzu|}} "time", but {{lang|sc|su tempus}} {{IPA-srd|su'Ã°empuzu|}} "the time"; {{lang|sc|domu}} "house", but {{lang|sc|sa âomu}} "the house". Such sound changes have become grammaticalised, making Sardinian an initial mutating language with similarities in this to the [[Insular Celtic languages]].

Although the latter two features were acquired during [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1700â1720)|Spanish rule]], the others indicate a deeper relationship between ancient Sardinia and the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] world; the retroflex ''d'', ''l'' and ''r'' are found in southern Italy, [[Tuscany]] and [[Asturias]], and were probably involved in the palatalization process of the Latin clusters ''-ll-'', ''-pl-'', ''-cl-'' (''-ll-''-Â &gt; Spanish and Catalan -''ll''- {{IPAslink|Ê}}, Gascon ''-th-'' {{IPAslink|c}}; ''-cl-''Â &gt; [[Galician-Portuguese]] ''-ch-'' {{IPA|/tÊ/}}, Italian ''-chi-'' {{IPA|/kj/}}), which as seen above had a different development in Sardinian.

===Vowels===
Vowels are {{IPAslink|Ã¤|a}}, {{IPAslink|e}}, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o}} and {{IPAslink|u}}, without length differentiation. [[Metaphony (Romance languages)#Sardinian|Metaphony]] occurs with {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, which in particular tend to be open-mid {{IPAblink|É}} and {{IPAblink|É}} when they are stressed and the following syllable does not contain {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|u}} or a palatal.

There are also [[nasal vowels]] {{IPA|[Ã£]}}, {{IPA|[áº½]}}, {{IPA|[Ä©]}}, {{IPA|[Ãµ]}}, {{IPA|[Å©]}} in some varieties, and even nasal diphthongs when an intervocalic ''n'' is deleted like in {{lang|sc|beni}} {{IPA-all|báº½jÌ~báº½Ä©|}}.

===Consonants===
According to [[Eduardo Blasco Ferrer]], Sardinian has the following phonemes:{{clarify|date=August 2018|says "phonemes" but below some are treated as allophones}}

There are three series of plosives or corresponding approximants:
* Voiceless stops derive from their Latin counterparts in composition after another stop. They are reinforced ([[geminate consonant|double]]) in initial position, but this reinforcement is not written because it does not produce a different [[phoneme]].
* Double voiced stops (after another consonant) derive from their Latin equivalents in composition after another stop.
* Weak voiced "stops" (actually approximants), sometimes transcribed {{angle bracket|[[Î²]] [[Î´]] [[Ä]]}} ({{IPA|/Î² Ã° É£/}} after vowels, as in Spanish), derive from single Latin stops (voiced or voiceless).
In [[Cagliari dialect|Cagliari]] and neighboring dialects, the soft {{IPA|/d/}} has become {{IPA|[É¾]}} due to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]: {{lang|la|digitus}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|didu}}/{{lang|sc|diru}} "finger".

The double-[[voiced retroflex stop]] {{IPA|/ÉÉ/}} (usually written ''-dd-'') derives from the former [[retroflex lateral approximant]] {{IPA|/É­É­/}}.

====Fricatives====
* The [[Labiodental consonant|labiodentals]] {{IPA|/f/}} (sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[ff]}} or {{IPA|[v]}} in initial position) and {{IPA|/v/}}.
** Latin initial ''v'' becomes ''b'' ({{lang|la|vipera}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|bÃ­bera}} "viper").
*** In central Sardinia the sound {{IPA|/f/}} disappears, akin to the {{IPA|/f/}}Â &gt; {{IPA|/h/}} change in Gascon and [[Old Spanish]].
* {{IPA|[Î¸]}}, written ''-th-'' (as in the English {{lang|en|thing}}), is a restricted dialectal variety of the phoneme {{IPA|/ts/}}.
* {{IPA|/s/}}
* {{IPA|/ss/}}, from [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]]; for example, {{lang|la|ipsa}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|Ã­ssa}}.
* {{IPA|/Ê/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[Ê]}} at the beginning of a word, otherwise {{IPA|[ÊÊ]}}, is written ''-sc(i/e)-''; its voiced equivalent, {{IPA|/Ê/}}, is often spelled with the letter ''x''.

====Affricates====
* {{IPA|/ts/}} (or {{IPA|[tts]}}), a [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] [[affricate consonant]] written ''-tz-'', corresponds to Italian ''-z-'' or ''-ci-''.
* {{IPA|/dz/}} (or {{IPA|[ddz]}}), written ''-z-'', corresponds to Italian ''-gi-''- or ''-ggi-''.
* {{IPA|/tÊ/}} is written ''-c(i/e)-'' or ''-[[Ã§]]-'' (also ''ts'' in loanwords).
* {{IPA|/ttÊ/}}
* {{IPA|/dÊ/}} is written ''-g(e/i)-'' or ''-j-''.

====Nasals====
* {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/mm/}}
* {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/nn/}}
* {{IPA|/É²É²/}}, written ''-gn-''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Limba Sarda Comuna |url=http://www.sardegnacultura.it/documenti/7_108_20090205122432.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''-nny-''/''-nni-''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.provincia.cagliari.it/ProvinciaCa/resources/cms/documents/arregulas.pdf |title=ArrÃ¨gulas po ortografia, fonÃ¨tica, morfologia e fueddÃ riu de sa norma campidanesa de sa lÃ¬ngua sarda |date=2009 |publisher=Alfa |isbn=9788885995475 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[palatal nasal]] for some speakers or dialects, although for most the pronunciation is {{IPA|[nËj]}}).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

====Liquids====
* {{IPA|/l/}} is double {{IPA|[ll]}} initially.
* {{IPA|/É¾/}} is written ''r''.
* {{IPA|/r/}} is written ''rr''.
Some permutations of ''l'' and ''r'' are seen: in most dialects a preconsonantal ''l'' (for example, ''-lt-'' or ''-lc-'') becomes ''r'': Latin {{lang|la|altum}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|artu}} "high/tall", {{lang|sc|marralzu}}/{{lang|sc|marrarzu}} "rock".

In [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] context, Latin ''l'' changed into {{IPA|[dz]}}, {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[ldz]}}, {{IPA|[ll]}} or {{IPA|[dÊ]}}, rather than the {{IPA|/Ê/}} of Italian: {{lang|sc|achizare}} (Italian {{lang|it|accigliare}}), {{lang|la|*volia}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|bÃ²lla}}/{{lang|sc|bÃ²lza}}/{{lang|sc|bÃ²za}} "wish, longing" (Italian {{lang|it|voglia}}), {{lang|la|folia}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|fogia}}/{{lang|sc|folla}}/{{lang|sc|foza}} "leaf" (Italian {{lang|it|foglia}}), {{lang|la|fÄ«lia}}Â &gt; {{lang|sc|filla}}/{{lang|sc|fidza}}/{{lang|sc|fiza}} "daughter" (Italian {{lang|it|figlia}}).

==Grammar==
Some distinctive features typical of Sardinian are:
* The plural [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] is ''-s'' (from the Latin [[accusative]] plural), as in the Western Romance languages French, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], Catalan, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]): ''sardu, sardus'', "Sardinian"; ''pudda'', ''puddas'', "hen"; ''margiane, margianes'', "fox". In Italo-Dalmatian languages (such as Italian) or [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]] languages (such as [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), the plural ends with ''-i'', ''-e'' or ''-a--.
* The definite article derived from the Latin ''ipse'': ''su, sa'', plural ''sos, sas'' (Logudorese) and ''is'' (Campidanese). Such articles are common in [[Balearic dialect|Balearic Catalan]], and were common in [[Gascon language|Gascon]].
* A [[periphrasis|periphrastic construction]] of "have to" (late Latin ''habere ad'') is used for the future: ''ap'a istÃ re'' &lt; ''apo a istÃ re'' "I will stay", Vulgar Latin 'habeo ad stare' (as in the Portuguese ''hei de estar'', but here as periphrasis for ''estarei''). The other Romance languages have realisations of the alternative Vulgar Latin 'stare habeo', Italian "starÃ²", Portuguese "estarei".
* For prohibitions, a negative form of the subjunctive is used: ''no bengias!'', "don't come!" (compare Spanish ''no vengas'' and Portuguese ''nÃ£o venhas'', classified as part of the affirmative [[imperative mood]]). Italian uses the infinitive (''non venire'') instead.
* A common occurrence of a left-dislocated construction: ''cussa cantone apo cantadu'' ("That song I have sung": that is, "I've sung that song").
** In yes/no questions, fronting of a constituent (especially a predicative element) is required, though it is not specifically a question-formation process: ''Cumprendiu m'as?'' ("Understood me you have", that is, "Have you understood me?"), ''Mandicatu at?'' ("Eaten he/she has", that is "Has he/she eaten?"), ''Fattu l'at'' ("Done he/she has", that is "He/She's done it"), etc.
*Interrogative phrases might be constructed like echo questions, with the interrogative marker remaining in underlying position: ''Sunt lÃ²mpios cando?'' ("They arrived when?", that is, "when did they arrive?"), ''Juanne at pigadu olÃ¬as cun chie?'' ("John has picked olives with whom?"), etc.
* Impersonal sentence constructions are commonly used to replace the passive voice, which is limited to the formal register: ''A Juanni ddu ant mortu'' rather than ''Juanni est istadu mortu''.
* The use of ''non de'' + noun: ''non de abba, abbardente est'' ("not of water brandy it+is": that is, "It is not water, but brandy."); ''non de frades, parent inimigos'' ("Not of brothers, they seem enemies": that is, "Far from being brothers, they are like enemies").
* The use of ''ca'' (from ''quia'') or ''ki'' as subordinate conjunctions: ''Ja nau ti l'apo ca est issa sa mere'' ("Already told I have you that is she the boss", that is "I've already told you that it's her the boss").
* Existential uses of ''Ã er'' / ''Ã i'' ("to have") and ''Ã¨sser'' / ''Ã¨ssi'' ("to be"): ''B'at prus de chentu persones inoghe!'' ("There is over a hundred people in here!"), ''Nci funt is pratus in mesa'' ("There are the plates on the table").
* ''Ite'' ("What") + adjective + ''chi'': ''Ite bellu chi ses!'' ("You are so beautiful!").
* Nominal syntagmas without having a head: ''Cussu ditzionariu de gregu est prus mannu de su de Efis'' ("That Greek dictionary is bigger than Efisio's"), ''Cudda machina est prus manna de sa de Juanne'' ("That car is bigger than John's").
* Extraposition of the lexycal head: ''Imprestami su tou de ditzionariu'' ("Please lend me your dictionary").
* ''Ancu'' + subjunctive as a way to express a (malevolent) wish on someone: ''Ancu ti falet unu lampu!'' ("May you be struck by lightning!").
* Prepositional accusative: ''Apo bidu a Maria'' ("I've seen Mary").
* Insertion of the affermative particle ''ja'' / ''giai'': ''Ja m'apo corcau'' ("I did go to bed").
** Use of the same particle to express [[Antiphrasis|antiphrastic]] formulas: ''Jai ses totu istudiatu, tue!'' ("You're so well educated!", that is, "You are so ignorant and full of yourself!").
* Reflexive use of intransitive verbs: ''Tziu Pascale si nch'est mortu&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to the transitive use of ''morrer'' / ''morri a...'', which means "to kill" instead. E.g.: ''Pascale at mortu a tziu Bachis'' ("Pascal has killed uncle Bachisio").&lt;/ref&gt; eris sero'' ("Uncle Pascal passed away yesterday"), ''Mi nch'apo dormiu pro una parica de oras'' ("I've slept for a couple of hours").
* Use of ''Ã er'' in reflexive sentences: ''Si at fertu a s'anca traballende'' ("He/She injured himself/herself while working").
* Combination of the perfective and progressive verb aspect: ''Est istadu traballende totu sa die" ("He/She has been working all day").
* Progressive aspect of the verb, which is meant to indicate an effective situation rather than typical or habitual: ''Non ti so cumprendende'' ("I don't understand you").
* Relative lack of adverbs ending in -''mente'': with the exception of some localized words like the Nuorese ''mescamente'' ("especially"), as well as recent Italian loanwords, all the Sardinian dialects have a number of ways with which to express the meaning conferred to such adverbs by the other Romance languages (e.g. ''LuchÃ­a currit prus a lestru / acoitendi de MarÃ­a'', "Lucy runs faster than Mary").

[[File:Gallurese.png|thumb|Corso-Sardinian (orange and yellow) with respect to Sardinian proper (green).]]
Historically, the Sardinians have always been quite a small population scattered across isolated [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]], sharing similar demographic patterns with Corsica. Starting from [[Francesco Cetti]]'s description in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.unica.it/mlorinczi/files/2007/04/5-sappada2000-2001.pdf Marinella LÅrinczi, ''Confini e confini. Il valore delle isoglosse (a proposito del sardo)'']&lt;/ref&gt; the Sardinian language has been traditionally subdivided into two macro-varieties, each spoken by roughly half of the entire community: the [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects (''su sardu logudoresu'') and the [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]] dialects (''su sardu campidanesu''), spoken respectively in North-Central and Southern Sardinia. All the Sardinian dialects differ primarily in phonetics, which does not hamper intelligibility;&lt;ref name="Sardinianvarieties"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Intonation in Romance |last=Mar Vanrell |first=Maria del |last2=Ballone |first2=Francesc |last3=Schirru |first3=Carlo |last4=Prieto |first4=Pilar |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199685332 |editor-last=Frota |editor-first=SÃ³nia |pages=317â349 |language=en-US |chapter=Sardinian intonational phonology: Logudorese and Campidanese varieties |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685332.003.0009 |editor-last2=Prieto |editor-first2=Pilar |chapter-url=http://prosodia.upf.edu/home/arxiu/publicacions/2015%20OUP%20INTONATION%20IN%20ROMANCE/09-Frota%20&amp;%20Prieto-Chap09-v2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnacultura.it/linguasarda/ilsardo/|title=Sardegna Cultura â Lingua sarda â Il sardo|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view of there being a dialectal boundary separating the Campidanese and Logudorese varieties has been in fact subjected to more recent research, that shows a fluid linguistic continuum from the Northern to the Southern ends of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bolognesu.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/una-lingua-unitaria-che-non-ha-bisogno-di-standardizzazioni/ ''Una lingua unitaria che non ha bisogno di standardizzazioni'', Roberto Bolognesi]&lt;/ref&gt; The dual perception of the Sardinian dialects, rather than pointing to an actual [[isogloss]], is in fact the result of a psychological adherence to the way Sardinia was administratively subvidided into a ''[[Caput]] Logudori'' (''Cabu de Susu'') and a ''Caput Calaris'' (''Cabu de Jossu'') by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Bolognesi, Roberto. ''Le identitÃ  linguistiche dei sardi'', Condaghes, 2013, pg.138&lt;/ref&gt; Some attempts have been recently made to introduce a standardized writing system for administrative purposes, like the LSU (''Limba Sarda Unificada'', "Unified Sardinian Language") and then the LSC (''Limba Sarda Comuna'', "Common Sardinian Language"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnacultura.it/linguasarda/limbasardacomuna/|title=Sardegna Cultura â Lingua sarda â Limba sarda comuna|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have not been generally acknowledged by native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnacultura.it/documenti/7_88_20070514130939.pdf Oppo, Anna. ''Le lingue dei sardi'', p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/lingrom/marzo/EscursioneSitoItaliano/la_standardizzazione_del_sardo.html ''La standardizzazione del sardo, oppure: Quante lingue standard per il sardo? E quali?'' - Matthea Wilsch, UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, Institut fÃ¼r Linguistik/Romanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Logudorese and Campidanese dialects have been estimated to have 88% of matches in 110-item [[Swadesh list|wordlist]], similarly to the 85-88% number of matches between [[ProvenÃ§al dialect|ProvenÃ§al]] [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] dialects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jolr.ru/index.php?article=192 ''How accurate can glottochronology be?

The Logudorese dialects are generally considered more conservative, with the Nuorese [[subdialect]] (''su sardu nugoresu'') being the most conservative of all. They have all retained the [[classical Latin]] pronunciation of the stop velars (''kena'' versus ''cena'', "supper"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/didattica/schede/slides.php?sez=37&amp;id=883&amp;ai=23&amp;mc=0010000 ''Le occlusive velari davanti a vocale palatale'', Centro di Studi Filologici Sardi]&lt;/ref&gt; the front middle vowels (compare Campidanese [[iotacism]], probably from Byzantine Greek)&lt;ref&gt;''et ipso quoque sermo Sardorum adhuc retinetnon pauca verba sermonis graeci atque ipse loquentium sonum graecisanum quendam prae se fert'' â Roderigo Hunno Baeza, Caralis Panegyricus, about 1516, manuscript preserved in the University Library of Cagliari&lt;/ref&gt; and assimilation of [[close-mid vowel]]s (''cane'' versus ''cani'', "dog" and ''gattos'' versus ''gattus'', "cats"). Labio-velars become plain labials (''limba'' versus ''lingua'', "language" and ''abba'' versus ''acua'', "water").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/didattica/schede/slides.php?sez=37&amp;id=885&amp;ai=25&amp;mc=0010000 ''Le labiovelari'', Centro di Studi Filologici Sardi]&lt;/ref&gt; ''I'' is prosthesized before consonant clusters beginning in ''s'' (''iscala'' versus Campidanese ''scala'', "stairway" and ''iscola'' versus ''scola'', "school"). An east-west strip of villages in central Sardinia speaks a transitional group of dialects (''su sardu de mesania''). Examples include ''is limbas'' (the languages) and ''is abbas'' (the waters). The Campidanese dialects are spoken in the southern half of Sardinia (including [[Cagliari]], once the metropolis of the Roman province), and was more influenced by [[Carthage]], Rome, Constantinople and [[Late Latin]]. Examples include ''is fruminis'' (the rivers) and ''is domus'' (the houses).

Sardinian is the indigenous and historical language of most Sardinian communities. However, Sardinian is not spoken as the native and primary language in a significant number of other ones, amounting to 20% of the Sardinian population.&lt;ref name="Ministero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sardinianvarieties" /&gt; The afore-mentioned Gallurese and Sassarese, despite being often colloquially considered part of Sardinian, are two [[Corsican language|Corso]]-Sardinian transitional languages; they are spoken in the northernmost part of Sardinia,&lt;ref name="minoranze"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comune.oulx.to.it/doc_patois/0701.pdf |title=Le minoranze linguistiche in Italia |access-date=2016-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084526/http://www.comune.oulx.to.it/doc_patois/0701.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardegnadigitallibrary.it/mmt/fullsize/2010072310445600012.pdf Maxia, Mauro.

[[Sassari]], the second-largest city on Sardinia and the main center of the northern half of the island (''cabu de susu'' in Sardinian, ''capo di sopra'' in Italian), is located there. There are also two [[language island]]s, the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]]-speaking community from the inner city of [[Alghero]] (northwest Sardinia) and the [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]-speaking towns of [[Carloforte]], in [[San Pietro Island]], and [[Calasetta]] in [[Sant'Antioco|Sant'Antioco island]] (south-west Sardinia).&lt;ref name="minoranze" /&gt;

'''Sectarian violence''' and/or '''sectarian strife''' is a form of [[communal violence]] inspired by [[sectarianism]], that is, between different [[sect]]s of one particular mode of ideology or religion within a nation/community. [[Religious segregation]] often plays a role in sectarian violence.

== Concept ==
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:
{{Quote|Traditionally, sectarian violence implies a symmetrical confrontation between two or more non-state actors representing different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2008: Armaments, Disarmament, and International Security |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sectarian violence differs from the concept of [[List of ethnic riots|race riot]]. It may involve the dynamics of [[social polarization]], the [[balkanization]] of a geographic area along the lines of self-identifying groups, and [[protracted social conflict]].

Some of the possible enabling environments for sectarian violence include power struggles, political climate, social climate, cultural climate, and economic landscape.
*[[Economy|Economic conflict]]: [[capitalism|capitalist]] versus [[collectivism|collectivist]]
*[[Politics|Political conflict]]: [[Communism|communist]] versus [[Nationalism|nationalist]]
*Interreligious conflict: [[Christians]] and/or [[Catholics]] versus [[Jews]]&lt;br&gt;[[Muslim]] versus [[Christian]]&lt;br&gt;[[Muslim]] versus [[Buddhist]] 
*[[Christianity|Christian conflict]]: [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] versus [[Protestantism|Protestant]]
*[[Islam|Islamic conflict]]: [[Shia Islam|Shia]] versus [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]

===Catholic-Orthodox===
{{see also|Fourth Crusade}}
Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] from [[Anatolia]], one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to "further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The genealogy of violence: reflections on creation, freedom, and evil |first=Charles K.|last=Bellinger |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2001 |page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjBW2JsNPPcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Crusades+Christianity+Orthodox+violence#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schlacht am WeiÃen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] in [[Bohemia]] (1620)âone of the decisive battles of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]
Following the onset of the [[Protestant Reformation]], a series of wars were waged in Europe starting [[circa]] 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to [[Miroslav Volf]], the [[European wars of religion]] were a major factor behind the "emergence of secularizing modernity".

In the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] followers of the Roman Catholic Church killed up to 30,000 [[Huguenot]]s (French Protestants) in mob violence. The massacres were carried out on the national day celebrating [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] sent the leader of the massacres a [[Golden Rose]], and said that the massacres "gave him more pleasure than fifty [[Battle of Lepanto|Battles of Lepanto]], and he commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican".&lt;ref name="gilmour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terrorism review|author1=Ian Gilmour |author2=Andrew Gilmour |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=2|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|page=136|doi=10.1525/jps.1988.17.3.00p0024k}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings have been called "the worst of the century's religious massacres",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.G. Koenigsberger|author2=George L. Mosse|author3=G.Q. Bowler|title=Europe in the Sixteenth Century, Second Edition|publisher=Longman|year=1989|isbn=0-582-49390-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the start of the ''fourth war'' of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

===Northern Ireland===
{{Further|The Troubles|Politics of Northern Ireland}}
Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. [[Northern Ireland]] has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for [[absentee landlord]]s, aspiring politicians, and members of the [[landed gentry]] stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late 18th century.

[[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|William E.H. Lecky]], an Irish historian, wrote in 1892 that, "If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Edward Hartpole Lecky|title=A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote;{{Quote|The Northern Ireland conflict is a religious conflict. Economic and social considerations are also crucial, but it was the fact that the competing populations in Ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Bruce|title=God Save Ulster|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|page=249|isbn=0-19-285217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|249}} Reviewers agreed "Of course the Northern Ireland conflict is at heart religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The English Historical Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=104|issue=413|date=October 1989|title=God Save Ulster: The Religion and Politics of Paisleyism by Steve Bruce (review)|author=David Harkness}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Hickey wrote;{{Quote|Politics in the North is not politics exploiting religion. That is far too simple an explanation: it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use. In the case of Northern Ireland the relationship is much more complex. It is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion. It is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth century England than to the last quarter of twentiethâcentury Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hickey|title=Religion and the Northern Ireland Problem|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|year=1984|page=67|isbn=0-7171-1115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The period from 1969-98 is known as "[[The Troubles]]", a period of frequent violence and tense relations between Northern Ireland's communities. About one in eight females and one in five males in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to no religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Background/RELIGION.html ''NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015'' results on religion], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, people of no religion and non-Christian faiths are still considered {{bywhom|date=September 2016}} as belonging to one of the two "sects" along with churchgoers. People of no religion are less likely to support the main, constitution-oriented main political parties, or more likely to support a more neutral political party such as the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=NILT1&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/POLPART2.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political party support], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

About two thirds of people with no religion tend to think of themselves as neither [[British unionism|unionist]] or [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], although a much higher percentage of those with no religion tend to think of themselves as unionist than nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who describe themselves as Protestant or Roman Catholic, a small majority of them appear to favour one of the two main political parties on either side: the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] or the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] for Protestants; and [[Sinn FÃ©in]] or the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] for Roman Catholics. In each case, the percentage in the ''Northern Irish Life &amp; Times Survey'' in 2015 was 57%.&lt;ref name=NILT1/&gt; Roman Catholics are more likely to reject the label British (59%) than Protestants are to reject the label Irish (48%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/IRBRIT.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Protestants are more likely to consider the British identity as the 'best' single way to describe themselves, at 67%, with Roman Catholics close behind at 63% who consider the best single way to describe themselves as Irish. There is an equal level of support for the more neutral Northern Irish identity, with 25% of people from each religion likely to choose that label as the best description. Over a third of people with no religion prefer to be described as Northern Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Community_Relations/NINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on best identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The [[Corrymeela Community]] (in [[Ballycastle, County Antrim]]), operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The [[Ulster Project]] works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Although [[Education in Northern Ireland|state schools]] in Northern Ireland are non-denominational, most Catholic parents still send their children to specifically Catholic schools or Irish-language medium schools, thus ensuring that state school students are almost wholly Protestant. There are some integrated schools and the [[Society of Friends]] (Quakers) have long been an advocate of co-education in terms of religion, operating the [[Friends' School, Lisburn|Friends' School]] in Lisburn (first established in 1774).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Yugoslav wars===
{{main|Yugoslav Wars}}
Howard Goeringer criticizes both the "Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch" for failing to condemn the "deliberate massacre of men, women and children in the name of 'ethnic cleansing' as incompatible with Jesus' life and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunts of Violence in the Church|first=Howard|last=Goeringer|year=2005|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwandan genocide===
{{Main|Rwandan Genocide}}
{{Further|Religion in Rwanda}}

The [[Demographics of Rwanda|majority of Rwandans]], and [[Tutsi]]s in particular, are Catholic, so shared religion did not prevent genocide. Miroslav Volf cites a Roman Catholic bishop from Rwanda as saying, "The best cathechists, those who filled our churches on Sundays, were the first to go with machetes in their hands".&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning&gt;{{cite journal |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |journal=Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies |date = January 1999|volume=16|number=1 |pages=7â12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Linden asserts that "there is absolutely no doubt that significant numbers of prominent Christians were involved in sometimes slaughtering their own church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Linden, I. (1997). The Church and Genocide. Lessons from the Rwandan Tragedy. In G. Baum (Ed.), The Reconciliation of Peoples. Challenge to the Churches (pp. 43â55). Geneva: WCC Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volf, "what is particularly disturbing about the complicity of the church is that Rwanda is without doubt one of Africaâs most evangelized nations. Eight out of ten of its people claimed to be Christians."&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning /&gt;

When the Roman Catholic [[Missionary|missionaries]] came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the "[[Hamitic]]" [[Scientific racism|theory of race origins]], which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between [[Hutu]] and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Genocide'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-34644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) report on the genocide states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandansâ¦&lt;ref name=OAU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DEEY?OpenDocument|title=Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide|publisher=Organization of African Unity|date=7 July 2000|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church argues that those who took part in the genocide did so without the sanction of the Church.&lt;ref name="wf"/&gt; Although the genocide was ethnically motivated and religious factors were not prominent, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that a number of religious authorities in Rwanda, particularly Roman Catholic, failed to condemn the genocide publicly at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno4-7-03.htm#P893_245534|title=Rwandan Genocide: The Clergy|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian leaders have been convicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] for their roles in the genocide.&lt;ref name="wf"&gt;''Dictionary of Genocide"'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs, p. 380, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-34644-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Rwandan Roman Catholic priests and nuns as well as a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] pastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/791907.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Rwandan bishop cleared of genocide|date=15 June 2000|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
{{See also|Sectarianism in Glasgow}}
Scotland, which is very close to Northern Ireland, suffers from a spill-over of sectarianism, largely owing to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland as many people, particularly in the West of Scotland, have links to Northern Ireland by genealogy or immigration. 

Scotland's two largest and best supported football clubs -- [[Rangers F.C.|Glasgow Rangers]], which, for many generations, has largely been identified with Protestants and unionism, and [[Celtic F.C.|Glasgow Celtic]], which, since its founding in the late 19th century, has been identified with Roman Catholics and Irish nationalism or republicanism -- both subscribe, with varying degrees of success, to government initiatives and charities like the [[Nil by Mouth (charity)|Nil by Mouth]] campaign are working in this area.

Celtic previously sent letters to every season ticket holder reminding supporters that no form of sectarianism is welcome at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eticketing.co.uk/celtic/staticpages/termsandconditions.aspx|title=Celtic F.C.'s Terms &amp; Conditions of sale - eTickets|author=|date=|website=www.eticketing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers' anti-sectarian policy is called ''Follow With Pride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hymns of hatred at Ibrox Park|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/hymnsofhatredatibroxpark|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=8 August 2007|location=London, UK|first=Mike|last=Small}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among Muslims==
{{main|Sectarian violence among Muslims}}
Sectarian violence between the two major sects of Islam, Shia and Sunni, has occurred in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon etc. This violent conflict has roots in the political turmoil arising out of differences over the [[succession to Muhammad]]. [[Abu Bakr]], a [[Sahabah|companion of Muhammad]], was nominated by [[Umar]] and elected as the first Sunni [[Rashidun|Rightly Guided Caliph]]. However another group felt that [[Ali]], the cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]], had been designated by Muhammad and is considered by Shia as the first [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]].

According to Sunnis, Abu Bakr was followed by Umar as [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], then by [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and finally by Ali. Ali's right to rule was challenged by [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah bin Abu Sufian]], governor of Syria, who believed{{fact|date=October 2016}} that Ali should have acted faster against the murderers of Uthman. The situation deteriorated further when many of those responsible for the death of Uthman rallied behind Ali. However, later on, both the parties agreed to have some one as a judge between them. This led to the separation of an extremist group known as [[Kharijites]] from Ali's army, which pronounced the judgement belonged to [[God in Islam|God]] alone. A member of this group later assassinated Ali. By breaching, [[Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty]], Muawiyah appointed his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as his successor. The credentials and rule of Yazid were challenged by Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]] (and grandson of Muhammad). A [[Battle of Karbala|battle at Karbala]] in Iraq led to the martyrdom of Hussein and dozens of others from ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' (the members of the family of Muhammad).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This tragic incident created deep fissures in the Muslim society. The conflict that had started at a political plane intervened with the dogma and belief systems.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Those who consider Ali to be the true heir to the [[Muhammad]] are known as "Shia" referring to Shian-e-Ali. The other Muslims are known as "Sunni" meaning "followers of the Traditions of The Prophet".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===In Iraq===
{{main|Civil war in Iraq (2006â07)|Sectarian violence in Iraq}}
In February 2006, more than 100 people were killed across Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left over a hundred people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022300216.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=Jonathan|last1=Finer|first2=Bassam|last2=Sebti|title=Sectarian Violence Kills Over 100 in Iraq|date=24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{main|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}
In Pakistan sectarianism exhibited its first organized nature in early 1980 when two rival organizations were established: [[Tehrik-e-Jafaria]] (TFJ) (Organization of the Jafri (Shia) Law) represented Shia communities, and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] (SSP) (Guardian of the Companions of the Prophet) representing Sunnis. The first major incident of this sectarian violence was killing of the [[Arif Hussain Hussaini]], founding leader of TFJ in 1986. 

In retaliation [[Haq Nawaz Jhangvi]], founder of the (SSP) was murdered. Since then internecine bloody vendetta has ensued. The focus of this violence has been [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]], [[Hangu District, Pakistan|Hangu]], [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]], [[Jhang District|Jhang]], [[Quetta District|Quetta]],Gigit- Baltistan and [[Karachi]].

The transformation of the sectarian conflict to a violent civil war in Pakistan coincided{{fact|date=October 2016}} with the establishment of the [[Islamic republic]] in Iran and promotion of the Sunni religion and its incorporation in the state institutions by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], regime in Pakistan.

The [[Iranian Revolution]] was led by Shia clerics, and it influenced Shia communities all over the world. In Pakistan Tehrik-e-Jafaria was established with the demands of enforcing the Sharia Law. {{fact|date=October 2016}} This demand was viewed as detrimental by the Sunni religious leaders. In response SSP was established by the Sunni extremist clerics. Many of these clerics had a background in the sectarian strife against the Ahmadis (a heterodox sect considered non-Muslim by majority of the Orthodox Schools)

===In Somalia===
[[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] is a [[Somali people|Somali]] paramilitary group consisting of [[Sufism|Sufis]] and moderates opposed to the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. They are fighting in order to prevent [[Wahhabi]]sm from being imposed on Somalia and to protect the country's Sunni-Sufi traditions and generally moderate religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8077725.stm |work=BBC News | title=Somali rage at grave desecration | date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
{{main|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War}}
The [[Syrian civil war]] gradually shifted towards a more sectarian nature. Pro-Assad militant groups are largely{{fact|date=October 2016}} Shia, while anti-Assad militant groups are non-secular, fundamentalist Sunni.

'''Iraqis''' are the second largest minority group living in [[Sweden]], with 131,888 Iraq-born people living in Sweden and 47,913 Swedes with at least one Iraq-born parent.&lt;ref name="scb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssd.scb.se/databaser/makro/produkt.asp?produktid=BE0101&amp;lang=2|title=Statistiska centrabyran|publisher=Sss.scb.se|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/viewFile/8006/5998|title=Iranian Diaspora: With focus on Iranian Immigrants in Sweden|publisher=Ccsenet.org|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of this group has doubled in the period of 2002 to 2009; the influx of Iraqi refugees increased dramatically from 2006 to 2009 as a result of the [[Iraq War]].

==Population==
Iraq-born people are the second largest minority group living in [[Sweden]], after the [[Sweden Finns]] (5.1%).&lt;ref name=IraqiRefugeesinSweden&gt;{{cite web | url =http://holfies.wordpress.com/2006/12/26/iraqi-refugees-in-sweden/ | title =Iraqi refugees find shelter in Sweden | accessdate =2007-08-14 | publisher =holfies.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swedentightens&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL06873099 | title =Sweden tightens rules on Iraqi asylum seekers | date=2007-07-06 | accessdate =2010-12-14 | publisher =reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Iraqi immigrants to Sweden have come in four distinct waves of migration. The first were around 8,000 Kurdish and Assyrian nationalists and Iraqi communists who were escaping the Baathist regime. This wave was between 1968â1978. The second wave of 10,000 people was between 1980 and 1988, mainly Kurds and Assyrians escaping the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] and Iraqi men escaping forced conscription in the [[IranâIraq War]]. The third wave was about 15,000 people, between 1991 and 1999, again mostly Kurdish and Assyrian people from Northern Iraq. Most of these came with families. The largest numbers, almost 30,000 people, of Iraqis in Sweden today have migrated as a consequence of the [[Iraq War]] of 2003 to 2010. Most of them have been Sunni Arabs and Assyrian Christians.

Christian Iraqis, fearing persecution in their homeland, make up a large part of that influx after Iraq occupation in 2003.&lt;ref name=Swedentightens/&gt; Sweden accepts more than half of all asylum applications from Iraqis in [[Europe]]. In 2006, over 9,000 Iraqis fled their country and came to Sweden seeking shelter, a fourfold increase over 2005.&lt;ref name=IraqisinSweden&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workpermit.com/news/2007_02_21/sweden/petitions_eu_iraq_refugees.htm |title=Iraqis Refugees in Sweden |accessdate=2007-08-14 |publisher=workpermit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sweden attempted to throttle the influx of Iraqi refugees by tightening the rules for asylum seekers,&lt;ref name=Swedentightens/&gt; but in 2008 there were again record numbers of Iraqi immigrants, close to 12,000. In 2009, the number of immigrants fell again slightly, to 8,400.

==Refugee status and naturalization==
In 2006 Sweden granted protection status to more Iraqis than in all other EU states combined.  In 2005 only 0.1 percent of Iraqis were recognised as refugees, but the total recognition rate including those granted complementary protection was a relatively high 24 per cent. In the year 2006 however, recognition rates leapt to a total of 91 per cent.&lt;ref name=IraqisInEurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/publ/RESEARCH/470c9be92.pdf |title=Iraqis in Europe |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=unhcr.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906113441/http://www.unhcr.org/publ/RESEARCH/470c9be92.pdf |archivedate=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Migrationsverket|Swedish Migration Board]] decided in early 2006 that all Iraqi asylum-seekers from Central and Southern Iraq whose claims had been rejected as part of the normal status determination process would nevertheless receive a [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] permit, allowing the majority of Iraqis in Sweden to begin the process of fully{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} integrating into Swedish society with a secure legal status.

In the context of the generally low recognition rates for Iraqis in other EU states,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Sweden's generosity led to a surge in the number of applications received from Iraqis. Figures increased from 2,330 in 2005 to 8,951 the following year, with a further 1,500 new arrivals per month in the first half of 2007. Most of these persons have joined the existing Iraqi community in Sweden in municipalities such as [[MalmÃ¶]] and [[SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje]], with the scale of the influx to these areas forcing newcomers to live in very poor conditions. Speaking in June 2007, SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje's mayor Anders Lago described the situation as being close to breaking point, with the authorities barely able to provide basic services and many newcomers sharing apartments with up to fifteen people.&lt;ref name=IraqisInEurope/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7129">The '''Tabom People''' or '''Agudas''' are the [[Afro-Brazilian]] community in South of [[Ghana]] who are mostly of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=T_sHRCc3QNwC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=|title=Tabom.

When they arrived in South Ghana and [[Accra]] and they could speak only [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], so they greeted each other with âComo estÃ¡?â (How are you?) to which the reply was âTÃ¡ bomâ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TÃ¡ bom? Tabom!|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/esporte/fk2606200653.htm|website=Folha de S. Paulo|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the [[Ewe people]], [[Ga-Adangbe people]] and [[Akan people]] in of South Ghana and Accra started to call them the Tabom People.

==Origins of Afro-Brazilian Community in Ghana==
The Afro-Brazilian descendants and community in South [[Ghana]] dates back to one study from the 19th century that between an estimated 3,000 and 8,000 former slaves decided to return to Africa.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"&gt;[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/html/770/77003302/77003302.html Alcione Meira Amos e Ebenezer Ayesu "Sou Brasileiro: Historia dos Tabom, Afro-Brasileiros em Acra, Gana", Universidade Federal da Bahia, Brasil, 2005, Afro-Ãsia, nÃºmero 033]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to now it is not very clear, if the Tabom really bought their freedom and decided to immediately come back or if they were at that time free workers in Brazil, they came after the [[MalÃª Revolt]] of 1835 in [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia]]. A lot of Afro-Brazilians when percecuted found their way back to Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria especially those who organised the MalÃª Revolt.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; In Ghana it is common to find family names like de Souza, Silva, or Cardoso. Some of them have been very well known in Ghana.

==Afro-Brazilians in Ghana==
[[File:Casa do Brasil em Acra, Gana - Brazil House in Accra, Ghana.jpg|300px|thumb|left| 
One of the Homes of the Tabom People, in Accra, Ghana, former slaves who returned to Africa after the abolition of slavery in Brazil. The House became a museum: Brazil House.]] In Ghana, the representative group of people that decided to come back from Brazil is the Tabom People. They came back on a ship called SS ''Salisbury'', offered by the British government. About seventy Afro-Brazilians of seven different families arrived in South Ghana and Accra, in the region of the old port in [[James Town, Accra|James Town]] in 1836.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; The reception by the Mantse Nii Ankrah of the Otublohum area was so warm that they decided to settle down in Accra.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; The leader of the Tabom group at the time of their arrival was a certain Nii Azumah Nelson.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; The eldest son of Azumah Nelson, Nii Alasha, was his successor and a very close friend to the Ga King Nii Tackie Tawiah.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; Together they helped in the development of the whole community in [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt;

At the present moment the Tabom Mantse is Nii Azumah V, descendant of the Nelsonâs. The Taboms are also known as the founders of the First Scissors House in 1854, the first [[tailoring]] shop in the country, which had amongst other activities, the task to provide the [[Ghana Army|Ghanaian Army]] with uniforms.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; Proof of these skills is without any doubt Dan Morton, another Tabom and one of the most famous tailors nowadays in Accra.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt;

In Ghana, the de Souza family can be found around [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], Kokomele and other parts of the [[Greater Accra Region|Greater Accra region]] and South Ghana. [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Cape Coast]] are also other bases.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; Almost all of them remained along the coastal regions of South Ghana.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; However, it is very common to see a De Souza, a Wellington, a Benson, a Pereria, a Palmares, a Nelson, an Azumah, Amorin, Da Costa, Santos, De Medeiros, Nunoo, Olympio, Maslieno, Maselino (a changed version of 'Maslieno' by the late Rev. Canon Seth Nii Adulai Maselino ((1919 - 1994)) whose parents originated from Maslieno House in Adabraka, Accra) and other Afro-Brazilians in Ghana speaking perfect [[Ga-Dangme languages|Ga-Adangbe language]], [[Ewe language]] and [[Akan language]].
&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; This is because most of the Afro-Brazilian people got married to [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Adangbes]] and [[Akan people|Akans]] &lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt;

Because they were welcomed by the [[Ewe people]], [[Ga-Adangbe people]] and [[Akan people]] and received by their kings as personal guests, the Taboms received lands in privileged locations, in places that are nowadays very well known [[Housing estate|estates]], like Asylum Down, the area near to the central train station and around the [[Accra Brewery Company]].&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; In those areas, the mango trees planted by them bear silent witnesses to their presence. In the estate of [[North Ridge, Accra|North Ridge]] there is a street called âTabom Streetâ, which is a reminder of the huge plantations that they formerly had there.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; Some of the Taboms live nowadays in [[Jamestown, Ghana|James Town]], where the first house built and used by them as they arrived in South Ghana is located.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; It is called the "'''Brazil House'''" and can be found in a short street with the name âBrazil Laneâ.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt; Because of their agricultural skills, they started plantations of [[mango]], [[cassava]], beans and other vegetables. They brought also skills such as [[irrigation]] techniques, [[architecture]], [[carpentry]], [[blacksmith]]ing, [[gold smith]]ing, tailoring, amongst others, which certainly improved the quality of life of the whole community.&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt;

Nowadays the Taboms are completely integrated in the Ghanaian society and are a part of the 
[[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Adangbe People]], [[Ewe people|Ewe People]] and [[Akan people|Akan People]].&lt;ref name="Sou Brasileiro"/&gt;

'''Technosexual''' is an individual who either:

# has a strong [[aesthetic]] sense and a love of [[gadget]]s.  In this sense, the word is a [[portmanteau]] of [[technophile]] and [[metrosexual]], which was first promoted by [[creative professional]] Ricky Montalvo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Montalvo: There is a geek in all of us, so why not show us|url=http://howigeek.typepad.com/about.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004553/http://howigeek.typepad.com/about.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe "a [[dandy]]ish [[narcissist]] in love with not only himself, but also his urban lifestyle and gadgets; a [[heterosexual|straight]] man who is in touch with his [[feminine side]] but has fondness for [[consumer electronics|electronics]] such as [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[personal computer|computers]], [[social software|software]], and the [[Web 2.0|web]]."&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;"Word Spy contributors" (2004) [http://www.wordspy.com/words/technosexual.asp Technosexual] wordspy.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''tepoztopilli''''' {{IPA-nah|tepostoËËpiËlËi|}} was a common front-line weapon of the [[Aztec]] military. The tepoztopilli was a pole-arm, and to judge from depictions in various [[Aztec codices]] it was roughly the height of a man, with a broad wooden head about twice the length of the users' palm or shorter, edged with razor-sharp [[obsidian]] blades which were deeply set in grooves carved into the head, and cemented in place with [[bitumen]] or plant resin as an adhesive. This made the weapon vaguely similar to the ''[[macuahuitl]]'' or "[[macana]]", however it had a much smaller cutting edge and a longer handle.  This gave the weapon a superior reach, but blows had to be more carefully executed. 

Halfway between a [[halberd]] and a [[spear]],  the tepoztopilli was equally useful for slashing and thrusting. [[Conquistador]] [[Bernal DÃ­az del Castillo]] mentions that on one occasion his armour was pierced by an Aztec lance and that only his thick cotton underpadding saved his life. 
The last authentic tepoztopilli was destroyed in a fire in 1884 in the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid|ArmerÃ­a Real]] in Madrid where it was housed.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Engadinder-Post-Posta-Ladina.png|thumb|The newspaper [[Engadiner Post|Engadiner Post / Posta Ladina]] although published in the Upper Engadine, uses Vallader in most of its Romansh-language articles]]

'''Vallader''' ({{Audio|Roh-vallader-vallader.ogg|[vÉËlaËdÉr]}}) is a variety of the [[Romansh language]] spoken in the [[Lower Engadine]] valley (''Engiadina Bassa'') of southeast [[Switzerland]], between [[Martina, Switzerland|Martina]] and [[Zernez]]. It is also used as a written language in the nearby community of [[Val MÃ¼stair]], where [[Jauer (Romansh)|Jauer]] is spoken. In 2008, schools in the Val MÃ¼stair switched from Vallader to [[Rumantsch Grischun]] as their written language, but switched back to Vallader in 2012, following a referendum.

The name of the dialect is derived from ''val'' 'valley'. It is the second most commonly spoken variety of Romansh, with 6,448 people in the Lower Engadine valley (79.2%) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gross, Manfred (2004), Romanisch â Facts &amp; Figures (in German), Chur, {{ISBN|3-03900-034-9}}. p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Romansh can be separated into two dialect groups: Rhine dialects (Sursilvan, Sutsilvan and Surmiran) and Engadine dialects (Vallader and Puter).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Kotliarov|first = Ivan|title = The elision of unstressed vowels before the Latin sequence /ka/ in Western Romance languages|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/flih.2010.31.issue-1/flih.2010.004/flih.2010.004.xml|journal = Folia Linguistica Historica|volume = 44|issue = Historica vol. 31|doi = 10.1515/flih.2010.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of Vallader was also used in [[Samnaun]] until the late 19th century, when speakers switched to [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]]. The last speaker of the Romansh dialect of Samnaun, Augustin HeiÃ, died in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Ada Ritter: ''Historische Lautlehre der ausgestorbenen romanischen Mundart von Samnaun (Schweiz, Kanton GraubÃ¼nden).'' In: ''Romania Occidentalis.'' 6, Verlag A. Lehmann, Gerbrunn bei WÃ¼rzburg 1981, S. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long period of time, the oldest written form [[Puter]] held much prestige with its name. It was used as the language of the aristocratic Engadine tourist region near St. Moritz (San Murezzan). It was used most widely in the 19th century. Vallader has since become more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dKMxRp5wfw4C|title = Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance|last = Posner|first = Rebecca|date = 1993-01-01|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|isbn = 9783110848649|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialect Jauer, is actually a variety of Vallader spoken in Val MÃ¼stair. It is almost only spoken there, and is virtually never written.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Georg A.|date=March 2009|title=PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP "NULL-SUBJECTS, EXPLETIVES, AND LOCATIVES IN ROMANCE"|url=http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/3756/AP_123_25_03_09_endgueltig.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#page=165|journal=Fachbereich Sprachwissenschaft der UniversitÃ¤t Konstanz Arbeitspapier Nr. 123|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
[[Puter]] and Vallader are sometimes referred to as one specific variety known as Ladin, a term which can also refer to the closely related language in Italy's [[Dolomites|Dolomite mountains]] also known as [[Ladin language|Ladin]].

They are also considered Engadine dialects, since they are spoken in the area of the Engadines.

Vallader shares many traits with the [[Puter]] dialect spoken in the Upper Engadine. On the lexical level, the two varieties are similar enough to have a common dictionary.&lt;ref name="Oscar Peer 1962"&gt;Oscar Peer: ''Dicziunari rumantsch. Ladin - tudais-ch''. Chur 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Puter and Vallader share the rounded front vowels [y] and [Ã¸], which are not found in other Romansh varieties. These sounds make written Ladin easily distinguishable through the numerous occurrences of the letters {{angle bracket|Ã¼}} and {{angle bracket|Ã¶}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ricarda Liver: ''RÃ¤toromanisch. Eine EinfÃ¼hrung in das BÃ¼ndnerromanische.'' Narr, TÃ¼bingen 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonological differences==
In Vallader, the clitics are almost always well preserved, and there are no clustered forms that are known. On the other hand, Puter still preserves the clitic system completely.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Wanner: ''The Power of Analogy: An Essay on Historical Linguistics''. https://books.google.com/books?id=QHCfGc6_mTkC&amp;dq=vallader+phonology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Puter, Vallader spelling reflects the pronunciation more closely.

Another difference is that one class of verbs end in ''-ar'' in Vallader, whereas the ending in Puter is ''-er''. The differences in verb conjugation are more divergent however, as can be seen the simple present of ''avair'' 'to have':&lt;ref name="Oscar Peer 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jachen Curdin Arquint: ''Vierv Ladin''. Tusan 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impersonals ==
In Vallader, impersonals are formed using a third person singular reflexive verbal clitic. This is an important detail derived most likely from Italian or Spanish. This is also possible in Puter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Stephen R. |date=2006 |title=Verb Second, Subject Clitics, and Impersonals in Surmiran (Rumantsch) |journal=Proceedings of the annual meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=3â21 |doi=10.3765/bls.v32i1.3435 |issn=2377-1666 |url=http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/viewFile/3435/3148 |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Vallader, being one of the five dialects, is mainly used in the Val MÃ¼stair and Engadine regions. The name comes from the term "valley" so it's only right that it is found in these regions full of valleys.

As you can see on the map provided below, Vallder is used much more widely to the North East of Switzerland. This distinct difference in blue shades shows the areas of Upper and Lower Engadines. The Lower Engadines, as the chart suggests, speaks Puter, which shares many common features with Vallader. In the Upper Engadines, Vallader is spoken.

A larger issue at hand for the minority Vallader speakers is not only the use of Bavarian, High and Swiss German, but also the division of Romansh. This is especially evident for speakers of the Vallader dialect; since Puter is so closely related in both location and language, it makes the slight differences more cumbersome.

== Dialects ==
[[File:EuInVallader.jpg|thumb|The pronucation of the word ''eu'' ('I') in the various dialects of the Lower Engadine and the Val MÃ¼stair, as of 1962.&lt;ref name="Oscar Peer 1962"/&gt;]]
While written Vallader is standardized, speakers employ local dialects in oral use. Differences in speech often allow people to pinpoint the home village of another speaker. For example, the word ''eu'' 'I' can be pronounced as [{{IPA|ËÉË}}], [{{IPA|ËÉw}}], [{{IPA|ËjÉ}}], [{{IPA|ËjÉ}}], [{{IPA|Ëjow}}] and [{{IPA|Ëjaw}}], depending on the local dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Ricarda Liver: ''RÃ¤toromanisch. Eine EinfÃ¼hrung in das BÃ¼ndnerromanische.'' Narr, TÃ¼bingen 2010, S. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialect of the Val MÃ¼stair, Jauer, is distinguished through the ending ''-er'' instead of ''-ar'' for verbs of the first conjugation, and by the placement of stress on the penultimate syllable of these verbs. In addition, stressed /a/ is diphthongized in Jauer. All three traits can be seen in the verb 'to sing', which is ''chantÃ r'' in Vallader but ''chÃ unter'' in Jauer.

It is an important fact to keep in mind that Jauer is almost exclusively spoken. Vallader is not only the preferred written form, but it is also the most widely used one.

== Official status ==
As stated earlier, in 2008, schools in the Val MÃ¼stair switched from Vallader to [[Rumantsch Grischun]] as their written language. When they switched back to Vallader in 2012 following a referendum, it showed that Vallader is in danger but is still without a doubt seen as a (if not the most) reliable language, especially for writing. Since Jauer is used almost solely for speech, this allows more room for Vallader to exist as more of an entity in the world of writing.

It is the second most widely used variety of Romansh, with 6,448 people in the Lower Engadine valley (79.2%) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This area is the main driving force behind keeping Vallader relevant.

== Literature ==
The first written document in Vallader is the psalm book ''Vn cudesch da Psalms'' by [[Durich Chiampell]] from the year 1562.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwingliana.ch/index.php/zwa/article/download/1120/1030 Die vierfache Bedeutung Durich Chiampells], retrieved 18. October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important authors who have written in Vallader include [[Peider Lansel]], [[Men Rauch]], [[Men Gaudenz]], [[Andri Peer|Andri]] and [[Oscar Peer]], [[Luisa Famos]], [[Cla Biert]], [[Leta Semadeni]] and [[Rut Plouda-Stecher]].

The songwriter [[Linard Bardill]] also employs Vallader in addition to German and Rumantsch Grischun.

== Sample ==
The fable [[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The Fox and the Crow]] by [[Jean de La Fontaine]] in Vallader, as well as a translation into [[English language|English]], the similar-looking but noticeably different-sounding dialect Puter, the Jauer dialect, and Rumantsch Grischun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liarumantscha.ch/data/media/pdf/facts_figures/facts_figures_rumantsch.pdf Gross, Manfred (2004), Rumantsch â Facts &amp; Figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418160304/http://www.liarumantscha.ch/data/media/pdf/facts_figures/facts_figures_rumantsch.pdf |date=2012-04-18 }}.

'''Westhoughton Mill''' or '''Rowe and Dunscough's Mill''', in Mill Street in [[Westhoughton]], near [[Bolton]] in the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Lancashire]], was the site of a [[Luddite]] arson attack in 1812. The mill was built in 1804 by Richard Johnson Lockett, a Macclesfield man who lived at Westhoughton Hall.  He leased the mill to Thomas Rowe of Manchester in 1808.

During 1811 and 1812 Luddites had been attacking powered mills throughout the English North and Midlands to such an effect that the government in February 1812 passed the [[Destruction of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1812|Frame Breaking Act]] making the damaging of powered looms punishable by death. Skilled weavers lost their livelihoods when production moved from a [[Putting out system|domestic system]] to new manufactories causing severe hardship and unrest among the workers. Unemployed weavers joined the Luddites believing their only hope was to destroy the machines. The government repressed rebellion by punishing offenders severely. In 1812 Luddite disorder around Manchester reached its peak.&lt;ref name ="FactoryNook"&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.bolton.gov.uk/website/westhoughton/pages/Placesofinterest.aspx | title=Places of Interest The burning of Westhoughton factory (Factory Nook)| publisher=Bolton Council| accessdate= 15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday 28 April, a large crowd of weavers and mechanics gathered in Westhoughton with the intention of destroying the power looms in Rowe and Dunscough's Mill. The [[Scots Greys]], deployed in Bolton by the government to quell unrest, were sent for but all was quiet when the contingent arrived and they returned to their quarters. Soon after they left, the factory and its contents were set alight and when the military returned the premises were destroyed and the culprits had disappeared. Some rioters gathered in the village in the evening demanding food and drink or money and the military was recalled and the [[Riot Act]] was read. Information about the ringleaders was collected and 24 men were arrested and sent for trial at [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster Assizes]]. Some were discharged but, "for having wilfully and maliciously set on fire and burnt a Weaving Mill, Warehouse and Loom Shop in the possession of Thomas Rowe and Thomas Dunscough at Westhoughton", Job Fletcher, James Smith, Thomas Kerfoot and Abraham Charlson, were sentenced to death and hanged and nine men were transported. After the Luddite act, manufacturers avoided the township until Chadwick's Silk Mill was built in the early 1850s.&lt;ref name ="FactoryNook"/&gt; Westhoughton Hall was attacked at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.lan-opc.org.uk/Westhoughton/history.html| title=Calendar of Events in the History Westhoughton to 1910| publisher=Lancashire OnLine Parish Clerks| accessdate= 5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mill was rebuilt after the attack and converted to a corn mill, until it was bought in 1840 by Peter Ditchfield, a cotton manufacturer who restored it to a cotton mill. On his death in 1854 the mill, by then employing some 40 people, passed to his son, Peter Ditchfield, jnr. After many years of spinning cotton and making flock, production ceased and the mill stood empty. It was eventually demolished in 1912 and the site is still (2017) a vacant lot.&lt;ref&gt;Council information board, Ditchfield Gardens, Westhoughton&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Exodus to Kwango Region and establishment of the Yaka kingdom===

King Kasongo led the exodus of the Lunda westward around the 17th century, the most organized expedition towards the conquest of the Kwango region in the kingdom of Kongo. Some Lunda had already preceded this. These Lunda conquerors were endowed with three major qualities: diplomacy, sociability and The organization, which enabled them to found the '''Yaka kingdom''' in the seventeenth century, harmoniously integrating the pre-established Kongo nations. The Lunda used this "soft power", more than fighting, to favour the union of the two peoples, Lunda and Kongo, under the kingdom Yaka. Ethnologists and sociologists unanimously agree that, throughout Belgian colonial history, this kingdom was one of the best organized and Especially the most resistant to Western penetration.

The name Yaka is a title that the Kongo gave to their warriors. Upon the arrival of Lunda, the kingdom of Kongo was already weakened by Portuguese incursions. Thus, the resistance that the Lunda find in the Kwango region is that of the isolated local tribes Kongo, including the Mbala, Tsamba, Hungana, Pindi, Ngongo, rather than that of a United Kongo kingdom. The Lunda, these "biluwa", or foreigners, which Nothing resisted on their passage, capable of catching bullets and arrows, were also called "Iluwa" (foreigners) or Bayaka (Catchers of the balls and the arrows). Both the Lunda that arrived and the kongo warriors had similar traits, hence the exact titles being given to them.

The Lunda, who had an interest in integrating into their political organization the local tribes who had not fled the invasion or who did not want to fight, had in turn adopted the identity "Yaka" which, in addition to conferring on them a title of nobility of the "invincible", integrated them better In their new country.

They had also gradually adopted the Kongo language (hence the Kiyaka language being spoken amongst them, an offshoot of Kikongo). Much more, Lunda chiefs married Kongo women. The offspring identified themselves as Yaka rather than Lunda. Thus, the Yaka appellation had established itself as a generic identity Of the Lunda and Kongo inhabiting territories area under the authority of the '''Kiamvu Kasongo-Lunda''', namely the territories of Kasongo-Lunda, Kenge and Popokabaka.

The Lunda of Nzofu later came in the territory of Kahemba retain the Lunda identity and language. As for the territory of Feshi, they emigrated there in the middle of the 18th century from the Basuku, a group of Kongo, who disassociated themselves from the power of Kiamvu Kasongo-Lunda and whose leader "Meni Kongo" refused to submit to the authority of the latter. Some other Kongo groups: the Mbala, Tsamba, Hungana, Pindi and Ngongo, etc. Had already emigrated to the Kwilu, leaving behind them, brothers and sisters who, together with the Lunda, composed the Yaka kingdom. The five territories that make up Kwango are therefore a binational space, Kongo and Lunda.

The reconciliation is thus the end of the wars of conquest between Kongo ethnic groups and the Lunda in Kwango was sealed by a ceremony and a particular ceremony in which the chief Meni Kongo representing Of the original Tsamba clans of Feshi and the Lunda chiefs were to share the parrot, dog and cat raw meat. At the end of this ceremony, the representatives of two nations buried their war weapons and promised peaceful coexistence forever. The Kongo and the Lunda of Kwango have lived in perfect harmony since the beginning of the 19th century.

===Contact with the Europeans powers===

When the administration of Leopold II arrived in Kwango after their establishment in Bas-Congo, Kwango Was an organized kingdom; The power of Kiamvu Kasongo-Lunda was legitimized and respected by all the peoples, Kongo and Lunda. It was also well represented on the whole kingdom that stretched from Kasongo-Lunda to Popokabaka through the present territory of Kenge. Peace between the Bayaka (Kongo and Lunda under the power of the Kiamvu Kasongo-Lunda), their brothers, the Basuku of Meni Kongo in the Feshi and the Lunda of Nzofu in Kahemba.

It was therefore not by default of hospitality that the agents of the Belgian administration came up against a refusal in Kwango. They represented a power that could not coexist easily with the existing political power.

According to Crawford Young, the Lunda empires in Kwango and Katanga had understood that colonial occupation was an aggression to repel and fight. The other groups, apart from a few scattered revolts including that of BapendÃ©, had behaved as if the exploration and occupation of their spaces by strangers were normal. (C. Young, 1965: 295-6).

===The resistance Of Kiamvu against the European power===

By the year 1890, a skilled administrator named Dhanis came to negotiate his acceptance with King "'''Kiamvu" Tsiimba Nkumbi.''' It was not even with his replacement of the name of Dussart who sought to impose the Leopold administration on Kwango even by force''. It was then that in 1892 and 1893 there were two wars ranked between the two armies, that of the Kiamvu Tsiimba Nkumbi and that of the Leopoldian administration in which there were considerable losses on both sides. If the principal Belgian agent perished in the first war of 1892, the one which followed in 1893 with a greater reinforcement of soldiers of the public force saw the assassination of the '''Kiamvu Tsiimba Nkumbi'''.'' It was also the beginning of the destabilization of the kings, but not that of the kingdom or the resistance. In fact, the kings who were enthroned after this revolting event showed themselves more intransigent with respect to submission to the power of whites. Thus, faced with repression, they had the choice either to go into exile with their brothers, the Lunda of Angola, or to undergo forced relegation to Banningville or elsewhere. Mulombo kings DÃ©sirÃ© Nkulu and Chief Munene Nkenzi were deported respectively, while the Kiamvu Muana Koko Kodia Puanga found refuge in Angola in 1915. After the two bloody wars of 1892 and 1893, when the Kwango was militarily armed, the resistance assumed passive form. This took many forms, ranging from the subtle violence by leopard men '''"Masiona"''' to civil disobedience and the refusal to serve any power of oppression, to participate in any enterprise or to obey any colonial injunction. It was this passive resistance that continued throughout the colonial era until independence. When in 1908, Leopold II ceded the Congo to Belgium, the colonial administration, to whom the narrative of the resistance Yaka had already been made, tried to occupy the Kwango by force, but she stumbled upon the civil resistance whose main manifestation was the refusal of cooperation with the colonial agents. Even after the assassination in 1893 of the Kiamvu Tsiimba Nkumbi, under which open resistance was waged, the Bayaka continued civic resistance. Because of the unfortunate incidents of the conflict, and after 2 years of colonial military siege, the colonial mission in Kwango was abandoned. By way of punishment and fear

That the Kwango hindered the colonial work and wished to overthrows the sovereignty of the Congo, in the hands of the colonial administration, which in turn forced to administration to put the Kwango on hold; Which meant that no development project could be undertaken. This did not prevent the Bayaka associating themselves with nationalists message of Lumumba, due to their strong presence in Kinshasa, only a century later, they heavily precipitate in the movement of independence, especially as the party that brought them together "LUKA "(The Kwangolese Union for Freedom and Independence) which had as its main objective the independence. The Bayaka, by their strong mobilization in Kinshasa, contributed strongly to the events that precipitated the independence of the Congo in 1959 - 1960.

===The root cause of the Bayakaâs denigration===

If the Bayaka have a history so glorious, where are the disparagement they are subjected to? The denigration of the Bayaka was originally the work of the colonial agents. The latter, after having abandoned the Kwango, were to create the division to better establish their authority in neighbouring Bas-Congo and Kwilu. Which Then opened the propaganda of Bayaka, warriors and savages, as they did not accept western civilization. This became the means of dividing and reigning. This is how, from a colonial propaganda, stereotypes stick to the identity of Yaka, especially in Kinshasa, the capital, where all the tribes of the Congo eventually meet. Nevertheless, as can be seen in the writings of sociologists And Belgian ethnologists, the colonial administration recognized the organization and dynamism of the Bayaka. As all slanderous statements are made away from Kwango, or whispering, the Bayaka have imperturbably pursued their traditional activities in all areas: art, craftsmanship, construction, hunting, fishing and agriculture.

The Bayaka fell victim to their exceptional resistance to colonial oppression and exploitation. Those of the Kwango, have among other things, resisted fiercely efforts of "pacification" of the Force Publique and Leopold IIâs administration.

The Yaka people are a matrilineal society that includes patrilineal lineage as family name.&lt;ref name="LambekStrathern1998p133"/&gt; Their villages have chiefs, who are recognized by the Congo government as a political office.&lt;ref name=yakaiowa/&gt;

Their Traditional Religion has the concept of ''Ndzambyaphuungu'', or a Creator God who resides in the sky, but this creator is not a part of their celebrations or rituals. The religious practices and ceremonies are instead directed towards the ''Bambuta'' or the spirits of the ancestors, and these are also part of healing dances during illnesses.&lt;ref name=yakaiowa/&gt;&lt;ref name="LambekStrathern1998p133"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Michael Lambek]]|author2=Andrew Strathern|title=Bodies and Persons: Comparative Perspectives from Africa and Melanesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBLf6-jm7AQC&amp;pg=PA133|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62737-5|pages=133â135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yaka farm cassava, sweet potatoes, and corn as staple source of food, and supplement this with fish and game meat. They have traditionally hunted with the help of hunting dogs.&lt;ref name=yakaiowa/&gt; In contemporary times, they are also migrant workers in urban areas.&lt;ref name=brityaka/&gt;

The Yaka are notable for their arts and handicrafts. They make statues, portraits, baskets, carved objects, masks, tools for cooking, building, hunting, fishing or entertaining with additions of instruments such as drums. Their masks are bulky, distinctive with upturned noses and eyes shaped in the form of globules. These masks were frequently used in various Traditional Religion ceremonies.&lt;ref name=brityaka/&gt; Their sculptures called ''Mbwoolo'' and their carved slit drum called ''Mukoku'' are regionally famous and used in ritual dances.&lt;ref name=yakaiowa&gt;[https://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/peoples/show/Yaka Yaka: Art and Life in Africa], University of Iowa Museum of Art (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
