'''Amba''' (also known as ''Aba'', ''Nembao'' or ''Nebao'') is the main language spoken on the island of [[Utupua]], in the easternmost province of the [[Solomon Islands]].

==Name==
The speaker population calls [[Exonym and endonym|their own]] language {{IPA-all|aᵐba|}} (with [[prenasalization|prenasalised]] {{IPA-all|ᵐb|}}). This name may be rendered ''Amba'' or ''Aba'' depending on spelling conventions, which have not been fixed yet for these languages.

Speakers of neighbouring [[Asumboa language|Asumboa]] designate the Amba language as {{IPA-all|neᵐbao|}}. This form, which may be spelled ''Nembao'' or ''Nebao'', has sometimes been used by foreigners as another name for the Amba language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9406">In [[printing]], '''anilox''' is a method used to provide a measured amount of ink to a [[flexography|flexo]] [[printing plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Racey|first1=Graham|title=How to Optimise the performance of your anilox rolls in 3 steps|url=http://www.pamarco.com/how-to-optimise-the-performance-of-your-anilox-rolls-in-3-steps/|website=Pamarco|publisher=Pamarco|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anilox roll is a hard [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an [[industrial ceramic]] whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells.
   
==Usage== 
Depending on the [[image resolution|detail]] of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. Low line screen rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in [[CMYK color model|four-color process]] work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job.
Depending on the design of the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the [[ink]] fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically [[viscous]] ink is deposited on the roller. A [[doctor blade]] is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material.

Anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells.
Print results are accomplished with this volume, which transfers to the printing plate and then to the substrate. In general transfer efficiency is approximately 25% to the substrate.
Cell count remains the same for the life of the roll while volume changes over time due to wear, plugging and damage.
Cell count accommodates volume at various cell shapes available from the laser engraving process.
The same cell count can be engraved to or wear to different volumes.

Contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades.
One blade works as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.
Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.

==Roll manufacture and specification==
Anilox rolls were originally made using a process of mechanical engraving, utilizing hardened steel tools of various cell counts and cell shapes [[diamond]] [[pecking machine]], but modern rolls are [[laser engraving|laser engraved]].
The characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate: angle of the cells, cell [[volume]], and line screen. A 60 degree angle ensures maximum [[density]] in a given space. Lower volume makes for less ink. Low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed, whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing. Both cell volume and line screen are closely correlated.   

The rolls are often specified by their line screen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a line screen?|url=http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/color_line_screen.htm|website=depaul.edu|publisher=depaul.edu|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is the number of cells per linear inch. These often range from around 250 to upwards of 2000, though the precise numbers vary by manufacturer. Most rolls sold are within 800 LPI, although a spike in demand for those with 800–1200 lines has been seen. 
Anilox rolls are almost always designed to be removed from the press for cleaning and for [[interchangeable parts|swapping out]] with different line screen rolls.

See above: Anilox rolls are properly specified by cell volume for the required print application.
Lower volumes = thinner ink films for the highest quality process printing.
Higher volumes address combination, screens, line work, solid coverage and coating applications.
In virtually all printing applications with various print requirements, one volume will not print all to the highest quality. Limited print stations generally call for a compromise between the highest quality graphics and color.
There are many variables to consider when specifying an anilox roll beyond the print requirements, such as; substrate, ink system, plate material, plate mounting tape, press speed, drying capacity,...., etc.
Best course of action is to consult suppliers of all these components for proper engraving specifications from their experience.

=== Anilox roll specifications : Line Count or Transfer Volume ===
There are four ways to specify Anilox rolls settings. Based on transfer volume, based on line count, American standard and European standard.

==== Transfer Volume ====
The European standard for transfer volume is cm³/m² or cubic centimetre per square meter which means how much volume (cm³) of ink will be transferred on how much surface (m²) of paper.

Sometimes, ink suppliers will give a recommended transfer weight per square meter, expressed in g/m². In which case you need to know the ink density before converting g/m² to cm³/m². 

The American standard for transfer volume is BCM / in² also written BCM/sq in or BCM, which means billion cubic microns per square inch. Cubic microns (μm³) is a unit of volume and one billion cubic micron (1 000 000 000 μm³) is equal to 0.001 cm³, also we know that one square meter is equal to 1550 square inch.

So &lt;u&gt;1 BCM/in² = 1.55 cm³/m²&lt;/u&gt;

==== Line Count ====
Line count&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is s line screen?|url=http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/color_line_screen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; will measure the finesse of the pattern on the Anilox roll. It measures how many cells are engraved per centimetre or per inch.

In Europe the standard is LPCM or lines per centimetre.

In America, the standard is LPI or lines per inch.

The conversion from transfer volume to line count isn't straightforward. Because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll, the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink. So the only way to convert cm³/m² (transfer volume) to LPCM (cell finesse) or BCM to LPI is to look at the conversion chart provided by the anilox roll supplier.

Also, any given anilox roll will age after some time and its actual transfer volume will be less and less.

==Handling and maintenance==
Though large wide-web flexo rolls are only maneuverable by overhead [[Crane (machine)|crane]], on smaller presses anilox rolls are often handled directly by operators. Extreme caution must be taken when handling these pieces of hardware as a single bump against a hard surface or sharp corner can destroy the delicate cell structure on the surface and render a roller completely useless, at a cost of around {{USD}}5000 for even small narrow-web rollers. Nicks and scratches add up quickly, so fine brushes (never brass brushes) are used for cleaning the anilox roll. 

Anilox rollers that are used with water, solvent and oil based inks, which dry when left sitting out and unagitated, must be cleaned immediately after use or a problem known as plugging occurs, where minuscule amounts of ink dry in the cells. This leaves tiny, but unacceptable, [[pinhole]]s in anything printed from the roll in the future.

The "'''Anthon Transcript'''" (often identified with the "'''Caractors document'''") is a small piece of paper on which [[Joseph Smith]] wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, these characters were from the [[golden plates]] (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the [[Book of Mormon]]) and represent the [[reformed Egyptian]] writing that was on the plates. In 1828, this paper was delivered to [[Charles Anthon]], a well-known classical scholar of [[Columbia College, Columbia University]], for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Some adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates.&lt;ref name="JS-H"&gt;{{cite book|title=Joseph Smith–History|last=Smith, Jr.|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Smith|publisher=[[LDS Church]]|pages=56–57|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1/64-65|accessdate=29 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126144132/http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1//64-65|archivedate= 26 November 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Smith claim that Anthon believed any idea of reformed Egyptian was a hoax all along and that Harris was being deceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter XVIII|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/269/mode/1up|title=Mormonism Unvailed|author=[[E.D.

Bushman, ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Knopf, 2005), pp. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers claim that the incident between Harris and Anthon fulfilled a [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] made by [[Isaiah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Isaiah|isa|29|11|12}}, [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: &lt;br/&gt; 12  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.&lt;/ref&gt; as Anthon is reported to have said to Harris, through Smith's telling of events, "I cannot read a sealed book."&lt;ref name="lds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19830717&amp;id=5OUOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5099,1126329|title=Charles Anthon, Reluctant Witness|last=Smith|first=Calvin N.|date=17 July 1983|publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|accessdate=13 December 2009}} {{quote |In his 1841 letter, Anthon said that "no one until the present time has even requested from me a statement in writing."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Mark Hofmann]] created and sold a [[Anthon Transcript forgery|forgery of the Anthon Transcript]] to leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which was revealed to be fraudulent when Hofmann's crimes were investigated.

==Harris's account of meeting with Anthon==
In 1838, Smith related an account based on Harris's version of the meeting. Smith wrote that Anthon "stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. [Harris] then showed him those not yet translated, and said they were [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Chaldaic]], [[Akkadian language|Assyriac]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]"; and that they were "true characters." According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon was also reported to have confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an [[Angel Moroni|angel]] of God had revealed the characters to Smith, Anthon reportedly tore up the authentication stating that there was no such thing as angels and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Harris then went to Dr. [[Samuel L. Mitchill]], who sanctioned what Anthon said.&lt;ref name="lds"&gt;{{lds|Joseph Smith–History|js_h|1|62|65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Elden|title=Approximate Book of Mormon Translation Timeline|url=http://www.eldenwatson.net/BoM.htm|website=eldenwatson.net|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard E. Bennett]], [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=mormonhistory "'Read This I Pray Thee': Martin Harris and the Three Wise Men of the East"], ''[[Journal of Mormon History]]'' '''36''':178 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. McBride, [//history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-martin-harris "The Contributions of Martin Harris"], lds.org, 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthon's accounts of meeting with Harris==
In 1834, Anthon stated in a letter that, "The whole story about my having pronounced the Mormonite inscription to be 'reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics' is perfectly false .... I soon came to the conclusion that it was all a trick, perhaps a hoax .... [Harris] requested an opinion from me in writing, which of course I declined giving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=E. D.|chapter=Anthon to E. D. Howe|date=17 February 1834|title=[[Mormonism Unvailed]]|authorlink=E. D. Howe|location=Painesville, Ohio|publisher=Telegraph Press, 1834|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/270/mode/2up }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthon stated in the letter that the story of his supposed authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that he had told Harris that the writings were part of "a scheme to cheat the farmer [Harris] of his money".&lt;ref&gt;''So What's the Difference?'', pp. 154–56, Fritz Ridenour, ed., Regal Books (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthon gave a second account in 1841 that contradicted his 1834 account as to whether or not he gave Harris a written opinion about the document: "[Harris] requested me to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man's sake, and partly to let the individual 'behind the curtain' see that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them."&lt;ref name="SRA"/&gt; In both accounts, Anthon maintained that he told Harris that Harris was the victim of a fraud.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachman|first=Daniel W.|authorlink=Daniel W.

Ludlow|title=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]|location=New York|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]]|year=1992|isbn=0-02-879602-0|oclc=24502140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomeroy Tucker]], a contemporary of Harris and Smith, wrote in 1867 that all the scholars whom Harris visited "were understood to have scouted the whole pretense as too depraved for serious attention, while commiserating the applicant as the victim of fanaticism or insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism|last=Tucker|first=Pomeroy|authorlink=Pomeroy Tucker|year=1867|publisher=D.

==Caractors document==
The [[Community of Christ]] purchased the handwritten slip of paper known as the Anthon Transcript, or the Caractors document from the heirs of [[David Whitmer]].&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Whitmer, who once owned the document, stated that it was this slip of paper that Harris showed to Anthon. Both Mormon apologists and critics, however, claim that it is not certain that the document is the original, since Anthon had mentioned that the characters on the slip he saw were arranged in vertical columns and ended in a "rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the [[Aztec calendar]] given by Humboldt," (1834) or "a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac" (1841).&lt;ref name="SRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedigitalvoice.com/enigma/essays/AAffair1.htm|title=The Anthon Affair|author=Jerome J. Kniujet|year=2000|publisher=Spalding Research Associates|accessdate=14 December 2009}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2014}} {{quote |In 1834 Anthon wrote that "[Harris] requested an opinion from me in writing, which of course I declined giving."

Scott Lloyd, [https://www.lds.org/church/news/speaker-gives-new-insights-on-martin-harris-1828-visit-to-charles-anthon?lang=eng "Scholar Gives New Insights on Martin Harris's 1828 Visit to Charles Anthon"] (webpage), lds.org, accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols on the document were published twice in 1844, after Smith's death, as characters that had been copied from the gold plates, one of them in the December 21 issue of ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]''.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; In 1956 a request for review of the Caractors Document was made to three recognized Egyptologists, Sir Alan Gardiner, William C.. Hayes, and John A. Wilson. Gardiner replied that he saw no resemblance with "any form of Egyptian writing." Hayes stated that it might be an inaccurate copy of something in [[hieratic script]] and that "some groups look like hieratic numerals", adding that "I imagine, however, that the inscription bears a superficial resemblance to other scripts, both ancient and modern, of which I have no knowledge." Wilson gave the most detailed reply, saying that "This is not Egyptian writing, as known to the Egyptologist. It obviously is not hieroglyphic, nor the "cursive hieroglyphic" as used in the Book of the Dead. It is not Coptic, which took over Greek characters to write Egyptian. Nor does it belong to one of the cursive stages of ancient Egyptian writing: hieratic, abnormal hieratic, or demotic."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/31894670/1956_Statements_of_Egyptologists_on_the_Caractors_Document&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is portrayed in the 2004 film ''[[The Work and the Glory (film)|The Work and the Glory]]''.

[[File:kilnerfig.jpg|thumb|200px|Representation of a human aura, after a diagram by [[Walter John Kilner]] (1847–1920).]]

An '''aura''' or '''human energy field''' is, according to [[New Age]] beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=55}} [[Psychics]] and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura.{{sfn|Hines|2002|p=427}}

In New Age [[alternative medicine]], the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called [[chakra]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} Such claims are not supported by [[scientific evidence]] and are [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=362–69}} When tested under [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]], the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheiber|first1=Béla|last2=Selby|first2=Carla|title=Therapeutic Touch|date=2000|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=1573928046|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], ''aura'' means wind, breeze or breath. It was used in [[Middle English]] to mean "gentle breeze". By the end of the 19th century, the word was used in some spiritualist circles to describe a speculated subtle emanation around the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=aura |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marques|first1=A.|title=The Human Aura: A Study|publisher=Office of Mercury|pages=1–2 and preface|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jj9DAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles Webster Leadbeater.019.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] is credited with developing and popularizing the concept of auras.]]
The concept of auras was first popularized by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], a former priest of the Church of England and a member of the mystic [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=686}} Leadbeater had studied [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in India, and believed he had the capacity to use his clairvoyant powers to make scientific investigations.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=193}} He claimed that he had discovered that most men come from Mars but the more advanced men come from the Moon, and that [[hydrogen]] atoms are made of six bodies contained in an egg-like form.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=220–22}} In his book ''Man Visible and Invisible'' published in 1903, Leadbeater illustrated the aura of man at various stages of his moral evolution, from the "savage" to the [[saint]].{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leadbeater|first1=Charles Webster|title=Man Visible and Invisible: Examples of Different Types of Men as Seen by Means of Trained Clairvoyance|date=2012|publisher=New Theosophical Press|isbn=9781471747038|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Leadbeater introduced the modern conception of auras by incorporating the [[Tantra|Tantric]] notion of [[chakra]]s in his book ''The Inner Life''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=183}} But Leadbeater didn’t simply present the Tantric beliefs to the West, he reconstructed and reinterpreted them by mixing them with his own ideas, without acknowledging the sources of these innovations. Some of Leadbeater’s innovations are describing chakras as energy vortexes, and associating each of them with a gland, an organ and other body parts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=184–87}}

In the following years, Leadbeater’s ideas on the aura and chakras where adopted and reinterpreted by other Theosophists such as [[Rudolf Steiner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rudolf|last2=Creeger|first2=Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos|date=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, New York|isbn=0880103736|page=159|edition=3rd|url=https://steiner.presswarehouse.com/sites/steiner/research/archive/theosophy/theosophy.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edgar Cayce]], but his occult anatomy remained of minor interest within the esoteric counterculture until the 1980s, when it was picked up by the New Age movement.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=187}}

In 1977, American esotericist [[Christopher Hills]] published the book ''Nuclear Evolution: The Rainbow Body'', which presented a modified version of Leadbeater’s occult anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hills|first1=Christopher|title=Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body|date=1977|publisher=University of the Trees Press|location=Boulder Creek, California|isbn=9780916438098|page=36|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bXRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Leadbeater had drawn each chakras with intricately detailed shapes and multiple colors, Hills presented them as a sequence of centers, each one being associated with a color of the rainbow. Most of the subsequent New Age writers will base their representations of the aura on Hill’s interpretation of Leadbeater’s ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=188}} Chakras became a part of mainstream esoteric speculations in the 1980s and 1990s. Many New Age techniques that aim to clear blockages of the chakras were developed during those years, such as [[crystal healing]] and aura-soma.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=92}} Chakras were, by the late 1990s, less connected with their theosophical  and Hinduist root, and more infused with New Age ideas. A variety of New Age books proposed different links between each chakras and colors, personality traits, illnesses, Christian sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myss|first1=Caroline|title=Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing|date=1997|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=9780609800140|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NmwwRCv52SAC|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=189}} Various type of holistic healing within the New Age movement claim to use aura reading techniques, such as [[bioenergetic analysis]], [[energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and [[energy medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Barbara Ann|title=Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553345397|pages=109–10|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?output=html_text&amp;id=M3dOAgz05bQC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Character+structure |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous attempts to capture an energy field around the human body, going as far back as photographs by a French army officer in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baraduc|first1=Hippolyte|title=L'ame humaine: ses mouvements, ses lumières et l'iconographie de l'invisible fluidique|date=1896|publisher=G. Carré|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tD8wAAAAYAAJ|page=61|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural interpretations of these images have often been the result of a lack of understanding of the simple natural phenomena behind them, such as heat emanating from a human body producing aura-like images under [[infrared photography]].&lt;ref name=Nickell&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Nickell |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aura_photography_a_candid_shot/ |title=Aura Photography: A Candid Shot  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baraducforcevital.tif|thumb|left|150px|Picture by Hippolyte Baraduc published in 1896, purported to show a "vital force" around a child.]]
In 1939, [[Semyon Davidovich Kirlian]] discovered that by placing an object or body part directly on photographic paper, and then passing a high voltage across the object, he would obtain the image of a glowing contour surrounding the object. This process became known as [[Kirlian photography]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=240–43}} Some parapsychologists, such as [[Thelma Moss]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], have proposed that these images show levels of psychic powers and bioenergies. However, studies have found that the Kirlian effect is caused by the presence of moisture on the object being photographed. Electricity produces an area of gas ionization around the object if it is moist, which is the case for living things. This causes an alternation of the electric charge pattern on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pehek|first1=JO|last2=Kyler|first2=HJ|last3=Faust|first3=DL|title=Image modulation in corona discharge photography |journal=Science |date=15 October 1976|volume=194|issue=4262|pages=263–70|pmid=968480}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rigorous experimentations, no mysterious process has been discovered in relation to the Kirlian photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=edited by Kendrick|title=The Hundredth monkey and other paradigms of the paranormal : a Skeptical inquirer collection|date=1991|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=0879756551|pages=209–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=427–28}}

More recent attempts at capturing auras include the Aura Imaging cameras and software introduced by Guy Coggins in 1992. Coggins claims that his software uses [[biofeedback]] data to color the picture of the subject. The technique has failed to yield reproducible results.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

==Tests==
[[File:Aura_testing.jpg|thumb|right|An aura reader tested in a [[Scientific control|controlled experiment]] at the [[Observatoire Zététique]], May 2004]]

Tests of psychic abilities to observe alleged aura emanations have repeatedly been met with failure.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

One test involved placing people in a dark room and asking the psychic to state how many auras she could observe. Only chance results were obtained.&lt;ref name="Loftin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftin|first1=Robert W.|title=Auras: Searching for the Light|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1990|volume=24|pages=403–09|publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of auras has occasionally been tested on television. One test involved an ''aura reader'' standing on one side of a room with an opaque partition separating her from a number of slots which might contain either actual people or mannequins. The aura reader failed to identify the slots containing people, incorrectly stating that all contained people.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/auras.html |title= Auras|accessdate=2006-12-15|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205221945/http://skepdic.com/auras.html| archivedate= 5 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another televised test another aura reader was placed before a partition where five people were standing. He claimed that he could see their auras from behind the partition. As each person moved out, the reader was asked to identify where that person was standing behind the slot. He identified 2 out of 5 correctly.&lt;ref name=Randi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZeQGld5QBU |title=James Randi tests an aura reader|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prove the existence of auras scientifically have repeatedly met with failure; for example people are unable to see auras in complete darkness, and auras have never been successfully used to identify people when their identifying features are otherwise obscured in controlled tests.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loftin/&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Randi/&gt; A 1999 study concluded that conventional sensory cues such as radiated body heat might be mistaken for evidence of a metaphysical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Bernhardt/publication/230683042_Perception_of_Conventional_Sensory_Cues_as_an_Alternative_to_the_Postulated'Human_Energy_Field'of_Therapeutic_Touch/links/55eda87108aedecb68fb074e.pdf |title=Perception of Conventional Sensory Cues as an Alternative to the Postulated'Human Energy Field'of Therapeutic Touch (PDF Download Available) |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.|year=1999|issue=Fall/Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==

Bridgette Perez in a review for the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has written "perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations might promote belief in auras... Psychological factors, including absorption, fantasy proneness, vividness of visual imagery, and after-images, might also be responsible for the phenomena of the aura."&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bridgette M. Perez |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_aura_a_brief_review/ |title=The Aura: A Brief Review  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in laboratory conditions have demonstrated that the aura is best explained as a visual illusion known as an [[afterimage]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Harris, D. F. (1932). ''A psycho physiological explanation of the so-called human "aura"''.  British Journal of Medical Psychology 12: 174–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, A., Anderson, D. &amp; Wyman, L. (1978).  ''Perceptual Aura: Not Spirit but Afterimage and Border Contrast Effects''.  ''[[Perceptual and Motor Skills]]'' 47: 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologists contend that people may perceive auras because of effects within the brain: [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]]s, or the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]] such as [[LSD]].&lt;ref name="ASID"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Donna L|last2=Daroff|first2=Robert B|last3=Ducros|first3=Anne|last4=Newman|first4=Nancy J|last5=Biousse|first5=Valérie|title=Most Cases Labeled as "Retinal Migraine" Are Not Migraine|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=March 2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–8|doi=10.1097/WNO.0b013e3180335222|url=http://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&amp;issue=03000&amp;article=00002&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015956/http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Familial occipitotemporal lobe epilepsy and migraine with visual aura |publisher=Neurology.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Andrew Neher has written that "there is no good evidence to support the notion that auras are, in any way, psychic in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Andrew|title=The Psychology of Transcendence|date=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486261670|pages=186–88|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that auras may be the result of [[synaesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/auras.html |title=auras – The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Skepdic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2012 study discovered no link between auras and synaesthesia, concluding "the discrepancies found suggest that both phenomena are phenomenologically and behaviourally dissimilar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milán|first1=E.G.|last2=Iborra|first2=O.|last3=Hochel|first3=M.|last4=Rodríguez Artacho|first4=M.A.|last5=Delgado-Pastor|first5=L.C.|last6=Salazar|first6=E.|last7=González-Hernández|first7=A.|title=Auras in Mysticism and Synaesthesia: A Comparison|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=March 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=258–68|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has written "Given the weight of the evidence it seems that the connection between auras and synaesthesia is speculative and based on superficial similarities that are likely coincidental."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella |first=Steven |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/05/07/is-aura-reading-synaesthesia-probably-not/ |title=Is Aura Reading Synaesthesia? Probably Not |publisher=Skepticblog |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes may include disorders within the [[visual system]] provoking optical effects.

==In popular culture==
* The book ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'', written by Cyril Henry Hoskin under the pseudonym [[Lobsang Rampa]], claims that Tibetan monks opened the spiritual third eye using [[trepanation]] in order to accelerate the development of clairvoyance and allow to see the aura. It also includes body gazing techniques purported to help achieve aura visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampa|first1=Lobsang|title=The Third Eye|date=1988|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=9780345340382|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered to be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yapp|first1=Nick|title=Hoaxers and Their Victims|date=1993|publisher=Parkwest|location=London|isbn=9780860517818|pages=140–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodin|first1=Thierry|title=Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies|date=2001|publisher=Wisdom Publishing|location=Boston|isbn=9780861711918|pages=196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1486">'''Autocommunication''' is a term used in [[communication studies]], [[semiotics]] and other [[cultural studies]] to describe communication from and to oneself. This is distinguished from the more traditionally studied form of communication where the sender and the receiver of the message are separate. This can be called ''heterocommunication''.

Where heterocommunication gives the receiver new information, autocommunication does not. Instead it enhances and restructures the receiver's ego. Both forms of communication can be found either in individuals or within organisations. When autocommunication is done by an individual it can be called [[intrapersonal communication]].

Autocommunication is typical for religious or artistic works. [[Prayer]]s, [[mantra]]s and [[personal journal|diaries]] are good examples. In organisations and corporations strategic plans and memos, for example, can function like mantras. But any text (or work) can become autocommunicational if it is read many times over.

'''Bank effect''' refers to the tendency of the [[stern]] of a [[ship]] to swing toward the near bank when operating in a river or constricted [[waterway]].

The asymmetric flow around a ship induced by the vicinity of banks causes pressure differences ([[Bernoulli's principle]]) between port and starboard sides. As a result, a [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|lateral force]] will act on the ship, mostly directed towards the closest bank, as well as a [[Yaw angle|yawing moment]] pushing her bow towards the centre of the waterway. The [[squat effect]] increases due to the decreased blockage.

This can be seen on this footage [http://www.bankeffects.ugent.be/meas.html video bank effects] taken during model tests in a [[towing tank]] at [http://www.shallowwater.ugent.be/EN/kc_fac_st_EN.htm Flanders Hydraulics Research]

This phenomenon depends on many parameters, such as bank shape, water depth, ship-bank distance, ship properties, ship speed and [[propeller|propeller action]]. A reliable estimation of bank effects is important for determining the limiting conditions in which a ship can safely navigate a waterway.

This phenomenon has several different names, including bank suction, bank cushion, stern suction, and ship-bank interaction.

==Mathematical content==
The Conjecture claims that any convex, closed and sufficiently smooth surface in three dimensional [[Euclidean space]] needs to admit at least two [[umbilic point]]s. In the sense of the Conjecture, the [[spheroid]] with only two umbilic points and the [[sphere]], all points of which are umbilic, are examples of surfaces with minimal and maximal numbers of the umbilicus. For the conjecture to be well posed, or the [[umbilic point]]s to be well-defined,  the surface needs to be at least twice differentiable.

==Mathematical research on an approach by a local umbilic index estimate for real analytic surfaces==

The invited address of [[Stefan Cohn-Vossen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephan Cohn-Vossen|S. Cohn-Vossen]], ''Der Index eines Nabelpunktes im Netz der Krümmungslinien'', Proceedings of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], vol II, Nicola Zanichelli Editore, Bologna 1929&lt;/ref&gt;  to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] of 1928  in [[Bologna]] was on the subject and in the 1929 edition of [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]'s third volume on Differential Geometry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Wilhelm Blaschke |first=W. |last=Blaschke |title=Differentialgeometrie der Kreise und Kugeln, Vorlesungen über Differentialgeometrie, vol. 3 |series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften |volume=XXIX |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=Berlin |year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While this book goes into print, Mr. Cohn-Vossen has succeeded in proving that closed real-analytic surfaces do not have umbilic points of index &gt; 2 (invited talk at the ICM in Bologna 1928). This proves the conjecture of Carathéodory for such surfaces, namely that they need to have at least two umbilics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Blaschke's index is twice the usual definition for an index of an umbilic point, and the global conjecture follows by the [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem|Poincaré–Hopf index theorem]]. No paper was submitted by Cohn-Vossen to the proceedings of the International Congress, while in later editions of Blaschke's book the above comments were removed. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that this work was inconclusive.

For analytic surfaces, an affirmative answer to this conjecture  was given in 1940 by [[Hans Hamburger]] in a long paper published in three parts.&lt;ref name="Hamburger 1940"/&gt; The approach of Hamburger was also via a local index estimate for isolated umbilics, which he had shown to imply the Conjecture in his earlier work.&lt;ref name="Hamburger1922"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Hamburger |authorlink=Hans Hamburger |year=1922 |title=Ein Satz über Kurvennetze auf geschlossenen Flächen |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin |volume=21 |issue= |pages=258–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Hamburger |year=1924 |title=Über Kurvennetze mit isolierten Singularitäten auf geschossenen Flächen |journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift|Math. Z.]] |volume=19 |issue= |pages=50–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, a shorter proof was proposed by [[Gerrit Bol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Bol |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN266833020_0049&amp;DMDID=dmdlog42 |title=Über Nabelpunkte auf einer Eifläche |journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift|Math. Z.]] |volume=49 |issue= |pages=389–410 |year=1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see also,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Blaschke |title=Sugli ombelichi d'un ovaloide |journal=Atti Convegno Mat. Roma |volume=1942 |year=1942 |pages=201–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in 1959, Tilla Klotz found and corrected a gap in Bol's proof in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On G. Bol's proof of Carathéodory's conjecture |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics|Commun. Pure Appl. Math.]] |volume=12 |issue= |pages=277–311 |year=1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamburger 1940"/&gt; Her proof, in turn, was announced to be incomplete in Hanspeter Scherbel's dissertation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=H. |last=Scherbel |title=A new proof of Hamburger's index theorem on umbilical points |work=Dissertation no. 10281 |year=1993 |publisher=[[ETH Zürich]] |type=PhD }}&lt;/ref&gt; (no results of that dissertation related to the Carathéodory conjecture were published for decades, at least nothing was published up to June 2009). Among other publications we refer to papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. J. |last=Titus |title=A proof of a conjecture of Loewner and of the conjecture of Carathéodory on umbilic points |journal=[[Acta Mathematica|Acta Math.]] |volume=131 |issue=1—2 |pages=43–77 |year=1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Sotomayor |first2=L. F. |last2=Mello |title=A note on some developments on Carathéodory conjecture on umbilic points |journal=Exposition Math. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |year=1999 |issn=0723-0869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Gutierrez |first2=J. |last2=Sotomayor |title=Lines of curvature, umbilic points and Carathéodory conjecture |journal=Resen. Inst. Mat. Estat. Univ. São Paulo |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=291—322 |year=1998 |issn=0104-3854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the proofs mentioned above are based on Hamburger's reduction of the Carathéodory conjecture to the following conjecture: '''the index of every isolated umbilic point is never greater than one'''.&lt;ref name="Hamburger1922"/&gt; Roughly speaking, the main difficulty lies in the resolution of singularities generated by umbilical points. All the above-mentioned authors resolve the singularities by induction on 'degree of degeneracy' of the umbilical point, but none of them was able to present the induction process clearly.

In 2002, Vladimir Ivanov revisited the work of Hamburger on analytic surfaces with the following stated intent:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V. V. |last=Ivanov |title=The Analytic Carathéodory Conjecture |journal=[[Siberian Mathematical Journal|Sib. Math. J.]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=251–322 |year=2002 |issn=0037-4474 |doi=10.1023/A:1014797105633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"First, considering analytic surfaces, we assert with full responsibility that Carathéodory was right. Second, we know how this can be proved rigorously. Third, we intend to exhibit here a proof which, in our opinion, will convince every reader who is really ready to undertake a long and tiring journey with us."

First he follows the way passed by Gerrit Bol and Tilla Klotz, but later he proposes his own way for singularity resolution where crucial role belongs to [[complex analysis]] (more precisely, to techniques involving analytic [[implicit function]]s, [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]], [[Puiseux series]], and circular [[root system]]s).

==Mathematical research on the original global conjecture for smooth surfaces==

In 2008, Guilfoyle and Klingenberg announced a proof of the global conjecture for surfaces of smoothness &lt;math&gt;C^{3,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. Their method uses neutral [[Kähler manifold|Kähler geometry]] of the [[Klein quadric]], [[mean curvature flow]], the [[Riemann–Roch theorem|Riemann–Roch index theorem]], and the [[Sard's theorem|Sard–Smale theorem]] on regular values of Fredholm operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=B. |last=Guilfoyle |first2=W. |last2=Klingenberg |title=Proof of the Carathéodory Conjecture |work= |arxiv=0808.0851 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preprint has not yet been published, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Ghomi |title=Open problems in geometry of curves and surfaces |url=https://people.math.gatech.edu/~ghomi/Papers/op.pdf |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ghomi and Howard showed, using a [[Möbius transformation]], that the global conjecture for surfaces of smoothness C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be reformulated in terms of the number of umbilic points on graphs subject to certain asymptotics of the gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Ghomi |first2=R. |last2=Howard |title=Normal curvatures of asymptotically constant graphs and Carathéodory's conjecture |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.]] |volume=140 |year=2012 |issue= |pages=4323–4335 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-2012-11420-0 |arxiv=1101.3031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5503">A '''cardiac shunt''' is a pattern of blood flow in the heart that deviates from the normal circuit of the [[circulatory system]]. It may be described as [[right-to-left shunt|right-left]], left-right or bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or [[pulmonary-to-systemic shunt|pulmonary-to-systemic]]. The direction may be controlled by [[left heart|left]] and/or [[right heart]] [[blood pressure|pressure]], a biological or [[artificial heart valve]] or both. The presence of a shunt may also affect left and/or right heart pressure either beneficially or detrimentally.

==Terminology==
[[File:Atrial septal defect-en.png|thumb|Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt]]
The left and right sides of the [[heart]] are named from a dorsal view, i.e., looking at the heart from the back or from the perspective of the person whose heart it is. There are four chambers in a heart: an atrium (upper) and a ventricle (lower) on both the left and right sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19612.htm | title =Heart chambers | vauthors = ((National Library of Medicine)),((National Institutes of Health)),Dugdale DC, Zieve D, Chen MA, Ogilvie I,((A.D.A.M. editorial team)) | publisher =nlm.nih.gov | date =June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s, blood from the body goes to the [[right side of the heart]] first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/craigs/How%20Your%20Heart%20Works.htm |title=How Your Heart Works |author2=''[[Montana State University]]'' |author=Carl Bianco |publisher=montana.edu |date=May 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516092450/http://www.montana.edu/craigs/How%20Your%20Heart%20Works.htm |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood enters the upper [[right atrium]], is pumped down to the [[right ventricle]] and from there to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/heart-blood-vessels/how-does-blood-flow-through-heart.aspx | title =How Does Blood Flow Through the Heart? | author =''[[Cleveland Clinic]]'' | publisher =clevelandclinic.org | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood going to the lungs is called the [[pulmonary circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/systems/pulmonary.html |title=Body Systems Pulmonary Circulation: It's All in the Lungs |author=''[[The Franklin Institute]]'' |publisher=fi.edu |date=May 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505075001/http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/systems/pulmonary.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the blood returns to the heart from the lungs via the pulmonary vein, it goes to the [[left side of the heart]], entering the upper [[left atrium]]. Blood is then pumped to the lower [[left ventricle]] and from there out of the heart to the body via the aorta. This is called the [[systemic circulation]]. A cardiac shunt is when blood follows a pattern that deviates from the systemic circulation, i.e., from the body to the right atrium, down to the right ventricle, to the lungs, from the lungs to the left atrium, down to the left ventricle and then out of the heart back to the systemic circulation.

A left-to-right shunt is when blood from the left side of the heart goes to the right side of the heart. This can occur either through a hole in the ventricular or atrial septum that divides the left and the right heart or through a hole in the walls of the arteries leaving the heart, called [[great vessels]]. Left-to-right shunts occur when the [[systolic blood pressure]] in the left heart is higher than the right heart, which is the normal condition in birds and mammals.

==Congenital shunts in humans==
The most common [[congenital heart defect]]s ('''CHD'''s) which cause shunting are [[atrial septal defect]]s ('''ASD'''), patent foramen ovale (PFO), [[ventricular septal defect]]s ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus|patent ductus arteriosi]] ('''PDA'''). In isolation, these defects may be [[asymptomatic]], or they may produce [[symptom]]s which can range from mild to severe, and which can either have an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] or a delayed onset. However, these shunts are often present in combination with other defects; in these cases, they may still be asymptomatic, mild or severe, acute or delayed, but they may also work to counteract the negative symptoms caused by another defect (as with [[d-Transposition of the great arteries]]).

Some acquired shunts are modifications of congenital ones: a [[balloon septostomy]] can enlarge a [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] (if performed on a [[newborn]]), PFO or ASD; or [[prostaglandin]] can be administered to a newborn to prevent the [[ductus arteriosus]] from closing. [[Biological tissue]]s may also be used to construct artificial passages.

===Mechanical===
Mechanical shunts such as the [[Blalock-Taussig shunt]] are used in some cases of CHD to control [[circulatory system|blood flow]] or blood pressure.

==Reptile==
{{see also|Reptile#Circulation}}
All reptiles have the capacity for cardiac shunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=James |year=2002 |title=The Physiological and Evolutionary Significance of Cardiovascular Shunting Patterns in Reptiles  |journal=News in Physiological Sciences |volume=17 |pages=241–245 |pmid=12433978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22073">'''Computerized physician order entry''' ('''CPOE'''), sometimes referred to as '''computerized provider order entry''' or '''computerized provider order management''' ('''CPOM'''), is a process of electronic entry of medical practitioner instructions for the treatment of patients (particularly [[hospital]]ized patients) under his or her care.

The entered orders are communicated over a [[computer network]] to the medical staff or to the departments ([[pharmacy]], laboratory, or [[radiology]]) responsible for fulfilling the order. CPOE reduces the time it takes to distribute and complete orders, while increasing efficiency by reducing [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors including preventing duplicate order entry, while simplifying inventory management and billing. 

CPOE is a form of [[patient management software]].&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009). http://healthit.ahrq.gov/images/jan09cpoereport/cpoe_issue_paper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required data==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
In a graphical representation of an order sequence, specific data should be presented to CPOE system staff in cleartext, including: 

* identity of the patient
* role of required member of staff
* resources, materials and medication applied
* procedures to be performed
* operational sequence to be obeyed
* feedback to be noted
* case specific documentation to build

Some textual data can be reduced to simple graphics.

==CPOE related terminology==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
CPOE systems use terminology familiar to medical and nursing staff, but there are different terms used to classify and concatenate orders. The following items are examples of additional terminology that a CPOE system programmer might need to know:

===Filler===
The application responding to, ''i.e.'', performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation.  The filler can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders.

===Order===
A request for a service from one application to a second application. In some cases an application is allowed to place orders with itself.

===Order detail segment===
One of several segments that can carry order information. Future ancillary specific segments may be defined in subsequent releases of the Standard if they become necessary.

===Placer===
The application or individual originating a request for services (order).

===Placer order group===
A list of associated orders coming from a single location regarding a single patient.

===Order Set===
A grouping of orders used to standardize and expedite the ordering process for a common clinical scenario. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a licensed physician.)

===Protocol===
A grouping of orders used to standardize and automate a clinical process on behalf of a physician. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a nurse, pharmacist, or other licensed health professional.)

==Features of CPOE systems==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
Features of the ideal computerized physician order entry system (CPOE) include:
;Ordering :Physician orders are standardized across the organization, yet may be individualized for each doctor or specialty by using order sets. Orders are communicated to all departments and involved caregivers, improving response time and avoiding scheduling problems and conflict with existing orders.
;Patient-centered [[decision support]] :The ordering process includes a display of the patient's medical history and current results and evidence-based [[Guideline (medical)|clinical guidelines]] to support treatment decisions.  Often uses [[medical logic module]] and/or [[Arden syntax]] to facilitate fully integrated [[Clinical decision support system|Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)]].
;[[Patient safety]] features : The CPOE system allows real-time patient identification, drug dose recommendations, [[adverse drug reaction]] reviews, and checks on allergies and test or treatment conflicts. Physicians and nurses can review orders immediately for confirmation.
;Intuitive [[Human interface]]: The order entry workflow corresponds to familiar "paper-based" ordering to allow efficient use by new or infrequent users.
;Regulatory compliance and security : Access is secure, and a permanent record is created, with [[electronic signature]].
;Portability : The system accepts and manages orders for all departments at the point-of-care, from any location in the health system (physician's office, hospital or home) through a variety of devices, including wireless [[computer|PCs]] and [[tablet computer]]s.
;Management :The system delivers statistical reports online so that managers can analyze patient census and make changes in staffing, replace inventory and audit utilization and productivity throughout the organization. Data is collected for training, planning, and [[root cause analysis]] for [[patient safety]] events.
;Billing :Documentation is improved by linking diagnoses ([[ICD-9-CM]] or [[ICD-10-CM]] codes) to orders at the time of order entry to support appropriate charges.

==Patient safety benefits==
In the past, physicians have traditionally hand-written or verbally communicated orders for patient care, which are then [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] by various individuals (such as unit clerks, [[nurses]], and ancillary staff) before being carried out.  Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=1999 | url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx | title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1999) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2012-12-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909192347/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx | archivedate=2013-09-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=2001 | url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309072808/html | title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error.

The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-quality-infection-control/study-cpoe-systems-improve-prophylactic-antibacterial-use-in-surgical-patients.html&lt;/ref&gt; CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in [[pharmacy informatics]] work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.

==Advantages==

Generally, CPOE is advantageous, as it leaves the trails of just better formatting retrospective information, similarly to traditional hospital information systems designs. The key advantage of providing information from the physician in charge of treatment for a single patient to the different roles involved in processing he treatise itself is widely innovative. This makes CPOE the primary tool for information transfer to the performing staff and lesser the tool for collecting action items for the accounting staff. However, the needs of proper accounting get served automatically upon feedback on completion of orders.

CPOE is generally not suitable without reasonable training and tutoring respectively. As with other technical means, the system based communicating of information may be inaccessible or inoperable due to failures. That is not different to making use of an ordinary telephone or with conventional hospital information systems. Beyond, the information conveyed may be faulty or erratic. A concatenated validating of orders must be well organized. Errors lead to liability cases as with all professional treatment of patients.

Prescriber and staff inexperience may cause slower entry of orders at first, use more staff time, and is slower than person-to-person communication in an emergency situation. Physician to nurse communication can worsen if each group works alone at their workstations.

But, in general, the options to reuse order sets anew with new patients lays the basic for substantial enhancement of the processing of services to the patients in the complex distribution of work amongst the roles involved. The basic concepts are defined with the clinical pathway approach. However, success does not occur by itself. The preparatory work has to be budgeted from the very beginning and has to be maintained all the  time. Patterns of proper management from other service industry and from production industry may apply. However, the medical methodologies and nursing procedures do not get affected by the management approaches.

==Risks==

CPOE presents several possible dangers by introducing new types of errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross Koppel | year = 2005 | title = Role of Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | pages = 1197–1203 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197 | format = abstract | pmid = 15755942 | issue = 10 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lohr  | first = Steve  | title = Doctors' Journal Says Computing Is No Panacea  | publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2005-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09compute.html?ei=5089&amp;en=402b792e748d99a2&amp;ex=1268110800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;adxnnlx=1150474153-xVix1BcYkvTKJpuLyHStrQ  | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation causes a false sense of security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an ''increased'' mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s Pediatric [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] when a CPOE systems was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=Yong Y.

CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Santell |first=John P |year=2004 |url=http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf |title=Computer Related Errors: What Every Pharmacist Should Know |format=PDF |publisher=United States Pharmacopia |accessdate=2006-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120194519/http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing CPOE to a complex medical environment requires ongoing changes in design to cope with unique patients and care settings, close supervision of overrides caused by automatic systems, and training, testing and re-training all users.

==Implementation==
CPOE systems can take years to install and configure. Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Kaufman  | first = Marc  | title = Medication Errors Harming Millions, Report Says.

Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Connolly  | first = Ceci | title = Cedars-Sinai Doctors Cling to Pen and Paper  | publisher = The Washington Post  | date = 2005-03-21   | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52384-2005Mar20.html|accessdate = 2006-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so a major effort must be focused on [[change management]], including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.

An early success with CPOE by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) is the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture or [[VistA]]. A [[graphical user interface]] known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's record at any computer in the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders by CPOE, including medications, special procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets and laboratory tests.

The world's first successful implementation of a CPOE system was at [[El Camino Hospital]] in Mountain View, California in the early 1970s. The Medical Information System (MIS) was originally developed by a software and hardware team at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in Sunnyvale, California, which became the TMIS group at Technicon Instruments Corporation. The MIS system used a light pen to allow physicians and nurses to quickly point and click items to be ordered.

{{As of|2005}}, one of the largest projects for a national EHR is by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the [[United Kingdom]].  The goal of the NHS is to have 60,000,000 patients with a centralized [[electronic health record]] by 2010. The plan involves a gradual roll-out commencing May 2006, providing  [[general practice]]s in England access to the [[National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT). The NHS component, known as the "Connecting for Health Programme",&lt;ref&gt;NHS Connecting for Health: [http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/delivery/ Delivering the National Programme for IT] Retrieved August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; includes office-based CPOE for medication prescribing and test ordering and retrieval, although some concerns have been raised about [[patient safety]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C J Morris |author2=B S P Savelyich |author3=A J Avery |author4=J A Cantrill |author5=A Sheikh | year = 2005 | title = Patient safety features of clinical computer systems: questionnaire survey of GP views | journal = Quality and Safety in Health Care | volume = 14 | pages = 164–168 | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/14/3/164 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1136/qshc.2004.011866 | pmid = 15933310 | issue = 3 | pmc = 1744017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and the [[New England Healthcare Institute]] (NEHI) published research showing that 1 in 10 patients admitted to a [[Massachusetts]] community hospital suffered a preventable medication error. The study argued that Massachusetts hospitals could prevent 55,000 adverse drug events per year and save $170 million annually if they fully implemented CPOE. The findings prompted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enact legislation requiring all hospitals to implement CPOE by 2012 as a condition of licensure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&amp;cnt=614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Hospitals Must Have CPOE By 2012 And CCHIT-Certified EHRS By 2015: [http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2008/08/13/massachusetts-hospitals-must-have-cpoe-by-2012-and-cchit-certified-ehrs-by-2015/] Retrieved April 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Dolan  | first = Pamela L.  | title = Insurer finds EMRs won't pay off for its doctors.  | publisher = American Medical News  | year = 2008  | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/03/10/bil20310.htm | accessdate = 2009-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also concludes that it would cost approximately $2.1 million to implement a CPOE system, and a cost of $435,000 to maintain it in the state of Massachusetts while it saves annually about $2.7 million per hospital.  The hospitals will still see payback within 26 months through reducing hospitalizations generated by error.  Despite the advantages and cost savings, the CPOE is still not well adapted by many hospitals in the US.

The Leapfrog’s 2008 Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  publisher = The Leapfrog Group  | year = 2008  | title = Leapfrog Hospital Survey Results.  | url = http://www.leapfroggroup.org/media/file/leapfrogreportfinal.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that most hospitals are still not complying with having a fully implemented, effective CPOE system.  The CPOE requirement became more challenging to meet in 2008 because the Leapfrog introduced a new requirement: Hospitals must test their CPOE systems with Leapfrog’s CPOE Evaluation Tool.  So the number of hospitals in the survey considered to be fully meeting the standard dropped to 7% in 2008 from 11% the previous year.  Though the adoption rate seems very low in 2008, it is still an improvement from 2002 when only 2% of hospitals met this Leapfrog standard.

{{About|a statement of belief}}
[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] depicting [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine]] (center) and the Fathers of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) as holding the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] of 381]]
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

A '''creed''' (also known as a ''confession'', ''symbol'', or ''statement of faith'') is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets.

One of the most widely used creeds in [[Christianity]] is the [[Nicene Creed]], first formulated in AD 325 at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. It was based on Christian understanding of the [[Canonical Gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the [[Trinity]], is generally taken as a fundamental test of [[orthodoxy]] for most [[Christian denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Johnson, Phillip R. "The Nicene Creed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apostles' Creed]] is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the [[#Christians without creeds|authority of those creeds]].

[[Muslim]]s declare the ''[[shahada]]'', or testimony: "I bear witness that there is no god but (the One) God ''([[Allah]])'', and I bear witness that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] is God's messenger."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamiclearningmaterials.com/shahada.html "Proclaiming the Shahada is the First Step Into Islam."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303214355/http://islamiclearningmaterials.com/shahada.html |date=2009-03-03 }} Islamic Learning Materials. Accessed: 17 May 2009. See also [http://www.ismailmohr.de/shahada.html "The Shahada, or  Shahāda / kalimatu-sh-shahādah / kelime-i şehadet."] A. Ismail Mohr. Accessed: 28 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Although some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which begins: "Hear, O Israel: the {{Lord}} our God, the {{Lord}} is one."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{see also|Credo}}
The word ''creed'' is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of [[liturgy]]. The term is anglicized from Latin ''credo'' "I believe", the [[incipit]] of the Latin texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]. A creed is sometimes referred to as a ''symbol'' in a specialized meaning of that word (which was first introduced to [[Late Middle English]] in this sense), after Latin ''symbolum'' "creed" (as in ''[[Symbolum Apostolorum]]'' = "Apostles' Creed"), after Greek ''symbolon'' "token, watchword".&lt;ref&gt;Justo L. Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', 2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some longer statements of faith in the [[Protestant]] tradition are instead called "confessions of faith", or simply "confession" (as in e.g. [[Helvetic Confession]]).
Within [[Evangelicalism]], the terms "doctrinal statement" or "doctrinal basis" tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on [[lectionary]] and [[translations of the Bible]], particularly in [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] churches of the [[King James Only movement]].

The term ''creed'' is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of ''[[ʿAqīdah|ʿaqīdah]]'' (literally "bond, tie") is often rendered as "creed".

==Christian creeds==
{{main|List of Christian creeds}}
Several creeds have originated in [[Christianity]].
* [[1 Corinthians 15]], 3–7 includes an early creed about Jesus' death and resurrection which was probably received by Paul. The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem apostolic community]].&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus—God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed.

* The [[Old Roman Creed]] is an earlier and shorter version of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. It was based on the 2nd century Rules of Faith and the interrogatory declaration of faith for those receiving [[baptism]], which by the 4th century was everywhere tripartite in structure, following Matthew 28:19.
* The [[Apostles' Creed]] is widely used by most [[Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechetical]] purposes.
* The [[Nicene Creed]] reflects the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Kiefer, James E. "The Nicene Creed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Chalcedonian Creed]] was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 in Asia Minor. It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.
* The [[Athanasian Creed]] (''Quicumque vult'') is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.
* The [[Tridentine Creed]] was initially contained in the [[papal bull]] ''[[Iniunctum Nobis]]'', issued by [[Pope Pius IV]] on November 13, 1565.  The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).
* The [[Maasai Creed]] is a creed composed in  1960 by the [[Maasai people]] of East Africa in collaboration with  missionaries  from the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]]. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Maasai culture.
* The [[Credo of the People of God]] is a profession of faith that [[Pope Paul VI]] published with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Solemni hac liturgia'' of 30 June 1968. Pope Paul VI spoke of it as "a profession of faith, ... a creed which, without being strictly speaking a dogmatic definition, repeats in substance, with some developments called for by the spiritual condition of our time, the [[Nicene Creed|creed of Nicea]], the creed of the immortal tradition of the holy Church of God."

==Christian confessions of faith==
Protestant denominations are usually associated with confessions of faith, which are similar to creeds but usually longer.
* The ''Sixty-seven Articles'' of the Swiss reformers, drawn up by [[Zwingli]] in 1523;
* The ''[[Schleitheim Confession]]'' of the [[Anabaptist]] [[Swiss Brethren]] drawn up in 1527 – (being Anabaptist, this confession was not Protestant in the usual sense);
* The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' of 1530, the work of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], which marked the breach with [[Rome]];
* The ''[[Tetrapolitan Confession]]'' of the [[German Reformed Church]], 1530;
* The ''[[Smalcald Articles]]'' of Martin Luther, 1537
* The ''[[Guanabara Confession of Faith]]'', 1558, the first Protestant writing in the Americas. By the martyr [[French Huguenots]]  [[Jean du Bourdel]], [[Matthieu Verneuil]], [[Pierre Bourdon]] and [[André la Fon]] at the site of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].
* The ''[[Gallic Confession]]'', 1559;
* The ''[[Scots Confession]]'', drawn up by [[John Knox]] in 1560;
* The ''[[Belgic Confession]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/BelgicConfession.html |title=The Belgic Confession |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawn up by [[Guido de Bres]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prca.org/books/portraits/debres.htm |title=Guido de Bres |publisher=Prca.org |date=2000-04-20 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1561;
* The ''[[Thirty-nine Articles]]'' of the [[Church of England]] in 1562;
* The ''[[Formula of Concord]]'' and its Epitome in 1577;
* The ''[[Irish Articles]]'' in 1615;
* The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' in 1647 was the work of the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] and has commended itself to the [[Presbyterian Church]]es of all English-speaking peoples, and also in other languages.
* The ''[[Savoy Declaration]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/Savoy_Declaration/ |title=The Savoy Declaration 1658 – Contents |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1658 which was a modification of the Westminster Confession to suit [[Congregationalist polity]];
* The ''[[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Baptist Confession]]'' of 1689 which had much in common with the Westminster Confession, but differed from it on a number of distinctions held important by the English [[Calvinistic]] [[Baptists]];
* The ''Confession of Faith of the [[Calvinistic Methodists]] (Presbyterians) of Wales''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creeds.net/cmwales/main.htm |title=Confession of Faith of the Calvinistic Methodists or Presbyterians of Wales }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1823.
* The ''[[Confession of Faith (United Methodist)|Confession of Faith]]'' of the [[United Methodist Church]], adopted in 1968

==Christians without creeds==
Some Christian denominations, and particularly those descending from the [[Radical Reformation]], do not profess a creed. This stance is often referred to as "non-creedalism". The [[Religious Society of Friends]], also known as the Quakers, consider that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. The [[Church of the Brethren]] and other [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] churches also espouses no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their "rule of faith and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Harold S.: [http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=88 "Forward"], "Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] contrast "memorizing or repeating creeds" with acting to "do what Jesus said".&lt;ref&gt;"Creeds—Any Place in True Worship?", ''Awake!'', October 8, 1985, ©Watch Tower, page 23, "The opening words of a creed invariably are, “I believe” or, “We believe.” This expression is translated from the Latin word “credo,” from which comes the word “creed.” ...What do we learn from Jesus’ words? That it is valueless in God’s eyes for one merely to repeat what one claims to believe. ...Thus, rather than memorizing or repeating creeds, we must do what Jesus said"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] do not share a creed.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Bill. "Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed." ''St. Petersburg Times.'' Apr 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Many evangelical Protestants similarly reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance. The [[Baptists]] have been non-creedal "in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another".&lt;ref name=Avis&gt;Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, {{ISBN|0-281-05246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} While many Baptists are not opposed to the ancient creeds, they regard them as "not so final that they cannot be revised and re-expressed. At best, creeds have a penultimacy about them and, of themselves, could never be the basis of Christian fellowship".&lt;ref name=Avis/&gt;{{rp|112}} Moreover, Baptist "confessions of faith" have often had a clause such as this from the First London (Particular) Baptist Confession (Revised edition, 1646):
{{quote|Also we confess that we now know but in part and that are ignorant of many things which we desire to and seek to know: and if any shall do us that friendly part to show us from the Word of God that we see not, we shall have cause to be thankful to God and to them.}}

Similar reservations about the use of creeds can be found in the [[Restoration Movement]] and its descendants, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]]. Restorationists profess "no creed but Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Harp|title=George A. Klingman|url=http://www.therestorationmovement.com/_states/texas/klingman.htm|website=Restoration History|publisher=Buford Church of Christ|accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[John Shelby Spong]], retired [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Bishop of Newark, has written that dogmas and creeds were merely "a stage in our development" and "part of our religious childhood." In his book, ''Sins of the Scripture'', Spong wrote that "Jesus seemed to understand that no one can finally fit the holy God into his or her creeds or doctrines. That is idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many people said (the Apostles Creed), but they understood what it was saying and what they meant by that quite differently. No matter how hard they tried, they could not close out this perennial debate. They cannot establish a consensus and they could not agree on the meaning of that phrase which had been once "delivered to the saints." It did not occur to these people that the task they were trying to accomplish was not a human possibility, that the mystery of God, including the God they believed they had met in Jesus, could not be reduced to human words and human concepts or captured inside human creeds. Nor did they understand that the tighter and more specific their words became, the less they would achieve the task of unifying the church. All creeds have ever done is to define those who are outside, who were not true believers; and thus their primarily achievement has been to set up eternal conflict between the "ins" and the "outs," a conflict that has repeatedly degenerated into the darkest sort of Christian behavior, including imperialism, torture, persecution, death and war.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John S. ''The sins of Scripture.'' HarperCollins, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-06-076205-6}}, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es, there was a quarrel about the Apostles' Creed in the mid-19th century. As a result, most cantonal reformed churches stopped prescribing any particular creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|43205|Apostolikumsstreit|author=Rudolf Gebhard|date=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latter Day Saints ==
{{main|Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)}}
Within the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the ''Articles of Faith'' are a list composed by [[Joseph Smith]] as part of an 1842 [[The Wentworth Letter|letter]] sent to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|"Long" John Wentworth]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]''. It is canonized with the "Bible", the "Book of Mormon", the "Doctrine &amp; Covenants" and ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]'', as part of the [[standard works]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Creedal works include:

==Jewish creed==
{{see also|Jewish principles of faith}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
Whether [[Judaism]] is creedal in character has generated some controversy. [[Rabbi]] [[Milton Steinberg]] wrote that "By its nature Judaism is averse to formal creeds which of necessity limit and restrain thought" and asserted in his book ''Basic Judaism'' (1947) that "Judaism has never arrived at a creed." The 1976 Centenary Platform of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], an organization of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis, agrees that "Judaism emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life."

Others,{{who|date=January 2013}} however, characterize the [[Shema Yisrael]]{{Bibleref2c|Deut.|6:4}} as a creedal statement in strict [[monotheism]] embodied in a single prayer: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" ({{lang-he|שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד}}; [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad'').

A notable statement of [[Jewish principles of faith]] was drawn up by [[Maimonides]] as his [[13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith", in ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I'', Mesorah Publications, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic creed==
{{main|ʿAqīdah|Iman (concept)}}
The [[shahada]], the two-part statement that "There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God" is often popularly called "the Islamic creed" and its utterance is one of the [[five pillars of Islam|"five pillars"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.islam-guide.com/ch3-16.htm|title=Islam Guide: What Are the Five Pillars of Islam?|website=www.islam-guide.com|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic theology, the term most closely corresponding to "creed" is  ''[[ʿAqīdah|ʿaqīdah]]'' ({{lang|ar|عقيدة}})
The first such creed was written as "a short answer to the pressing heresies of the time" is known as ''Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar'' and ascribed to [[Abū Ḥanīfa]].&lt;ref name=Glasse&gt;Glasse, Cyril (2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">The '''crony-capitalism index''' aims to indicate whether the livelihood of the people from certain country or city with a capitalist economy are easily affected by [[crony capitalism]]. It is not an internationally recognized index due to its limitations.&lt;ref name=limit&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economist develops a crony capitalism index (good attempt but falls short)|url=http://www.againstcronycapitalism.org/2014/03/the-economist-develops-a-crony-capitalism-index-good-attempt-but-falls-short/|accessdate=20 March 2014|author=Nick Sorrentino|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a new measurement of crony capitalism designed by ''[[The Economist]]'' newspaper based on the "work by Ruchir Sharma of [[Morgan Stanley]] Investment Management, Aditi Gandhi and Michael Walton oew Delhi's [[Centre for Policy Research]], and others" in 2014.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web|title=Our crony-capitalism index: Planet Plutocrat |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet |publisher=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2014|author=The Economist|authorlink=The Economist|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The index aims to be a measuring trend in the number of economic [[rent-seeking|rent-seekers]]. The assumption behind is because of the favorable political policies set by the government officials, the [[:en:tycoon|tycoons]] are increasing their wealth and interest. As a result, they get a larger part of people’s fruits of labor, instead of generating more wealth for the whole society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More pragmatism needed over Hong Kong's land policy |url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1451158/more-pragmatism-needed-over-hong-kongs-land-policy |publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Howard Inn|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some extreme cases, some favored suppliers are influential on the establishment and application of the business-impacting laws and citizens pay the tax for purchasing the overpriced products supplied by the favored corporations.

==Methodology==
Ten of the industries that are susceptible to [[monopoly]] or require licensing or highly depend on the government have been selected: casinos; coal, palm oil and timber; defense; deposit-taking banking and investment banking; infrastructure and pipelines; ports; airports; real estate and construction; steel and other metals; mining and commodities; utilities and telecoms services. Then, the total wealth of world’s billionaires who actively involve in rent-heavy industries from the data of [[Forbes]] will be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires |url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/#tab:overall |work=Forbes|authorlink=Forbes|accessdate=28 March 2014|author=Forbes|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results can be achieved from the ratio of billionaire wealth to [[GDP]] in their own countries; higher ratio of billionaire wealth to [[GDP]] indicates higher possibility of suffering from [[crony capitalism]].

==Result==
===2016===
The 2016 index was published on May 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21698239-across-world-politically-connected-tycoons-are-feeling-squeeze-party-winds The party winds down].India is ranked at ninth position in crony-capitalism with crony sector wealth accounting for 3.4 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), according to a new study by The Economist. 

In India, the non-crony sector wealth amounts to 8.3 per cent of the GDP, as per the latest crony-capitalism index. 

In 2014 ranking also, India stood at the ninth place.

==Limitations==

===Concealing fortunes===
The phenomenon of concealing fortunes is common for cronies, especially in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Elite Wealth in Offshore Tax Havens, Leaked Files Show |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-22/chinas-elite-wealth-in-offshore-tax-havens-show-leaked-files |work=BloombergBusinessweek|accessdate=30 March 2014|author= Dexter Roberts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revealed that some of the powerful politicians have disguised their properties by transferring it under the names of their friends and family members. Unreliable property records are also believed to be the obstacles of determining an individual’s actual wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin the Perónist |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/nina-l--khrushcheva-examines-the-affinities-between-russia-s-leader-and-argentina-s-post-war-strongman |work=Project Syndicate |accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Nina L. Khrushcheva |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the cronies are not willing to announce their wealth publicly has affected the accuracy of the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economist’s Crony Capitalism Index Does Not Measure Crony Capitalism |url=http://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2014/03/31/the-economists-crony-capitalism-index-does-not-measure-crony-capitalism/ |work=The Global Anticorruption Blog |accessdate=30 March 2014|author=Eden Schiffmann|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rough categorization===
''[[The Economist]]'' roughly categorizes the industrial sectors with neglected critical instances of cronyism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politicians’ Extortion Racket |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/opinion/politicians-extortion-racket.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2014|author= Peter Schweizer|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Limited data of crony===
The index has only counted the wealth of billionaires which contributed to the omission of extensive data. Due to the lack of data, particular industries in a certain country cannot be exactly identified as "crony heavy". A group of cronies can also possibly be enriched by plenty of rent-seeking while not wealthy enough to achieve the cut-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting corruption in India: A bad boom |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21598967-graft-india-damaging-economy-country-needs-get-serious-about-dealing-it |work=The Economist|accessdate=29 March 2014|author=The Economist|authorlink=The Economist|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this group will not be examined in the index. The index is only a crude guide to the concentration of wealth in opaque industries compared with more competitive ones.

==="Good governance" factor===
Public opinion has been weighted heavily when determining which governments are better.&lt;ref name=limit/&gt; Political consultant Nick Sorrentino wrote that ''The Economist'' "was afraid to go completely down the (anti) cronyism path because if one really examines cronyism it is tied in deeply with modern government".&lt;ref name=limit/&gt; Certain kinds of cronyism that involved fewer of the top social classes, such as the [[military-industrial complex]] in the United States, fail to be reflected in the index, which diminishes its accuracy.&lt;ref name=limit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5206">'''DWIM''' ('''do what I mean''') computer systems attempt to anticipate what users intend to do, correcting trivial errors automatically rather than blindly executing users' explicit but potentially incorrect inputs.

==Software==
The term was coined by [[Warren Teitelman]] in his DWIM package for [[BBN Lisp]], part of his PILOT system, some time before 1966.&lt;ref name='pilot'&gt;Warren Teitelman, "PILOT: A Step towards Man-Computer Symbiosis", [[M.I.T.]] Ph.D. Dissertation, [[Project MAC]] MAC-TR-32, September 1966. [http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0638446 DTIC AD0638446] [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/AD638446 PDF]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='teitelman'&gt;Warren Teitelman, "Toward a programming laboratory", in J. N. Buxton and [[Brian Randell]], ''Software Engineering Techniques'', April 1970, a report on a conference sponsored by the NATO Science Committee, Rome, Italy, 27–31 October 1969, p. 108''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Walker, Lewis M. Norton (Eds.): Proceedings of the 1st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Washington, DC, p 715, May 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitelman's DWIM package "correct[ed] errors automatically or with minor user intervention",&lt;ref name='teitelman' /&gt; similarly to a [[spell checker]] for natural language.

Teitelman and his [[Xerox PARC]] colleague [[Larry Masinter]] later described the philosophy of DWIM in the [[Interlisp]] [[programming environment]] (the successor of BBN Lisp): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although most users think of DWIM as a single identifiable package, it embodies a pervasive philosophy of user interface design: at the user interface level, system facilities should make reasonable interpretations when
given unrecognized input. ...the style of interface used throughout Interlisp allows the user to omit various parameters and have these default to reasonable values...&lt;br&gt;

DWIM is an embodiment of the idea that the user is interacting with an agent who attempts to interpret the
user's request from contextual information. Since we want the user to feel that he is conversing with the system,
he should not be stopped and forced to correct himself or give additional information in situations where the correction or information is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Teitelman, Larry Masinter, "The Interlisp Programming Environment", ''Computer'' (IEEE) '''14''':4:25-33, April 1981. {{doi|10.1109/C-M.1981.220410}} [http://larry.masinter.net/interlisp-ieee.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of DWIM claimed that it was "tuned to the particular typing mistakes to which
Teitelman was prone, and no others" and called it "Do What Teitelman Means," "Do What Interlisp Means"&lt;ref&gt;Guy L. Steele Jr., Richard P. Gabriel, "The Evolution of Lisp", in ''History of programming languages---II'', 1996, {{ISBN|0-201-89502-1}} {{doi|10.1145/234286.1057818}}, p. 16. [http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/HOPL2-Uncut.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or even claimed DWIM stood for "Damn Warren's Infernal Machine." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/DWIM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The DWIM concept has been adopted by users of the [[GNU Emacs]] [[text editor]] to describe [[Emacs Lisp]] functions or commands that "do the right thing" depending on context,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DoWhatIMean|title=Do What I Mean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not specifically correct the user's typing. The Emacs [[wiki]] gives the example of a file copy command that is able to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] the destination path from a split window configuration that contains two [[dired]] windows, one of which displays the source path. DWIM functionality is often mentioned in the command's name; GNU Emacs has a &lt;code&gt;comment-dwim&lt;/code&gt; function that comments out a selected region if uncommented, or uncomments it when already commented out, using comment characters and indentation appropriate for the environment and current context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Comment-Tips.html|title=Comment Tips|quote=Generally speaking, the M-; (comment-dwim) command automatically starts a comment of the appropriate type; or indents an existing comment to the right place, depending on the number of semicolons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Comment-Commands.html|title=Comment Commands|quote=The command to create or align a comment is M-; (comment-dwim). The word “dwim” is an acronym for “Do What I Mean”; it indicates that this command can be used for many different jobs relating to comments, depending on the situation where you use it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dumun''' is a nearly extinct [[Rai Coast languages|Rai Coast]] language spoken in [[Madang Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]].

Dumun is reported to go by the name '''Bai''', but evidently this is a distinct (though related) language, or at least a variety called Bai recorded by Maclay was distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2843435/Systematic_typological_comparison_as_a_tool_for_investigating_language_history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glottolog2" /&gt;

'''Dzao Min''' ({{zh|藻敏}}, Zao Min), is a [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien language]] of China. Mao (2004:306) reports a total of more than 60,000 speakers in [[Liannan County]] and [[Yangshan County]] of [[Guangdong]], and in [[Yizhang County]] of [[Hunan]]. The speakers from Bapai, Guangdong are also called Bapai Yao (八排瑶族).

==Distribution==
The ''Chenzhou Prefecture Gazetteer'' (1996) reports that there are 1,200 "Bapai Yao" (八排瑶) or "Zao Min" (藻敏) in Huangjiapan Village 黄家畔村, Mangshan Township 莽山乡, [[Yizhang County]], Hunan. They are reported to have migrated from Taipingdong 太平洞, Chengjia District 称架区, [[Yangshan County]], Guangdong in the 16th century.

Long Guoyi (2011) covers the six Zao Min dialects of Daping 大坪, Junliao 军寮, Mangshan 莽山, Nan'gang 南岗, Panshi 盘石, and Youling 油岭.&lt;ref&gt;龙国贻 [Long Guoyi] (2011). [http://lib.cnki.net/cdmd/10052-1011159807.html 藻敏瑶语语音研究].&lt;/ref&gt; Long reports that other than in Liannan County, small pockets of Zao Min speakers are located in:
*Taipingdong Village, Chengjia District, [[Yangshan County]] 阳山县秤架区太平洞村
*Huangjiabang Village, Mangshan Township, [[Yizhang County]] 宜章县莽山乡黄家塝村
*Longxi Village, Dongping Township, [[Ruyuan County]] 乳源县东坪镇龙溪村
*[[Lianshan County]] 连山壮族瑶族自治县
*[[Yangchun]] County 阳春县 (in Guigang 圭岗镇 and Yongning 永宁镇 towns). In Yongning Town 永宁镇, there are some elderly Zao Min (locally known as Pai Yao 排瑶) speakers surnamed Mai 麦 who are located in Tiedong 铁垌瑶族村 village; on the other hand, the Guoshan Yao 过山瑶 of neighboring Hengdong 横垌瑶族村 village, who belong to the Zhao 赵 clan, can all speak Iu Mien.&lt;ref name="Yangjiang"&gt;http://www.yangjiang.gov.cn/mlyj/lswh/msfq/201504/t20150415_162769.html&lt;/ref&gt; Yangchun County has 8,228 ethnic Yao and  450 Yao speakers.&lt;ref name="Yangjiang"/&gt; There are also ethnic Yao living in Yunrong village 云容瑶族自治村 of Yangchun County.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">'''Estray''', in law, is any [[domestic animal]] found wandering at large or lost, particularly if the owner is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/estray|title=Estray|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases this includes domesticated animals and not pets.

Under early English [[common law]], estrays were forfeited to the king or lord of the manor; under modern statutes, provision is made for taking up stray animals and acquiring either title to them or a lien for the expenses incurred in keeping them. A person taking up an estray has a qualified ownership in it, which becomes absolute if the owner fails to claim the animal within the statutory time limit. Whether the animal escaped through the owner's negligence or through the wrongful act of a third person is immaterial. If the owner reclaims the estray, he is liable for reasonable costs of its upkeep. The use of an estray during the period of qualified ownership, other than for its own preservation or for the benefit of the owner, is not authorized. Some statutes limit the right to take up estrays to certain classes of persons, to certain seasons or places, or to animals requiring care.

When public officials, such as a county [[sheriff]] impound stray animals, they may sell them at auction to recover the costs of upkeep, with proceeds, if any, going into the public treasury.   In some places, an uncastrated male [[livestock]] animal running at large may be [[castration|neutered]] at the owner's expense.

It is common in the US for there to be a required "Notice of Estray" sworn and filed in a local office. The process usually takes a prescribed time to permit the property owner to collect his property. Otherwise, the finder obtains title to the property.

{{Quotation|'''ESTRAYS'''

'''1 Definition.''' There is no strictly accurate definition of an estray to be found in any reported decision but from all of them may be deduced the following: An estray is an animal, by nature tame and reclaimable, having a value as property generally recognized by law, as a sheep, ox, hog, or horse, which is found wandering and the owner of which is unknown. Animals on which the law sets no value as a dog or cat and animals ''ferae naturae'' as a bear or wolf cannot be considered as estrays.

'''2 Right to Forfeit.'''  a. '''At Common Law''' The right to forfeit the title of the owner to estrays has been recognized from a very remote period. At the common law they were originally forfeited to the king as the general owner and lord paramount of the soil; and later they most commonly belonged to the lord of the manor by special grant from the crown.|From ''The American and English Encyclopaedia Law and Practice'', 1910, Vol. III, p. 1030&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHAsAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was one of the first [[Esperantists]] in the world, and was able to communicate in over 100 different languages. In 1891, Lorenz moved to [[Brazil]] due to political reasons.{{clarify|date=August 2017}} In Brazil, he lived firstly in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and then in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Southern Brazil]]). Lorenz published over 36 books in 40 languages and was one of the most prominent promoters of [[Esperanto movement]] ever in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Francés Blanc]], "O Lorencovi", in František Vladimír Lorenc, ''[http://edicions.talvera.free.fr/bastidas/Franti%9aek%20Vladim%edr%20LORENC.%20Uplna%20ucebnice%20mezinarodniho%20reci%20dra%20Esperanta.pdf Úplná učebnice mezinárodní řeči dra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5771">In [[computer science]], '''garbage in, garbage out''' ('''GIGO''') describes the concept that flawed, or nonsense [[input (computer science)|input]] data produces nonsense [[input/output|output]] or "garbage". 

The principle also applies more generally to all [[analysis]] and [[logic]], in that [[argument]]s are unsound if their [[premise]]s are flawed.

==History==
It was popular in the early days of computing, but applies even more today, when powerful computers can produce large amounts of erroneous [[data]] or [[information]] in a short time. The first use of the phrase has been dated to a November 10, 1957, syndicated newspaper article about US Army mathematicians and their work with early computers,&lt;ref name="newspapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55787725/?terms=%22garbage%2Bin%2Bgarbage%2Bout%22|title=Work With New Electronic ‘Brains’ Opens Field For Army Math Experts|newspaper=The Hammond Times|page=65|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an Army Specialist named William D. Mellin explained that computers cannot think for themselves, and that "sloppily programmed" inputs inevitably lead to incorrect outputs. The underlying principle was noted by the inventor of the first programmable computing device design:

{{quote|On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?"&amp;nbsp;... I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.|[[Charles Babbage]]|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babbage |first=Charles |year=1864 |title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher |publisher=Longman and Co. |page=67 |oclc=258982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More recently, the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] comes to a similar conclusion: 

{{quote|"A loading computer is an effective and useful tool for the safe running of a ship. However, its output can only be as accurate as the information entered into it."|[[Marine Accident Investigation Branch|MAIB]]|''SAFETY FLYER Hoegh Osaka: 
Listing, flooding and grounding on 3 January 2015''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Uses==

The term can also be used as an explanation for the poor quality of a digitized audio or video file. Although [[digitizing]] can be the first step in cleaning up a signal, it does not, by itself, improve the quality. Defects in the original analog signal will be faithfully recorded, but may be identified and removed by a subsequent step by [[digital signal processing]].

GIGO is commonly used to describe failures in human [[decision-making]] due to faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data.  This sort of issue predates the computer age, but the term can still be applied.

GIGO was the name of a [[Usenet]] [[Gateway (computer program)|gateway]] program to [[FidoNet]], MAUSnet, e.a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable, and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar, they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary, with Urdu adopting stronger Persian and Arabic influences, and Hindi relying more heavily on Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kachru|first=Yamuna|authorlink=Yamuna Kachru|title=Hindi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooH5VfLTQEQC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3812-X|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[partition of India]], the terms ''Hindustani,'' ''Hindi,'' and ''Urdu'' were synonymous; they all covered what would be mostly called Hindi and Urdu today.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Hindustani}}
Early forms of present-day Hindustani developed from the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]] ''[[apabhraṃśa]]'' [[vernacular]]s of present-day [[North India]] in the 7th–13th centuries.The generally accepted notion is that it was a purely sanskritised Hindu language at first that took significant influence from invading Persian empires.&lt;ref name="brown2008"&gt;{{Citation | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World |author1=Keith Brown |author2=Sarah Ogilvie | year=2008 | isbn=0-08-087774-5 | publisher=Elsevier | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F2SRqDzB50wC | quote=Apabhramsha seemed to be in a state of transition from Middle Indo-Aryan to the New Indo-Aryan stage.

The basis in general for the introduction of Persian into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianised Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laet|first=Sigfried J. de Laet|authorlink=Sigfried J. de Laet|title=History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734|year=1994|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-102813-7|page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, towards the end of the Mughal period, with the fragmentation of the empire and the elite system, a variant of Khariboli, one of the successors of apabhraṃśa vernaculars at Delhi, and nearby cities, came to gradually replace Persian as the [[lingua franca]] among the educated elite [[upper class]] particularly in northern India, though Persian still retained much of its pre-eminence for a short period. The term ''Hindustani'' ({{lang-fa|ھندوستانی}} "of ''[[Hindustan]]''") was the name given to that variant of Khariboli.

For socio-political reasons, though essentially the variant of Khariboli with Persian vocabulary, the emerging [[prestige dialect]] became also known as ''Zabān-e Urdū-e Mualla'' "language of the court" or ''Zabān-e Urdū'' {{rtl-lang|fa|زبان اردو}}, ज़बान-ए उर्दू, "language of the camp" in Persian, derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ''Ordū'' "camp", cognate with English ''[[wikt:horde|horde]]'', due to its origin as the common speech of the Mughal army). The more highly Persianised version later established as a language of the court was called ''[[Rekhta]]'', or "mixed".

As an emerging common dialect, Hindustani absorbed large numbers of Persian, Arabic, and Turkic words, and as Mughal conquests grew it spread as a lingua franca across much of northern India. Written in the [[Persian alphabet]] or [[Devanagari]],&lt;ref name="mcgregor_912"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=Sheldon|authorlink=Sheldon Pollock|title=Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xowUxYhv0QgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA912|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22821-4|page=912}}&lt;/ref&gt; it remained the primary lingua franca of northern India for the next four centuries (although it varied significantly in vocabulary depending on the local language) and achieved the status of a literary language, alongside Persian, in Muslim courts. Its development was centred on the poets of the Mughal courts of cities in [[Uttar Pradesh]] such as Delhi, [[Lucknow]], and [[Agra]].

[[John Fletcher Hurst]] in his book published in 1891 mentioned that the Hindustani or camp language of the [[Mughal Empire]]'s courts at Delhi was not regarded by philologists as distinct language but only as a dialect of [[Hindi]] with admixture of Persian. He continued: "But it has all the magnitude and importance of separate language. It is linguistic result of Muslim rule of eleventh &amp; twelfth centuries and is spoken (except in rural [[Bengal]]) by many [[Hindu]]s in [[North India]] and by [[Muslim|Musalman]] population in all parts of India". Next to English it was the official language of [[British Raj]], was commonly written in Arabic or Persian characters, and was spoken by approximately 100,000,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|authorlink=John Fletcher Hurst|title=Indika, The country and People of India and Ceylon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_1ykl3ZHXcC&amp;pg=PA344|year=1992|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=344|id=GGKEY:P8ZHWWKEKAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British colonised the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the late 18th through to the late 19th century, they used the words 'Hindustani', 'Hindi' and 'Urdu' interchangeably.

However, with independence, use of the word 'Hindustani' declined, being largely replaced by 'Hindi' and 'Urdu', or 'Hindi-Urdu' when either of those was too specific. More recently, the word 'Hindustani' has been used for the colloquial language of [[Bollywood]] films, which are popular in both India and Pakistan and which cannot be unambiguously identified as either Hindi or Urdu.

==Registers==
{{See also|Hindi–Urdu controversy|Register (sociolinguistics)}}
Although, at the spoken level, Hindi and Urdu are considered [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of a single language, they differ vastly in literary and formal [[vocabulary]]; where literary Hindi draws heavily on Sanskrit and to a lesser extent [[Prakrit]], literary Urdu draws heavily on Persian and Arabic. The grammar and base vocabulary (most pronouns, verbs, adpositions, etc.) of both Hindi and Urdu, however, are the same and derive from a Prakritic base, and both have Persian/Arabic influence.

The standardised registers Hindi and Urdu are collectively known as ''Hindi-Urdu''. Hindustani is perhaps the ''lingua franca'' of the north and west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], though it is understood fairly well in other regions also, especially in the urban areas. A common vernacular sharing characteristics with Sanskritised Hindi, regional Hindi and Urdu, Hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly Sanskritised Hindi or highly Arabicised/Persianised Urdu.

This can be seen in the popular culture of [[Bollywood]] or, more generally, the vernacular of North Indians and Pakistanis, which generally employs a lexicon common to both ''Hindi'' and ''Urdu'' speakers. Minor subtleties in region will also affect the 'brand' of Hindustani, sometimes pushing the Hindustani closer to Urdu or to Hindi. One might reasonably assume that the Hindustani spoken in [[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] (known for its usage of Urdu) and [[Varanasi]] (a holy city for Hindus and thus using highly Sanskritised Hindi) is somewhat different.

===Modern Standard Hindi===
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Rigveda]] manuscript in Devanagari (early 19th century)]]
{{Main article|Hindi}}
Standard Hindi, one of the [[official languages of India]], is based on the Kharibol dialect of the Delhi region and differs from Urdu in that it is usually written in the indigenous Devanagari of India and exhibits less Persian and Arabic influence than Urdu. It has a literature of 500 years, with prose, poetry, religion and philosophy, under the Bahmani Kings and onwards. It is prevalent all over the [[Deccan Plateau]].
Note that the term ''Hindustani'' has generally fallen out of common usage in modern India, except to refer to "Indian" as a nationality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:10298.bahri|title=Learners' Hindi-English Dictionary|first=|last=Bahri,|date=13 February 1989|website=dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a style of Indian [[Hindustani classical music|classical music prevalent in northern India]]. The term used to refer to it is ''Hindi'' or ''Urdu'', depending on the religion of the speaker, and regardless of the mix of Persian or Sanskrit words used by the speaker. One could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers, with the highly Persianised Urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily Sanskrit-based dialect, spoken in the region around [[Varanasi]], at the other end. In common usage in India, the term ''Hindi'' includes all these dialects except those at the Urdu spectrum. Thus, the different meanings of the word ''Hindi'' include, among others:
# standardised Hindi as taught in schools throughout India (except some states such as Tamil Nadu),
# formal or official Hindi advocated by [[Purushottam Das Tandon]] and as instituted by the post-independence Indian government, heavily influenced by Sanskrit,
# the vernacular dialects of Hindustani as spoken throughout India,
# the neutralised form of Hindustani used in popular television and films, or
# the more formal neutralised form of Hindustani used in television and print news reports.

===Modern Standard Urdu===
[[File:Zaban urdu mualla.png|thumb|165px|The phrase ''Zabān-e Urdu-e Mo'alla'' in the [[Nastaʿlīq script]]]]
{{Main article|Urdu}}
Urdu is the national language of Pakistan and an officially recognised regional language of India. Urdu is the official language of all Pakistani provinces and is taught in all schools as a compulsory subject up to the 12th grade. It is also an official language in the Indian states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[National Capital Territory of Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Telangana]] that have significant Muslim populations.

===Bazaar Hindustani===
In a specific sense, ''Hindustani'' may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech, in contrast with the standardised Hindi and Urdu. This meaning is reflected in the use of the term ''[[bazaar]] Hindustani'', in other words, the "language of the street or the marketplace", as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal Hindi, Urdu, or even Sanskrit. Thus, the Webster's New World Dictionary defines the term Hindustani as ''the principal dialect of Hindi/Urdu, used as a trade language throughout north India and Pakistan.''

[[Amir Khusro]] ca. 1300 referred to this language of his writings as ''Dehlavi'' (देहलवी; {{Nastaliq|دہلوی}} 'of Delhi') or ''Hindavi'' (हिन्दवी; {{Nastaliq|ہندوی}}). During this period, Hindustani was used by [[Sufis]] in promulgating their message across the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Amri-Hindavi"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://islamicindia.blogspot.com/2005/11/origin-and-growth-of-urdu-language.html| title = The Origin and Growth of Urdu Language|publisher = Yaser Amri|accessdate = 2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the advent of the [[Mughals]] in the subcontinent, Hindustani acquired more Persian loanwords. ''[[Rekhta]]'' ('mixture') and ''Hindi'' ('Indian')&lt;ref name="mcgregor_912"/&gt; became popular names for the same language until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="faruqi_806"&gt;{{citation

[[George Abraham Grierson|Grierson]], in his highly influential ''[[Linguistic Survey of India]]'', proposed that the names ''Hindustani, Urdu,'' and ''Hindi'' be separated in use for different varieties of the Hindustani language, rather than as the overlapping synonyms they frequently were:

{{quote|text=We may now define the three main varieties of Hindōstānī as follows:—Hindōstānī is primarily the language of the Upper Gangetic Doab, and is also the ''lingua franca'' of India, capable of being written in both Persian and Dēva-nāgarī characters, and without purism, avoiding alike the excessive use of either Persian or Sanskrit words when employed for literature. The name 'Urdū' can then be confined to that special variety of Hindōstānī in which Persian words are of frequent occurrence, and which hence can only be written in the Persian character, and, similarly, 'Hindī' can be confined to the form of Hindōstānī in which Sanskrit words abound, and which hence can only be written in the Dēva-nāgarī character.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, vol. 9-1, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Official status==
[[File:South asia.jpg|210px|thumb|Hindustani, in its standardised registers, is one of the official languages of both India (Hindi) and Pakistan (Urdu).]]
Hindi, a major standardized [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of Hindustani, is declared by the [[Constitution of India]] as the "official language (राजभाषा, ''rājabhāśā'') of the Union" (Art. 343(1)) (In this context, "Union" means the Federal Government and not the entire country – India has [[languages with official status in India|23 official languages]]). At the same time, however, the definitive text of federal laws is officially the English text and proceedings in the higher appellate courts must be conducted in English. At the state level, Hindi is [[Languages with official status in India|one of the official languages]] in 9 of the 29 Indian states and three Union Territories (respectively, [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Haryana]]; Delhi, [[Chandigarh]], and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]). In the remaining states Hindi is not an official language. In states like [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]], studying Hindi is not compulsory in the state curriculum. However an option to take the same as second or third language does exist. In many other states, studying Hindi is usually compulsory in the school curriculum as a third language (the first two languages being the state's official language and English), though the intensiveness of Hindi in the curriculum varies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.nic.in/natpol_new.asp Government of India: National Policy on Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620100111/http://education.nic.in/natpol_new.asp |date=20 June 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urdu, also a major standardized register of Hindustani, is also one of the languages recognized in the [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India]] and is an official language of the Indian states of [[Telangana]], [[Bihar]], Delhi, [[Jammu and Kashmir]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Although the government school system in most other states emphasises Modern Standard Hindi, at universities in cities such as [[Lucknow]], [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]] and [[Hyderabad]], Urdu is spoken and learnt, and ''Saaf'' or ''Khaalis'' Urdu is treated with just as much respect as ''Shuddha'' Hindi.

Urdu is also the national language of Pakistan, where it shares [[official language]] status with [[Pakistani English|English]]. Although English is spoken by many, and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the native language of the majority of the population, Urdu is the ''lingua franca''.

''Hindustani'' was the official language of the [[British Raj]] and was synonymous with both Hindi and Urdu.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge-Hindustani"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 179178| title = Colonial Knowledge and the Fate of Hindustani|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | volume=35|pages=665–682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coward|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Coward|title=Indian Critiques of Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGGudMuE4PIC&amp;pg=PA218|year=2003|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5910-2|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; After India's independence in 1947, the Sub-Committee on Fundamental Rights recommended that the official language of India be Hindustani: "Hindustani, written either in Devanagari or the Perso-Arabic script at the option of the citizen, shall, as the national language, be the first official language of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article94695.ece|title=Hindi, not a national language: Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this recommendation was not adopted by the Constituent Assembly.

==Hindustani outside South Asia==
Besides being the ''lingua franca'' of  North India and Pakistan in South Asia, Hindustani is also spoken by many in the South Asian diaspora and their descendants around the world, including [[North America]] (in Canada, for example, Hindustani is one of the fastest growing languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/census-wednesday-language-1.4231213|title=Census data shows Canada increasingly bilingual, linguistically diverse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Europe]], and the [[Middle East]].

[[Fiji Hindi]] was derived from the Hindustani linguistic group and is spoken widely by Fijians of [[Indian people|Indian]] origin.

Hindustani was also one of the languages that was spoken widely during [[British rule in Burma]]. Many older citizens of [[Myanmar]], particularly [[Anglo-Indian]]s and the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]], still know it, although it has had no official status in the country since [[Myanmar#Military rule (1962–2011)|military rule]] began.

Hindustani is also spoken in the countries of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], where [[migrant worker]]s from various countries live and work for several years.

==Phonology==
{{Main article|Hindustani phonology}}

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Hindustani grammar}}

==Vocabulary==
{{see also|Hindustani etymology}}
Hindustani contains around 5,500 words of Persian and Arabic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuczkiewicz-Fraś|first1=Agnieszka|title=Perso-Arabic Loanwords in Hindustani|date=2008|location=Kraków|publisher=Księgarnia Akademicka|isbn=978-83-7188-161-9|page=X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Main article|Hindustani orthography|Devanagari Braille|Urdu Braille}}
[[File:Surahi in samrup rachna calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|"Surahi" in [[Samrup Rachna]] calligraphy]]
Historically, Hindustani was written in the [[Kaithi]], Devanagari, and Urdu alphabets.&lt;ref name="mcgregor_912"/&gt; Kaithi and Devanagari are two of the [[Brahmic scripts]] native to India, whereas Urdu is a derivation of the Persian [[Nastaʿlīq script]], which is the preferred calligraphic style for Urdu.

Today, Hindustani continues to be written in the Urdu alphabet in Pakistan. In India, the Hindi register is officially written in Devanagari, and Urdu in the Urdu alphabet, to the extent that these standards are partly defined by their script.

However, in popular publications in India, Urdu is also written in Devanagari, with slight variations to establish a Devanagari Urdu alphabet alongside the Devanagari Hindi alphabet.

Because of [[Indian English|anglicisation]] in South Asia and the international use of the [[Latin script]], Hindustani is occasionally written in the Latin script. This adaptation is called [[Roman Urdu]] or Romanised Hindi, depending upon the register used. Because the Bollywood film industry is a major proponent of the Latin script, the use of Latin script to write in Hindi and Urdu is growing amongst younger Internet users.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Since Urdu and Hindi are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] when spoken, Romanised Hindi and Roman Urdu (unlike Devanagari Hindi and Urdu in the Urdu alphabet) are mutually intelligible as well.

==Sample text==

Movie titles are often screened in three scripts: Latin, Devanagari and occasionally Perso-Arabic. The use of Urdu or Hindi in films depends on the film's context: historical films set in the [[Delhi Sultanate]] or [[Mughal Empire]] are almost entirely in Urdu, whereas films based on [[Hindu mythology]] or [[Middle kingdoms of India|ancient India]] make heavy use of Hindi with Sanskrit vocabulary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12154">The '''indeterminacy of translation''' is a thesis propounded by 20th-century American [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] [[philosopher]] [[W. V. Quine]]. The classic statement of this thesis can be found in his 1960 book ''[[Word and Object]]'', which gathered together and refined much of Quine's previous work on subjects other than formal logic and set theory.&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt; The indeterminacy of translation is also discussed at length in his ''Ontological Relativity''.&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt;  Crispin Wright suggests that this "has been among the most widely discussed and controversial theses in modern analytical philosophy".&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; This view is endorsed by [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] who states that it is "the most fascinating and the most discussed philosophical argument since Kant's Transcendental Deduction of the Categories".&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;

Three aspects of indeterminacy arise, of which two relate to indeterminacy of translation.&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt;  The three indeterminacies are  (i) [[inscrutability of reference]], and (ii) [[holophrastic indeterminacy]],  and (iii) the [[Confirmation holism|underdetermination of scientific theory]]. The last of these, not discussed here, refers to Quine's assessment that evidence alone does not dictate the choice of a scientific theory. The first refers to indeterminacy in interpreting individual words or sub-sentences. The second refers to indeterminacy in entire sentences or more extensive portions of discourse.

==Indeterminacy of reference==
{{Main|Inscrutability of reference}}
Indeterminacy of reference refers to the interpretation of words or phrases in isolation, and Quine's thesis is that no unique interpretation is possible, because a 'radical interpreter' has no way of telling which of many possible meanings the speaker has in mind. Quine uses the example of the word "gavagai" uttered by a native speaker of the unknown language ''Arunta'' upon seeing a rabbit.  A speaker of English could do what seems natural and translate this as "Lo, a rabbit." But other translations would be compatible with all the evidence he has: "Lo, food"; "Let's go hunting"; "There will be a storm tonight" (these natives may be superstitious); "Lo, a momentary rabbit-stage"; "Lo, an undetached rabbit-part."  Some of these might become less likely &amp;ndash; that is, become more unwieldy hypotheses &amp;ndash; in the light of subsequent observation.  Other translations can be ruled out only by querying the natives: An [[wikt:affirmative|affirmative]] answer to "Is this the same ''gavagai'' as that earlier one?" rules out some possible translations.  But these questions can only be asked once the linguist has mastered much of the natives' [[grammar]] and abstract [[vocabulary]]; that in turn can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language; and those sentences, on their own, admit of multiple interpretations.&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;

The situation is made worse when more abstract words are used, not directly attached to public observation:
{{quote|Thus, translating some native utterance as, say, "Pelicans are our half-brothers" is a much more contextual affair. It involves utilizing what Quine calls analytical hypothesis (''i.e.'' hypotheses that go beyond all possible behavioral data.) ...His [Quine's] claim is not that successful translation is impossible, but that it is multiply possible. The philosophical moral of indeterminacy of translation is that propositions, thought of as objectively valid translation relations between sentences, are simply non-existent...&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;|Roger F. Gibson|Quine, p. 258}}

These observations about the need for context brings up the next topic, holophrastic indeterminacy.

==Holophrastic indeterminacy==
{{main|Holophrastic indeterminacy}}
{{quote|The second kind of indeterminacy, which Quine sometimes refers to as ''holophrastic indeterminacy'', is another matter. Here the claim is that there is more than one correct method of translating sentences where the two translations differ not merely in the meanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also in the net import of the whole sentence. This claim involves the whole language, so there are going to be no examples, perhaps except of an exceedingly artificial kind.&lt;ref name=Hylton/&gt;|Peter Hylton |Willard van Orman Quine; Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}
It is confusing that Quine's choice of meaning for 'holophrastic', contrasting it with sub-sentential phrases, appears to run counter to its accepted meaning in [[holophrasis|linguistics]], "expressing a complex of ideas in a single word or in a fixed phrase".&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;
 
Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate a hitherto unknown language he calls ''Arunta''. He suggests that there are always different ways one might break a sentence into words, and different ways to distribute functions among words. Any [[hypothesis]] of [[translation]] could be defended only by appeal to context, by determining what other sentences a native would utter. But the same indeterminacy appears there: any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language.

==General remarks==
Indeterminacy of translation also applies to the interpretation of speakers of one's own language, and even to one's past utterances. This does not lead to [[skepticism]] about meaning &amp;ndash; either that meaning is hidden and unknowable, ''or'' that words are meaningless.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; However, when combined with a (more or less [[behaviorism|behavioristic]]) premise that everything that can be learned about the meaning of a speaker's utterances can be learned from his behavior, the indeterminacy of translation may be felt to suggest that there are no such entities as "meanings"; in this connection, it is highlighted (or claimed) that the notion of [[synonymy]] has no operational definition{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. But saying that there are no "meanings" is not to say that words are not meaningful or significant.

Quine denies an absolute standard of right and wrong in translating one language into another; rather, he adopts a pragmatic stance toward translation, that a translation can be consistent with the behavioral evidence. And while Quine does admit the existence of standards for good and bad translations, such standards are peripheral to his philosophical concern with the act of translation, hinging upon such [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] issues as speed of translation, and the [[wikt:lucidity|lucidity]] and [[conciseness]] of the results. The key point is that more than one translation meets these criteria, and hence that no unique meaning can be assigned to words and sentences.

==Analytic–synthetic distinction==
{{Main|Analytic–synthetic distinction#Quine's criticisms}}
In Quine's view, the indeterminacy of translation leads to the inability to separate ''analytic'' statements whose validity lies in the usage of language from ''synthetic'' statements, those that assert facts about the world. The argument hinges on the role of synonymy in analytic statements, "A natural suggestion, deserving close examination, is that the synonymy of two linguistic forms consists simply in their interchangeability in all contexts without change of truth value".&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt; However, Quine argues, because of the indeterminacy of translation, any attempt to define 'analyticity' on a substitutional basis invariably introduces assumptions of the synthetic variety, resulting in a circular argument. Thus, this kind of substitutability does not provide an adequate explanation of synonyms.

'''Jamaican Country Sign Language''', also '''Country Sign''', or '''Konchri Sain''' (KS) in [[Jamaican Patois]], is an indigenous [[village sign language]] of [[Jamaica]]. It is used by a small number of Deaf and hearing Jamaicans, spread over several communities in the rural south-western parish of St. Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberbatch (2012:387)&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of formal education for the St. Elizabeth deaf in 1975 by American Mennonite missionaries introduced two additional signed systems which have negatively affected KS: [[Signed English]] and [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumberbatch (2012:387)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dolman (1985:15)&lt;/ref&gt; School officials strongly discouraged the use of the language inside and outside the classroom, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of fluent KS signers and a dramatic decline in the language's prestige.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, currently, KS is used primarily by elderly monolingual Deaf community members, while other community members use [[Jamaican Sign Language]], a [[dialect]] of [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent sociolinguistic survey reports that there are currently forty deaf adult KS signers on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Parks, Epley, et al., (2011:10)&lt;/ref&gt; The language will become extinct in the next twenty to thirty years, if deliberate effort is not taken to save it by means of an effective language planning strategy. Already, the [[University of the West Indies]] in conjunction with the [[University of Central London]] has begun working on a [[language documentation]] project for the language.&lt;ref&gt;Zeshan (2007:271)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1804">'''José de Fontes Pereira''' (born 1838 in [[Luanda]] - died May 1891) was a radical  [[Angola]]n lawyer-journalist and writer.

==Career==
Considered an early Angolan nationalist and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilado]], Pereira took advantage of a relatively [[Freedom of the press|free press]] in Angola from 1870-1890 to question [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] obligations and control over Angola. He addressed topics such as the export of black Angolans to [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]an plantations, coerced labor within the colony, inefficiency, corruption and racial discrimination, amongst many others.

Writing for the literate Portuguese settler population of Angola, Pereira wrote mostly in the [[Portuguese language]]. Pereira lost his job and was put on trial when, in 1890, he suggested that the [[British Empire|British]] should take over colonial administration of the colony due to Portuguese incompetence. He died 16 months later in May 1891 of natural causes.

In mathematics, '''Khabibullin's conjecture''', named after [[B. N. Khabibullin]], is related to [[Raymond Paley|Paley]]'s problem&lt;ref name=hab_01&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khabibullin B.N. |title=Paley problem for [[plurisubharmonic function]]s of finite lower order |journal=Sbornik: Mathematics|year=1999 |volume=190 |issue=2 |pages=309&amp;ndash;321}}&lt;/ref&gt; for plurisubharmonic functions and to various [[extremal problem]]s in the theory of [[entire function]]s of several variables.

== The first statement in terms of logarithmically convex functions ==
'''Khabibullin's conjecture''' (version 1, 1992). ''Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative [[increasing function]] on the half-line &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S(e^x)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex function of &lt;math&gt;x\in[-\infty,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda\geq 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. If'' 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int^1_0 S(tx)\,(1-x^2)^{n-2}\,x\,dx\leq t^\lambda\text{ for all }t\in[0,+\infty),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

''then''
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\int^{+\infty}_0 S(t)\,\frac{t^{2\lambda-1}}{(1+t^{2\lambda})^2}\,dt\leq \frac{\pi\,(n-1)}{2\lambda}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\lambda}{2k}\Bigr).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This statement of the Khabibullin's conjecture completes his survey.&lt;ref name=hab_02&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khabibullin BN |title=The representation of a meromorphic function as the quotient of entire functions and Paley problem in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbb C^n&lt;/math&gt;: a survey of some results |journal=Mat. Fizika, analiz, geometria |year=2002 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=146&amp;ndash;167 |arxiv=math.CV/0502433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to Euler's Beta function ==

Note that the product in the right hand side of the inequality ({{EquationNote|2}}) is related to the Euler's [[Beta function]] &lt;math&gt;\Beta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\pi\,(n-1)}{2\lambda}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\lambda}{2k}\Bigr)=\frac{\pi\,(n-1)}{\lambda^2}\cdot\frac{1}{\Beta(\lambda/2,n)}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Discussion ==

For each fixed &lt;math&gt;\lambda\geq 1/2&lt;/math&gt; the function
:&lt;math&gt;
S(t)=2(n-1)\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\lambda}{2k}\Bigr)
\, t^{\lambda},
&lt;/math&gt;

turns the inequalities ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) to
equalities. 

The Khabibullin's conjecture is valid for &lt;math&gt;\lambda\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; without the assumption of convexity of &lt;math&gt;S(e^x)&lt;/math&gt;. Meanwhile, one can show that this conjecture is not valid without some convexity conditions for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In 2010, [[R. A. Sharipov]] showed that the conjecture fails in the case &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;\lambda=2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=hab_03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharipov, R. A. |title=A Counterexample to Khabibullin's Conjecture for Integral Inequalities |journal=Ufa Mathematical Journal,  |year=2010 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=99&amp;ndash;107 |arxiv=1008.2738|bibcode=2010arXiv1008.2738S }}&lt;/ref&gt;



== The second statement in terms of increasing functions ==
'''Khabibullin's conjecture''' (version 2). ''Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative increasing function on the half-line &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. If'' 

:&lt;math&gt;
 \int_0^1 \frac{h(tx)}{x} \,(1-x)^{n-1}\,dx \leq t^\alpha\text{ for all }t\in[0,+\infty),&lt;/math&gt;

''then''
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{+\infty}\frac{h(t)}{t}\,\frac{dt}{1+t^{2\alpha}}\leq
\frac{\pi}{2} \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\alpha}{k}\Bigr)=
\frac{\pi}{2\alpha} \cdot \frac{1}{\mathrm B (\alpha, n)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== The third statement in terms of non-negative functions ==
'''Khabibullin's conjecture''' (version 3). ''Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative continuous function on the half-line &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. If'' 
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^1 \Bigl(\,\int_x^1 (1-y)^{n-1} \frac{dy}{y}\Bigr)q(tx)\,dx
\leq t^{\alpha-1}\text{ for all }t\in[0,+\infty),&lt;/math&gt;

''then''
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{+\infty} q(t)\log \Bigl(1+\frac1{t^{2\alpha}}\Bigr)\,dt\leq
\pi \alpha \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\alpha}{k}\Bigr)=
 \frac{\pi}{\mathrm B (\alpha, n)}.

In marketing terminology, a '''killer feature''' is any attribute of a product that proves so useful as to become the main attraction of the product. Examples include [[Spreadsheet|spreadsheets]] as a feature of the [[Personal computer|PC]], or [[Social network|social networking]] as a feature of the [[Internet]].

Analogous to [[killer application]], which specifically refers to ''software as a killer feature'' of its compatible hardware (meaning that the software sells the hardware), the term ''killer feature'' often more specifically refers to [[software feature]]s that sell the software.

The items in this list were predominantly made with a writing brush on manuscript scrolls, which was the preferred medium until the advent of commercial printing and publishing in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the manuscripts are noted examples of [[calligraphy]]. They are housed in [[Buddhist temple|temples]], museums, libraries or archives, [[Shinto shrine|shrines]], universities and in private collections.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

====Sutras====
The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of [[Baekje]] in the form of classical Chinese books and [[sutra]]s, likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (''kansubon'').&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevens-p102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|1981|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown-p374"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly in conjunction with the introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keally-historic"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of Buddhism, strongly promoted by [[Prince Shōtoku]] (574–622), in the late-6th century and early-7th century was one of the factors&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The other factor was the establishment of a bureaucratic Chinese-style government in Japan around the same time&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a rise in the importance of writing.&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism required the study of sutras in Chinese. To satisfy the growing demand for them, imported [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] manuscripts were copied, first by Korean and Chinese immigrants, and later in the mid-7th century by Japanese scribes.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangyō Gisho]] ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length.&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 673 the entire Buddhist canon had been systematically copied.&lt;ref name="stevens-p102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p141"/&gt; Not a single sutra survives from before the end of the 6th century.&lt;ref name="brown-p159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant complete sutra copied in Japan dates to 686 and has been designated a National Treasure.&lt;ref name="sansom-p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p80"/&gt; During the 7th and 8th centuries, the copying of Buddhist texts, including sutras, dominated writing. Few Chinese secular or local Japanese works (which were rare) were copied.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p80"/&gt; The state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (''shakyōjo'') before 727&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Probably much before this date.&lt;/ref&gt; with highly specialized calligraphers, proofreaders and metal polishers to satisfy the large demand for Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="stevens-p102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansom-p141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1978|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eubanks-p189"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eubanks|2010|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sutra copying was not only for duplication but also to acquire religious merit;&lt;ref name="sansom-p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus nearly all Buddhist texts were hand-copied during the 8th century despite knowledge of printing.&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"/&gt;

The peak of sutra copying occurred in the [[Nara period]] at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the [[Lotus Sutra]] were the sutras most often copied.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p80"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamarre-p81"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaMarre|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p83"/&gt; Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The traditional Chinese way to prevent insect damage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p84"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly the ones that were produced in 741 when [[Emperor Shōmu]] decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among [[provincial temple]]s.&lt;ref name="stevens-p102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brown-p43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown-p255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sutra copies contain a colophon with the name of the sponsor—often somebody from the ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''shakyōjo'' closed at the end of the 8th century, the imperial family and leading aristocrats continued to sponsor sutra copying.&lt;ref name="eubanks-p189"/&gt; Because of an enhanced belief in the powers of the Lotus Sutra, more Heian period copies of this sutra exist than of all other sutras combined.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p87"/&gt; Starting in the early [[Heian period]], styles became flowery and ornate with lavish decorations as sutras were not used only in recitation but for dedication and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lamarre-p77"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaMarre|2000|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamarre-p83"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaMarre|2000|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional sutra copying was more often undertaken by the initiator than in the Nara period.&lt;ref name="stevens-p102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; New forms of decoration came in fashion by the early-11th century including placing each character in the outline of a stupa, on lotus pedestals or next to depictions of Boddhisattvas.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutras were increasingly furnished with [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] starting in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy shifted from [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] to [[Japanese calligraphy|Japanese style]].&lt;ref name="kornicki-p88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutra copying continued into the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and subsequent periods, but only rarely to comparable artistic effect.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p90"/&gt; With the import of printed [[Song Dynasty|Song]] editions in the Kamakura period, hand-copying of the complete scriptures died out and sutra copying was only practiced for its devotional aspect.&lt;ref name="stevens-p106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|1981|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven sutras or sets of sutras from the 6th century [[Western Wei]] to 14th century [[Nanboku-chō period]] have been designated National Treasures. Some of the oldest items in this list originated in China.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Treatises, commentaries====
[[Nara period]] Buddhism was dominated by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was far removed from the daily life of the people.&lt;ref name="eliot-nara"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|1935|pp=218–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sansomh-p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1958|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 804, two [[Bhikkhu|Japanese monks]] [[Kūkai]] and [[Saichō]] travelled to China; on their return they established [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]] respectively. Unlike their predecessors both [[Esoteric Buddhism|esoteric]] schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits.&lt;ref name="sansomh-p117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-tendaishingon"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|1935|pp=233–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name="shiveley-p343"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of new sects appeared in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries as a natural reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of ''[[mappō]]''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For this reason these new schools have been termed "evangelist" by Sir George Bailey Sansom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sansomh-p426"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1958|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing out of an [[Amitabha|Amida]] cult, the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] [[Pure Land]] school was founded in 1224 by [[Shinran]], and attracted a following from all classes and occupations.&lt;ref name="sansomh-p424"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1958|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-jodoshinshu"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|1935|pp=254–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, [[Dōgen]] introduced the [[Sōtō]] school of [[Zen]] Buddhism emphasizing meditation and [[dharma]] practice.&lt;ref name="eliot-nichirenzen"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliot|1935|pp=275–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to [[Nichiren]]'s proclamation of his teachings in 1253. [[Nichiren Buddhism]] was exceptional for being militant and intolerant.&lt;ref name="sansomh-p426"/&gt; The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the [[Lotus Sutra]].&lt;ref name="sansomh-p426"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eliot-nichirenzen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sansomh-p427"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|1958|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen treatises and commentaries of famous Japanese monks dating from the early Heian to the Kamakura period have been designated as National Treasures. These include three commentaries by Kūkai on two of the main mantras (Dainichikyō and Kongōhannyakyō) of Shingon Buddhism, works by Shinran discussing [[Pure Land Buddhism]], mappō and Amida, a manual on [[zazen]] "seated meditation" by Dōgen and two works by Nichiren related to his teachings. In addition two large scale collection of documents from the [[Nara period|Nara]] to the [[Meiji period]] are listed here as National Treasures.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewin-p396"/&gt; Characterised by freely written bold characters, the style often ignores criteria and classical standards for calligraphy.&lt;ref name="noma-p252"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noma|2003|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earnshaw-p98"/&gt; The brush is moved continuously across the paper creating richly variated lines.&lt;ref name="lewin-p398"/&gt; Unlike other calligraphy, bokuseki is considered "religious art"—a manifestation of the artist's understanding of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]].&lt;ref name="baroni-p32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baroni|2002|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the literal meaning of the word "bokuseki", translated as "ink trace", indicates the piece is considered to be a trace of the enlightened mind.&lt;ref name="earnshaw-p98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Earnshaw|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bokuseki style developed from [[Song Dynasty]] calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with [[Eisai]] in 1191.&lt;ref name="lewin-p398"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1994|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref name="earnshaw-p98"/&gt; Later bokuseki became part of the zen practice and served as meditation help.&lt;ref name="lewin-p396"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1994|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were often mounted on [[Kakemono|hanging scrolls]], and displayed in temples and [[Chashitsu|tea rooms]].&lt;ref name="jaanus-bokuseki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="earnshaw-p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baroni-p32"/&gt; The master of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] [[Sen no Rikyū]] considered them crucial to the tea ceremony in the sense that they put the participants in the right frame-of-mind.&lt;ref name="earnshaw-p98"/&gt; Bokuseki gained in importance through the [[chanoyu]] in the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Momoyama period]]s.&lt;ref name="lewin-p398"/&gt; [[Daitō Kokushi]] and [[Musō Soseki]], both from the [[Rinzai school]] of Zen Buddhism, were the most famous bokuseki masters of the time.&lt;ref name="lewin-p398"/&gt;

The bokuseki style is present in a variety of Zen genres such as Buddhist sermons or Dharma talks (hōgo), certificates of enlightenment (inkajō), [[Death poem|death verses]] (yuige), [[gatha]] verses (geju), poetry&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;One's own poetry or that of a poet or master.&lt;/ref&gt; (shi), letters, names and titles given to a monk by his master (jigo), exhortory sermons (shidōgo), gakuji,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Two or three large characters written horizontally for display over a doorway or on a wall.&lt;/ref&gt; inscriptions on Zen paintings (san) and [[Ensō|Zen circles]].&lt;ref name="jaanus-bokuseki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewin-p396"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevens-p143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|1981|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 23 bokuseki National Treasures of various types including inkajō, hōgo, letters and yuige. They date from the 12th to 14th centuries and have been mounted on hanging scrolls.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Albums of exemplary calligraphy, tekagami===
Collections of exemplary calligraphy, or ''tekagami'' (lit. "mirror of the hands"), were created by cutting pages and sections of old books and scrolls of sutras, poems and letters, which were arranged in albums in a chronological order or according to social status.&lt;ref name="frederic-p956"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moshiogusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="levine-p359"/&gt; By the early-16th century, calligraphic connoisseurs of the Kohitsu house had practiced activities aimed at preserving ancient calligraphic works.&lt;ref name="levine-p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|2005|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tekagami'' production appears to have started in the [[Momoyama period]].&lt;ref name="levine-p359"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|2005|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/s&gt; These albums served as model books for calligraphy practice, the emulation of old styles, and as reference works for authentication in the growing antique market.&lt;ref name="levine-p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|2005|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the selection of calligraphers, and the type of calligraphies in a ''tekagami'', show the changing tastes in classical Japanese-style calligraphy over the years.&lt;ref name="moshiogusa"/&gt; Four ''tekagami'' containing works from the 8th century [[Nara period|Nara]] to the 15th century [[Muromachi period]] have been designated as National Treasures.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Others===
There are three National Treasures writings that do not fit in any of the above categories, all originating in China. Two are 7th century works: a copy of the [[Thousand Character Classic]] by Zhi Yong both in formal and cursive scripts, and a tracing copy of a letter by the famous Chinese calligrapher [[Wang Xizhi]]. The former work&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;But not this particular manuscript&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have been imported to Japan by the legendary scholar [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] in ancient times. One is a 13th-century set of large-scale letters (2 or 3 each) to be displayed on walls or above doorways.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

[[File:Lorenzo Hammarsköld.gif|thumb|Lorenzo Hammarsköld.]]
'''Lorenzo Hammarsköld''' (b. ''Lars Hammarskjöld'', 7 April 1785 &amp;ndash; 15 October 1827) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] critic and literary historian.  He also published poetry.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Tuna, Vimmerby]]. He became a student at [[Uppsala]] in 1801, but failed to take his degree in 1806. He therefore accepted a humble post at the [[National Library of Sweden|royal library at Stockholm]], with which institution he remained connected for many years.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{EB9|wstitle=Hammarsköld, Lorenzo|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804 he published an article on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]], which attracted much attention, and was the means of founding the “Phosphoric School,” as it was called, of poetry in Sweden. Hammarsköld became the friend of [[Atterbom]] and antagonist of Wallmark, and in due time, by the bitterness of his tone, brought down on himself the scathing anger of [[Esaias Tegnér]]. In 1806 he published ''Translations and Imitations of Poets, Old and New'', in the preface of which he denounced the classic Swedish writers with much force and wit, commending Goethe and Tieck to the young poets of the day.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

In 1803 appeared his ''Critique of Schiller'', and in 1810 a volume of essays of a polemical kind. In 1813 Hammarsköld published a collection of his poems, and in 1815 had to endure the ridicule of Tegnér's satire ''Hammarspik''. In 1818 appeared the first part of Hammarsköld's chief contribution to literature, his famous ''Svenska Vitterheten'', a history of polite letters in Sweden, a book that was revised and republished after his death by &lt;!-- Pehr Adolph? --&gt;Sondén, in 1833.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

Hammarsköld was among the first to recognise the talent of the poet [[Erik Johan Stagnelius]]. He collected the works of the deceased poet and published his poems in 1824-26.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The '''Manifiesto blanco''', or White Manifesto was written in 1946 by artists and students in [[Buenos Aires]] under the direction of [[Lucio Fontana]] during his time in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyhrust Into the Whirlwind: Italian Art before Arte Povera|journal=Zero to Infinity|year=2001|pages=21–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The manifesto emphasized the importance of new technologies as they pertained to the arts and the pursuit of '''integrating art and science'''.  "This idea of synthesis is grounded in the concept that certain scientific and philosophical developments have transformed the human psyche to such an extent that traditional "static" art forms and the differentiation of artistic disciplines have become obsolete.  A new, synthetic art is advocated that will involve the dynamic principle of movement through time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Anthony|title=Lucio Fontana: Between Utopia and Kitsch|journal=Grey Room|year=2001|volume=5|pages=54–77|jstor=1262573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sharp 3 Axis Vertical Mill Full View.jpg|thumb|right|Full view of a 3-axis clone of a [[Bridgeport (machine tool brand)|Bridgeport]]-style vertical milling machine]]

'''Milling''' is the process of [[machining]] using rotary [[Milling cutter|cutters]] to remove material{{sfn|Brown &amp; Sharpe|1914|p=7}} by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. This may be done varying direction{{sfn|CMMC|1922|p=122}} on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure.{{sfn|Usher|1896|p=142}} Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It is one of the most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances.

Milling can be done with a wide range of [[machine tool]]s. The original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of [[numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]], milling machines evolved into machining centers: milling machines augmented by automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC capability, coolant systems, and enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) or horizontal machining centers (HMCs). 

The integration of milling into [[turning]] environments, and vice versa, began with [[Metal lathe#Swiss-style Lathes and Live Tooling|live tooling]] for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations. This led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to facilitate milling and turning within the same work envelope.

==Process==

[[File:Fraisage surfacage.svg|thumb|Face milling process (cutter rotation axis is vertical - 0° inclination relative to tool axis)]]
Milling is a [[cutting]] process that uses a [[milling cutter]] to remove material from the surface of a workpiece. The milling cutter is a rotary [[cutting tool]], often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to [[drilling]], where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. As the milling cutter enters the workpiece, the cutting edges (flutes or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving off [[Swarf|chips (swarf)]] from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that hang together to a greater or lesser extent (depending on the material) to form chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its [[mechanics]]) from slicing softer materials with a [[blade]].

The milling process removes material by performing many separate, small cuts. This is accomplished by using a cutter with many teeth, spinning the cutter at high speed, or advancing the material through the cutter slowly; most often it is some combination of these three approaches.{{sfn|CMMC|1922|p=122}} The [[speeds and feeds]] used are varied to suit a combination of variables. The speed at which the piece advances through the cutter is called '''feed rate''', or just '''feed'''; it is most often measured in length of material per full revolution of the cutter.

There are two major classes of milling process:
* In '''face milling''', the cutting action occurs primarily at the end corners of the milling cutter. Face milling is used to cut flat surfaces (faces) into the workpiece, or to cut flat-bottomed cavities.
* In '''peripheral milling''', the cutting action occurs primarily along the circumference of the cutter, so that the cross section of the milled surface ends up receiving the shape of the cutter. In this case the blades of the cutter can be seen as scooping out material from the work piece. Peripheral milling is well suited to the cutting of deep slots, threads, and gear teeth.

===Milling cutters===

{{main|Milling cutter}}

Many different types of cutting tools are used in the milling process. Milling cutters such as [[endmill]]s may have cutting surfaces across their entire end surface, so that they can be drilled into the workpiece (plunging). Milling cutters may also have extended cutting surfaces on their sides to allow for peripheral milling. Tools optimized for face milling tend to have only small cutters at their end corners.

The cutting surfaces of a milling cutter are generally made of a hard and temperature-resistant material, so that they [[wear]] slowly. A low cost cutter may have surfaces made of [[high speed steel]]. More expensive but slower-wearing materials include [[cemented carbide]]. Thin film coatings may be applied to decrease friction or further increase hardness.

They are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools). They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g., a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).

[[File:Revolutionsandridges.png|thumb|A diagram of revolution ridges on a surface milled by the side of the cutter, showing the position of the cutter for each cutting pass and how it corresponds with the ridges (cutter rotation axis is perpendicular to image plane)]]
As material passes through the cutting area of a milling machine, the blades of the cutter take swarfs of material at regular intervals. Surfaces cut by the side of the cutter (as in peripheral milling) therefore always contain regular ridges. The distance between ridges and the height of the ridges depend on the feed rate, number of cutting surfaces, the cutter diameter.{{sfn|CMMC|1992|pp=125–127}} With a narrow cutter and rapid feed rate, these revolution ridges can be significant variations in the [[surface finish]].

[[File:Prolate trochoid.svg|thumb|left|Trochoidal marks, characteristic of face milling.]]
The face milling process can in principle produce very flat surfaces. However, in practice the result always shows visible [[trochoid]]al marks following the motion of points on the cutter's end face. These '''revolution marks''' give the characteristic [[surface finish|finish]] of a face milled surface. Revolution marks can have significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end face and the degree of perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and feed direction. Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed.. In a precise face milling operation, the revolution marks will only be microscopic scratches due to imperfections in the cutting edge.


[[File:Practical Treatise on Milling and Milling Machines p138.png|thumb|Heavy gang milling of milling machine tables]]'''Gang milling''' refers to the use of two or more [[milling cutter]]s mounted on the same [[Mandrel|arbor]] (that is, ganged) in a horizontal-milling setup. All of the [[Milling cutter|cutter]]s may perform the same type of operation, or each cutter may perform a different type of operation. For example, if several workpieces need a slot, a flat surface, and an angular [[Groove (engineering)|groove]], a good method to cut   these (within a non-[[CNC]] context) would be gang milling. All the completed workpieces would be the same, and milling time per piece would be minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmachinetools.com/how_to_use_a_milling_machine.htm|publisher=American Machine Tools Co.|title=How to use a Milling Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang milling was especially important before the [[CNC]] era, because for duplicate part production, it was a substantial efficiency improvement over manual-milling one feature at an operation, then changing machines (or changing setup of the same machine) to cut the next op. Today, [[CNC]] mills with automatic tool change and 4- or 5-axis control obviate gang-milling practice to a large extent.

==Equipment==
Milling is performed with a [[milling cutter]] in various forms, held in a collett or similar which, in turn, is held in the spindle of a milling machine.

=== Types and nomenclature ===
Mill orientation is the primary classification for milling machines. The two basic [[wikt:configuration#Noun|configurations]] are vertical and horizontal. However, there are alternative classifications according to method of control, size, purpose and power source.

====Mill orientation====

=====Vertical mill=====
[[File:Milling machine (Vertical, Manual) NT.PNG|thumb|upright=0.72|right|'''Vertical''' milling machine. 1: milling cutter 2: spindle 3: top slide or overarm 4: column 5: table 6: Y-axis slide 7: knee 8: base]]

In the '''vertical mill''' the spindle axis is vertically oriented. [[Milling cutter]]s are held in the spindle and rotate on its axis. The spindle can generally be extended (or the table can be raised/lowered, giving the same effect), allowing plunge cuts and drilling. There are two subcategories of vertical mills: the bed mill and the turret mill.

* A '''turret mill''' has a stationary spindle and the table is moved both perpendicular and parallel to the spindle axis to accomplish cutting. The most common example of this type is the Bridgeport, described below.  Turret mills often have a quill which allows the milling cutter to be raised and lowered in a manner similar to a drill press.  This type of machine provides two methods of cutting in the vertical (Z) direction:  by raising or lowering the quill, and by moving the knee.
* In the '''bed mill''', however, the table moves only perpendicular to the spindle's axis, while the spindle itself moves parallel to its own axis.

Turret mills are generally considered by some to be more versatile of the two designs.  However, turret mills are only practical as long as the machine remains relatively small.  As machine size increases, moving the knee up and down requires considerable effort and it also becomes difficult to reach the quill feed handle (if equipped).  Therefore, larger milling machines are usually of the bed type.

A third type also exists, a lighter machine, called a mill-drill, which is a close relative of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists.  A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small drill press, but equipped with an X-Y table.  They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized drill press, with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a drill press to deal with the lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation.  A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a drill press motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar.  Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a drill press may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting.  Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as drill press, where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation.  As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts [[collet]]s.  These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.

=====Horizontal milling machine=====
[[File:Milling machine diagram.svg|thumb|upright=0.72|right|'''Horizontal''' milling machine. 1: base 2: column 3: knee 4 &amp; 5: table (x-axis slide is integral) 6: overarm 7: arbor (attached to spindle)]]

A horizontal mill has the same sort  but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal spindle (see [[Arbor milling]]) across the table. Many horizontal mills also feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this feature is called a ''universal table''.  While endmills and the other types of tools available to a vertical mill may be used in a horizontal mill, their real advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to mill grooves and slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be ganged together on the arbor to mill a complex shape of slots and planes. Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive.  Simplex mills have one spindle, and duplex mills have two.  It is also easier to [[gear cutting|cut gears]] on a horizontal mill.  Some horizontal milling machines are equipped with a power-take-off provision on the table.  This allows the table feed to be synchronized to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as [[hypoid]] gears.

=====Comparative merits=====
The choice between vertical and horizontal spindle orientation in milling machine design usually hinges on the shape and size of a workpiece and the number of sides of the workpiece that require machining. Work in which the spindle's axial movement is [[Surface normal|normal]] to one plane, with an endmill as the cutter, lends itself to a vertical mill, where the operator can stand before the machine and have easy access to the cutting action by looking down upon it. Thus vertical mills are most favored for diesinking work (machining a mould into a block of metal).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavier and longer workpieces lend themselves to placement on the table of a horizontal mill.

Prior to [[numerical control]], horizontal milling machines evolved first, because they evolved by putting milling tables under lathe-like headstocks. Vertical mills appeared in subsequent decades, and accessories in the form of add-on heads to change horizontal mills to vertical mills (and later vice versa) have been commonly used. Even in the [[CNC]] era, a heavy workpiece needing machining on multiple sides lends itself to a horizontal machining center, while diesinking lends itself to a vertical one.

==== Alternative classifications ====
In addition to horizontal versus vertical, other distinctions are also important:

|-
| Spindle axis orientation
| Vertical versus horizontal; &lt;br /&gt; Turret versus non-turret

| A distinction whose meaning evolved over decades as technology progressed, and overlaps with other purpose classifications above. Not relevant to today's [[CNC]] mills. Regarding manual mills, the common theme is that "plain" mills were production machines with fewer axes than "universal" mills; for example, whereas a plain mill had no indexing head and a non-rotating table, a universal mill would have those. Thus it was suited to universal service, that is, a wider range of possible toolpaths. Machine tool builders no longer use the "plain"-versus-"universal" labeling.

====Variants====
[[Image:Miniature milling machine.jpg|thumb|right|A Sieg X2 miniature hobbyist mill plainly showing the basic parts of a mill]]

* '''Bed mill''' This refers to any milling machine where the spindle is on a ''pendant'' that moves up and down to move the cutter into the work, while the table sits on a stout ''bed'' that rests on the floor.  These are generally more rigid than a knee mill. Gantry mills can be included in this bed mill category. 
* '''Box mill''' or '''column mill''' Very basic hobbyist bench-mounted milling machines that feature a head riding up and down on a column or box way.
* '''C-frame mill''' These are larger, industrial production mills. They feature a knee and fixed spindle head that is only mobile vertically.  They are typically much more powerful than a turret mill, featuring a separate hydraulic motor for integral hydraulic power feeds in all directions, and a twenty to fifty horsepower motor.  Backlash eliminators are almost always standard equipment. They use large NMTB 40 or 50 tooling. The tables on C-frame mills are usually 18" by 68" or larger, to allow multiple parts to be machined at the same time.
* '''Floor mill''' These have a row of rotary tables, and a horizontal pendant spindle mounted on a set of tracks that runs parallel to the table row.  These mills have predominantly been converted to [[CNC]], but some can still be found (if one can even find a used machine available) under manual control.  The spindle carriage moves to each individual table, performs the machining operations, and moves to the next table while the previous table is being set up for the next operation.  Unlike other mills, floor mills have movable floor units.  A crane drops massive rotary tables, X-Y tables, etc., into position for machining, allowing large and complex custom milling operations.
* '''Gantry mill''' The milling head rides over two rails (often steel shafts) which lie at each side of the work surface.
* '''Horizontal boring mill''' Large, accurate bed horizontal mills that incorporate many features from various machine tools.  They are predominantly used to create large manufacturing jigs, or to modify large, high precision parts.  They have a spindle stroke of several (usually between four and six) feet, and many are equipped with a tailstock to perform very long boring operations without losing accuracy as the bore increases in depth.  A typical bed has X and Y travel, and is between three and four feet square with a rotary table or a larger rectangle without a table.  The pendant usually provides between four and eight feet of vertical movement.  Some mills have a large (30" or more) integral facing head.  Right angle rotary tables and vertical milling attachments are available for further flexibility.
* '''[[Jig borer]]''' Vertical mills that are built to bore holes, and very light slot or face milling.  They are typically bed mills with a long spindle throw.  The beds are more accurate, and the handwheels are graduated down to .0001" for precise hole placement.
* '''Knee mill''' or '''knee-and-column mill''' refers to any milling machine whose x-y table rides up and down the column on a vertically adjustable knee. This includes Bridgeports.
* '''Planer-style mill''' Large mills built in the same configuration as [[Planer (metalworking)|planers]] except with a milling spindle instead of a planing head. This term is growing dated as planers themselves are largely a thing of the past.
* '''Ram-type mill''' This can refer to any mill that has a cutting head mounted on a sliding ram. The spindle can be oriented either vertically or horizontally. In practice most mills with rams also involve swiveling ability, whether or not it is called "turret" mounting. The Bridgeport [[wikt:configuration#Noun|configuration]] can be classified as a vertical-head ram-type mill. [[Van Norman]] specialized in ram-type mills through most of the 20th century. Since the wide dissemination of [[CNC]] machines, ram-type mills are still made in the Bridgeport configuration (with either manual or [[CNC]] control), but the less common variations (such as were built by Van Norman, Index, and others) have died out, their work being done now by either Bridgeport-form mills or machining centers.
* '''Turret mill''' More commonly referred to as Bridgeport-type milling machines. The spindle can be aligned in many different positions for a very versatile, if somewhat less rigid machine.

==== Alternative terminology ====
A milling machine is often called a '''mill''' by [[machinist]]s. The archaic term '''miller''' was commonly used in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Currently the term "miller" refers to machines built when that term was current, as with "phonograph" and "horseless carriage."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s there has developed an overlap of usage between the terms '''milling machine''' and '''machining center'''. NC/[[CNC]] machining centers evolved from milling machines, which is why the terminology evolved gradually with considerable overlap that still persists. The distinction, when one is made, is that a machining center is a mill with features that pre-[[CNC]] mills never had, especially an automatic tool changer (ATC) that includes a tool magazine (carousel), and sometimes an automatic pallet changer (APC). In typical usage, all machining centers are mills, but not all mills are machining centers; only mills with ATCs are machining centers.

[[Image:Makino-S33-MachiningCenter-example.jpg|thumb|Thin wall milling of [[aluminum]] using a water based [[cutting fluid]] on the [[milling cutter]]]]

Most [[CNC]] milling machines (also called ''machining centers'') are computer controlled vertical mills with the ability to move the spindle vertically along the Z-axis. This extra degree of freedom permits their use in diesinking, engraving applications, and [[2.5D (machining)|2.5D]] surfaces such as [[relief]] sculptures. When combined with the use of [[cone (geometry)|conical]] tools or a [[Milling cutter#Ball nose cutter|ball nose cutter]], it also significantly improves milling precision without impacting speed, providing a cost-efficient alternative to most flat-surface hand-[[engraving]] work.

[[Image:DeckelMaho-DMU50e-MachiningCenter.jpg|thumb|Five-axis machining center with rotating table and [[computer interface]]]]

[[CNC]] machines can exist in virtually any of the forms of manual machinery, like horizontal mills. The most advanced [[CNC]] milling-machines, the [[multiaxis machining|multiaxis machine]], add two more axes in addition to the three normal axes (XYZ). Horizontal milling machines also have a C or Q axis, allowing the horizontally mounted workpiece to be rotated, essentially allowing asymmetric and [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] [[turning]]. The fifth [[Axis of rotation|axis]] (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool itself. When all of these axes are used in conjunction with each other, extremely complicated geometries, even organic geometries such as a human head can be made with relative ease with these machines. But the skill to program such geometries is beyond that of most operators. Therefore, 5-axis milling machines are practically always programmed with [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]].

The operating system of such machines is a closed loop system and functions on feedback.
These machines have developed from the basic NC (NUMERIC CONTROL) machines. A computerized form of NC machines is known as CNC machines. A set of instructions (called a program) is used to guide the machine for desired operations. Some very commonly used codes, which are used in the program are:
 G00 – rapid traverse
 G01 – linear interpolation of tool.
 G21 – dimensions in metric units.
 M03/M04 – spindle start (clockwise/counter clockwise).
 T01 M06 – automatic tool change to tool 1
 M30 – program end.

Various other codes are also used. A CNC machine is operated by a single operator called a programmer. This machine is capable of performing various operations automatically and economically.

With the declining price of computers and [[CNC#DIY, hobby, and personal CNC|open source CNC software]], the entry price of CNC machines has plummeted.

=== Tooling ===
The accessories and cutting tools used on machine tools (including milling machines) are referred to in aggregate by the [[mass noun]] "tooling". There is a high degree of standardization of the tooling used with CNC milling machines, and a lesser degree with manual milling machines. To ease up the organization of the tooling in CNC production many companies use a [[tool management]] solution.

[[Milling cutter]]s for specific applications are held in various tooling configurations.

CNC milling machines nearly always use SK (or ISO), CAT, BT or HSK tooling. SK tooling is the most common in Europe, while CAT tooling, sometimes called V-Flange Tooling, is the oldest and probably most common type in the USA. CAT tooling was invented by [[Caterpillar Inc.]] of [[Peoria, Illinois]], in order to standardize the tooling used on their machinery. CAT tooling comes in a range of sizes designated as CAT-30, CAT-40, CAT-50, etc. The number refers to the [[Association for Manufacturing Technology]] (formerly the National Machine Tool Builders Association (NMTB)) [[Machine taper|Taper size]] of the tool.

[[Image:1941-G.jpg|thumb|A CAT-40 toolholder]]
[[Image:Universal Plan- und Ausdrehkopf von Wohlhaupter.jpg|thumb|A boring head on a Morse taper shank]]
An improvement on CAT Tooling is BT Tooling, which looks similar and can easily be confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes in a range of sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT tooling is symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT tooling is not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT Tooling is all Imperial thread and BT Tooling is all Metric thread. Note that this affects the pull stud only; it does not affect the tool that they can hold. Both types of tooling are sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.

SK and HSK tooling, sometimes called "Hollow Shank Tooling", is much more common in Europe where it was invented than it is in the United States. It is claimed that HSK tooling is even better than BT Tooling at high speeds. The holding mechanism for HSK tooling is placed within the (hollow) body of the tool and, as spindle speed increases, it expands, gripping the tool more tightly with increasing spindle speed. There is no pull stud with this type of tooling.

For manual milling machines, there is less standardization, because a greater plurality of formerly competing standards exist. Newer and larger manual machines usually use NMTB tooling. This tooling is somewhat similar to CAT tooling but requires a [[Drawbar (machine tool)|drawbar]] within the milling machine.  Furthermore, there are a number of variations with NMTB tooling that make interchangeability troublesome. The older a machine, the greater the plurality of standards that may apply (e.g., [[Machine taper#Morse|Morse]], [[Machine taper#Jarno|Jarno]], [[Machine taper#Brown &amp; Sharpe|Brown &amp; Sharpe]], [[Van Norman#Spindle tooling|Van Norman]], and other less common builder-specific tapers). However, two standards that have seen especially wide usage are the Morse #2 and the R8, whose prevalence was driven by the popularity of the mills built by [[Bridgeport (machine tool brand)|Bridgeport Machines]] of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. These mills so dominated the market for such a long time that "Bridgeport" is virtually synonymous with "manual milling machine". Most of the machines that Bridgeport made between 1938 and 1965 used a Morse taper #2, and from about 1965 onward most used an R8 taper.

==CNC pocket milling==
'''Pocket milling''' has been regarded as one of the most widely used operations in [[machining]]. It is extensively used in [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]] and [[Shipbuilding|shipyard]] industries. In pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat surface of a work piece is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly roughing operation is done to remove the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Thomas R.|title=Pocket Milling with Tool Engagement Detection|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Systems|date=1992|volume=11|issue=2|pages=112–123|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027861259290042E|accessdate=11 March 2015|doi=10.1016/0278-6125(92)90042-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by [[2.5D (machining)|2.5 axis]] [[CNC]] milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical parts. Since the importance of pocket milling is very relevant, therefore effective pocketing approaches can result in reduction in [[Machining Time|machining time]] and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Martin|title=A geometry-based investigation of the tool path generation for zigzag pocket machining|journal=The Visual Computer|date=1991|volume=7|issue=5-6|pages=296–308|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01905694|accessdate=11 March 2015|doi=10.1007/BF01905694}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Numerical control|NC]] pocket milling can be carried out mainly by two tool paths, viz. linear and non-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choy|first1=H.S.|last2=Chan|first2=K.W.|title=A corner-looping based tool path for pocket milling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448502000490||date=February 2003|accessdate=11 March 2015|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(02)00049-0|volume=35|journal=Computer-Aided Design|pages=155–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear tool path===

In this approach, the tool movement is unidirectional. Zig-zag and zig tool paths are the examples of linear tool path.

====Zig-zag tool path====
In zig-zag milling, material is removed both in forward and backward paths. In this case, cutting is done both with and against the rotation of the spindle. This reduces the machining time but increases [[Machining vibrations|machine chatter]] and [[tool wear]].

====Zig tool path====
In zig milling, the tool moves only in one direction. The tool has to be lifted and retracted after each cut, due to which machining time increases. However, in case of zig milling surface quality is better.

===Non-linear tool path===
In this approach, tool movement is multi-directional. One example of non-linear tool path is contour-parallel tool path.

====Contour-parallel tool path====
In this approach, the required pocket boundary is used to derive the tool path. In this case the cutter is always in contact with the work material. Hence the idle time spent in positioning and retracting the tool is avoided. For large-scale material removal, contour-parallel tool path is widely used because it can be consistently used with up-cut or down-cut method during the entire process. There are three different approaches that fall into the category of contour-parallel tool path generation. They are:

*Pair-wise intersection approach:In pair-wise intersection approach, the boundary of the pocket is brought inwards in steps, The offset segments will intersect at concave corners. To obtain the required contour, these intersections are to be trimmed off. On the other hand, in case of convex corner, the offset segments are extended and thereby connected to make the contour. These operations viz. offsetting, trimming and extending are repeatedly done to cover the entire machining volume with sufficient layer of profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Allan|last2=Arbab|first2=Farhad|title=An algorithm for generating NC tool paths for arbitrarily shaped pockets with islands|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|date=April 1992|volume=11|issue=2|pages=152–182|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=130832|accessdate=12 March 2015|doi=10.1145/130826.130832}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Voronoi diagram]] approach: In voronoi diagram approach, the pocket boundary is segmented and voronoi diagram is constructed for the entire pocket boundary. These voronoi diagrams are used for generating the tool path for machining. This method is considered to be more efficient and robust. Moreover, it avoids topological problems associated with traditional offsetting algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeong|first1=J.|last2=Kim|first2=K.|title=Tool Path Generation for Machining Free-Form Pockets Voronoi Diagrams|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01179076|website=Springer Link|publisher=The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology 1998, Volume 14, Issue 12, pp 876-881|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Persson|first1=H.|title=NC machining of arbitrarily shaped pockets|journal=Computer-Aided Design|date=May 1978|volume=10|issue=3|pages=169–174|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010448578901410|accessdate=12 March 2015|doi=10.1016/0010-4485(78)90141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curvilinear tool path====
In this approach, the tool travels along a gradually evolving spiral path. The spiral starts at the center of the pocket to be machined and the tool gradually moves towards the pocket boundary. The direction of the tool path changes progressively and local acceleration and deceleration of the tool are minimized.  This reduces tool wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bieterman|first1=Michael B.|last2=Sandstrom|first2=Donald R.|title=A Curvilinear Tool-Path Method for Pocket Machining|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering|date=Nov 11, 2003|volume=125|pages=709–715|url=http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1448185|doi=10.1115/1.1596579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===1795-1810===
[[File:Milled wooden clock teeth.jpg|thumb|Milled gear teeth on a Terry style wooden movement clock.]]
Milling machines evolved from the practice of rotary filing—that is, running a circular cutter with [[File (tool)|file]]-like teeth in the headstock of a [[lathe]]. Rotary filing and, later, true milling were developed to reduce time and effort spent hand-filing. The full story of milling machine development may never be known, because much early development took place in individual shops where few records were kept for posterity. However, the broad outlines are known, as summarized below. From a history-of-technology viewpoint, it is clear that the naming of this new type of machining with the term "milling" was an extension from that word's earlier senses of processing materials by abrading them in some way (cutting, grinding, crushing, etc.).
Rotary filing long predated milling. A rotary file by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]], circa 1760, is well known.&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916p206"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 206].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, [[Eli Terry]] began using a milling machine at Plymouth Connecticut in the production of tall case clocks. With the use of his milling machine, Terry was the first to accomplish [[Interchangeable parts]] in the clock industry. Milling wooden parts was efficient in interchangeable parts, but inefficient in high yields. Milling wooden blanks results in a low yield of parts because the machines single blade would cause loss of gear teeth when the cutter hit parallel grains in the wood. Terry later invented a spindle cutting machine to mass produce parts in 1807. Other Connecticut clockmakers like James Harrison of Waterbury, Thomas Barnes of Litchfield, and Gideon Roberts of Bristol, also used milling machines to produce their clocks. &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Kenneth D., and Snowden Taylor. Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock. Ken Roberts Publishing, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1810s–1830s===
[[File:Eli Whitney milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|This milling machine was long credited to Eli Whitney and dated to circa 1818. From the 1910s through the 1940s, this version of its provenance was widely published. In the 1950s and 1960s, various historians of technology mostly discredited the view of this machine as the first miller and possibly even of Whitney as its builder. Nonetheless, it is still an important early milling machine, regardless of its exact provenance.]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown milling machine of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North.]]
[[File:Nasmyth milling machine 1829-1830--001.png|thumb|The milling machine built by James Nasmyth between 1829 and 1831 for milling the six sides of a hex nut using an indexing fixture.]]
It is clear that milling machines as a distinct class of machine tool (separate from lathes running rotary files) first appeared between 1814 and 1818. The centers of earliest development of true milling machines were two federal [[armory (military)|armories]] of the U.S. ([[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harpers Ferry]]) together with the various private armories and [[Inside contracting|inside contractors]] that shared [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] of skilled workmen with them. 
Between 1912 and 1916, [[Joseph Wickham Roe|Joseph W. Roe]], a respected founding father of machine tool historians, credited [[Eli Whitney]] (one of the private arms makers mentioned above) with producing the first true milling machine.&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972p17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916p142ff"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false caption of figure facing p. 142].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1918, he considered it "Probably the first milling machine ever built—certainly the oldest now in existence […]."&lt;ref name="Roe1918p309"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1918}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nC4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 309].&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent scholars, including Robert S. Woodbury&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972p16-26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=16–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and others,&lt;ref name="Baida1987"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baida|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; have improved upon Roe's early version of the history and suggest that just as much credit—in fact, probably more—belongs to various other inventors, including Robert Johnson of [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; [[John H. Hall (soldier)|Captain John H. Hall]] of the Harpers Ferry armory; [[Simeon North]] of the Staddle Hill factory in Middletown; Roswell Lee of the Springfield armory; and [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]]. (Several of the men mentioned above are sometimes described on the internet as "the inventor of the first milling machine" or "the inventor of interchangeable parts". Such claims are oversimplified, as these technologies evolved over time among many people.)

Peter Baida,&lt;ref name="Baida1987"/&gt; citing Edward A. Battison's article "Eli Whitney and the Milling Machine," which was published in the ''Smithsonian Journal of History'' in 1966, exemplifies the dispelling of the "[[Great Man theory|Great Man]]" image of Whitney by historians of technology working in the 1950s and 1960s. He quotes Battison as concluding that "There is no evidence that Whitney developed or used a true milling machine." Baida says, "The so-called Whitney machine of 1818 seems actually to have been made after Whitney's death in 1825." Baida cites Battison's suggestion that the first true milling machine was made not by Whitney, but by Robert Johnson of Middletown.&lt;ref name="Baida1987"/&gt;

The late teens of the 19th century were a pivotal time in the history of machine tools, as the period of 1814 to 1818 is also the period during which several contemporary pioneers ([[James Fox (engineer)|Fox]], [[Matthew Murray|Murray]], and [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Roberts]]) were developing the [[planer (metalworking)|planer]],&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp50-62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;f=false Chapter V: Inventors of the Planer, pp. 50–62].&lt;/ref&gt; and as with the milling machine, the work being done in various shops was undocumented for various reasons (partially because of proprietary secrecy, and also simply because no one was taking down records for posterity).

[[James Nasmyth]] built a milling machine very advanced for its time between 1829 and 1831.&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972pp24-26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=24–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was tooled to mill the six sides of a hex nut that was mounted in a six-way [[Indexing (motion)|indexing]] fixture.

A milling machine built and used in the shop of Gay &amp; Silver (aka Gay, Silver, &amp; Co) in the 1830s was influential because it employed a better method of vertical positioning than earlier machines. For example, Whitney's machine (the one that Roe considered the very first) and others did not make provision for vertical travel of the knee. Evidently, the [[workflow]] assumption behind this was that the machine would be set up with shims, vise, etc. for a certain part design, and successive parts did not require vertical adjustment (or at most would need only shimming). This indicates that early thinking about milling machines was as production machines, not [[toolroom]] machines.

In these early years, milling was often viewed as only a roughing operation to be followed by finishing with a hand file. The idea of ''reducing'' hand filing was more important than ''replacing'' it.

===1840s–1860===
[[File:Lincoln miller--a typical example--P and W--001.png|thumb|A typical Lincoln miller. The configuration was established in the 1850s. (This example was built by [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt &amp; Whitney]], probably 1870s or 1880s.)]]
Some of the key men in milling machine development during this era included [[Frederick W. Howe]], [[Francis A. Pratt]], [[Elisha K. Root]], and others. (These same men during the same era were also busy developing the state of the art in [[turret lathe]]s. Howe's experience at Gay &amp; Silver in the 1840s acquainted him with early versions of both machine tools. His machine tool designs were later built at [[Robbins &amp; Lawrence]], the [[Providence Tool Company]], and [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]].) The most successful milling machine design to emerge during this era was the {{visible_anchor|Lincoln miller}}, which rather than being a specific make and model of machine tool is truly a family of tools built by various companies on a common configuration over several decades. It took its name from the first company to put one on the market, George S. Lincoln &amp; Company (formerly the Phoenix Iron Works), whose first one was built in 1855 for the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] armory.&lt;ref name="Roe1916p165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, p.

During this era there was a continued blind spot in milling machine design, as various designers failed to develop a truly simple and effective means of providing slide travel in all three of the archetypal milling axes (X, Y, and Z—or as they were known in the past, longitudinal, traverse, and vertical). Vertical positioning ideas were either absent or underdeveloped. The Lincoln miller's spindle could be raised and lowered, but the original idea behind its positioning was to be set up in position and then run, as opposed to being moved frequently while running. Like a turret lathe, it was a repetitive-production machine, with each skilled setup followed by extensive fairly low skill operation.

===1860s===
[[File:Brown-and-Sharpe-universal-miller-1861-001.png|thumb|Brown &amp; Sharpe's groundbreaking universal milling machine, 1861]]
In 1861, Frederick W. Howe, while working for the Providence Tool Company, asked Joseph R. Brown of [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] for a solution to the problem of milling spirals, such as the flutes of twist drills. These were usually filed by hand at the time.&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp208-209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 208–209].&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Planer (metalworking)#Helical planing|Helical planing]] existed but was by no means common.) Brown designed a "universal milling machine" that, starting from its first sale in March 1862, was wildly successful. It solved the problem of 3-axis travel (i.e., the axes that we now call XYZ) much more elegantly than had been done in the past, and it allowed for the milling of spirals using an [[indexing head]] fed in coordination with the table feed. The term "universal" was applied to it because it was ready for any kind of work, including toolroom work, and was not as limited in application as previous designs. (Howe had designed a "universal miller" in 1852, but Brown's of 1861 is the one considered a groundbreaking success.)&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp208-209"/&gt;

Brown also developed and patented (1864) the design of formed milling cutters in which successive sharpenings of the teeth do not disturb the geometry of the form.&lt;ref name="Roe1916p206"/&gt;

The advances of the 1860s opened the floodgates and ushered in modern milling practice.

===1870s to World War I===
[[File:Horizontal milling machine--Cincinnati--early 1900s--001.png|thumb|A typical universal milling machine of the early 20th century. Suitable for toolroom, jobbing, or production use.]]
In these decades, [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] and the [[Cincinnati Milling Machine Company]] dominated the milling machine field. However, hundreds of other firms also built milling machines at the time, and many were significant in various ways. Besides a wide variety of specialized production machines, the archetypal multipurpose milling machine of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a heavy knee-and-column horizontal-spindle design with power table feeds, indexing head, and a stout overarm to support the arbor. The evolution of machine design was driven not only by inventive spirit but also by the [[Milling cutter#History|constant evolution of milling cutters]] that saw milestone after milestone from 1860 through [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972pp51-55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=51–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury1972pp79-81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=79–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and interwar period===
Around the end of World War I, machine tool control advanced in various ways that laid the groundwork for later CNC technology. The [[jig borer]] popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in "tenths" (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for [[Servomechanism|servos]] that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of [[Backlash (engineering)|antibacklash leadscrew nuts]]. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.

====Bridgeport milling machine====
In 1936, Rudolph Bannow (1897–1962) conceived of a major improvement to the milling machine.&lt;ref name="AmerPrecisMuseum1982"&gt;{{Harvnb|American Precision Museum|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His company commenced manufacturing a new knee-and-column vertical mill in 1938. This was the [[Bridgeport (machine tool brand)|Bridgeport]] milling machine, often called a ram-type or turret-type mill because its head has sliding-ram and rotating-turret mounting.  The machine became so popular that many other manufacturers created copies and variants. Furthermore, its name came to connote any such [[Genericized trademark|variant]]. The Bridgeport offered enduring advantages over previous models. It was small enough, light enough, and affordable enough to be a practical acquisition for even the smallest machine shop businesses, yet it was also smartly designed, versatile, well-built, and rigid. Its various directions of sliding and pivoting movement allowed the head to approach the work from any angle. The Bridgeport's design became the dominant form for manual milling machines used by several generations of [[Small and medium enterprises|small- and medium-enterprise]] machinists. By the 1980s an estimated quarter-million Bridgeport milling machines had been built,&lt;ref name="AmerPrecisMuseum1982"/&gt; and they (and their clones) are still being produced today. &lt;!-- Work on getting a GFDL photo of a Bridgeport to put here. --&gt;

===1940s–1970s===
By 1940, automation via cams, such as in [[Automatic lathe|screw machines and automatic chuckers]], had already been very well developed for decades. Beginning in the 1930s, ideas involving [[servomechanism]]s had been in the air, but it was especially during and immediately after [[World War II]] that they began to germinate (see also [[Numerical control#History|Numerical control &gt; History]]). These were soon combined with the emerging technology of digital [[computer]]s. This technological development milieu, spanning from the immediate pre–World War II period into the 1950s, was powered by the military capital expenditures that pursued contemporary advancements in the directing of gun and rocket artillery and in [[missile guidance]]—other applications in which humans wished to control the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinematics]]/[[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] of large machines quickly, precisely, and automatically. Sufficient R&amp;D spending probably would not have happened within the machine tool industry alone; but it was for the latter applications that the will and ability to spend was available. Once the development was underway, it was eagerly applied to machine tool control in one of the many post-WWII instances of [[technology transfer]].

In 1952, numerical control reached the developmental stage of laboratory reality. The first NC machine tool was a Cincinnati Hydrotel milling machine retrofitted with a scratch-built NC control unit. It was reported in ''Scientific American'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pease|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as another groundbreaking milling machine, the Brown &amp; Sharpe universal, had been in 1862.

During the 1950s, numerical control moved slowly [[commercialization|from the laboratory into commercial service]]. For its first decade, it had rather limited impact outside of aerospace work. But during the 1960s and 1970s, NC evolved into CNC, data storage and input media evolved, computer processing power and memory capacity steadily increased, and NC and CNC machine tools gradually disseminated from an environment of huge corporations and mainly aerospace work to the level of medium-sized corporations and a wide variety of products. NC and CNC's drastic advancement of machine tool control deeply transformed the culture of manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Noble1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noble|1984}}, throughout.&lt;!-- Can we at least get a large page range here? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The details (which are beyond the scope of this article) have evolved immensely with every passing decade.

===1980s–present===
Computers and CNC machine tools continue to develop rapidly. The [[personal computer]] revolution has a great impact on this development. By the late 1980s small machine shops had desktop computers and CNC machine tools. Soon after, hobbyists, artists, and designers began obtaining CNC mills and lathes. Manufacturers have started producing economically priced CNCs machines small enough to sit on a desktop which can cut at high resolution materials softer than stainless steel. They can be used to make anything from jewelry to printed circuit boards to gun parts, even fine art.

== Milling standards ==
National and international standards are used to standardize the definitions, environmental requirements, and test methods used for milling. Selection of the standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has some significance in the design of the mill. In the United States, [[ASME]] has developed the standards B5.45-1972 ''Milling Machines'' and B94.19-1997 ''Milling Cutters and End Mills''.

General tolerances include: +/-.005" for local tolerances across most geometries, +/-.010" for plastics with variation depending on the size of the part, 0.030" minimum wall thickness for metals, and 0.060" minimum wall thickness for plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/340051/Design_Guides/Xometry_DesignGuide_CNCMachining.pdf|title=Design Guide: CNC Machining|last=|first=|date=|website=xometry.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''Mini-Estrella''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Mini-Star") is used in [[lucha libre]] to describe a division of short [[professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] or ''luchadors'', some of whom have [[dwarfism]]. The Mexican ''Mini-Estrellas'' is comparable to [[Midget wrestling]] practiced around the world, but with the notable exception that some of the ''Mini-Estrellas'' do not have dwarfism but are simply short. Some ''Mini-Estrellas'' have later on moved on to work as regular sized competitors. The ''Mini-Estrellas'' have been featured in several promotions outside Mexico, most notably [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA).

Originally the limit for the Mini division was {{height|m=1.53}} but in recent years wrestlers such as [[Pequeño Olímpico]] have worked the Minis division despite being {{height|m=1.69}} tall.&lt;ref name=MondoMini&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha a Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher= HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=You ain't seen nothing yet: the minis|pages=209–212|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the formative years of the ''Mini-Estrellas'' history they were also referred to as "Micro Luchadors", or "Micro Wrestlers".

==History==
The origins of the ''Mini-Estrella'' division lies in [[Midget wrestling]], which in Mexico was popularized in the 1970s when promoters used the [[United States of America|American]] concept and had a number of Mexican [[Dwarfism|little people]] perform as a "special attraction" on lucha libre shows. In the early days saw the popularity of wrestlers such as Gran Nikolai, Pequeno Goliath and Arturito (inspired by [[R2-D2]]), especially with the children.&lt;ref name=LuchaMinis&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=''La Pequeña Escala'' / On a small scale|pages=80–86|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1980s midget wrestling was less popular in Mexico, especially since few new wrestlers had joined the division.&lt;ref name=MondoMini/&gt;

In the early 1990s [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's oldest wrestling promotion, created a new concept, the ''Mini-Estrella'' division. The division was created by [[Antonio Peña]] who worked for CMLL at the time, who came up with the idea of using both little people and short wrestlers together and to have the ''Mini-Estrellas'' work as smaller versions of popular wrestlers of the time. Peña and CMLL created the [[CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship]] in 1992, which is considered the official birth of the division.&lt;ref name=SL182&gt;{{cite news|author=Ocampo, Ernesto|title=El fin de una era: Adiós a Antonio Peña|work=SuperLuchas|id=issue 182|date=October 7, 2006|url=http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/|accessdate=October 14, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMLL's ''Mini-Estrellas'' division featured a number of skilled, high flying wrestlers which helped make the concept an immediate success. Original ''Mini-Estrellas'' division consisted of [[Mascarita Sagrada]] (the first CMLL Mini-Estrella champion), [[Super Muñequito|Aguilata Solitaria]], [[Octagoncito]], [[Espectrito]], Mazakrito, [[Pierrothito]], Pequeño Tritón, [[Fire (wrestler)|Mascarita Mágica]], [[Ultimo Dragoncito]], [[Pequeño Olímpico|Cicloncito Ramírez]], Pequeño Jaque Mate, Platita and [[Bracito de Oro|Gargolita]].

In 1993 Peña decided to leave CMLL and create his own wrestling promotion, [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA), and in the process a number of the ''Mini-Estrellas'' left with Peña. Among those that left CMLL were the division's two main stars, the champion Mascarita Sagrada and his rival Espectrito.&lt;ref name=SL182/&gt; Peña later created the [[Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship]] as AAA's ''Mini-Estrella'' championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: Mexican National Midget (Miniestrella) Title|page=401|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the success of both the CMLL and AAA ''Mini-Estrella'' division other promotions such as the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) and the [[World Wrestling Association]] (WWA) briefly promoted ''Mini-Estrella'' championships, but neither promotion gained the success of CMLL and AAA. AAA would later create two other ''Mini-Estrella'', the IWC and the LLL Mini-Estrellas championships, but both were later abandoned. The success of the ''Mini-Estrella'' division was evident as AAA put them in the main event of [[Triplemanía III-A]], one of AAA's biggest shows of the years. The match was a 13-Minis [[Professional wrestling match types|Steel Cage Elimination match]], ''Lucha de Apuesta'', "Mask vs. Mask" match. In the end Payasito Rojo was the last man in the cage after Bandita, Espectrito, Espectrito II, [[Mini Psicosis|Jerrito Estrada]], [[Fuercita Guerrera]], Mascarita Sagrada, Mini Calo, Octagóncito, [[La Parkita]], Payasito Azul, [[Super Muñequito]], and Torerito had all left the cage. The Triplemanía match was one of the first ever ''Luchas de Apuestas'' matches in the ''Mini-Estrella'' division.&lt;ref name="Trip3A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iii-a|title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania|date=June 10, 1995|accessdate=February 19, 2009|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA would later create another "first" in the ''Mini-Estrellas'' division as they created ''Los Mini Vipers'', a Mini version of ''[[Los Vipers]]''.&lt;ref name=AbismoOrbit&gt;{{cite news|author=Flores, Manuel|title=Abismo Negro Adiós al rey de marinete|work=SuperLuchas|id=308|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexican Federal District|D.F.]]|pages=24–26|date=March 30, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 AAA created the [[AAA Mascot Tag Team Championship]], the first and so far only tag team championship for teams consisting of a ''Mini-Estrella'' and the regular sized wrestler he is based on.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/luchadores/minis/mini-abismo-negro.html|title=AAA Luchadores – Minis – Mini Abismo Negro|accessdate=March 28, 2009|publisher=LuchalibreAAA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, then reigning Mexican National Mini-Estrellas Champion, [[Mascarita Dorada|Mascarita Sagrada 2000]] left AAA while still holding the championship; he later appeared in CMLL, repackaged as "Mascarita Dorada" but the announcers still mentioned the fact that he was the Mexican National Mini-Estrella Champion.

==Mini-Estrellas outside Mexico==
[[File:Pierothito pressing Tzuki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierrothito]] lifting [[Tzuki]] during a match in the United States.]]
The ''Mini-Estrellas'' have not been restricted to working outside Mexico, although Mexico is the only country to regularly promote the ''Mini-Estrellas'' as a specific division. Often the ''Mini-Estrellas'' are brought in for a "special attraction" match such the [[World Wrestling Council]]'s 19th and 22nd anniversary shows that featured Mascarita Sagrada and other Minis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wwc/anniv.html#17|title=WWC Anniversary Shows: #17|accessdate=March 2, 2009|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wwc/anniv.html#22|title=WWC Anniversary Shows: #22|accessdate=March 2, 2009|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) also invited the ''Mini-Estrellas'' to appear on one of their shows, a pre-PPV match at the [[Starrcade (1996)|1996 Starrcade]] where Mascarita Sagrada and Octagóncito defeated Jerrito Estrada and [[Piratita Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw96.htm|title=WCW Ring Results: 1996|accessdate=March 3, 2009|date=December 29, 1996|quote=Mascarita Sagrada &amp; Octagoncito defeated Jerrito Estrada &amp; Piratita Morgan|author=Cawthon, Graham|publisher=thehistoryofwwe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern California based Pro Wrestling Revolution is the only US based promotion to have created a specific Mini-Estrella championship, created in 2009.

In 1997 the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and AAA began a talent sharing program, which allowed several ''Mini-Estrellas'' wrestlers to compete on WWF television.&lt;ref name=juniors&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/10/15/1263952.html|title=New division added to Smackdown|author=Waldman, Jon|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=April 13, 2009|date=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These wrestlers included Mascarita Sagrada, La Parkita and several AAA ''Mini-Estrellas'' that were given new gimmicks for their WWF appearances including [[Tsuki|Max Mini]] (formerly Máscarita Sagrada, Jr.), El Torito (Espectrito), [[Mini Abismo Negro|Mini Goldust]] (Mini Karis La Momia) and Mini Vader (Piratita Morgan).&lt;ref name=juniors/&gt; Mascarita Sagrada originally wrestled under his normal name but was soon repackaged as "Mini Nova", a mini version of [[Mike Segura|Super Nova]], a ''Luchador'' that worked for the WWF at the time. Mini Nova made his in ring debut in a match at [[WWE Bad Blood#1997|Bad Blood]] in 1997 where he teamed with Max Mini against [[Espectrito II|Tarantula]] and [[Octagoncito (AAA)|Mosaic]]. The Minis appeared on ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'' as well as in matches at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]] in 1997 and the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan19_rumble.html|title=Austin wins predictable Rumble|author=Powell, John|work=Slam!

In October 2005 the WWE created a "Juniors division" exclusive to their [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|Smackdown]] brand. the division featured a number of minis from Mexico that mainly appeared in backstage skits of a comedic nature. Minis included Mascarita Sagrada, [[Tsuki]], Octagoncito and [[Pequeño Violencia]], the division also included [[Brazo de Plata|Super Porky]], who had never worked in the ''Mini-Estrella'' division in Mexico. Super Porky only appeared in backstage skits but did not wrestle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/06.htm|title=WWF Ring Results: 2006|accessdate=2009-03-02|date=2006-02-07|quote=Octagoncito &amp; Pequeno Violencia fought Mascarita Sagrada &amp; Tsuki to a no contest at 2:37 when Finlay came out and assaulted several of the participants and dropped Tsuki with the Emerald Fusion; after the bout, Finlay cut a promo saying he came to fight and didn't care about how big or small everyone else was|author=Cawthon, Graham|publisher=thehistoryofwwe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2006 the WWE gave up on the Juniors division and released all the mini wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/juniorsreleased |title=Juniors released |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219014445/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/juniorsreleased |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US based [[Lucha Libre USA]] began promoting in 2010 and featured several ''Mini-Estrellas'', unlike in Mexican promotions, ''Mini-Estrellas'' such as [[Mascarita Dorada]] and [[Pequeño Halloween]] compete against regular sized competitors instead of in a separate division.

==From Mini-Estrella to regular competitors==
[[Image:Cuije.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cuije]] held the [[AAA Mascot Tag Team Championship]] with [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|El Alebrije]].]]
Since the ''Mini-Estrella'' division is not restricted only to people with Dwarfism some wrestlers have moved on from the ''Mini-Estrellas'' division to the regular sized division, especially some of the competitors over the {{height|m=1.53}} height limit the division originally had. [[Mike Segura]] originally worked as Orito (a mini version of [[Oro (wrestler)|Oro]]) in CMLL, but when he began working for AAA he began working in the regular sized division as Super Nova.&lt;ref name=MondoMini/&gt; Similarly Felinito wrestled in CMLL as a mini but when jumped to AAA he began wrestling in the regular sized division as Mach 1. Freelance became a regular sized wrestler after losing his mask as Panterita.

In late 1997 CMLL booked an eight-man ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match where the winner would earn the right to work in the "regular sized" division. [[Virus (wrestler)|Damiancito El Guerrero]] defeated Cicloncito Ramírez, Tritoncito, Pequeño Cochisse, Platita, [[Espectrito II|Guerrerito del Future]], Pequeño Sayama and [[Pequeño Violencia|Fierito]] to earn the right to work with "regular sized" wrestlers.&lt;ref name=SL301&gt;{{cite news|author=Manuel Rivera|title=Entrevista por Virus|work=SuperLuchas|id=301|page=25|date=January 12, 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1998 he made his debut as part of the regular sized division under the name "Virus", no mention was made that Virus used to work as Damiancito El Guerrero or the fact that he still held the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship. By 1999 CMLL decided that it was time to crown a new CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion as Virus was still technically the champion despite not having worked as a mini for over a year. Instead of making Virus return to the Minis division to lose the title CMLL decided to give the championship to [[Ultimo Dragoncito]] and then subsequently announce that Ultimo Dragoncito had "won" the title on an undisclosed day in October 1999.&lt;ref name=CMLLMini&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: EMLL CMLL Midget (miniestrella) Title|page=396|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMLL is currently holding a "Bicentennial tournament" in August, 2010 to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the ''Mini-Estrellas'' division, where the winner will "graduate" to the regular sized division. The tournament consists of two ''torneo cibernetico'' elimination matches with the winner of each facing off in a singles match on August 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2010/08/10/arena-mexico-martes-10-de-agosto-18-aniversario-de-los-luchadores-minis-con-el-torneo-bicentenario/|title=Arena México (martes 10 de agosto) – 18 Aniversario de los luchadores minis con el Torneo Bicentenario|date=August 10, 2010|author=Ruiz Glez, Alex|accessdate=August 12, 2010|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2010/08/10/cmll-el-sueno-de-un-mini-estrella-se-convierte-realidad/|title=CMLL- El sueño de un mini estrella se convierte realidad|date=August 10, 2010|author=Oculto, Rostro|accessdate=August 12, 2010|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pequeño Damián 666|Demus 3:16]] won the first ''cibernetico'', defeating [[Electrico (wrestler)|Eléctrico]], [[Saturno (wrestler)|Saturno]], [[Fantasy (Mini-Estrella)|Fantasy]], [[Pequeño Olímpico]], [[Pequeño Nitro]], [[Pequeño Violencia]] and [[Cisne (wrestler)|Cisne]] to earn a place in the finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2010/08/11/arena-mexico-resultados-10-de-agosto-demus-316-gana-la-primera-eliminatoria-del-torneo-de-minis-bicentenario/|title=Arena México (resultados 10 de agosto): Demus 3:16, gana la primera eliminatoria del Torneo de Minis Bicentenario|author=Ruiz Glez, Alex|date=August 11, 2010|accessdate=August 12, 2010|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second ''torneo cibernetico'' took place on August 17, 2010, and was won by Pierrothito. On August 24, 2010, Demus 3:16 defeated Pierrothito in the finals of the tournament to earn his way out of the ''Mini-Estrella'' division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2010/08/25/arena-mexico-resultados-martes-24-de-agosto-demus-316-gana-el-torneo-bicentenario-de-minis-y-se-une-con-los-%E2%80%9Cgrandes%E2%80%9D/|title=Arena México (Resultados martes 24 de agosto) – Demus 3:16 gana el torneo bicentenario de minis y se une con los "grandes"|author=Ruiz Glez, Alex|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate= March 12, 2011|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Demus 3:16 wrestled Virus in a hair vs. hair mask. Demus 3:16 lost the match and after that he returned to the minis division.

==Wrestling style==
Since ''Mini-Estrella'' wrestlers are smaller and possess less muscle bulk than heavyweights or even [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweights]] it lends to a [[professional wrestling aerial techniques|high-flying]] wrestling style for a number of the ''Mini-Estrellas'', especially in recent years.&lt;ref name=MondoMini/&gt; Some wrestlers such as Mascarita Dorada are able to perform moves that his regular sized counterpart would have a hard time executing.&lt;ref name=MondoMini/&gt; Not all performers in the ''Mini-Estrella'' division are able to work a high flying style, especially those with more severe forms of dwarfism work a more grounded style.&lt;ref name=LuchaMinis/&gt;

==Championships==
The first Mini-Estrellas championship was created in 1992 when CMLL created the CMLL Mini-Estrellas World Championship. Since then rivals AAA, UWA and WWA all created a Mini-Estrellas championship, although only AAA's championship sustained any longevity. In 2008 CMLL decided to use the [[Mexican National Lightweight Championship]] as a secondary title for the ''Mini-Estrellas'' division. Up until that point the Lightweight title had not been considered a ''Mini-Estrellas'' championship.&lt;ref name=Pierrothito&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n863596.htm|title=En honor a Panther|author=Alfredo Ascencio|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=July 12, 2009|publisher= ESTO, OEM Online|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">In [[information extraction]], a '''named entity''' is a real-world object, such as persons, locations, organizations, products, etc., that can be denoted with a proper name. It can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include [[Barack Obama]], [[New York City]], [[Volkswagen Golf]], or anything else that can be named. Named entities can simply be viewed as entity instances (e.g., [[New York City]] is an instance of a [[city]]).

From a historical perspective, the term ''Named Entity'' was coined during the [[Message Understanding Conference|MUC-6 evaluation campaign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Grishman |first1=Ralph |first2=Beth |last2=Sundheim |title=Design of the MUC-6 evaluation |conference=TIPSTER '96 Proceedings |year=1996|url=https://aclweb.org/anthology/M/M95/M95-1001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contained ENAMEX (entity name expressions e.g. persons, locations and organizations) and NUMEX (numerical expression).

A more formal definition can be derived from the [[rigid designator]] by [[Saul Kripke]]. In the expression "Named Entity", the word "Named" aims to restrict the possible set of entities to only those for which one or many rigid designators stands for the referent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Nadeau |first1=David |first2=Satoshi |last2=Sekine |title=A survey of named entity recognition and classification |conference=Lingvisticae Investigationes |year=2007|url=http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/sekine/papers/li07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A designator is rigid when it designates the same thing in every possible world. On the contrary, [[Non-rigid designator|flaccid designators]] may designate different things in different possible worlds.

As an example, consider the sentence, "Obama is the president of the United States". Both "Obama" and the "United States" are named entities since they refer to specific objects ([[Barack Obama]] and [[United States]]). However, "president" is not a named entity since it can be used to refer to many different objects in different worlds (in different presidential periods referring to different persons, or even in different countries or organizations referring to different people). Rigid designators usually include proper names as well as certain natural terms like biological species and substances.

There is also a general agreement in the [[Named Entity Recognition]] community to consider as named entities temporal and numerical expressions such as amounts of money and other types of units, which may violate the rigid designator perspective.

The task of recognizing named entities in text is [[Named Entity Recognition]] while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called [[Entity Linking|Named Entity Disambiguation]]. Both tasks require dedicated algorithms and resources to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Damien|last1=Nouvel|first2=Maud|last2=Ehrmann|first3=Sophie|last3=Rosset|title=Named Entities for Computational Linguistics|editor=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1-84821-838-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
'''Penis envy''' ({{lang-de|Penisneid}}) is a stage theorized by [[Sigmund Freud]] regarding [[female]] [[psychosexual development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2616954|title=Three essays on the theory of sexuality|last=1856-1939.|first=Freud, Sigmund,|date=1975|origyear=1962|publisher=Basic Books|others=Strachey, James.|isbn=0465097081|location=New York|oclc=2616954}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which young girls experience anxiety upon realization that they do not have a [[Human penis|penis]]. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in a series of transitions toward a mature female sexuality and [[gender identity]]. In Freudian theory, the penis envy stage begins the transition from an attachment to the mother to competition with the mother for the attention, recognition and affection of the father.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 158-163&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel reaction of a [[boy]]'s realization that women do not have a penis is [[castration anxiety]].

Freud's theories regarding psychosexual development, and in particular the ''phallic stage'', were criticized and refined by other psychoanalysts, such as [[Karen Horney]], [[Otto Fenichel]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Juliet Mitchell]], and [[Clara Thompson]].

==Freud's theory==
Freud introduced his theory of the concept of interest in—and envy of—the penis in his 1908 article "On the Sexual Theories of Children":&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 195-6&lt;/ref&gt; it was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality|Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex]]'' (1905), but a synopsis of the 1908 article was added to the third edition in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 112-4&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[On Narcissism]]'' (1914) he described how some women develop a masculine ideal as "a survival of the boyish nature that they themselves once possessed".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 83-4&lt;/ref&gt; The term grew in significance as Freud gradually refined his views of sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred as one went from the [[phallic stage]] to the [[Psychosexual development#Latency phase|latency stage]] (see [[Psychosexual development]]).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 336-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosexual development: child===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

In Freud's psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the [[libido]] (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the ''oral stage'', in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to ''both'' sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events, known as the [[Oedipus complex]] for boys, and the [[Electra complex]] for girls, result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

Freud thought girls:
* Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
* The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
* She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father's penis.
* She develops a sexual desire for her father.
* The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what ''she'' sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
* Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
* The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
* The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of [[lex talionis]]).
* The girl employs the [[defence mechanism]] of [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development; the key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy's father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gender role.

===Psychosexual development: adult===

Freud considered that in normal female development penis envy transformed into the wish for a man and/or a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 297-301&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] differentiated two types of adult women in whom penis envy remained intense as the wish-fulfilling and the vindictive types:&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 494-5&lt;/ref&gt; The former were dominated by fantasies of having or becoming a penis—as with the singing/dancing/performing women who felt that in their acts they magically incorporated the [parental] phallus.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (2005) p. 29-30 and p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The latter sought revenge on the male through humiliation or deprivation (whether by removing the man from the penis or the penis from the man).&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (1974) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of Freud's theory==

===Within psychoanalytic circles===
Freud's theories regarding psychosexual development, and in particular the ''phallic stage'', were early challenged by other psychoanalysts, such as [[Karen Horney]], Otto Fenichel and [[Ernest Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt; though Freud did not accept their view of penis envy as a secondary, rather than a primary, female reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 391-2&lt;/ref&gt; Later psychologists, such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Jean Piaget]], challenged the Freudian model of child psychological development as a whole.

[[Jacques Lacan]], however, took up and developed Freud's theory of the importance of what he called "''penisneid'' in the unconscious of women"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; in linguistic terms, seeing what he called the phallus as the privileged signifier of humanity's subordination to language: "the phallus (by virtue of which the unconscious is language)".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; He thereby opened up a new field of debate around [[phallogocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bnhNE6LrmMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22penis%20envy%22%20OR%20%22phallogocentrism%22&amp;f=false The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism]'' (1995) p. 224-6 and p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;—some figures like [[Juliet Mitchell]] endorsing a view of penis envy which "uses, not the man, but the phallus to which the man has to lay claim, as its key term",&lt;ref&gt;Juliet Mitchell and [[Jacqueline Rose]], ''Feminine Sexuality'' (1982) p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; others strongly repudiating it.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist and sociological criticisms===
In Freud's theory, the female sexual center shifts from the [[clitoris]] to the [[vagina]] during a heterosexual life event. Freud believed in a duality between how [[gender]]s construct mature sexuality in terms of the opposite gender, whereas feminists reject the notion that female sexuality can only be defined in relation to the male. Feminists development theorists instead believe that the clitoris, not the vagina, is the mature center of female sexuality because it allows a construction of mature female sexuality independent of the penis. 

A significant number of [[Feminism|feminists]] have been highly critical of penis envy theory {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} as a concept and psychoanalysis as a discipline, arguing that the assumptions and approaches of the psychoanalytic project are profoundly [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], anti-feminist, and [[misogynist]]ic and represent women as broken or deficient men.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 520-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Horney]]—a German psychoanalyst who also placed great emphasis on childhood experiences in psychological development—was a particular advocate of this view. She asserted the concept of "[[womb envy]]", and saw "masculine [[narcissism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; as underlying the mainstream Freudian view.

Some [[Feminism|feminists]]  argue that Freud's developmental theory is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] and denies women a mature sexuality independent of men; they also criticize it for privileging the [[vagina]] over the [[clitoris]] as the center of [[Human female sexuality|women's sexuality]]. They criticize the sociosexual theory for privileging heterosexual [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and penile penetration in defining women's "mature state of sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 94-101&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the concept explains how, in a patriarchal society, women might envy the power accorded to those with a phallus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, ed., ''Freud and Women'' (1990) p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

In her influential paper "Women and Penis Envy" (1943), [[Clara Thompson]] reformulated the latter as ''social'' envy for the trappings of the dominant gender,&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Friday, ''Women on Top'' (1991) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Sociology|sociological]] response to female subordination under patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol I'' (1973) p. 332-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betty Friedan]] referred to penis envy as a purely parasitic social bias typical of Victorianism and particularly of Freud's own biography, and showed how the concept played a key role in discrediting alternative notions of femininity in the early to mid twentieth century: "Because Freud's followers could only see woman in the image defined by Freud – inferior, childish, helpless, with no possibility of happiness unless she adjusted to being man's passive object – they wanted to help women get rid of their suppressed envy, their neurotic desire to be equal. They wanted to help women find sexual fulfilment as women, by affirming their natural inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Betty Friedan, The Feminine Mystique, 1963, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small but influential number of Feminist philosophers, working in [[Psychoanalytic feminism]], and including [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 94-101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hélène Cixous]], have taken varying [[post-structuralist]] views on the question, inspired or at least challenged by figures such as Jacques Lacan and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliet Mitchell]] in her early work attempted to reconcile Freud's thoughts on psychosexual development with Feminism and Marxism by declaring his theories to be simply observations of gender identity under [[capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Born in [[Arusha]], Palangyo was educated locally, in [[Uganda]] and the United States. He majored in biology at [[St. Olaf College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], [[Minnesota]], and went on to graduate school at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Abandoning the sciences for literature, he took a diploma of education from [[Makerere University College]] and taught in several secondary schools. In 1968 he returned to the United States to join the writers' workshop at the [[University of Iowa]], and gained an MFA in creative writing.

{{Dravidian}}
'''Proto-Dravidian''' is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of the common ancestor of the [[Dravidian languages]].{{sfn|Andronov|2003|p=299}} It is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian, and Proto-South Dravidian, although the date of diversification is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bhadriraju Krishnamurti |title=The Dravidian Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54fV7Lwu3fMC&amp;pg=PA492 |date=16 January 2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-43533-8 |page=492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Elamo-Dravidian languages}}

As a [[proto-language]], the Proto-Dravidian language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It is suggested that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=chvjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&amp;dq=the+proto-+Dravidian+linguistic+community+disintegrated+at+the+beginning+of+the+4th+millennium+B.+C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y History and Archaeology, Volume 1, Issues 1-2] p.234, Department of Ancient History, Culture, and Archaeology, University of Allahabad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Proto-Dravidian contrasted between five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*ā'', ''*i'', ''*ī'', ''*u'', ''*ū'', ''*e'', ''*ē'', ''*o'', ''*ō''.  The sequences ''*ai'' and ''*au'' are treated as ''*ay'' and ''*av'' (or *''aw'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Baldi | first = Philip   | title = Linguistic Change and Reconstruction Methodology  | publisher = Walter de Gruyter  | year = 1990 | isbn = 3-11-011908-0 | page = 342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
Proto-Dravidian has been reconstructed as having the following consonant phonemes (Subrahmanyam 1983:p40, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurthi 2003):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! [[Labial consonant|Labial]]
! [[Dental consonant|Dental]]
! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
! [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]
! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
! [[Velar consonant|Velar]]
! [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|- align=center
! [[Nasal stop|Nasal]]
| *m
| *n̪
| *n
| *ɳ
| *ɲ
| (*ŋ)
|
|- align=center
! [[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]
| *p
| *t̪
| *t
| *ʈ
| *c
| *k
|
|- align=center
! [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
|
|
|
| *ɭ(*ṛ, *r̤)
|
|
| (*h)
|- align=center
! [[Flap consonant|Flap]]
|
|
| *r
|
|
|
|
|- align=center
! [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]
| *v
|
| *l
| *ɭ
| *j
|
|
|}

The alveolar stop ''*ṯ'' in many daughter languages developed into an alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}}. The stop sound is retained in [[Kota language (India)|Kota]] and [[Toda language|Toda]] (Subrahmanyam 1983). [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] still retains the original (alveolar) stop sound in gemination. (''ibid''). In Old Tamil it took the enunciative vowel like the other stops. In other words, ''*ṯ'' (or ''*ṟ'') did not occur word-finally without the enunciative vowel (''ibid'').

Velar nasal ''*ṅ'' occurred only before ''*k'' in Proto-Dravidian (as in many of its daughter languages). Therefore, it is not considered a separate phoneme in Proto-Dravidian. However, it attained phonemic status in languages like Malayalam, [[Gondi language|Gondi]], [[Konda language (Dravidian)|Konda]] and [[Pengo language|Pengo]] because the original sequence ''*ṅk'' was simplified to ''*ṅ''. (Subrahmanyam 1983)

The glottal fricative ''*h'' has been proposed by Bh. Krishnamurthi to account for the Old Tamil Aytam (''Āytam'') and other Dravidian comparative phonological phenomena (Krishnamurthi 2003).

The Northern Dravidian languages [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], [[Malto language|Malto]] and [[Brahui language|Brahui]] cannot easily be derived from the traditional Proto-Dravidian phonological system. McAlpin (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David W.|last=McAlpin|title=Velars, Uvulars and the Northern Dravidian hypothesis|year=2003|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=123:3|pp=521–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that they branched off from an earlier stage of Proto-Dravidian than the conventional reconstruction, which would apply only to the other languages. He suggests reconstructing a richer system of dorsal stop consonants:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Early Proto-Dravidian !! Late Proto-Dravidian&lt;br&gt;(Proto-Non-North Dravidian) !! Proto-Kurukh-Malto !! Brahui
|- align="center"
| *c || *c || *c ||&lt;!--tʃ?--&gt;
|- align="center"
| *kʲ || *c || *k || k
|- align="center"
| *k || *k || *k || k
|- align="center"
| *q || *k || *q || x&lt;br/&gt;k / _i(ː)
|}

== Speakers ==

The [[Dravidian_people#Origins|origin and territory of the Proto-Dravidian speakers]] is uncertain, but some suggestions have been made based on the reconstructed Proto-Dravidian vocabulary. The reconstruction has been done on the basis of cognate words present in the different branches ([[Northern Dravidian languages|Northern]], [[Central Dravidian Languages|Central]] and [[South Dravidian|Southern]]) of the Dravidian language family.{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=353}}

According to Dorian Fuller (2007), the botanical vocabulary of Proto-Dravidian is characteristic of the [[dry deciduous forest]]s of central and peninsular India. This region extends from [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests|Saurashtra]] and [[Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests|Central India]] to [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|South India]]. It thus represents the general area in which the Dravidians were living before separation of branches.{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=353}}

According to [[Franklin Southworth]] (2005), the Proto-Dravidian vocabulary is characteristic of a rural economy based on agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting. However, there are some indications of a society more complex than a rural one:{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=353-354}}

* Words for an [[storey|upper storey]] and [[beam (structure)|beam]]
* Metallurgy
* Trade
* Payment of dues (possibly taxes or contributions to religious ceremonies)
* Social stratification

These evidences are not sufficient to determine with certainty the territory of the Proto-Dravidians. These characteristics can be accommodated within multiple contemporary cultures, including:{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=353-354}}

* 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE Neolithic-Chalcolithic cultures of present-day [[Ahar-Banas culture|western Rajasthan]], [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and other parts of the peninsula.
* [[List of Indus Valley Civilisation sites|Indus Valley civilization sites]] in Saurashtra (Sorath) area of present-day [[Gujarat]]. [[Asko Parpola]] identifies Proto-Dravidians with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) and the [[Meluhha]] people mentioned in [[Sumer]]ian records. According to him, the word "Meluhha" derives from the Dravidian words ''mel-akam'' ("highland country"). It is possible that the IVC people exported [[sesame oil]] to [[Mesopotamia]], where it was known as ''ilu'' in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and ''ellu'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. One theory is that these words derive from the Dravidian name for sesame (''el'' or ''ellu''). However, [[Michael Witzel]], who associates IVC with the ancestors of [[Munda languages|Munda]] speakers, suggests an alternative etymology from the para-Munda word for wild sesame: ''jar-tila''. Munda is an [[Austroasiatic language]].{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=354}}

'''Running economy''' consists of many [[physiology|physiological]] and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] factors that contribute to running performance, and is measured to quantify [[energy homeostasis|energy utilization]] while running at an [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] intensity.&lt;ref name="DRF_Daniels"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first1=Jack |authorlink=Jack Daniels (coach) |title=Daniels' Running Formula |chapter=Aerobic and training profiles |edition=3 |editor-last=Hanlon |editor-first=Tom |editor-link=Tom Hanlon |editor2-last=Marty |editor2-first=Claire |editor3-last=Wolpert |editor3-first=Tyler |location=Champaign, IL |publisher=Human Kinetics |date=31 Dec 2013 |pages=33–38 |isbn=978-1450431835 |quote=The measure of energy expended while running aerobically at some submax speeds is a measure of running economy. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="FAR_Saunders"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Factor affecting running economy in trained distance runners |journal=Sports Medicine |year=2004 |last=Saunders |first=Philo |last2=Pyne |first2=David |last3=Telford |first3=Richard |last4=Hawley |first4=John |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=465–485 |pmid=15233599 |url=http://www.siuaps.univ-rennes1.fr/digitalAssets/312/312102_Saunders_et_al.__2004_._Running_economy__Review___1_.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-18 |quote=Running economy (RE) is typically defined as the energy demand for a given velocity of submaximal running, and is determined by measuring the steady-state consumption of oxygen (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the respiratory exchange ratio. |doi=10.2165/00007256-200434070-00005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821125357/http://www.siuaps.univ-rennes1.fr/digitalAssets/312/312102_Saunders_et_al.__2004_._Running_economy__Review___1_.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}}&lt;ref name="TOM_Crowther"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/crowther/Misc/RBC/economy.shtml |title=Tips on maximizing your running economy |last=Crowther |first=Greg |work=Greg Crowther professional website |date=2001 |accessdate=2014-08-20 |quote=Measuring someone's running economy is equivalent to asking the question, "How far can this person run using a given amount of energy?" Energy use is usually reported in terms of oxygen consumption; the farther the person can run per unit of oxygen consumed -- or, stated another way, the less oxygen he/she consumes in running a given distance -- the more economical he/she is. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Respirometry|Oxygen consumption]] (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most direct method for measuring running economy, as the exchange of gases in the body, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, closely reflects energy metabolism. Those who are able to consume less oxygen while running at a given velocity are said to have a better running economy.

In [[distance running]], an athlete may attempt to improve performance through training designed to improve running economy. Running economy has been found to be a good predictor of race performance; it has been found to be a stronger correlate of performance than maximal oxygen uptake ([[VO2max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]]) in trained runners with the same values (Saunders, 2004). The literature relating to RE is vast and the determinants of RE supported by empirical data.

==Factors affecting running economy==
In ''The Lore of Running'', [[Tim Noakes]], a professor of exercise and sports science at the [[University of Cape Town]], and also recreational runner, describes a number of variables that may affect running economy: vertical motion while running, the ability of the muscles to absorb energy during the shock of landing and transfer it to push-off, [[biomechanics|biomechanical factors]], technique and type of activity, fitness and training, age, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], weight of clothing and shoes, and environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Noakes"&gt;Noakes, Tim. 2003. ''The Lore of Running.'' (4th edition) [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-87322-959-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various studies have shown [[marathon|marathon runners]] to be more economical than [[middle distance running|middle distance runners]] and [[sprint (running)|sprinters]] at speeds of 6–12 miles per hour (10-19 kilometers per hour).&lt;ref name="Kenney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kenney |first1=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">'''Sociocultural linguistics''' is a term used to encompass a broad range of theories and methods for the study of [[language]] in its sociocultural context.  Its growing use is a response to the increasingly narrow association of the term [[sociolinguistics]] with specific types of research involving the [[quantitative research|quantitative analysis]] of [[Linguistics#Variation|linguistic features]] and their correlation to [[sociology|sociological]] variables.  The term as it is currently used not only clarifies this distinction, but highlights an awareness of the necessity for transdisciplinary approaches to [[language]], [[culture]] and [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.  (2010). Theme-based research in the transdisciplinary field of educational linguistics.  In F.M. Hult (Ed.), &lt;i&gt;Directions and prospects for educational linguistics&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 19-32).  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The scope of sociocultural linguistics, as described by researchers such as [[Kira Hall]] and [[Mary Bucholtz]], is potentially vast, though often includes work drawing from disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[sociology of language]], as well as certain streams of [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[folklore|folklore studies]], [[media studies]], [[social theory|social]] and [[literary theory]], and the [[philosophy of language]].

==Historical precedents==
Sociocultural linguists, especially in the United States, take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of language and the social and cultural functions of language use. Although [[Generative linguistics|generative]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] have been dominant in the United States since the mid-twentieth century, American linguists have periodically proposed to bring their studies closer to other fields of social inquiry. For example, in 1929, [[Edward Sapir]] urged linguists to move beyond diachronic and formal analyses for their own sake and to "become aware of what their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in general" (1929:207).

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is peculiarly important that linguists, who are often accused, and accused justly, of failure to look beyond the pretty patterns of their subject matter, should become aware of what their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in general. Whether they like it or not, they must become increasingly concerned with the many anthropological, sociological, and psychological problems which invade the field of language. [Sapir 1929:214]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Forty years later, [[Dell Hymes]] (1964) lamented that the socially integrated linguistics Sapir had called for was disappearing. Hymes and others worried that new formal approaches, as well as the push for [[linguistics]] as an autonomous field, threatened to once again isolate linguists. At the same time, though, the growth of [[ethnolinguistics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] offered a venue for the socially engaged linguistics Sapir had called for four decades earlier.

After four more decades, just as Hymes (1964) worried that linguistics had been bleached of its association with the study of human interaction in the wake of formalist studies, scholars noted that sociolinguistics in turn had narrowed to denote only specific types of study. Sociocultural linguistics is thus "the broad interdisciplinary field concerned with the intersection of language, culture, and society" (Bucholtz and Hall 2005: 5).

'''South Bolivian Quechua''', also known as '''Central Bolivian Quechua''', is a dialect of [[Southern Quechua]] spoken in [[Bolivia]] and adjacent areas of [[Argentina]], where it is also known as ''Colla''. It is not to be confused with North Bolivian Quechua, which is spoken on the northern Andean slopes of Bolivia and is phonologically distinct from the South Bolivian variety. Estimates of the number of speakers of South Bolivian Quechua range from 2.3&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;Moseley, Christopher (ed.). 2010. [http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1943.html "Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, 3rd edn."] Paris, UNESCO Publishing. Online version."&lt;/ref&gt; to 2.8 million,&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BO/status "Bolivia"] at ''[[Ethnologue]]'' (17th ed., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most spoken [[languages of Bolivia|indigenous language in Bolivia]], just slightly greater than Aymara, with roughly 2 million speakers in Bolivia. In comparison, the North Bolivian dialect has roughly 116,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt;

== History and dialect classification ==

South Bolivian Quechua is a member of the Southern branch of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua language family]], making it closely related to other Southern Quechua dialects including [[Ayacucho Quechua|Ayacucho]] and particularly [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]],&lt;ref name="Adelaar"&gt;Adelaar, Willem F.H., and Pieter C. Muysken. ''The Languages of the Andes.'' Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; varieties which are both spoken in Peru.

The Quechua language family spans an extremely diverse set of languages, many of which are mutually unintelligible, which is why linguists have classified Quechua as a language family as opposed to one language with many dialects. Though it is believed that all Quechuan languages descended from a single ancestor, Proto-Quechua, there is still debate on how the modern Quechuan languages evolved into their current states, and what this timeline would look like. As a result of this, there have been numerous suggested classifications and theories of the relatedness of specific languages and dialects of Quechua.&lt;ref name="Landerman"&gt;Landerman, Peter Nelson. ''Quechua Dialects and Their Classification.'' Ann Arbor: UMI Dissertation Services, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current broad division of Quechua into [[Quechua language|four main branches]] is generally accepted.

[[Joseph Greenberg]], in his highly contested theory of the [[Amerind languages|Amerind superfamily]], places the Quechua language family in the Andean branch of Amerind, which is part of the larger Southern Amerind branch that encompasses all indigenous South American languages. Much of Greenberg's proposal has been disproved, and his claims regarding Quechua are equally suspect. Even at one of his lower subgroupings, the Andean language family, the idea that Andean languages such as Quechua and Aymara are related is still debated, and the common consensus is that similarities between Quechua and Aymara arose from language contact as opposed to a genetic relationship.&lt;ref name=Heggarty4&gt;Heggarty, Paul. [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/quechua/Eng/Sounds/Aymara/AymaraOriginsAndDiversity.htm "Origins and Diversity of Aymara"], last updated 21 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some dialectal differences in South Bolivian Quechua across the regions of Bolivia. These dialects include Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Oruro, Potosi, and Sucre in Bolivia, along with Northwest Jujuy in Argentina. There are perhaps still a few speakers, out of 8,000 ethnic Quechua, in Chile. [[Santiagueño Quechua]] in Argentina, though divergent, appears to derive at least partly from South Bolivian Quechua.

== Language status ==

Quechua is recognized as an official language of Bolivia, one of the 36 indigenous languages declared official in the nation's Constitution. At approximately 2.8 million speakers out of a population of roughly 10 million, it is the most widely spoken indigenous language in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt; This number is much greater than many other prominent indigenous languages of Bolivia such as [[North Bolivian Quechua]] (116,000 speakers) or [[Guaraní language|Guarani]] (33,700 speakers). However, compared to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which is spoken by 8.7 million or roughly 87% of Bolivians, Quechua is much less widely used. There have been numerous concerns raised over the status of indigenous languages including South Bolivian Quechua due to the prestige language in the area, Spanish, potentially forcing the endangerment of other devalued languages.&lt;ref name="Molina"&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. [http://droitcultures.revues.org/2661 "Revitalization of Endangered Languages: Quechua in the Andes"], ''Droit et cultures'', online 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ethnologue]] lists South Bolivian Quechua as "developing", which indicates that "the language is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some though this is not yet widespread or sustainable."&lt;ref name="ethnologue2"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status "Language Status"] at ''[[Ethnologue]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[UNESCO]]'s Atlas of Endangered Languages categorizes South Bolivian Quechua as "vulnerable",&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; defined as the following: "Most but not all children or families of a particular community speak the language as their first language, but it may be restricted to specific social domains (such as at home, where children interact with their parents and grandparents)."&lt;ref name="unesco2"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001836/183699E.pdf "UNESCO: Language Vitality and Endangerment"], 10–12 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; While South Bolivian Quechua and the Quechua language family in general are much better off compared to many other indigenous languages due to the relatively large number of speakers, Quechua is still in danger due to its long history of Spanish influence and bilingualism. In addition, the linguistic, ideological, and cultural differences among its many dialects make it difficult for policymakers to approach Quechua as a whole, as each Quechua community provides different challenges in regard to language policy and planning.&lt;ref name="Molina" /&gt;

Over the past few decades there has been a surge in revitalization efforts for Quechua and other indigenous languages due to factors such as a growth in international tourism promoting cultural pride.&lt;ref name=Heggarty3&gt;Heggarty, Paul. [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/quechua/Eng/Main/i_DANGER.HTM "How Endangered is Quechua?"], last updated 21 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts have been made to increase the linguistic and cultural status of the Quechua language and peoples. In Bolivia, many policymakers are advocating the teaching of Quechua and other indigenous languages like Aymara in all public schools and government offices.&lt;ref name="Reel"&gt;Reel, Monte. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901665.html "In Bolivia, Speaking Up for Native Languages"]. The Washington Post, 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these revitalization efforts are often met with resistance, and their effectiveness in halting Quechua's decline is still questionable.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

South Bolivian Quechua has three basic vowel sounds: unrounded front vowel /i/, rounded back vowel /u/, and low central vowel /a/. The front vowel /i/ is lowered to [e] or [ɛ] when next to a uvular stop or when separated from a uvular stop only by a non-stop consonant. The  back vowel /u/ is similarly lowered in this environment, to [o] or [ɔ].

=== Consonants ===

The following table displays the consonant sounds in South Bolivian Quechua using the orthographic system employed by Bills (1969).&lt;ref name="Bills"&gt;Bills, Garland D., Bernardo Vallejo C., and Rudolph C. Troike. ''An Introduction to Spoken Bolivian Quechua.'' Austin: U of Texas P, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; IPA equivalents are included in brackets where necessary.

There are four stops and one affricate /ch/ in the basic sound system. The five sounds contrast with both their aspirated and glottalized versions, a characteristic that occurs in many dialects of the Quechua language family and is believed to be as a result of exposure to [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which makes the same distinctions.&lt;ref name="Adelaar" /&gt; Aspiration and glottalization can be seen to be contrastive in minimal pairs such as ''puñun'' "he sleeps" versus ''p'uñun'' "his jug", and ''piña'' "pineapple" versus ''p"iña'' "wild".

All stops, affricates, and fricatives are voiceless with the exception of /q/, which becomes a voiced uvular fricative [ʁ] syllable-initially.&lt;ref name="Bills" /&gt;

Additional phonological alternations include fricativization of /k/ and /q/ syllable-finally to velar [x] and uvular [χ] respectively. The fricative /s/ has allophones [s] and [ʃ], of which the latter occurs quite infrequently.{{refn|group=nb|Crapo writes these allophones as two separate phonemes.&lt;ref name="Crapo"&gt;Crapo, Richley H., and Percy Aitken. ''Bolivian Quechua Reader and Grammar-Dictionary.'' Ann Arbor: Karoma, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}} All fricatives occur only word-initially and medially, never finally.

The three nasal sounds assimilate to the point of articulation of the following consonant sound. Word-finally, /n/ is the only nasal that occuan; it becomes [ŋ].

=== Syllable structure ===

South Bolivian Quechua generally has a simple CV(C) syllable structure, where the coda consonant is optional. The onset consonant is also optional word-initially, as in the words ''ima'' "what" and ''uk'' "one", and Spanish borrowings can contain word-initial consonant clusters of the form CCV(C), as in ''bwenos diyas'' "good morning". No more than two consonants are allowed in a consonant cluster.

Proto-Quechua has few constraints on the combinations of consonant clusters allowed, but due to consonant [[lenition]] syllable-finally, there are greater restrictions on the types of consonant clusters that occur in South Bolivian Quechua.&lt;ref name="Adelaar" /&gt; Some of the possible consonant clusters can be seen in the following examples:

* ''čilwi'' "chick, baby chicken"
* ''p'isqu'' "bird"
* ''qan munanki'' "you want it"
* ''kayqa'' "this"
* ''waliqlla rirquy'' "may you go well"

=== Stress ===

Primary stress generally occurs on the penultimate syllable of the word, with secondary stresses on alternating syllables. This can be seen in the following analyses for the words ''munankičis'' and ''munankičisñaču'' (root verb ''muna'' "want, desire"), where stress has been numbered below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| mu || nan || ki || čis
|-
| 2 ||  || 1 || 
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| mu || nan || ki || čis || ña || ču
|-
| 2 ||  || 3 ||  || 1 || 
|}

Rare exceptions exist where the final syllable of the word carries the primary stress, such as in ''ari'' "yes". There also exist some 'emotive' suffixes in the language that are always stressed, resulting in stress on the last syllable of the word.&lt;ref name="Crapo" /&gt; Stress on the final syllable can also occur through the dropping of some single-syllable suffixes (for instance, the yes/no question marker ''-chu'') without a subsequent shifting of the stress.

==Morphology==

South Bolivian Quechua is an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[polysynthetic language]] with a rich [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational morphology]], allowing the language to convey a large amount of information in a single word. As a result of this, words in South Bolivian Quechua can be very long.&lt;ref name="Heggarty1"&gt;Heggarty, Paul. [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/quechua/Eng/Main/i_LING.HTM "Quechua: Main Points of Interest for Linguists"], last updated 21 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Words in the language are purely [[suffix]]al; no other types of [[affix]]es are used. These suffixes are also highly regular, with alternations generally only occurring to maintain syllable structure.

Morphemes within a word are ordered as follows:

* root + derivational suffixes + inflectional suffixes + clitics

===Derivational morphology===

South Bolivian Quechua has many clearly derivational suffixes, where a noun, verb, or adjective is derived from a different lexical category.&lt;ref name="Heggarty2"&gt;Heggarty, Paul. [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/quechua/Eng/Main/i_ASPECTS.HTM "Some Intriguing Aspects of Quechua"], last updated 21 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are a few examples:

''Note:'' -y ''is the verb infinitive marker.''

* ''-cha'' (factive): ''wasi'' "house", ''wasi-cha-y'' "to build a house"
* ''-naya'' (desiderative): ''aycha'' "meat", ''aycha-naya-y'' "to feel like eating some meat"
* ''-ya'' (autotransformative): ''wira'' "fat", ''wira-ya-y'' "to get fat, put on weight"
* ''-na'' (obligative): ''tiya'' "sit", ''tiya-na'' "seat, chair"
* ''-yuq'' (possessive): ''wasi'' "house", ''wasi-yuq'' "householder"
* ''-li'' (adjective formative from verb): ''mancha'' "fear", ''mancha-li'' "cowardly, fearful"

Other suffixes are less clearly categorized as derivational or inflectional, including some aspectual suffixes as well as a class of suffixes termed “auxiliary”. For example, the causative suffix ‘’-chi’’ may seem straightforwardly inflectional in some instances:

* ''mik"u-chi-'' "make (someone) eat"
* ''puri-chi-'' "make (someone) walk"
* ''paka-chi-'' "cause (someone) to hide"

But in other cases it can be derivational:

* ''runa wañu-chi'' "man killer, murderer"
* ''puma wañu-chi'' "puma hunter"
* ''wasi saya-chi'' "house builder, carpenter"

===Inflectional morphology===

====Verbs====

There are several categories of [[verb]]al suffixes in South Bolivian Quechua. These include [[linguistic modality|modal suffixes]], [[object (grammar)|object markers]], [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] markers, and [[grammatical person|person markers]].&lt;ref name="Crapo" /&gt;

South Bolivian Quechua has a great amount of modal suffixes that are used to express a range of concepts. Some examples include:

* ''-ra'' "un-, undo"; ''wata-ra-'' "unknot, untie"
* ''-naya'' "intend to, about to, do as if to"; ''willa-naya-'' "act as if to tell"
* ''-ysi'' "help someone"; ''mik”u-ysi-y'' "help him eat"
* ''-na'' "have to, be able to" (obligative); ''willa-na-'' "have to tell"
* ''-pu'' "for someone else" (benefactive); ''qu-pu-y'' "give it to him"

Some of these modal suffixes can be derivational if used with a non-verb—for example, [[South Bolivian Quechua#Derivational Morphology|''-naya'' and ''-na'']].

Person markers differentiate between first, second, and third persons and plurality, as well as an inclusive and exclusive first person plural. Object markers and subject markers are used in the language, and object markers appear before subject markers. The object marker is ''-wa'' for a first person object and ''-su'' for a second person object. The following table details possible combinations of object and subject markers.&lt;ref name="Crapo" /&gt; Some person categories lack a subject and/or object marker.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || || colspan="6" align="center" | '''Object'''
|-
| || || '''1st Sg.''' || '''1st Pl. Ex.''' || '''1st Pl. In.''' || '''2nd Sg.''' || '''2nd Pl.''' || '''3rd Sg. or Pl.'''
|-
| rowspan="7" | '''Subject''' || '''1st Sg.''' || || || || ''-su...-yki'' || ''...-ykichiq'' || ''...-ni''
|-
| '''2nd Sg.''' || ''-wa...-nki'' || ''-wa...-yku'' || || || || ''...-nki''
|-
| '''3rd Sg.''' || ''-wa...-n'' || ''-wa...-yku'' || ''-wa...-nchiq'' || ''-su...-nki'' || ''-su...-nkichiq'' || ''...-n''
|-
| '''1st Pl. In.''' || || || || || || ''...-nchiq''
|-
| '''1st Pl. Ex.''' || || || || ''-su...-yku'' || ''...-ykichiq'' || ''...-yku''
|-
| '''2nd Pl.''' || ''-wa...-nkichiq'' || ''-wa...-yku'' || || || || ''...-nkichiq''
|-
| '''3rd Pl.''' || ''-wa...-nku'' || ''-wa...-yku'' || ''-wa...-nchiq'' || ''-su...-nku'' || ''-su...-nkichiq'' || ''...-nku''
|-
|}

All non-present tenses in the [[grammatical mood|indicative]] are marked by a suffix directly preceding the person marking. The present subjunctive is marked with a suffix following the person marking. Examples of tense markers include the simple past suffix ''-rqa'', past imperfect ''-yka'', and past perfect ''-sqa''. Tense suffixes can change form depending on person and can alter person marking in some cases: for instance, in the past imperfect tense, both the third person singular and plural subject markers (typically ''-n'', ''-nchiq'', or ''-nku'' depending on object) become ''-q'', meaning that a verb in the past imperfect with a third person subject would end in ''-yka-q''.

====Nouns====

Apart from case-marking suffixes, [[noun]]s in South Bolivian Quechua can also be pluralized with the suffix ''-kuna'' (or by a numeral modifier preceding the noun). However, most speakers use the suffix -s, borrowed from Spanish, when the noun ends in a vowel. For example, wasi ("house") becomes wasis ("houses") or runa ("person") becomes runas ("people/persons"). The Quechua suffix -kuna is usually only used when a noun ends in a consonant, such as with yan (road), which becomes yankuna (roads). A collective marker, ''-ntin'', also exists to denote “togetherness”, as in ''alqu michi-ntin'' "the dog, together with the cat". Possessiveness is marked by a suffix attached to the noun, with the form that the morpheme takes dependent on person, plurality, and whether it is following a vowel or consonant.

====Other lexical categories====

[[Pronoun]]s in the language have no person markers, but do have plural markers that vary by person. Possessive pronouns are marked by the addition of the appropriate genitive suffix.

[[Adjective]]s can be made into superlatives with the suffix ''-puni'', as in ''kosa'' "good"; ''kosa-puni'' "good above all others, best".

====Independent suffixes====
Some suffixes in South Bolivian Quechua can be used with words of any lexical category, and are generally found at the end of the word after all other suffixes. Some examples are:

* ''-ri'' "please, nicely, with delight" (polite)
* ''-pis'' "even though, even if, and, also" (additive)
* ''-chu'' "is it so?" (non-factual, question marker)
* ''-chus'' "if, maybe" (dubitative)

===Reduplication===

[[Reduplication]] is used extensively for various purposes, and can be derivational:&lt;ref name="Heggarty2" /&gt;

* ''llañuy'' "thin"; ''llañuy llañuy'' "very thin"
* ''wasi'' "house"; ''wasi wasi'' "settlement, collection of houses"
* ''rumi'' "stone"; ''rumi rumi'' "rocky"

Reduplicated stems can be suffixal as well:

* ''taq'' "sound of hammer blow"; ''taq-taq-ya-y'' "to hit with a hammer"

==Syntax==

===Word order===

The basic word order of South Bolivian Quechua is stated to be [[subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="Heggarty2" /&gt; However, because nouns are marked for case, word order is in fact very flexible and is generally varied for the purposes of emphasis. For instance, the following sentences all mean "Atahuallpa had Huascar killed":

* Atawallpa sipi-chi-rqa Waskar-ta.
* Atawallpa Waskar-ta sipi-chi-rqa.
* Waskara-ta Atawallpa sipi-chi-rqa.
* Waskar-ta sipi-chi-rqa Atawallpa.

One aspect of word order that is constant in the language is the fact that noun modifiers must directly precede the noun ([[word order|adjective-noun]]).

===Case marking===

South Bolivian Quechua is [[nominative-accusative]]. Nouns can have the following case markers:

* Genitive ''-q/-qpa/-qpata''
* Accusative ''-ta''
* Dative ''-man''
* Ablative ''-manta''
* Locative ''-pi''
* Purposive ''-paq''
* Causal ''-rayku''
* Instrumental ''-wan''
* Comitative ''-tawan''
* Allative ''-kama''

Lack of a case marker indicates the nominative.

===Passives===

Passives are marked by suffixes, including ''-sqa'' on the verb, ''-manta'' "from, by" on the agent, and ''-wan'' "with" on the instrument, as in the following examples:

* ''Chay runa alqu-'''manta''' k"ani-'''sqa''''' "That man was bitten by the dog"
* ''Runa rumi-'''wan''' maqa-'''sqa''''' "The man was hit with a rock"

===Subordination===

Subordination is mostly indicated by participles, and can be marked for tense only relative to the main verb. Subordination need not be explicitly marked, as certain participles can be understood as subordinative—for example, a literal gloss of ''His coming, I will leave'' can be interpreted as ''When he comes, I will leave'' or ''If he comes, I will leave''. Other suffixes such as ''-qti'' "when" and ''-rayku'' "because" can also be used to mark a subordinate clause.&lt;ref name="Crapo" /&gt;

In addition, subordination can also be indicated lexically by ''ukta...chaymanta...'' "first...then..." or ''ukta...q"ipanta...'' "first...afterwards...", as in the following examples:

* '''''Ukta''' q"awa-wa-n, '''chaymanta''' chaski-n'' "First he saw me, then he ran"
* '''''Ukta''' q"awa-wa-spa, '''q"ipanta''' pay chaski-n'' "First seeing me, afterwards he ran" ("After seeing me, he ran")

{{Biological classification}}
In [[biology]], a '''species''' is the basic unit of [[biological classification|classification]] and a [[taxonomic rank]], as well as a unit of [[biodiversity]], but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and [[conservation]]ists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as [[Carl Linnaeus]] thought, species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another, there would be no problem, but [[evolution]]ary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of [[organism]]s in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can [[reproduction|produce]] [[Fertility|fertile]] [[offspring]], typically by [[sexual reproduction]]. While this definition is often adequate, when looked at more closely it is [[species problem|problematic]]. For example, with [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], in a [[species complex]] of hundreds of similar [[microspecies]], or in a [[ring species]], the boundaries between closely related species become unclear. Among organisms that reproduce only [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]], the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. Problems also arise when dealing with [[fossil]]s, since reproduction cannot be examined; the concept of the [[chronospecies]] is therefore used in [[palaeontology]]. Other ways of defining species include their [[karyotype]], [[DNA]] sequence, [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], behaviour or [[ecological niche]].

All species are given a [[binomial nomenclature|two-part name]], a "binomial". The first part of a binomial is the [[genus]] to which the species belongs. The second part is called the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] or the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] (in [[botanical nomenclature]], also sometimes in [[zoological nomenclature]]). For example, ''[[Boa constrictor]]'' is one of four species of the genus ''[[Boa (genus)|Boa]]''.

Species were seen from the time of [[Aristotle]] until the 18th century as fixed kinds that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the [[great chain of being]]. In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time. [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' explained how [[speciation|species could arise]] by [[natural selection]]. That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through [[genetics]] and population [[ecology]]. Genetic variability arises from [[mutation]]s and [[recombination (biology)|recombination]], while organisms themselves are mobile, leading to geographical isolation and [[genetic drift]] with varying selection pressures. Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by [[horizontal gene transfer]]; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and [[polyploid]]y; and species may [[extinction|become extinct]] for a variety of reasons. [[Viruses]] are a special case, driven by a [[mutation–selection balance|balance of mutation and selection]], and can be treated as [[Viral quasispecies|quasispecies]].

As a practical matter, species concepts may be used to define species that are then used to measure [[biodiversity]], though whether this is a good measure is disputed, as other measures are possible.

==History==

===Classical forms===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}

In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] used the term γένος (génos) to mean a kind, such as a [[bird]] or [[fish]], and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind, such as (within the birds) the [[crane (bird)|crane]], [[eagle]], [[crow]], or [[sparrow]]. These terms were translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named; today the birds are a [[class (taxonomy)|class]], the cranes are a [[family (taxonomy)|family]], and the crows a [[genus]]. A kind was distinguished by its [[Property (philosophy)|attributes]]; for instance, a bird has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.  A form was distinguished by being shared by all its members, the young inheriting any variations they might have from their parents. Aristotle believed all kinds and forms to be distinct and unchanging. His approach remained influential until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=Leroi88&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=88–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed species===
[[File:John Ray from NPG.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[John Ray]] believed that species breed true and do not change, even though variations exist.]]
{{main|Great chain of being}}

When observers in the [[Early Modern]] period began to develop systems of organization for living things, they placed each kind of animal or plant into a context. Many of these early delineation schemes would now be considered whimsical: schemes included consanguinity based on colour (all plants with yellow flowers) or behaviour (snakes, scorpions and certain biting ants). [[John Ray]], an English naturalist, was the first to attempt a biological definition of species in 1686, as follows:

{{quote|No surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species&amp;nbsp;... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ray, John |authorlink=John Ray |title=Historia plantarum generalis, Tome I, Libr. I |date=1686&lt;!--that volume--&gt;|page=Chap. XX, page 40}}, quoted in {{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1982 |title=The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution, and inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press| page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Linnaeus]] created the binomial system for naming species.]]

In the 18th century, the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] classified organisms according to shared physical characteristics, and not simply based upon differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=P. H. |last1=Davis |first2=V. H.|last2=Heywood |year=1973 |title=Principles of Angiosperm Taxonomy |location=Huntington, New York |publisher=Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the idea of a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]] of classification based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=James L. |last1=Reveal |first2=James S. |last2=Pringle |title=Flora of North America |year=1993 |chapter=7.

This view was influenced by European scholarly and religious education, which held that the categories of life are dictated by God, forming an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] hierarchy, the [[Great chain of being#The Great Chain in natural science|''scala naturae'' or great chain of being]]. However, whether or not it was supposed to be fixed, the ''scala'' (a ladder) inherently implied the possibility of climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mahoney, Edward P. |title=Lovejoy and the Hierarchy of Being |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=211–230 |doi=10.2307/2709555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The possibility of change===

Faced with evidence of hybridisation, Linnaeus came to accept that species could change, and the struggle for survival, but not that new species could freely evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=24 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, naturalists understood that species could change form over time, and that the history of the planet provided enough time for major changes. [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], in his 1809 ''Zoological Philosophy'', described the [[transmutation of species]], proposing that a species could change over time, in a radical departure from Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |year=2002 |publisher=Belknap Harvard |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3 |pages=170–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provided a compelling account of [[evolution]] and the formation of new species. Darwin argued that it was populations that evolved, not individuals, by [[natural selection]] from naturally occurring variation among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler |year=2003 |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=0-520-23693-9 | pages=177–223 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required a new definition of species. Darwin concluded that species are what they appear to be: ideas, provisionally useful for naming groups of interacting individuals, writing:

{{quote|I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other&amp;nbsp;... It does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for convenience sake.&lt;ref name="metaphysical"&gt;{{cite book |last=Menand |first=Louis |title=[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America]] |year=2001 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=0-374-70638-7 |pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;

==Taxonomy and naming==
[[File:Mountain-lion-01623.jpg|thumb|A cougar, mountain lion, panther, or puma, among other common names: its scientific name is ''[[Puma concolor]]''.]]

===Common and scientific names===

The commonly used names for kinds of organisms are often ambiguous: "cat" could mean the domestic cat, ''[[Felis catus]]'', or the cat family, [[Felidae]]. Another problem with common names is that they often vary from place to place, so that puma, cougar, catamount, panther, painter and mountain lion all mean ''[[Puma concolor]]'' in various parts of America, while "panther" may also mean the [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca'') of Latin America or the [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus'') of Africa and Asia. In contrast, the scientific names of species are chosen to be unique and universal; they are in two parts used together: the [[genus]] as in ''Puma'', and the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] as in ''concolor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word About Species Names&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.sms.si.edu/irlspec/NamSpecies.htm |publisher=Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce |accessdate=11 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324161039/http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/NamSpecies.htm |archivedate=24 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hone |first1=Dave |title=What's in a name?

===Species description===
[[File:Lacerta plica holotype - ZooKeys-355-049-g005.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[type (biology)|type specimen]] ([[holotype]]) of ''[[Plica plica|Lacerta plica]]'', described by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758]]
{{main|Species description}}

A species is given a [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] name when a [[type (biology)|type specimen]] is described formally, in a publication that assigns it a unique scientific name. The description typically provides means for identifying the new species, differentiating it from other previously described and related or confusable species and provides a [[validly published name]] (in botany) or an [[available name]] (in zoology) when the paper is accepted for publication. The type material is usually held in a permanent repository, often the research collection of a major museum or university, that allows independent verification and the means to compare specimens.&lt;ref name="ICZNexampleabstract"&gt;One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at {{cite journal |accessdate=18 June 2011 |url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/10/ijs.0.030767-0.abstract?sid=90908f15-6b51-4878-8663-92387c779b71 |title=''Methylobacterium cerastii'' sp. nov., a novel species isolated from the leaf surface of ''Cerastium holosteoides'' |first1=S. |last1=Wellner |first2=N. |last2=Lodders |first3=P. |last3=Kämpfer |year=2012 |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |volume=62 |pages=917–924 |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.030767-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |last=Hitchcock |first=A.

===Abbreviations===

Books and articles sometimes intentionally do not identify species fully and use the abbreviation "sp." in the singular or "spp." (standing for ''species pluralis'', the Latin for multiple species) in the plural in place of the specific name or epithet (e.g. ''Canis'' sp.) This commonly occurs when authors are confident that some individuals belong to a particular genus but are not sure to which exact species they belong, as is common in [[paleontology]]. Authors may also use "spp." as a short way of saying that something applies to many species within a genus, but not to all. If scientists mean that something applies to all species within a genus, they use the genus name without the specific name or epithet. The names of genera and species are usually printed in [[italics]]. Abbreviations such as "sp." should not be italicised. When a species identity is not clear a specialist may use "cf." before the epithet to indicate that confirmation is required. The abbreviations "nr." (near) or "aff." (affine) may be used when the identity is unclear but when the species appears to be similar to the species mentioned after.&lt;ref name=winston&gt;{{cite book |last=Winston |first=Judith E. |title=Describing species. Practical taxonomic procedure for biologists |publisher=Columbia University Press |place=New York| year=1999 |pages=141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification codes===

With the rise of online databases, codes have been devised to provide identifiers for species that are already defined, including:
* [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) employs a numeric 'taxid' or ''Taxonomy identifier'', a "stable unique identifier", e.g., the taxid of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is 9606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=9606&amp;lvl=3&amp;lin=f&amp;keep=1&amp;srchmode=1&amp;unlock |title=Home – Taxonomy – NCBI |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207144820/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&amp;id=9606&amp;lvl=3&amp;lin=f&amp;keep=1&amp;srchmode=1&amp;unlock |archivedate=7 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes]] (KEGG) employs a three- or four-letter code for a limited number of organisms; in this code, for example, ''H. sapiens'' is simply ''hsa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html |title=KEGG Organisms: Complete Genomes |publisher=Genome.jp |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160440/http://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[UniProt]] employs an "organism mnemonic" of not more than five alphanumeric characters, e.g., ''HUMAN'' for ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy |title=Taxonomy |publisher=Uniprot.org |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127091404/http://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy |archivedate=27 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] (ITIS) provides a unique number for each species. The LSID for ''Homo sapiens'' is urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:4da6736d-d35f-11e6-9d3f-bc764e092680:col20170225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITIS: Homo sapiens |url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/e3b90576561f93a8ac8b59e185b01511/synonym/ee0f23e7dd7ddbf69de58c0abba12e5b |publisher=Catalogue of Life |accessdate=11 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312194754/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/e3b90576561f93a8ac8b59e185b01511/synonym/ee0f23e7dd7ddbf69de58c0abba12e5b |archivedate=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lumping and splitting===
{{main|Lumpers and splitters}}

The naming of a particular species, including which genus (and higher taxa) it is placed in, is a ''hypothesis'' about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are discovered to be of the same species, the older species name is given priority and usually retained, and the newer name considered as a junior synonym, a process called ''synonymisation''. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called ''splitting''. Taxonomists are often referred to as "lumpers" or "splitters" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognising differences or commonalities between organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=George Gaylord |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |title=The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=85 |page=23 |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Bob |title=Upstart Antichrist |journal=History Workshop Journal |issue=60 |date=2005 |pages=202–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winston/&gt;

===Broad and narrow senses===
{{main|Sensu}}

The [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclatural codes]] that guide the naming of species, including the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] for animals and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]] for plants, do not make rules for defining the boundaries of the species. Research can change the boundaries, also known as circumscription, based on new evidence. Species may then need to be distinguished by the boundary definitions used, and in such cases the names may be qualified with ''[[sensu stricto]]'' ("in the narrow sense") to denote usage in the exact meaning given by an author such as the person who named the species, while the [[antonym]] ''sensu lato'' ("in the broad sense") denotes a wider usage, for instance including other subspecies. Other abbreviations such as "auct." ("author"), and qualifiers such as "non" ("not") may be used to further clarify the sense in which the specified authors delineated or described the species.&lt;ref name=winston/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Philip |title=sensu stricto, sensu lato |url=http://www.treeterms.co.uk/definitions/sensu-stricto-sensu-lato |website=AZ of tree terms |date=2016 |accessdate=9 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054734/http://www.treeterms.co.uk/definitions/sensu-stricto-sensu-lato |archivedate=10 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary: sensu |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary&amp;nfv=true |publisher=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |accessdate=9 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802164704/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?booksection=glossary&amp;nfv=true |archivedate=2 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species identification is made difficult by discordance between molecular and morphological investigations; these can be categorized as two types: (i) one morphology, multiple lineages (e.g. [[convergent evolution|morphological convergence]], [[cryptic species]]) and (ii) one lineage, multiple morphologies (e.g. [[phenotypic plasticity]], multiple [[biological life cycle|life-cycle]] stages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |title=How discordant morphological and molecular evolution among microorganisms can revise our notions of biodiversity on Earth |journal=BioEssays |volume=36 |issue=10| pages=950–959 |doi=10.1002/bies.201400056 |author1=Lahr, D.

The evolutionary biologist [[James Mallet]] concludes that

{{quote|there is no easy way to tell whether related geographic or temporal forms belong to the same or different species. Species gaps can be verified only locally and at a point of time.

===Aggregates of microspecies===

Natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] presents a challenge to the concept of a reproductively isolated species, as fertile hybrids permit gene flow between two populations. For example, the [[carrion crow]] ''Corvus corone'' and the [[hooded crow]] ''Corvus cornix'' appear and are classified as separate species, yet they hybridise freely where their geographical ranges overlap.&lt;ref name="BerkeleyDefHybrid"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defining a species |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_41 |publisher=University of California Berkeley |accessdate=12 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313042614/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_41 |archivedate=13 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ring species ===
{{main|Ring species}}

A [[ring species]] is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can sexually interbreed with adjacent related populations, but for which there exist at least two "end" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential [[gene flow]] between each "linked" population.{{sfn|Zachos|2016|p=188}} Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, "end" populations may [[Sympatric|co-exist in the same region]] thus closing the ring. Ring species thus present a difficulty for any species concept that relies on reproductive isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamos |first=David N. |title=The Species Problem: Biological Species, Ontology, and the Metaphysics of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT02AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |date=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-6118-0 |page=330 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312134720/https://books.google.com/books?id=KT02AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |archivedate=12 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ring species are at best rare.

==Attempts at definition==

Biologists and taxonomists have made many attempts to define species, beginning from [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and moving towards [[genetics]]. Early taxonomists such as Linnaeus had no option but to describe what they saw: this was later formalised as the typological or morphological species concept. Mayr emphasised reproductive isolation, but this, like other species concepts, is hard or even impossible to test.&lt;ref name="Zelnio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |title=A species definition for the modern synthesis |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |date=1995 |volume=10 |pages=294–299 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(95)90031-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have tried to refine Mayr's definition with the recognition and cohesion concepts, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Masters |first1=J.

A typological species is a group of organisms in which individuals conform to certain fixed properties (a type), so that even pre-literate people often recognise the same taxon as do modern taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gould 1980"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |chapter= A Quahog is a Quahog | title=In: The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=New York |publisher= W.W.

This method was used as a "classical" method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory. However, different phenotypes are not necessarily different species (e.g. a four-winged ''[[Drosophila]]'' born to a two-winged mother is not a different species). Species named in this manner are called ''morphospecies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjps/20.2.97 |author=Ruse, Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |title=Definitions of Species in Biology |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=97–119 |year=1969 |jstor=686173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewin |first=Ralph A. |authorlink=Ralph A.

Wiley and Mayden state that they see the evolutionary species concept as "identical" to [[Willi Hennig]]'s species-as-lineages concept, and assert that the biological species concept, "the several versions" of the phylogenetic species concept, and the idea that species are of the same kind as higher taxa are not suitable for biodiversity studies (with the intention of estimating the number of species accurately).

===Ecological species===

An ecological species is a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment.

In [[palaeontology]], with only [[comparative anatomy]] (morphology) from [[fossil]]s as evidence, the concept of a [[chronospecies]] can be applied. During [[anagenesis]] (evolution, not necessarily involving branching), palaeontologists seek to identify a sequence of species, each one derived from the [[pseudoextinction|phyletically extinct]] one before through continuous, slow and more or less uniform change. In such a time sequence, palaeontologists assess how much change is required for a morphologically distinct form to be considered a different species from its ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronospecies |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095611471 |publisher=Oxford Reference |accessdate=12 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001151656/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095611471 |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carr |first1=Steven M. |title=Evolutionary species and chronospecies |url=https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Evolutionary_vs_Chronospecies.html |publisher=Memorial University Newfoundland and Labrador |accessdate=12 January 2018 |date=2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310075417/http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Evolutionary_vs_Chronospecies.html |archivedate=10 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dzik, J. |year=1985 |title=Typologic versus population concepts of chronospecies: implications for ammonite biostratigraphy |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=71–92 |url=https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app30/app30-071.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313080626/http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app30/app30-071.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Michael J. |last2=Lyman|first2=R.

===Viral quasispecies===
{{main |Viral quasispecies}}

Viruses have enormous populations, are doubtfully living since they consist of little more than a string of DNA or RNA in a protein coat, and mutate rapidly. All of these factors make conventional species concepts largely inapplicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Regenmortel |first1=Marc H.V |title=Logical puzzles and scientific controversies: The nature of species, viruses and living organisms |journal=Systematic and Applied Microbiology |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1–6| year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.syapm.2009.11.001 |pmid=20005655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A viral [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]] is a group of genotypes related by similar mutations, competing within a highly [[mutagenic]] environment, and hence governed by a [[mutation–selection balance]]. It is predicted that a viral quasispecies at a low but [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|evolutionarily neutral]] and highly connected (that is, flat) region in the [[fitness landscape]] will outcompete a quasispecies located at a higher but narrower fitness peak in which the surrounding mutants are unfit, "the quasispecies effect" or the "survival of the flattest". There is no suggestion that a viral quasispecies resembles a traditional biological species.&lt;ref name=Nimwegen1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Nimwegen |first1=Erik |last2=Crutchfield |first2=James P. |last3=Huynen |first3=Martijn |title=Neutral evolution of mutational robustness |date=August 1999 |journal=PNAS |volume=96 |issue=17 |pages=9716–9720 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/17/9716.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.17.9716|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.9716V |arxiv=adap-org/9903006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WilkeWang2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilke |first1=Claus O. |last2=Wang |first2=Jia Lan |last3=Ofria |first3=Charles |last4=Lenski |first4=Richard E. |last5=Adami |first5=Christoph |title=Evolution of digital organisms at high mutation rates leads to survival of the flattest |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6844 |year=2001 |pages=331–333 |doi=10.1038/35085569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElenaAgudelo-Romero2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elena |first1=S.

==Change==
Species are subject to change, whether by evolving into new species,&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt; exchanging genes with other species,&lt;ref name=Vaux/&gt; merging with other species or by becoming extinct.{{sfn|Zachos|2016|pp=77–96}}

=== Speciation ===
{{main|Speciation}}

The [[evolution]]ary process by which biological populations evolve to become distinct or reproductively isolated as species is called [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Orator F. |authorlink=Orator F.

This occurs most easily in [[allopatric]] speciation, where populations are separated geographically and can diverge gradually as mutations accumulate. Reproductive isolation is threatened by hybridisation, but this can be selected against once a pair of populations have incompatible [[allele]]s of the same gene, as described in the [[Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model]].&lt;ref name=Barton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=N.

=== Exchange of genes between species ===
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|[[Horizontal gene transfer]]s between widely separated species complicate the phylogeny of [[bacteria]].]]
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Horizontal gene transfer between organisms of different species, either through [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], [[antigenic shift]], or [[reassortment]], is sometimes an important source of genetic variation. Viruses can transfer genes between species. Bacteria can exchange plasmids with bacteria of other species, including some apparently distantly related ones in different phylogenetic [[Three-domain system|domains]], making analysis of their relationships difficult, and weakening the concept of a bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pennisi, Elizabeth| pages=335| volume=334–335 | journal=Science | year=2004 | title=Researchers Trade Insights about Gene Swapping| url=http://www2.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Pennisi_2003.pdf| deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218071130/http://www2.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Pennisi_2003.pdf | archivedate=18 February 2006 | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melcher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.02.004 |pmid=15041172 |url=http://web.uconn.edu/gogarten/articles/TIG2004_cladogenesis_paper.pdf |title=Cladogenesis, coalescence and the evolution of the three domains of life |journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=20 |issue=4|pages=182|year=2004 |last1=Zhaxybayeva |first1=Olga |last2=Peter Gogarten |first2=J. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181517/http://web.uconn.edu/gogarten/articles/TIG2004_cladogenesis_paper.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaux&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12872 |title=Speciation through the looking-glass |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=480–488 |year=2017 |last1=Vaux |first1=Felix |last2=Trewick |first2=Steven A. |last3=Morgan-Richards |first3=Mary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis-Marie Bobay and Howard Ochman suggest, based on analysis of the genomes of many types of bacteria, that they can often be grouped "into communities that regularly swap genes", in much the same way that plants and animals can be grouped into reproductively isolated breeding populations. Bacteria may thus form species, analogous to Mayr's biological species concept, consisting of asexually reproducing populations that exchange genes by homologous recombination.&lt;ref name="Venton2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venton |first1=Danielle |title=Highlight: Applying the Biological Species Concept across All of Life |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |pages=502–503 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx045|pmid=28391326 |pmc=5381533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BobayOchman2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bobay |first1=Louis-Marie |last2=Ochman |first2=Howard |title=Biological Species Are Universal across Life's Domains |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |pages=491–501 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
{{further|Extinction|Extinction event}}

A species is extinct when the [[endling|last individual]] of that species dies, but it may be [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] well before that moment. It is estimated that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, some five billion species, are now extinct. Some of these were in [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] such as those at the ends of the [[Permian]], [[Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. Mass extinctions had a variety of causes including [[volcano|volcanic activity]], [[climate change]], and changes in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, and they in turn had major effects on Earth's ecology, atmosphere, land surface, and waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-412-63380-5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164104/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

The resulting single species has been termed as a "[[compilospecies]]".{{sfn|Zachos|2016|p=82}}

==Practical implications==

Biologists and [[conservation]]ists need to categorise and identify organisms in the course of their work. Difficulty assigning organisms reliably to a species constitutes a threat to the [[external validity|validity]] of research results, for example making measurements of how abundant a species is in an [[ecosystem]] moot. Surveys using a phylogenetic species concept reported 48% more species and accordingly smaller populations and ranges than those using nonphylogenetic concepts; this was termed "taxonomic inflation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/jzs.12088 |title=Taxonomic inflation, the Phylogenetic Species Concept and lineages in the Tree of Life – a cautionary comment on species splitting |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=180 |year=2015 |last1=Zachos |first1=Frank E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could cause a false appearance of change to the number of endangered species and consequent political and practical difficulties.&lt;ref name="Agapow2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul‐Michael |last1=Agapow |first2=Olaf R.

Conservation laws in many countries make special provisions to prevent species from going extinct. Hybridization zones between two species, one that is protected and one that is not, have sometimes led to conflicts between lawmakers, land owners and conservationists. One of the classic cases in North America is that of the protected [[northern spotted owl]] which hybridizes with the unprotected [[California spotted owl]] and the [[barred owl]]; this has led to legal debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usgsstaffpub/708 |title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty, Volume 2: Conserving Biodiversity in Human-Dominated Landscapes |last1=Haig |first1=Susan M. |last2=Allendorf |first2=F.

It has been argued, too, that since species are not comparable, counting them is not a valid measure of [[biodiversity]]; alternative measures of phylogenetic biodiversity have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mishler |first1=Brent D. |editor1-last=Wilson |editor1-first=R. |title=Getting Rid of Species? |work=Species: New Interdisciplinary Essays |date=1999 |publisher=MIT Press |pages=307–315 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/672e/7dbe0b756ec853fdb0a3580aca4dffb6f64b.pdf |isbn=978-0262731232 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174246/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/672e/7dbe0b756ec853fdb0a3580aca4dffb6f64b.pdf |archivedate=10 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vane-Wright |first1=R.

'''Suffixaufnahme''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzʊfɪksˌaʊfˌnaːmə|lang}}, "suffix resumption"), also known as '''case stacking''', is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] phenomenon used in forming a [[genitive construction]], whereby prototypically a [[genitive case|genitive]] noun [[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with its [[head (linguistics)|head]] noun. It was first recognized in [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]] and some other [[Caucasian language|Caucasian]] and ancient [[Middle East]]ern languages as well as many [[Australian languages]], and almost invariably coincides with [[agglutinative languages|agglutinativity]].

A [[subject (grammar)|subject]], for instance, would be marked with a subjective [[affix]] as well as a genitive affix. So, for example, in Old Georgian ''perx-ni k'ac-isa-ni'' (foot-&lt;small&gt;NOM.PL&lt;/small&gt; man-&lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;NOM.PL&lt;/small&gt;) 'a man's feet', the genitival noun phrase agrees in case (nominative) and number (plural) with the head noun.  

However, while such a possessive construction is most frequently found in suffixaufnahme, other nominal constructions may also show similar behavior. In Old Georgian, a postpositional phrase modifying a noun could take on that noun's case and number features: ''"Ra turpa prinvelia!" c'amoidzaxa '''ert-ma bavshv-ta-gan-ma''' ''[one-ERG child-GEN.PL-from-ERG] ("'What a wonderful bird!' exclaimed one of the children") has the ergative (also called narrative) case ''-ma'' on ''ertma'' repeated in the modifying postpositional phrase, headed by ''-gan''.

'''Tai tai''' (太太) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] colloquial term for an elected leader-wife or head-wife of a multi-wife (polygynous / sister-wife) family; or a wealthy [[marriage|married]] woman who does not work.&lt;ref name="isbn974-93100-3-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sylvie Phillips |title=Tai Tai Tales |publisher=Bangkok Books |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=974-93100-3-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EGDO__EaZIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22tai+tai%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2Ws-TZ7hBNOr4Abg3siuCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the same as the [[Cantonese]] title for a married woman.&lt;ref name="isbn1-85788-378-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Price, Fiona L. |title=Success with Asian Names: A Practical Guide for Business and Everyday life |publisher=Nicholas Brealey Publishing |location=London |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-85788-378-0 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FRIYcHARa0C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%22tai+tai%22+cantonese+mrs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4G0-TeziMJDr4Ab64OGzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tai%20tai%22%20cantonese%20mrs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the same euphemistic value as "lady" in English: sometimes flattery, sometimes subtle insult.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} One author describes it as equivalent to the English term "[[ladies who lunch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/redlantern/2008/08/06/are-you-a-tai-tai/|first=Elizabeth|last=Kain|title=Are you a Tai Tai?|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
By the time of the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, the term had come to imply a wife who was "dependent on her newly rising bourgeois husband" for her [[consumerism|consumerist]] lifestyle, and Chinese feminists and "new women" of that era tried to disassociate themselves from the term precisely for that reason.&lt;ref name="Wang1999"/&gt;

'''Convergence''' is a phenomenon in telecommunication and media industry to integrate services, content offerings, and means of communication under one core technology or ecosystem. It includes cultural, society, business, service, technology, regulatory, and content aspects that need to be considered.

It’s practical application manifests in various concrete examples, as e.g. Internet, digital convergence, media convergence, home applications, and telecommunication. This article describes a wide are of aspects of convergence, with illustrations of convergent merging technologies (NBIC, nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive technologies) and convergence of media technology.

==Definitions==
"'''''Convergence''' is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process''" (Roco 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roco | first1 = MC | year = 2002 | title = 'Coherence and divergence of megatrends in science and engineering | url =https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020157027792 | journal = J Nanopart Res | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 9–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge and Roco 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bainbridge | first1 = W.S. | last2 = Roco | first2 = M.C. | year = 2016 | title = 'Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence | url = | journal = J. Nanoparticle Res. | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 211 | doi=10.1007/s11051-016-3520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[File:Leatherman-Charge-XTi.jpg|thumb|A converged mechanical tool, the multitool. Within one device, it provides many tools.]]
Siddhartha Menon defines convergence, in his ''Policy initiative Dilemmas on Media Covergence: A Cross National Perspective'', as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as "a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform".&lt;ref&gt;Siddhartha, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. [[Jan van Dijk]] suggests that "digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros".&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J. (1999). The network society. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Siddhartha. "Policy Initiative Dilemmas On Media Convergence: A Cross National Perspective." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–35. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 20 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is defined by Blackman, 1998, as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Convergence between telecommunications and other media: how should regulation adapt? | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 163–170 | doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, 1998; Gates, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conlins | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = Back to the future: Digital Television and Convergence in the United Kingdom | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 4–5| pages = 383–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gate | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Convergence and competition: Technological change, industry concentration and competition policy in the telecommunications sector | url = | journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 83–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Digital Convergence and its consequences | url = | journal = Javnost/The Public | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1080/13183222.1999.11008716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media technological convergence''' is the tendency that as [[technological change|technology changes]], different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called "network convergence") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]]. Many experts{{who|date=May 2013}} view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of [[information and communication technology]] devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. 
Convergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]]. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market.&lt;ref name = "Shin"&gt;Shin, Dong Hee, Won – Yong Kim, and Dong-Hoon Lee. "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–19. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, W. and Levin, S. (2005). From Clones To Packets: The Development Of Competition In Local Residential Telecommunications. TPRC 2005 The 33rd Research Conference on Communication, Information and Internet Policy, September 23–25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of media technological convergence ==

Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd.|pages=163–170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. "The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent."&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies.
[[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} "The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress." Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ramón Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called "Mediamorphosis" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".&lt;ref&gt;(Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York University Press, New York.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converging technological fields ==

'''NBIC''', an acronym for [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]], was, in 2014,  the most popular term for converging technologies. It was introduced into public discourse through the publication of ''[[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]'', a report sponsored in part by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Roco, Mihail C.| editor2 = Bainbridge, William Sims| editor2-link = William Sims Bainbridge| title = [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]| publisher = Springer| date = 2003| isbn = 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as GNR ([[Genetics|'''G'''enetics]], '''N'''anotechnology and [[Robotics|'''R'''obotics]]) ([[Bill Joy]], 2000, [[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us|Why the future doesn't need us]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us | first = Bill | last= Joy | authorlink= Bill Joy | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html |publisher= Wired |date= 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Journalist [[Joel Garreau]] in ''[[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human'' uses "GRIN", for '''G'''enetic, '''R'''obotic, '''I'''nformation, and '''N'''ano processes,&lt;ref name="Garreau 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Garreau, Joel| author-link = Joel Garreau| title = [[Radical Evolution]]: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies — and What It Means to Be Human| publisher =Doubleday| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-385-50965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[science journalist]] Douglas Mulhall in ''Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World'' uses "GRAIN", for '''G'''enetics, '''R'''obotics, [[Artificial intelligence|'''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence]], and '''N'''anotechnology.&lt;ref name="Mulhall 2002"&gt;{{cite book| author = Mulhall, Douglas| title = Our Molecular Future: How Nanotechnology, Robotics, Genetics and Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Our World| publisher =Prometheus Books| date = 2002 | isbn = 1-57392-992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another acronym coined by the [[:Category:Appropriate technology organizations|appropriate technology organization]] [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] is "BANG" for "[[Bit|'''B'''it]]s, [[Atom|'''A'''tom]]s, [[Neuron|'''N'''euron]]s, [[Gene|'''G'''ene]]s".&lt;ref name="ETC Group 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = ETC Group| author-link = ETC Group (AGETC)| title = The Strategy for Converging Technologies: The Little BANG Theory| date = 2003| url = http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| accessdate = 2007-02-09| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925235057/http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/169/01/combang2003.pdf| archivedate = 2007-09-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converging science and technology fields ==
A comprehensive term used by Roco, Bainbridge, Tonn and Whitesides is '''[https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319022031 Convergence of Knowledge, Technology and Society (2013)]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Roco M.C., Bainbridge W.S., Tonn B. and Whitesides G.

== Examples of technology implications ==

Convergent solutions include both [[Landline|fixed-line]] and mobile technologies. Recent examples of new, convergent services include:

* Using the Internet for voice and [[video telephony]]
* [[Video on demand]]
* [[Fixed-mobile convergence]]
* [[Mobile-to-mobile convergence]]
* [[Location-based service]]s
* Integrated products and bundles

Convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions. Convergent technologies include:

* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]]
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]
* [[IPTV]]
* [[Voice over IP]]
* [[Voice call continuity]]
* [[DVB-H|Digital video broadcasting – handheld]]

==Convergence in appliances==
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or "black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n21/mode/2|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 071|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, media business practice has been to identify the next "black box" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as "black boxes" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the "black box" theory, and instead creates clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other "black box" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: "...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context." Despite the creation of "black boxes", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.&lt;ref&gt;Cheskin Research. "Designing Digital Experiences for Youth", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the "smart phone," a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they  incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. This type of convergence is popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the "improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; He believes the same technology has the potential to be "used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

==Convergence on the internet==
The role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as "Connected TV" or "Hybrid TV", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital convergence==
Digital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called "spokes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=1599041561|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] "[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194/A_Computing_Studio_Method_for_Teaching_Design_Thinking|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|publisher=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content, mixing personal (user-generated) content with professional (copyright protected) content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/the-new-media-ownership-law-doesnt-address-the-real-crisis-journalism-is-facing|title=The new media ownership law doesn't address the real crisis journalism is facing|publisher=The Guardian|author=Margaret Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example are personal music videos that combine user-generated photos with chart music. The German startup [[Trivid GmbH]] has developed [[Clipgenerator]] that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Bebo]].

==Convergence in the marketplace==
Convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies ("telcos"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.

==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==
Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted"&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt; They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the "social-side effects," in that "the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating."&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"&gt;Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.
Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, p.101-112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5¡V12.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Casey.

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news “island” in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pavlic J. V. New Media Journalism // 21st Century Communication. A Reference Handbook. Volume 1 &amp; 2. /Ed. By William F. Eadie. Los Angeles, 2009. 970 p. P. 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture An Introduction To Mass Communication. 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013. 9–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity."&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;Holt, Jennifer, and Alisa Perren, eds. Media Industries History, Theory and Method. West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence culture ===

[[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process "where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"&gt;HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video.

The association of Bert and Bin Laden links back to the Ignacio's Photoshop project for fun.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide''. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Convergence culture is a part of [[participatory culture]]. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. 
Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"/&gt;

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:

{{quote|...a "catalyst" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Cell phone convergence ===
The social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Another example, [[Rok Sako To Rok Lo]] (2004) was screened in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and other part of India through EDGE-enabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Social movements ===
The integration of [[social movement]]s in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as "the first informational guerrilla movement".&lt;ref&gt;Castells, 2004:82&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1988:630&lt;/ref&gt; A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, "Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;Papic, M., Noonan, S. (2011) "Social Media As a Tool for Protest." Stratfor, 3 Feb. 2011.

== Examples in Regulation ==

===Example: VoIP===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;Written in 2011, 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57&lt;/ref&gt; Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.&lt;ref&gt;PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda." Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. 
"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests"(Blackman).&lt;ref&gt;

===Emerging trends in communications===
[[Network neutrality]] has emerged as an issue. Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, "a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development." Second, "neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, 2004d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. "Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: "From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.&lt;ref name = "Shin"/&gt; The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"&gt;Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications
Public Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

The layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer – the provider of service. 3. Application layer –  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer – the layer which users see.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"/&gt; In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online &lt;PDF&gt;. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Messaging==
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should soon{{when|date=May 2011}} be able to let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or [[long number]]. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

==Example: Mobile==
"Mobile service provisions" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as "The [[Fantastic Four]]" or "Grand Slam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

==Example: Home network==
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].

The '''Teushen language''' is an [[indigenous language of Argentina]], which may be extinct. It was spoken by the [[Teushen people]], a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] people of [[Patagonia]], who lived between the [[Puelche people]] to their north and the [[Tehuelche people]] to the south, who occupied the central part of the Tierra del Fuego region. The tribe is now extinct.

The language is thought to be related to the [[Selknam language|Selk'nma]], [[Puelche language|Puelche]], and [[Tehuelche language]]s. These collectively belong to the [[Chonan languages|Chonan language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar and Muysken 556&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, some [[Tehuelche people]] also spoke Teushen.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar and Muysken, 581&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War dialing''' or '''wardialing,'''  a.k.a. "janning"{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, is a technique to automatically scan a list of [[telephone]] numbers, usually dialing every number in a [[area code|local area code]] to search for modems, computers, [[bulletin board system]]s ([[computer server]]s) and [[fax machine]]s. [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|Hackers]] use the resulting lists for various purposes: [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hobbyists]] for exploration, and [[Hacker (computer security)|crackers]] – malicious hackers who specialize in breaching computer security – for guessing user accounts (by capturing voicemail greetings), or locating modems that might provide an entry-point into computer or other electronic systems. It may also be used by security personnel, for example, to detect unauthorized devices, such as modems or faxes, on a company's telephone network.

==Process==

A single wardialing call would involve calling an unknown number, and waiting for one or two rings, since answering computers usually pick up on the first ring. If the phone rings twice, the modem hangs up and tries the next number. If a modem or fax machine answers, the wardialer program makes a note of the number. If a human or answering machine answers, the wardialer program hangs up. Depending on the time of day, wardialing 10,000 numbers in a given area code might annoy dozens or hundreds of people, some who attempt and fail to answer a phone in two rings, and some who succeed, only to hear the wardialing modem's [[carrier tone]] and hang up. The repeated incoming calls are especially annoying to businesses that have many consecutively numbered lines in the exchange, such as used with a [[Centrex]] telephone system.

Some newer wardialing software, such as [[WarVOX]], does not require a modem to conduct wardialing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkreading.com/security/news/215800791/next-generation-war-dialing-tool-on-tap.html Next Generation 'War-Dialing' Tool On Tap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, such programs can use [[VOIP]] connections, which can speed up the number of calls that a wardialer can make. [[Sandstorm Enterprises]] has a patent {{US patent|6490349}} on a multi-line war dialer. ("System and Method for Scan-Dialing Telephone Numbers and Classifying Equipment Connected to Telephone Lines Associated therewith.") The patented technology is implemented in Sandstorm's [[PhoneSweep]] war dialer.

==Popularity==
The popular name for this technique originated in the 1983 film ''[[WarGames]]''.&lt;ref name=ryan2004&gt;{{cite web | title = War, Peace, or Stalemate: Wargames, Wardialing, Wardriving, and the Emerging Market for Hacker Ethics | author = Patrick S. Ryan | ssrn = 585867 | publisher = Social Science Research Network | date = Summer 2004 | accessdate = April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, the protagonist programmed his computer to dial every telephone number in [[Sunnyvale, California]] to find other computer systems. Prior to the movie's release, this technique was known as "hammer dialing" or "[[demon dialing]]",{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but the film introduced the method to many, such as the members of [[The 414s]].&lt;ref name="cnn20150310"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tech/2015/03/10/digital-shorts-original-teenage-hackers-orig.cnn | title=The 414s: The Original Teenage Hackers | publisher=CNN | date=2015-03-10 | people=Vollmann, Michael T (director)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985 at least one company advertised a "War Games Autodialer" for [[Commodore computers]].&lt;ref name="cg198501"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/1985-01-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_19_1985_Jan#page/n187/mode/2up|title=MegaSoft Limited|last=|first=|date=January 1985|work=Compute!'s Gazette|accessdate=2017-12-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=167|type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs became common on bulletin board systems of the time, with file names often truncated to wardial.exe and the like due to [[8.3 filename|length restrictions of 8 characters]] on such systems. Eventually, the etymology of the name fell behind as "war dialing" gained its own currency within computing culture.{{r|ryan2004}}

The popularity of wardialing in 1980s and 1990s prompted some states to enact legislation prohibiting the use of a device to dial telephone numbers without the intent of communicating with a person.

==Variants==

A more recent phenomenon is [[wardriving]], the searching for [[wireless network]]s ([[Wi-Fi]]) from a moving vehicle. Wardriving was named after wardialing, since both techniques involve actively scanning to find computer networks. The aim of wardriving is to collect information about [[wireless access point]]s (not to be confused with [[piggybacking (internet access)|piggybacking]]).

Similar to war dialing is a [[port scan]] under TCP/IP, which "dials" every [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] of every [[IP address]] to find out what services are available. Unlike wardialing, however, a port scan will generally not disturb a human being when it tries an IP address, regardless of whether there is a computer responding on that address or not. Related to wardriving is [[warchalking]], the practice of drawing chalk symbols in public places to advertise the availability of wireless networks.

The term is also used today by analogy for various sorts of exhaustive [[brute force attack]] against an authentication mechanism, such as a password. While a [[dictionary attack]] might involve trying each word in a dictionary as the password, "wardialing the password" would involve trying every possible password. Password protection systems are usually designed to make this impractical, by making the process slow and/or locking out an account for minutes or hours after some low number of wrong password entries.
